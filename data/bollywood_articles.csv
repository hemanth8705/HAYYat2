But do you know the musical genius behind this chartbuster? Enter Thaman S, the maestro whose compositions have become chartbusters. He is set to make waves in Bollywood with his debut full album for Varun Dhawan’s Christmas release, Baby John. Here’s everything you need to know about this prolific composer and his extraordinary journey. Born as Ghantasala Sai Srinivas in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, Thaman comes from a lineage steeped in music. His grandfather, Ghantasala Balaramayya, was a celebrated director and producer, while his father, Ghantasala Siva Kumar, was a renowned drummer who worked in over 700 films with legendary composer K Chakravarthy. His mother, Ghantasala Savitri, sister Yamini, and aunt B. Vasantha have all lent their voices as playback singers. Growing up in a Telugu-speaking family of musicians in Chennai, Thaman was immersed in the rhythms and melodies that would later define his career.   Thaman made his debut as a music director with Kick (2009) and has since become one of the most sought-after composers in South Indian cinema. His discography reads like a greatest-hits playlist -- Race Gurram, Sarrainodu, Tuck Jagadish, Sarkaru Vaari Paata, Varisu, and Guntur Kaaram. Each project showcased his knack for blending traditional Indian sounds with modern beats, creating tracks that resonate with listeners across generations and regions. It’s not just his music, but also his collaborations with top stars like Allu Arjun, Mahesh Babu, and Vijay that have cemented his position as a musical powerhouse. Tracks like Butta Bomma and Jai Balayya are proof of his ability to craft earworms that linger long after the credits roll.   While Thaman has dabbled in Bollywood before, composing the main theme for Simmba, Jai Bajrangbali for Singham Again, and the title track for Golmaal Again, Baby John marks his full-fledged album debut. Fans are eagerly awaiting how his signature style translates to Bollywood’s diverse musical landscape. Thaman’s entry into Bollywood is a natural progression for a composer who has already achieved superstar status in the South. With Baby John releasing this Christmas, he’s set to introduce a whole new audience to his distinctive sound.   Thaman’s appeal lies in his ability to innovate while staying true to his roots. Whether it’s the pulsating beats of Ramuloo Ramulaa or the soulful melodies of Butta Bomma, his compositions have a universal quality that transcends language and culture.   For those unfamiliar with Thaman’s work, now is the perfect time to explore his discography. Start with Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo and Race Gurram, then dive into his latest releases like Varisu and Guntur Kaaram. With Baby John just around the corner, Thaman S is poised to become a household name not just in India but globally. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or a curious newcomer, Thaman’s music promises a journey full of rhythm, emotion, and unforgettable melodies.Published By: Trisha BhattacharyaPublished On: Dec 18, 2024ALSO READ |  Varun Dhawan's Baby John: What to expect from the remake of Atlee's Theri

Starring Shah Rukh Khan, it explores themes of identity, responsibility, and self-reliance.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/swades-20-years-shah-rukh-khan-film-themes-timeless-ashutosh-gowariker-2651239-2024-12-18,"Released in 2004, Ashutosh Gowariker’s Swades stands as one of Indian cinema’s most poignant narratives, seamlessly blending the personal and the societal. Starring Shah Rukh Khan as Mohan Bhargava, an NRI who reconnects with his roots, Swades tells a story transcending its time. It's 2024, which means that even after two decades since the film's release, its themes of identity, responsibility, and self-reliance remain as relevant as ever. This is one of the main reasons it resonated with the audience in an ever-globalising world.  At its core, Swades is mainly about rediscovering one’s roots and embracing the challenges of belonging. Mohan, a NASA scientist living a life of comfort and professional success in the United States, embarks on a journey to rural India to find Kaveri Amma, the woman who brought him up. What begins as a personal mission evolves into a transformative experience, as he confronts the stark realities of rural poverty, inequality, and the lack of basic amenities. Mohan’s journey mirrors the struggles of countless expatriates who grapple with the feeling of almost being displaced in a way, between their adopted lives abroad and the pull of their homeland. The film’s nuanced portrayal of this internal conflict strikes a chord even today. As globalisation continues to create opportunities for individuals to work and live abroad, the question of contributing to one’s homeland remains pertinent. Swades has, since day one, challenged its viewers to reflect on their responsibilities to their roots, presenting a compelling case for balancing personal ambitions with collective good.  One of Swades’ most enduring legacies is its focus on rural development and self-reliance. The film has highlighted the systemic challenges faced by India’s villages, including the lack of electricity, access to clean water, and educational opportunities. Through the innovative hydroelectric project spearheaded by Mohan, the narrative underscores the transformative power of science and technology in addressing these issues.  Mohan's years of education and experience in the United States, particularly his tenure at NASA, ultimately pays off in the most meaningful way. As a token of gratitude, he gives back to his village by facilitating access to essential amenities, benefiting not only the villagers but also the village as a whole. This focus on grassroots empowerment aligns closely with the principles of self-sufficiency (aatmanirbharta) championed by leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. By showcasing the potential of localised solutions, Swades inspires viewers to believe in the possibility of change from within. The hydroelectric project becomes a metaphor for hope and resilience, reminding us that collective action and innovation can overcome even the most daunting challenges.  A movie does not consist solely of direction, acting, and cinematography but also music. A film's soundtrack plays a pivotal role in driving the plot forward. The music of Swades, composed by AR Rahman, deepens the emotional resonance of the film. Tracks like ""Yeh Jo Des Hai Mera"" capture the essence of Mohan's bittersweet journey, evoking feelings of pride, responsibility, and nostalgia. The album transcends language barriers, creating a profound connection with listeners who have ever experienced the bittersweet emotion of homesickness.   The brilliance of Javed Akhtar's lyricism is drizzled everywhere on this album. It elevates the themes of the film and gets seamlessly intertwined with the narrative. Tracks such as ""Pal Pal Hai Bhaari"" celebrate India’s cultural richness, while ""Yun Hi Chala Chal"" offers a philosophical take on life’s journey. The combination of Rahman’s compositions and Akhtar’s poetic brilliance ensures that the music of Swades remains timeless.   Perhaps the most powerful aspect of Swades is its ability to inspire action. The film’s message is clear: change begins with individuals willing to step out of their comfort zones. Mohan’s transformation from a detached observer to an active participant in his village’s upliftment serves as a blueprint, demonstrating that one person can make a difference. For today’s youth, who are increasingly aware of global and local challenges, Swades offers a message of hope and agency. The film reminds us that while systemic issues may seem insurmountable, grassroots efforts can create ripple effects of change. It is a clarion call to harness one’s skills and resources for the betterment of society.  What makes Swades truly timeless is its universal appeal. Its themes of identity, belonging, and responsibility are not confined to any particular culture or era. Whether it is an Indian expatriate longing to reconnect with their homeland or anyone grappling with the balance between personal success and societal good, the film’s message resonates across borders. As the world grapples with issues like climate change, inequality, and cultural preservation, Swades continues to serve as a reminder of the power of individual action. Its emphasis on self-reliance and the potential of local communities to solve their own problems is a lesson that remains relevant in today’s fast-paced, interconnected world.   Ashutosh Gowariker's Swades is more than just a film—it's a powerful narrative that challenges and inspires. Through Mohan Bhargava's journey, the film holds a mirror to society, urging us to reflect on our roles and responsibilities. The poignant lyrics by Javed Akhtar, ""Yeh jo des hai mera, swades hai mera. Ye wo bandhan hai jo kabhi toot nahi sakta,"" continue to resonate with audiences, inspiring future generations to reevaluate their connection to their homeland. As we navigate the complexities of a globalised world, Swades remains a beacon of hope, reminding us that true progress lies in rediscovering our roots and working collectively towards a brighter future.Published By: Trisha BhattacharyaPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

Swades, the story of NASA scientist Mohan Bhargava’s emotional homecoming, debuted in theatres and has since become a cultural touchstone. As the film completes 20 years, Gowariker marks this milestone with a heartfelt letter, reflecting on the journey of creating a film that redefined patriotism and inspired generations. Swades was not just another film; it's a tale of homecoming. Starring Shah Rukh Khan as Mohan Bhargava, the film tells the story of an Indian expatriate who reconnects with his homeland, finding purpose in bringing electricity to a remote village. Its poignant message - ""real change begins at home” - continues to resonate, making Swades a film that transcends time. In his letter, Gowariker reflects on the essence of the film, “Swades was more than just a film—it was a journey of homecoming, a story of belonging, and a call to reconnect with our roots. At its heart, it carried a message of hope, responsibility, and the importance of giving back."" Gowariker’s letter celebrates the people behind the film - including the cast and crew who brought Swades to life. From Shah Rukh Khan’s soulful portrayal of Mohan Bhargava to the unforgettable music by AR Rahman and lyrics by Javed Akhtar, every contribution made the film a masterpiece.

 “My heartfelt gratitude to Shah Rukh for embodying Mohan Bhargava with such honesty and bringing forth the message of the film with so much conviction,” Gowariker writes. He also praised the music team for their timeless creations, including the iconic Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera, which remains an anthem of hope and pride. The director paid tribute to the late legends who were integral to the film’s creation: actors Kishori Ballal, Lekh Tandon, and Rajesh Vivek; lyricist KP Saxena; and art director Nitin Desai, among others. “Their work and spirit will always live on,” Gowariker wrote. For 20 years, Swades has remained a film that audiences continue to revisit and cherish. Its realistic portrayal of India’s challenges, coupled with an optimistic call to action, set it apart from other patriotic films of its time. Gowariker acknowledges the role of the audience in the film’s enduring legacy, stating, “Your connection to Mohan, Kaveri Amma, Geeta, and Charanpur has made this film timeless.” To commemorate the occasion, Gowariker shared two special edition anniversary posters, celebrating the film’s milestone. These posters serve as a tribute to the journey of Swades and its profound impact on Indian cinema. The metaphor of “lighting the bulb” - both literally and figuratively - runs through Swades and Gowariker’s heartfelt letter. As Mohan Bhargava brings electricity to a village, he ignites hope and possibility, a message that Gowariker hopes will inspire audiences even today. “Here’s to 20 years of Swades and here’s to you - may you keep ‘lighting the bulb’ in your life and in the lives of others,"" added Gowariker.Published By: shweta keshriPublished On: Dec 17, 2024Must Watch

It has been reported that the actor sustained an eye injury during the incident. According to Hindustan Times, an object struck Akshay's eye while he was engaged in a stunt. An ophthalmologist was immediately summoned to the set, who treated the eye with a bandage and advised him to rest. Despite the injury, the shoot continued with the other actors. Akshay, however, is determined to return to the set soon as the film is nearing completion, and he wishes to avoid any delays. Housefull 5 boasts an ensemble cast, including series regulars Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh, along with the return of Abhishek Bachchan, Shreyas Talpade, Chunky Panday, and Nargis Fakhri. New additions to the cast feature Fardeen Khan, Dino Morea, Johnny Lever, Jackie Shroff, Sanjay Dutt, Nana Patekar, Sonam Bajwa, Chitrangda Singh, and Soundarya Sharma. The film commenced production earlier this year in Europe, with the cast spending 40 days filming on a cruise ship that sailed from Newcastle to Spain, Normandy, Honfleur, and back to Plymouth.

She shared that, like most shoots, they were working under a tight schedule and had to wrap up quickly. “We were shooting the song 'Jaane Kyu Log Pyar Karte Hai' in Sydney,” she wrote, “and like all shoots, we had to hurry & finish within a certain time frame, so everyone was focused on finishing the shoot as soon as possible.” However, the actress humorously revealed that she had missed breakfast that morning and, unsurprisingly, all she could think about was food. “I was starving,"" she admitted. ""Once the shoot was over, I was asked to do a few stills/photos. I made a face and said I’m starving. Can we do this later?” Preity added, sharing her relatable hunger-driven frustration.

Bazmee had assisted Kapoor on Prem Rog. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/anees-bazmee-recalls-being-raj-kapoor-assistant-director-2648884-2024-12-12,"Not many know that blockbuster director Anees Bazmee started his career as Raj Kapoor's assistant director. As the world celebrates the legendary filmmaker's centenary, Bazmee exclusively spoke to India Today Digital about his learning and time with the maverick and whether he incorporates those in his own films. The Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 director shared that he met Raj Kapoor through a senior writer. As he was starting work on Prem Rog, Kapoor let him join the team, and that's how the journey began. Talking about what he observed and learnt being around Raj Kapoor, Bazmee said, ""His passion. It was something else. He slept, ate, and walked cinemas. He actually breathed and lived cinema. He could only make these great films because of his love towards the craft. He had such a big vision, and he knew how to translate that on screen through camera."" When asked if he managed to use all these learnings to make films like him, the Welcome director sheepishly said, ""Not at all, because I could never do that. He was a genius and no one could ever match up to his skills. But I truly feel that whatever little I have achieved, it's all because I started with him. I have often wondered if he was around when I made films. I would have been in seventh heaven then. I remember when I was writing, and then directing my first film, I often lamented that he could never see his student walking on the same path."" Bazmee also shared that Raj Kapoor was very particular about his assistants being treated the same way, ""We also got to travel in planes with him, stay in big hotels, and have the same food. He was a professional and a team leader that we should all aspire to be."" The Singh is Kinng maker also said that Raj Kapoor gave most actors their best performances. He also made the supporting cast shine with strong written parts, ""He was a visionary. Even the extras in the films come across as an important part. That was the RK magic."" Discussing more about the mood on an RK film set, Bazmee said that the celebrated filmmaker would be in the best of the mood, showering love on everyone if things were going as per plan on his set. And when it didn't, everyone would be at the receiving end of his scolding. ""But those were also out of love, because he wanted the best out of the actors and the film. Personally, I remember standing with my hands folded behind me. He was a big man for me to even have an equation with. But just being in the same room was a learning experience."" As readers would know, to celebrate his 100th birth anniversary, an RK Film Festival has been planned across 40 cities, from December 13-15. Anees Bazmee picked Prem Rog as the film he would want to watch again on the big screens. He also shared that it's a great opportunity to take the iconic films to the younger generation, ""I am so glad that Raj sahab's legacy continues through his grandchildren now. I think Ranbir Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor and even Karisma Kapoor are such amazing actors. Even Chintu ji (Rishi Kapoor) contributed so much to the Kapoor name."" Anees Bazmee also remembered the famous RK Studios, sharing that most films were shot there. He added that they would spend their entire day there, and that he has beautiful memories of the place. ""All his sets were so grand, almost like it came from another world. Raj saab ka kamaal hi kuch aur tha (He really did wonders),"" the proud student concluded.Published By: Anvita SinghPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Kareena-Saif, Ranbir Kapoor in Delhi to mark Raj Kapoor's 100th birth anniversary

By the time I came to Don, I had realised that the most important thing to focus on is my craft, not your relationships with your director, co-actors, not how you behave on set, but what you do between action and cut,” said the actor.

Directed by Kalees and produced by Atlee, the film promises action, drama, and emotional depth.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/varun-dhawans-baby-john-what-to-expect-from-the-remake-of-atlees-theri-thalapathy-vijay-2647757-2024-12-11,"Bollywood star Varun Dhawan is gearing up to take audiences on a high-octane ride with his upcoming film, Baby John. Directed by Kalees and bankrolled by Atlee, this film is a remake of Atlee’s 2016 Tamil hit Theri, which starred Thalapathy Vijay, Samantha, and Amy Jackson.  If the trailer is anything to go by, Baby John appears to stick closely to the original story, promising a mix of emotional depth, thrilling action, and larger-than-life moments. Here’s what makes this project an exciting addition to the year’s lineup.  advertisementA Cop-Turned-Family Man First things first, let’s address the elephant in the room -- Varun Dhawan won’t be playing a double role in Baby John. Much like Thalapathy Vijay in Theri, Varun’s character is a decorated police officer who is forced to leave the force under mysterious circumstances (no spoilers, of course!) and move to a quiet life with his young daughter.   First things first, let’s address the elephant in the room -- Varun Dhawan won’t be playing a double role in Baby John. Much like Thalapathy Vijay in Theri, Varun’s character is a decorated police officer who is forced to leave the force under mysterious circumstances (no spoilers, of course!) and move to a quiet life with his young daughter.   But wouldn’t it be a twist if there was a secret double role lurking somewhere? While the trailer doesn’t suggest this, it’s still fun to imagine the dramatic possibilities.  Even without a second character, Varun has a meaty role to sink his teeth into. The father-daughter relationship and its emotional resonance are sure to tug at your heartstrings, just as they did in Theri.   While Baby John sticks closely to its source material, the fact that it’s a remake doesn’t mean it lacks originality.   Varun Dhawan: Stepping into the Mass Hero Arena  What truly has fans buzzing is the chance to see Varun Dhawan embrace a massy, larger-than-life action hero persona. Sure, we saw shades of an intense Varun in Badlapur, but Baby John could take this to a whole new level. Following in the footsteps of Atlee’s Jawan, which turned Shah Rukh Khan into a never-seen-before action hero, this film has the potential to elevate Varun’s stardom.   The trailer already teases some explosive action sequences, and Varun looks every bit the part. His work in Citadel: Honey Bunny has proven that he can handle intense choreography; so expect punches, kicks, and slow-motion shots galore. For fans of South Indian cinema and Thalapathy Vijay’s Theri, this will be a litmus test for how Varun stacks up to the original star.Look Out for Top-Notch Craftsmanship Another highlight of Baby John is its technical brilliance. The cinematography by Kiran Koushik promises to make the action sequences pop and the emotional moments shine. The trailer hints at a visual treat, with rich colours and dramatic lighting accentuating every frame. Expect the camera work to take you straight into the heart of the chaos while also giving weight to the film’s more tender scenes.   And let’s not forget the editing. Reuben, who worked on the blockbuster Jawan, is in charge of piecing this film together. His knack for creating tight, edge-of-your-seat sequences will be crucial in making Baby John a gripping experience. If Jawan is anything to go by, Reuben knows how to keep audiences glued to their seats.    Cameos and Soundtracks to Look Forward To  Adding even more excitement is Salman Khan’s cameo as DIG Varadha Rajan. His brief but impactful appearance in the trailer has already sent fans into a frenzy.  This marks the first step in Salman’s collaboration with Atlee, and it’s thrilling to see the groundwork being laid for bigger things to come. Who wouldn’t want to see Salman and Varun sharing the screen in a high-stakes action sequence?   Apart from Salman Khan, Sanya Malhotra will also be seen in a cameo appearance.  Music is another element that’s bound to elevate the film. Thaman S, known for his dynamic compositions, is behind the score, and it already sounds like a winner.   The trailer features a track with a rap by Raja Kumari, blending Thaman’s signature beats with contemporary energy. The result? A soundtrack that’s sure to stick in your head long after the credits roll.   Varun Dhawan’s distinct style and Bollywood’s flair for grandeur will undoubtedly give the film its own identity. For audiences who loved Theri, Baby John offers a chance to revisit a beloved story with fresh faces and a slightly different lens.  For those new to the tale, it’s an opportunity to experience a gripping narrative that blends action, drama, and heartfelt moments.   In a time when Bollywood is embracing mass filmmaking in a big way, Baby John could be a major turning point for Varun Dhawan. Whether it’s his transformation into an action hero, the film’s high production values, or the buzzworthy cameos and music, there’s plenty to look forward to.

Zeenat recounted how the number was brought to life with Kishore Kumar’s infectious vocals, a playful beat, and an energetic performance by Amitabh Bachchan, which set the stage for one of the most memorable tracks in Indian cinema. ""I remember most acutely the quantity of paan that Mr Bachchan consumed and the sheer energy he brought to set,"" Zeenat wrote, recalling the fun-filled days of shooting.
