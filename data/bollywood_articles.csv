But do you know the musical genius behind this chartbuster? Enter Thaman S, the maestro whose compositions have become chartbusters. He is set to make waves in Bollywood with his debut full album for Varun Dhawan’s Christmas release, Baby John. Here’s everything you need to know about this prolific composer and his extraordinary journey. Born as Ghantasala Sai Srinivas in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, Thaman comes from a lineage steeped in music. His grandfather, Ghantasala Balaramayya, was a celebrated director and producer, while his father, Ghantasala Siva Kumar, was a renowned drummer who worked in over 700 films with legendary composer K Chakravarthy. His mother, Ghantasala Savitri, sister Yamini, and aunt B. Vasantha have all lent their voices as playback singers. Growing up in a Telugu-speaking family of musicians in Chennai, Thaman was immersed in the rhythms and melodies that would later define his career.   Thaman made his debut as a music director with Kick (2009) and has since become one of the most sought-after composers in South Indian cinema. His discography reads like a greatest-hits playlist -- Race Gurram, Sarrainodu, Tuck Jagadish, Sarkaru Vaari Paata, Varisu, and Guntur Kaaram. Each project showcased his knack for blending traditional Indian sounds with modern beats, creating tracks that resonate with listeners across generations and regions. It’s not just his music, but also his collaborations with top stars like Allu Arjun, Mahesh Babu, and Vijay that have cemented his position as a musical powerhouse. Tracks like Butta Bomma and Jai Balayya are proof of his ability to craft earworms that linger long after the credits roll.   While Thaman has dabbled in Bollywood before, composing the main theme for Simmba, Jai Bajrangbali for Singham Again, and the title track for Golmaal Again, Baby John marks his full-fledged album debut. Fans are eagerly awaiting how his signature style translates to Bollywood’s diverse musical landscape. Thaman’s entry into Bollywood is a natural progression for a composer who has already achieved superstar status in the South. With Baby John releasing this Christmas, he’s set to introduce a whole new audience to his distinctive sound.   Thaman’s appeal lies in his ability to innovate while staying true to his roots. Whether it’s the pulsating beats of Ramuloo Ramulaa or the soulful melodies of Butta Bomma, his compositions have a universal quality that transcends language and culture.   For those unfamiliar with Thaman’s work, now is the perfect time to explore his discography. Start with Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo and Race Gurram, then dive into his latest releases like Varisu and Guntur Kaaram. With Baby John just around the corner, Thaman S is poised to become a household name not just in India but globally. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or a curious newcomer, Thaman’s music promises a journey full of rhythm, emotion, and unforgettable melodies.Published By: Trisha BhattacharyaPublished On: Dec 18, 2024ALSO READ |  Varun Dhawan's Baby John: What to expect from the remake of Atlee's Theri

Starring Shah Rukh Khan, it explores themes of identity, responsibility, and self-reliance.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/swades-20-years-shah-rukh-khan-film-themes-timeless-ashutosh-gowariker-2651239-2024-12-18,"Released in 2004, Ashutosh Gowariker’s Swades stands as one of Indian cinema’s most poignant narratives, seamlessly blending the personal and the societal. Starring Shah Rukh Khan as Mohan Bhargava, an NRI who reconnects with his roots, Swades tells a story transcending its time. It's 2024, which means that even after two decades since the film's release, its themes of identity, responsibility, and self-reliance remain as relevant as ever. This is one of the main reasons it resonated with the audience in an ever-globalising world.  At its core, Swades is mainly about rediscovering one’s roots and embracing the challenges of belonging. Mohan, a NASA scientist living a life of comfort and professional success in the United States, embarks on a journey to rural India to find Kaveri Amma, the woman who brought him up. What begins as a personal mission evolves into a transformative experience, as he confronts the stark realities of rural poverty, inequality, and the lack of basic amenities. Mohan’s journey mirrors the struggles of countless expatriates who grapple with the feeling of almost being displaced in a way, between their adopted lives abroad and the pull of their homeland. The film’s nuanced portrayal of this internal conflict strikes a chord even today. As globalisation continues to create opportunities for individuals to work and live abroad, the question of contributing to one’s homeland remains pertinent. Swades has, since day one, challenged its viewers to reflect on their responsibilities to their roots, presenting a compelling case for balancing personal ambitions with collective good.  One of Swades’ most enduring legacies is its focus on rural development and self-reliance. The film has highlighted the systemic challenges faced by India’s villages, including the lack of electricity, access to clean water, and educational opportunities. Through the innovative hydroelectric project spearheaded by Mohan, the narrative underscores the transformative power of science and technology in addressing these issues.  Mohan's years of education and experience in the United States, particularly his tenure at NASA, ultimately pays off in the most meaningful way. As a token of gratitude, he gives back to his village by facilitating access to essential amenities, benefiting not only the villagers but also the village as a whole. This focus on grassroots empowerment aligns closely with the principles of self-sufficiency (aatmanirbharta) championed by leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. By showcasing the potential of localised solutions, Swades inspires viewers to believe in the possibility of change from within. The hydroelectric project becomes a metaphor for hope and resilience, reminding us that collective action and innovation can overcome even the most daunting challenges.  A movie does not consist solely of direction, acting, and cinematography but also music. A film's soundtrack plays a pivotal role in driving the plot forward. The music of Swades, composed by AR Rahman, deepens the emotional resonance of the film. Tracks like ""Yeh Jo Des Hai Mera"" capture the essence of Mohan's bittersweet journey, evoking feelings of pride, responsibility, and nostalgia. The album transcends language barriers, creating a profound connection with listeners who have ever experienced the bittersweet emotion of homesickness.   The brilliance of Javed Akhtar's lyricism is drizzled everywhere on this album. It elevates the themes of the film and gets seamlessly intertwined with the narrative. Tracks such as ""Pal Pal Hai Bhaari"" celebrate India’s cultural richness, while ""Yun Hi Chala Chal"" offers a philosophical take on life’s journey. The combination of Rahman’s compositions and Akhtar’s poetic brilliance ensures that the music of Swades remains timeless.   Perhaps the most powerful aspect of Swades is its ability to inspire action. The film’s message is clear: change begins with individuals willing to step out of their comfort zones. Mohan’s transformation from a detached observer to an active participant in his village’s upliftment serves as a blueprint, demonstrating that one person can make a difference. For today’s youth, who are increasingly aware of global and local challenges, Swades offers a message of hope and agency. The film reminds us that while systemic issues may seem insurmountable, grassroots efforts can create ripple effects of change. It is a clarion call to harness one’s skills and resources for the betterment of society.  What makes Swades truly timeless is its universal appeal. Its themes of identity, belonging, and responsibility are not confined to any particular culture or era. Whether it is an Indian expatriate longing to reconnect with their homeland or anyone grappling with the balance between personal success and societal good, the film’s message resonates across borders. As the world grapples with issues like climate change, inequality, and cultural preservation, Swades continues to serve as a reminder of the power of individual action. Its emphasis on self-reliance and the potential of local communities to solve their own problems is a lesson that remains relevant in today’s fast-paced, interconnected world.   Ashutosh Gowariker's Swades is more than just a film—it's a powerful narrative that challenges and inspires. Through Mohan Bhargava's journey, the film holds a mirror to society, urging us to reflect on our roles and responsibilities. The poignant lyrics by Javed Akhtar, ""Yeh jo des hai mera, swades hai mera. Ye wo bandhan hai jo kabhi toot nahi sakta,"" continue to resonate with audiences, inspiring future generations to reevaluate their connection to their homeland. As we navigate the complexities of a globalised world, Swades remains a beacon of hope, reminding us that true progress lies in rediscovering our roots and working collectively towards a brighter future.Published By: Trisha BhattacharyaPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

As the film completes 20 years, Gowariker marks this milestone with a heartfelt letter, reflecting on the journey of creating a film that redefined patriotism and inspired generations. Swades was not just another film; it's a tale of homecoming. Starring Shah Rukh Khan as Mohan Bhargava, the film tells the story of an Indian expatriate who reconnects with his homeland, finding purpose in bringing electricity to a remote village. Its poignant message - ""real change begins at home” - continues to resonate, making Swades a film that transcends time. In his letter, Gowariker reflects on the essence of the film, “Swades was more than just a film—it was a journey of homecoming, a story of belonging, and a call to reconnect with our roots. At its heart, it carried a message of hope, responsibility, and the importance of giving back."" Gowariker’s letter celebrates the people behind the film - including the cast and crew who brought Swades to life. From Shah Rukh Khan’s soulful portrayal of Mohan Bhargava to the unforgettable music by AR Rahman and lyrics by Javed Akhtar, every contribution made the film a masterpiece.

 “My heartfelt gratitude to Shah Rukh for embodying Mohan Bhargava with such honesty and bringing forth the message of the film with so much conviction,” Gowariker writes. He also praised the music team for their timeless creations, including the iconic Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera, which remains an anthem of hope and pride. The director paid tribute to the late legends who were integral to the film’s creation: actors Kishori Ballal, Lekh Tandon, and Rajesh Vivek; lyricist KP Saxena; and art director Nitin Desai, among others. “Their work and spirit will always live on,” Gowariker wrote. For 20 years, Swades has remained a film that audiences continue to revisit and cherish. Its realistic portrayal of India’s challenges, coupled with an optimistic call to action, set it apart from other patriotic films of its time. Gowariker acknowledges the role of the audience in the film’s enduring legacy, stating, “Your connection to Mohan, Kaveri Amma, Geeta, and Charanpur has made this film timeless.” To commemorate the occasion, Gowariker shared two special edition anniversary posters, celebrating the film’s milestone. These posters serve as a tribute to the journey of Swades and its profound impact on Indian cinema. The metaphor of “lighting the bulb” - both literally and figuratively - runs through Swades and Gowariker’s heartfelt letter. As Mohan Bhargava brings electricity to a village, he ignites hope and possibility, a message that Gowariker hopes will inspire audiences even today. “Here’s to 20 years of Swades and here’s to you - may you keep ‘lighting the bulb’ in your life and in the lives of others,"" added Gowariker.Published By: shweta keshriPublished On: Dec 17, 2024Must Watch

Bazmee had assisted Kapoor on Prem Rog. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/anees-bazmee-recalls-being-raj-kapoor-assistant-director-2648884-2024-12-12,"Not many know that blockbuster director Anees Bazmee started his career as Raj Kapoor's assistant director. As the world celebrates the legendary filmmaker's centenary, Bazmee exclusively spoke to India Today Digital about his learning and time with the maverick and whether he incorporates those in his own films. The Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 director shared that he met Raj Kapoor through a senior writer. As he was starting work on Prem Rog, Kapoor let him join the team, and that's how the journey began. Talking about what he observed and learnt being around Raj Kapoor, Bazmee said, ""His passion. It was something else. He slept, ate, and walked cinemas. He actually breathed and lived cinema. He could only make these great films because of his love towards the craft. He had such a big vision, and he knew how to translate that on screen through camera."" When asked if he managed to use all these learnings to make films like him, the Welcome director sheepishly said, ""Not at all, because I could never do that. He was a genius and no one could ever match up to his skills. But I truly feel that whatever little I have achieved, it's all because I started with him. I have often wondered if he was around when I made films. I would have been in seventh heaven then. I remember when I was writing, and then directing my first film, I often lamented that he could never see his student walking on the same path."" Bazmee also shared that Raj Kapoor was very particular about his assistants being treated the same way, ""We also got to travel in planes with him, stay in big hotels, and have the same food. He was a professional and a team leader that we should all aspire to be."" The Singh is Kinng maker also said that Raj Kapoor gave most actors their best performances. He also made the supporting cast shine with strong written parts, ""He was a visionary. Even the extras in the films come across as an important part. That was the RK magic."" Discussing more about the mood on an RK film set, Bazmee said that the celebrated filmmaker would be in the best of the mood, showering love on everyone if things were going as per plan on his set. And when it didn't, everyone would be at the receiving end of his scolding. ""But those were also out of love, because he wanted the best out of the actors and the film. Personally, I remember standing with my hands folded behind me. He was a big man for me to even have an equation with. But just being in the same room was a learning experience."" As readers would know, to celebrate his 100th birth anniversary, an RK Film Festival has been planned across 40 cities, from December 13-15. Anees Bazmee picked Prem Rog as the film he would want to watch again on the big screens. He also shared that it's a great opportunity to take the iconic films to the younger generation, ""I am so glad that Raj sahab's legacy continues through his grandchildren now. I think Ranbir Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor and even Karisma Kapoor are such amazing actors. Even Chintu ji (Rishi Kapoor) contributed so much to the Kapoor name."" Anees Bazmee also remembered the famous RK Studios, sharing that most films were shot there. He added that they would spend their entire day there, and that he has beautiful memories of the place. ""All his sets were so grand, almost like it came from another world. Raj saab ka kamaal hi kuch aur tha (He really did wonders),"" the proud student concluded.Published By: Anvita SinghPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Kareena-Saif, Ranbir Kapoor in Delhi to mark Raj Kapoor's 100th birth anniversary

Directed by Kalees and bankrolled by Atlee, this film is a remake of Atlee’s 2016 Tamil hit Theri, which starred Thalapathy Vijay, Samantha, and Amy Jackson.  If the trailer is anything to go by, Baby John appears to stick closely to the original story, promising a mix of emotional depth, thrilling action, and larger-than-life moments. Here’s what makes this project an exciting addition to the year’s lineup.  advertisementA Cop-Turned-Family Man First things first, let’s address the elephant in the room -- Varun Dhawan won’t be playing a double role in Baby John. Much like Thalapathy Vijay in Theri, Varun’s character is a decorated police officer who is forced to leave the force under mysterious circumstances (no spoilers, of course!) and move to a quiet life with his young daughter.   First things first, let’s address the elephant in the room -- Varun Dhawan won’t be playing a double role in Baby John. Much like Thalapathy Vijay in Theri, Varun’s character is a decorated police officer who is forced to leave the force under mysterious circumstances (no spoilers, of course!) and move to a quiet life with his young daughter.   But wouldn’t it be a twist if there was a secret double role lurking somewhere? While the trailer doesn’t suggest this, it’s still fun to imagine the dramatic possibilities.  Even without a second character, Varun has a meaty role to sink his teeth into. The father-daughter relationship and its emotional resonance are sure to tug at your heartstrings, just as they did in Theri.   While Baby John sticks closely to its source material, the fact that it’s a remake doesn’t mean it lacks originality.   Varun Dhawan: Stepping into the Mass Hero Arena  What truly has fans buzzing is the chance to see Varun Dhawan embrace a massy, larger-than-life action hero persona. Sure, we saw shades of an intense Varun in Badlapur, but Baby John could take this to a whole new level. Following in the footsteps of Atlee’s Jawan, which turned Shah Rukh Khan into a never-seen-before action hero, this film has the potential to elevate Varun’s stardom.   The trailer already teases some explosive action sequences, and Varun looks every bit the part. His work in Citadel: Honey Bunny has proven that he can handle intense choreography; so expect punches, kicks, and slow-motion shots galore. For fans of South Indian cinema and Thalapathy Vijay’s Theri, this will be a litmus test for how Varun stacks up to the original star.Look Out for Top-Notch Craftsmanship Another highlight of Baby John is its technical brilliance. The cinematography by Kiran Koushik promises to make the action sequences pop and the emotional moments shine. The trailer hints at a visual treat, with rich colours and dramatic lighting accentuating every frame. Expect the camera work to take you straight into the heart of the chaos while also giving weight to the film’s more tender scenes.   And let’s not forget the editing. Reuben, who worked on the blockbuster Jawan, is in charge of piecing this film together. His knack for creating tight, edge-of-your-seat sequences will be crucial in making Baby John a gripping experience. If Jawan is anything to go by, Reuben knows how to keep audiences glued to their seats.    Cameos and Soundtracks to Look Forward To  Adding even more excitement is Salman Khan’s cameo as DIG Varadha Rajan. His brief but impactful appearance in the trailer has already sent fans into a frenzy.  This marks the first step in Salman’s collaboration with Atlee, and it’s thrilling to see the groundwork being laid for bigger things to come. Who wouldn’t want to see Salman and Varun sharing the screen in a high-stakes action sequence?   Apart from Salman Khan, Sanya Malhotra will also be seen in a cameo appearance.  Music is another element that’s bound to elevate the film. Thaman S, known for his dynamic compositions, is behind the score, and it already sounds like a winner.   The trailer features a track with a rap by Raja Kumari, blending Thaman’s signature beats with contemporary energy. The result? A soundtrack that’s sure to stick in your head long after the credits roll.   Varun Dhawan’s distinct style and Bollywood’s flair for grandeur will undoubtedly give the film its own identity. For audiences who loved Theri, Baby John offers a chance to revisit a beloved story with fresh faces and a slightly different lens.  For those new to the tale, it’s an opportunity to experience a gripping narrative that blends action, drama, and heartfelt moments.   In a time when Bollywood is embracing mass filmmaking in a big way, Baby John could be a major turning point for Varun Dhawan. Whether it’s his transformation into an action hero, the film’s high production values, or the buzzworthy cameos and music, there’s plenty to look forward to.

Kalees revealed that Vijay was deeply impressed by Varun’s performance and the energy he brought to the film. While talking to India Today Digital, Kalees said, ""Atlee introduced me to Vijay sir because he has worked with him, and I was kind of new to him. He was warm during the meeting.

No, here we have Salman Khan's larger-than-life cameo, which will surely make the audience happy.

Despite its noble intentions, the film struggles with execution and fails to evoke the emotional depth it aims for.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/reviews/story/vanvaas-movie-review-nana-patekar-utkarsh-sharma-film-dull-version-baghban-2652809-2024-12-20,"Release Date: 20 Dec, 2024 The relationship between parents and their children is believed to be sacred, but is it really so? Are children financially and emotionally capable of caring for their elderly parents? Over time, the philosophy that ‘blood is thicker than water’ seems to lose its essence. Attempting to reiterate this belief, Anil Sharma, after the mega-successful Gadar 2, made Vanvaas. The film addresses how children, sometimes, go to extremes to rid themselves of old parents and how, at times, their love is merely about securing financial gains after their death. Starring Nana Patekar and Utkarsh Sharma in lead roles, Vanvaas may have noble intentions but falters at the execution level, making it a tedious watch. The film bears an uncanny resemblance to Amitabh Bachchan's 2003 film Baghban, but the children in Vanvaas are far more malicious. From neglecting their parents to feeling emotionally detached as they grow older, the narrative captures the growing disconnection between generations. In Vanvaas, the father (Nana Patekar), still grieving his wife’s death, is diagnosed with dementia. This further deteriorates his relationship with his family. When he decides to donate his house to a trust, his children conspire to abandon him in Varanasi, far from their Palampur home, and even pronounce him dead to inherit his assets. Meanwhile, a stranger and a crook, Veeru (Utkarsh Sharma), in the ghats, bumps into him, decides to care for him and works to reunite him with his family.

The theme of an outsider caring for an abandoned elder while their children desert them is reminiscent of Baghban. However, in Baghban, the emotional connections between the characters were heartfelt and convincing. In contrast, Vanvaas fails to develop a meaningful bond between Deepak (Nana Patekar) and Veeru. The writing and direction do not allow their relationship to grow naturally, and moments that should feel poignant instead come across as superficial. For instance, a conversation over local liquor lacks any depth or emotion. Similarly, the sons’ animosity toward their father is portrayed without context, making their motivations appear one-dimensional. Providing more insight into their hatred could have added layers to the story.

Although Vanvaas aspires to be a deeply emotional film, the dialogues lack impact. They fail to evoke tears or heartache and occasionally veer into unintentional humour. The love story between Utkarsh and Simrat Kaur is underdeveloped and adds little to the narrative. The music is forgettable, with none of the songs leaving a lasting impression. The film’s long runtime of 2 hours and 40 minutes tests the audience’s patience as the story unfolds at a sluggish pace. Watch the trailer of Vanvaas here:    Surprisingly, this film comes from Anil Sharma, who previously delivered memorable entertainment with films like Gadar. Even his previous film, Apne, gave families the iconic line ‘Apne toh apne hote hai’, but there is nothing similarly impactful to take away from Vanvaas.

The film’s saving grace is Rajpal Yadav, who lights up the screen with his impeccable comic timing and witty dialogues, offering a much-needed relief. Utkarsh Sharma has grown as an actor since Gadar 2 and delivers a commendable performance. However, Nana Patekar’s portrayal is underwhelming, as he appears to simply recite his lines without much emotional investment. Ashwini Kalsekar’s over-the-top acting detracts from the film, while the rest of the cast remains largely forgettable. Moreover, the outdated cinematography and performances make the film feel stuck in the 1980s.

Vanvaas is well-intentioned, but it will surely have a tough time, fighting mass entertainers Pushpa 2 and Baby John in theatres.Published By: Anindita MukhopadhyayPublished On: Dec 20, 2024ALSO READ |  Nana Patekar invites Aamir Khan for a special screening of his film Vanvaas

The performances of lead cast make the film enjoyable.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/reviews/story/baby-john-movie-review-varun-dhawan-keerthy-suresh-atlee-actioner-massy-messy-2655044-2024-12-25,"Release Date: 25 Dec, 2024 Imagine being served a buffet filled with an overdose of masala food that leaves your palate bewildered. Varun Dhawan's Baby John is exactly that, in the form of a long, very long, two-hour- 45-minute film. While the makers initially claimed that Baby John is inspired by the blockbuster Theri, let's burst that bubble - the film is almost a rehash of the Thalapathy Vijay-starrer. Hence, every frame looks more like a vision of Atlee, the director of the 2016 original Tamil film, and the presenter of Baby John. The biggest highlight, however, is Salman Khan's cameo and the banter he shares with Varun Dhawan, who somehow mirrors the superstar's swag in his own sweet way. The Kalees-directed film follows John (Dhawan), who is living a normal life with his daughter Khushi (a fabulous Zara Zyanna). He is showered with attention from her school teacher (Wamiqa Gabbi). As you await some sweet romance, we see the otherwise meek John fold up his lungi, kick and punch a dozen villains in his backyard. This is when we learn that he is Satya Verma - an ex-righteous cop, who ruffled the wrong feathers of a corrupt minister (Jackie Shroff), leading to the tragic murder of his wife Meera (Keerthy Suresh) and mother (Sheeba Chadha). Faking his death, he moves to another part of the country, leaving the service to follow his wife's dying wish. But ek baar jo maine commitment kardi, toh main pane (Once I’ve made a commitment, then I...)... you get the drift, right? The humble father soon returns as the stylish supercop and becomes society's new saviour. Eventually, like in any Indian film, he also manages to beat the villain to a pulp. In Baby John, the hero and his five-year-old child also get to deliver sermons to the villain. And not to forget, the climax even has Satya fighting while riding a horse. Herogiri kayaam rehni chahiye (Heroism should always be there)! Here's the trailer: 

And while you're still wrapping your head around all that you saw over the last two hours, Salman Khan makes his splashing entry as Agent Bhai Jaan. He not only attempts some whistle-worthy action stunts but also, in his inimitable style, delivers his jokes. However, his interaction with Varun Dhawan, where the latter questions him about his decision to be a parent, is quite candid. The sequence also gives an insight into the warm bond between both actors.   

And while you're still wrapping your head around all that you saw over the last two hours, Salman Khan makes his splashing entry as Agent Bhai Jaan. He not only attempts some whistle-worthy action stunts but also, in his inimitable style, delivers his jokes. However, his interaction with Varun Dhawan, where the latter questions him about his decision to be a parent, is quite candid. The sequence also gives an insight into the warm bond between both actors. As already mentioned, the film reeks of Atlee's style and there are times when you feel like you are watching a different version of Jawan - be it Varun Dhawan's police officer avatar, pigeons flying during the hero's entry, or the love song between the lead couple. Given that the original film came eight years ago, the makers seem to overlook how much the world has changed and evolved since then. There are moments and unintentionally funny dialogues, especially because they are literal translations of the Tamil film. For instance, Satya tells Meera that she is not only his wife but also a mother to him. Not kidding, I almost choked on my caramel popcorn. Coming to our Baby John, Varun Dhawan - the actor gives an earnest performance and also seems to really have a lot of fun on-screen. There are a few scenes, one with Sanya Malhotra, that are genuinely entertaining. However, his character, even though likeable, is too cocky to play such a righteous police officer. After killing the minister's son, the way he mocks the father seems really unjustified. Even his conversation with Meera's father, where he calls himself a Gandhian cop, only to indulge in an over-the-top gunfight, is amusing. Varun's character is actually more gimmicks than substance, making you feel sorry for the actor. He could have done wonders if it had been a well-written part. Keerthy Suresh looks so beautiful on-screen that it's hard to take your eyes off her. However, her character has too many loose strings, making it ineffectual. Wamiqa Gabbi, on the other hand, is quite wasted, and her performance, too, is unimpressive. Her action scenes seem forced into the plot, and she and Varun lack chemistry as well. Jackie Shroff impresses with his menacing character, but his role, too, leaves you unsatisfied. However, his swag and style, especially how he perches up on his seat, adds so much to the part. The surprise factor of Baby John, however, is Rajpal Yadav. He not only gets to do some action but, when mocked over his comedy, exclaims, ""Comedy is serious business"" - a line that got the loudest cheers in the cinema hall. Another highlight of Baby John is its music and background score by composer S Thaman. While 'Nain Matakka' and the title track are already chartbusters, 'Bandobast' and 'Hazaar Baar' have also been picturised beautifully, making your experience enjoyable. The background score too adds to the narrative, showing the magic of sound. Where the film fails is in its attempt to cater to the mass genre with its heroism and masala. The makers do touch upon poignant issues like women's safety, but everything feels superficial and choreographed. Even with high-speed shots, the scenes don't evoke the emotional impact they should. And that's probably why you never truly feel invested in the narrative. Baby John could either benefit from the withdrawal symptoms fans are experiencing after Pushpa 2: The Rule or lose the battle to Allu Arjun's mass-actioner.  3 out of 5 stars for Baby John.Published By: K JananiPublished On: Dec 25, 2024ALSO READ  |  Varun Dhawan's Baby John: What to expect from the remake of Atlee's Theri

The sustained dominance of Pushpa 2 and the success of Mufasa heavily impacted Baby John’s performance.

While Laapataa Ladies, which was India’s official entry, did not make the cut, the Hindi-language film Santosh, representing the UK, has advanced in the competition. This has led to debates over the choice of films India submits for the Oscars every year. Actor Shahana Goswami, who plays the titular role in the Sandhya Suri film, spoke exclusively to India Today Digital, reacting to the noise surrounding Laapataa Ladies' exit. The actor was asked about the conversation around the Film Federation of India's decision to choose the Kiran Rao directorial over Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light, which has been winning international accolades. She said, ""Honestly, I don't know the procedure of how films are chosen. I think it's the NFDC (National Film Development Corporation) that decides, but I don't know what's the criteria or even the application process. Hence, I don't think I can comment on the process of selecting an official entry."" Discussing the social media noise, the actor said that it's part of parcel of how we are as humans, where we need to comment on everything. ""When the film was chosen as India's selection, everyone was so happy. Also, I think Laapataa Ladies has done superbly well. It may have been a slow burn in theatres but when it was released on OTT, it just flew. I haven't watched it yet but from what I know it deals with various themes and topics with an element of humour. I think all these conversations are just a commentary of the media and people."" Shahana Goswami added that if Laapataa Ladies had made the cut and Santosh didn't, the conversations would have been different. ""The winds would have changed. But the fact is that these things are so intangible. If someone asks me to break why Santosh was shortlisted, we wouldn't know. However, we are all just grateful that we moved a step ahead. But it doesn't take away from other people's journeys. Another short film, Anuja, is shortlisted, so just the fact South Asian women and their body of work are being represented and talked about globally is an achievement. Although we don't need one platform to validate our work when something like this happens, it's amazing. More so, because more people will now watch our films. Hence, it's still a big win for Laapataa Ladies to have come so far."" The actor also thanked the Academy members for watching her film and voting for it. She added how many reached out to the team about how much they loved the film.

The epic dialogue from Baby John loosely translates to - Many like me may have come before, but I’m here for the first time. Varun Dhawan’s foray into the action genre with big-budget commercial entertainer, Baby John, left fans underwhelmed. Despite his usual charm and dedication in the film, it falters in several key areas that hinder its potential to shine as a high-octane action thriller. While the Kalees-directorial had the ingredients for success, it ultimately failed to deliver, leaving a sense of disappointment for viewers seeking a fresh take on the genre. Here’s a breakdown of what didn’t work in favour of the film: Overblown and uninspired action Baby John boasts numerous action sequences, a key component of any modern thriller, but they fall flat in terms of execution. Rather than thrilling, many of the action scenes come across as over-the-top and exaggerated, lacking the realism that could have made them impactful. If you expect Atlee-style action in the movie, it will disappoint you at various levels. The action sequences are John Wick-inspired, with repetitive choreography and little innovation to make them stand out. Instead of energising the audience, these scenes become tedious, detracting from the core narrative rather than adding value. Watch the trailer here: Unconvincing heroVarun, renowned for his versatility across genres, encounters a significant challenge in convincingly portraying a rogue action hero. Despite his commendable effort, he struggles to exude the raw intensity and grit that is essential for the role. His portrayal as a super cop, Satya Verma, transitioning to the rowdy Baby John, feels disjointed.His energy in some portions is misaligned with the tone of the film, leaving him unable to fully immerse himself in the action hero persona. This disconnect between the actor and his character further weakens the film’s overall appeal.Lack of originalityA major drawback of the film is its derivative plot. Although an adaptation from Tamil hit Theri, its predictable storyline brought nothing new to the table. The film’s reliance on a well-worn formula made it hard for audiences to stay engaged, as it lacked the innovative twists needed to distinguish itself from its predecessor.Emotional disconnectAt its heart, Baby John attempts to explore the emotional bond between a father and his child, a universally appealing theme. However, the emotional depth that should underpin the narrative is lost amid the loud action sequences and melodramatic elements. The climax of the film, highlighting a bond between a father and daughter, turned out underwhelming with the emotional touch missing. This lack of emotional engagement makes it difficult for viewers to invest in the stakes of the story.Weak villainOne positive aspect of the film was Jackie Shroff’s portrayal of a menacing villain.

Now, both Sujoy and he are making it a priority to align their schedules and bring it to life.” However, according to Hindustan Times, the actor's team has refuted the rumours. In an earlier report, it was revealed that Sujoy Ghosh would not be directing King, a crime drama he initially developed for Shah Rukh Khan. Instead, Siddharth Anand, who directed Khan in Pathaan, will take over the project. King features Shah Rukh in a role suitable for his age and marks the theatrical debut of his daughter, Suhana Khan.

The movie will bring back some fan-favourite characters who met their end in the series, including Abhishek Banerjee’s Compounder. Banerjee’s performance as the Compounder in Mirzapur Season 1 was one of the most memorable aspects of the show. In an exclusive interview with India Today Digital, Abhishek expressed his excitement and enthusiasm about returning to the series. Known for his dark and intense performances, the actor's portrayal of the Compounder left a lasting impression on audiences, even after the character's early death in the first season. Talking about what fans can expect from his character, Abhishek Banerjee said, “In Mirzapur: The Film, you can expect unwavering loyalty from my character. And let’s be honest, where there’s Compounder, bloodshed is inevitable. Since my character met an early end in the series, I’m pretty sure the makers aren’t bringing us back to life. My guess is that the film will explore events from the time when we were still alive.” “But I know that fans can look forward to a perfect blend of swag and dhamaka on screen. I still remember the energy on set during the first season—every day was all about enjoying the process and having a blast. Mirzapur has always been about unapologetic swag and boundless love, and I believe that essence will shine through once again,” he added. While the details of the film and his role remain under wraps, the actor expressed his gratitude for the loyal fanbase that continues to associate him with the gritty character despite his extensive body of work. ""We haven’t received the script yet, so I don’t know much about my character or its development. However, what I do know is that it’s going to be a massive entertainer. Mirzapur has an incredibly loyal fanbase. No matter how much work I’ve done, there are still young boys and girls who recognise me as Compounder. It’s crazy because I’ve been part of several blockbusters, but for a certain group, their love for Compounder remains unmatched,” Abhishek, who was last seen in Stree 2 said. Mirzapur: The Film will delve deeper into the world of Mirzapur, with its rowdy gangsters returning to portray their iconic characters in a grand, larger-than-life theatrical experience. It is backed by Amazon MGM Studios and Excel Entertainment.

 Directed by Mudassar Aziz, known for his work on films like Pati Patni Aur Woh, Happy Bhag Jayegi, and Khel Khel Mein, the film promises to deliver a fresh and entertaining story. The film was announced in November 2022 and will now release in 2025.  Meanwhile, on the work front, Arjun was last seen in Singham Again, which presented a parallel narrative to the mythological epic Ramayana. Directed by Rohit Shetty, the film is the third film in the Singham franchise and the fifth installment in his cop universe. Rakul Preet Singh will next be seen in De De Pyaar De 2. Unlike the first film, directed by Akiv Ali, the sequel will be helmed by Anshul Sharma, known for Saare Jahaan Se Mehnga. Bhumi is set to make her web series debut with Daldal, where she plays a cop. The series has already wrapped up filming and will be released on Prime Video next year. In addition to Daldal, she also stars in another web show titled The Royals, alongside Ishaan Khatter.Published By: Prachi aryaPublished On: Jan 2, 2025ALSO READ |  Arjun Kapoor announces new film with Bhumi Pednekar and Rakul Preet Singh in quirky styleMust Watch

The show was met with mixed reviews and subsequently cancelled after just one season.   Speaking candidly about the challenges faced during the production on the KADAK YouTube channel's new interview, Mika detailed the difficulties of working with lead actors Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover, who are a married couple. The production involved a month-long shoot in London that unexpectedly stretched to two months, adding to the complications.   “I took a team of 50 to London for a month-long schedule. However, it was extended to two months. Karan and Bipasha created a lot of drama,” Mika revealed.  “They were a married couple, so I booked a single room for them. But, they were like, ‘No, we need our separate rooms.’ I didn’t understand the logic. They then demanded to move to a different hotel. We did that as well,” said Mika.     Mika’s frustration was further heightened on the day of shooting a pivotal scene. Despite the actors signing a contract that included a kissing scene, they reportedly refused to perform it. “They are husband and wife, and yet they created drama around kissing each other on screen,” he said.   Criticising what he perceives as preferential treatment towards larger production houses, Mika added, “These stars fall on the feet of big producers like Dharma Productions and Yash Raj Films and keep praising them for even the tiniest roles, but their attitude changes when it comes to smaller producers. Aren’t we also spending money?”   Dangerous was directed by Bhushan Patel and featured a crime thriller storyline, yet it failed to leave a lasting impression.

He also humbly refused to take any credit for the character and its popularity, stating how it's all the writer and filmmaker's doing. Discussing how such characters eventually manage to get their due, the actor said, ""Honestly, it depends on how it resonates with people. You go through your career and continue to do different types of roles, and a few of them manage to stick. Some are hits, and some misses. But by and large, the effort is to play parts based on some sort of reality that serves the story primarily or serves the themes of the story. And if that resonates with audiences, it sticks in people's memory. You cannot, however, enter it thinking that I want to do these kinds of memorable roles. You have to keep working and, hopefully, some will be memorable. The bad ones will be forgotten, fortunately. But you cannot plan a lot of things."" When asked how he reacts to social media celebrating Taran and his personality, Kunaal smiled to say, ""It's the writing. I don't know, it's the filmmakers and the writers.

Dinesh Vijan, the producer, has likened Akshay to 'Thanos' of the Maddock horror-comedy universe, indicating his significant role in the franchise. Maddock Films recently announced that Stree 3 is scheduled for a theatrical release on August 13, 2027. The revelation was made during the recently held trailer launch of Skyforce, which has been co-produced by Dinesh Vijan. When asked if he would be a part of the horror-comedy universe, Akshay playfully remarked that the decision lies with producers Dinesh Vijan and Jyoti Deshpande. He hinted at his return by stating that Amar Kaushik, who directed Stree 2, would be directing the next installment as well. Dinesh Vijan confirmed Akshay's involvement, describing him as a crucial part of the universe. Last year's Stree 2 was a major blockbuster, largely due to its numerous cameo appearances. Akshay Kumar's surprise cameo as the descendent of Chandra Bhan, a notorious character in the series, was a highlight. The film concluded with a hint that Akshay's character would have a more prominent role as a supervillain in Stree 3.Published By: Anvita SinghPublished On: Jan 5, 2025ALSO READ |  Sky Force trailer: Akshay Kumar leads India's deadliest air strikeMust Watch

Kangana reflected on her decision to release the film theatrically rather than a direct-to-streaming debut. She even said how directing the political drama was the 'wrong decision'.  In an interview with News18, Kangana, who will be seen playing the role of former Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, admitted feeling 'scared' by the delay in her film's release, especially when the Central Bureau of Film Certification (CBFC) withheld certification for several months. “I was scared. I did feel that it was a wrong decision to release it in theatres. I thought that I could’ve got a better deal on OTT and that would mean that I didn’t have to go through any censorship. I was scared that my film would be dissected aur pata nahi kya kya nikaal denge aur kya rakhenge (I didn’t know what they would censor and what all they would keep),” Kangana said. Further, Kangana remarked how she took things for granted and thought that nothing would happen to her film because of BJP’s national rule. “I felt like I made wrong decisions and choices on many levels, and the first one being wanting to direct the film. I took things for granted thinking that we don’t have the Congress government in the centre. So much happened when Mrs Gandhi served as the Prime Minister of India for three terms. Khatarnak hua tha. I thought that I would get away by making Emergency. But that didn’t happen. I was in despair. However, we fought the situation,” she added. Given all the suggestions by the censor body to edit a few scenes, Kangana shared that the final version is a slightly edited one. Reacting to the same, she said, “We have a lot of respect for government bodies and we cooperated with them. We had to edit some things out, but that’s not because they aren’t true or there’s no evidence to substantiate them. It’s just that we didn’t want to hurt sentiments. We submitted all the necessary documents. Everything was scrutinised and vetted by historians and people from different communities and parts of the country. They didn’t find anything in the film offensive. They felt that it was unfair to stall its release.” Set against one of the most turbulent times in Indian political history, Emergency delves into the state of emergency declared by Indira Gandhi in 1975.

It plays on your mind because you look a certain way while following it, and then you want to look like that forever—but nobody can maintain that look forever. I always say, don’t go by my Instagram account; I’m putting my best version there,” Rohit concluded.  Also starring Vivek Oberoi, Tusshar Kapoor and others, Shootout at Lokhandwala was helmed by Apoorva Lakhia.

The actor played Constable Ram Sevak in the film and received praises for attempting action for the first time in his career.  Rajpal Yadav addressed Baby John's failure. He told Bollywood Bubble, ""If this wasn’t a remake, then this would have been the most well-made film of my 25-year career. But since Vijay had done it, the audience had already seen it and because it was a remake, it affected the box office of the film.” Rajpal was asked whether Varun was upset by Baby John's failure. Denying it, the actor added, “Varun is such a sweet boy, very hardworking. He has always tried to do something different, and his attempts must be appreciated because it’s a big deal to take risks.” Made on a budget of over Rs 180 crore, Baby John opened to Rs 11.25 crore in cinemas. The film's numbers drastically fell on the second day, earning Rs 4.75 crore. As per a Sacilk report, the film's daily earnings have dipped below a crore now. The film is struggling to touch the Rs 40 crore-mark in India. Baby John is the Hindi remake of Thalapathy Vijay's Tamil film, Theri. It also stars Keerthy Suresh and Wamiqa Gabbi in important roles. The primary antagonist role in the film is played by Jackie Shroff with cameo appearances by Salman Khan and Sanya Malhotra.

Sood said that the two haven't been on 'talking terms' since Sood walked out of Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi. However, he holds no ill will towards her.  Speaking to YouTuber Subhankar Mishra, Sonu Sood said, ""We are not on talking terms right now, but I have been very close with her family – her mother, father and sister meet me very lovingly. I have a rule in life that if I have ever been close to someone or friends with them, if I have a problem, I will never speak against them."" “People can say whatever they want, but I will never say anything against them. I might feel upset thinking, ‘This person was a good friend and said such things’. I feel that it’s her foolishness. She is not a bad person. But sometimes, when you write or say things, you don’t actually think it through. I might have also gone through this and done similar things. However, there is no regret. It’s her point of view,” he added. Sonu Sood had quit Kangana's film, Manikarnika-The Queen of Jhansi, due to prior work commitments. However, Kangana later claimed that the incident happened as Sonu Sood did not like working under a female director. At the time, Sood had denied the allegations.

The film not only defined his career but also left a lasting impact on Bollywood, becoming one of the most influential Indian films. In a recent interview, Manoj revealed that he initially felt guilty and uncomfortable with the success of the film. It was Akshaye Khanna who helped him overcome these feelings, advising him not to feel guilty and to embrace his achievements. The success of Satya catapulted Manoj to nationwide fame and earned him the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor. However, he initially struggled to adjust to the sudden attention and success. Manoj recently shared that he felt out of place in five-star hotels and experienced impostor syndrome. Akshaye Khanna helped him navigate this phase, advising him, “Manoj, why are you feeling so guilty about your success? Own it.” Manoj admitted to feeling uncomfortable with the newfound attention, having spent 25 years working without it. Speaking to Midday, Manoj Bajpayee said, ""You have not seen all of this for such a long period that you’re not used to it. People ask me, ‘Are you comfortable with the attention that you are getting?’ No, how can I be? I am very nice and polite to them, to expect me to be comfortable? No, for 25 years I hadn’t gotten that attention. (By the time I became a star) all others had been stars for 30 years or so. They wouldn’t know anything else.  In 2024, Manoj appeared in five projects, including a streaming series, most of which were released directly on OTT platforms. Among them was The Fable, which premiered at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival and is awaiting public release. He also starred in the Netflix black comedy crime thriller series Killer Soup alongside Konkona Sen Sharma. His other films included Silence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout, Bhaiyya Ji, and Despatch.Published By: Anisha RaoPublished On: Jan 9, 2025ALSO READ |  Manoj Bajpayee recalls 'frustrating' time when 'Satya' was stalledMust Watch

Neither he nor the audience then knew at the time that the boy, whose name flashed as 'Hrithik Roshan', would one day play a huge role in the evolution of films in the early 2000s. When Hrithik Roshan first appeared as Rohit and then Raj in Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, the audience was enamoured. He brought about a dose of mint-like freshness, something that the film industry had long awaited. Having been directed and produced by veteran actor-filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, the film was a mammoth launchpad for Hrithik. And it was rather cleverly done too. The script was planned in a way which made the audience believe that Hrithik has the potential to play dual roles with different character traits, right from the very start. Speaking to India Today Digital, Rakesh Roshan said, “When I made the film, I was not sure that it was going to do well or if Hrithik was going to be a superstar. Nobody can predict about the film. I just made the film, and I was a director and producer who was working with an actor. It's wasn't the son I was working with.” He added, “Once the film was ready, and it was about to release, then my father-instinct woke up. I used to pray to God that 'Please picture chala dena bete ke liye kyunki usne bahut mehnat ki hai' (Please help the film become successful, he’s worked very hard for it). We don't know the success of the film, why it is and why it is not.” Hrithik Roshan was believable as the naïve and gullible Rohit, who had no malice in his heart for anyone. Scenes later, he appeared as the muscular Raj, who danced like he was forever trained to do so all his life. He hit and beat like a professional. And boy, when he loved, all the girls secretly wanted to place themselves instead of then-debutante Ameesha Patel. And that’s how Hrithik Roshan became one of the chosen ones to have been a sensation, right from his very first film.

His male fans straight hit the gym...or perhaps, dance classes, all emulating their now-favourite newfound superstar. Rakesh Roshan told us that when the film released, the audience reactions were “unbelievably crazy”. He said, “How it happened and why it happened, I don't think anybody can analyse it. I still feel that when an actor becomes a big star or a superstar, there has to be some magnet in him to pull the audience. And what his magnet was, we don't know. Perhaps his eyes pulled the audience or the way he carried himself.” The filmmaker continued, “You won’t believe that there are some fans who came and told me 'My toddler son does not eat food until he watches Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai. How would a 2-year-old know who Hrithik Roshan is? There is some kind of attraction in him that pulls the audience.” But Hrithik could hardly taste his success of Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai. On one hand, fans couldn’t get enough of him. On the other, his father was hospitalised, after having been shot at by unidentified assailants. Hrithik had even allegedly thought of quitting films.

Trade analysts initially estimated the film's first-day earnings to be between Rs 70 lakh and Rs 1 crore, making the Rs 2.45 crore opening a pleasant surprise.

 Before unveiling his first look, the Chamkila actor had teased fans with a post that read, “Much awaited film is about to be released in Feb. So we had to postpone the album. Stay tuned folks (sic).” Based on the life of Jaswant Singh Khalra, the film made headlines last year when it encountered challenges with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), which recommended between 85 to 120 cuts. As reported by Mid-Day, the biggest change suggested by the censor board was to remove Khalra’s name from the film. Reportedly, CBFC has also asked the makers, Honey Trehan and Ronnie Screwvala, to reconsider the title Punjab ’95, which references the year Khalra disappeared. The activist went missing in September 1995, and ten years later, six Punjab police officers were convicted for his murder.Published By: Prachi aryaPublished On: Jan 11, 2025ALSO READ  |  Diljit Dosanjh shares his first 'naughty' vlog of 2025, fans can't stop laughingTrending Reel

In an exclusive interview with India Today Digital, Rakesh spoke about the challenges involved in casting newcomers and how he was as well aware of his son’s caliber. However, what was interesting to note was that Ameesha was cast just three days before the shooting. While talking about the same, the director said, ""I was not nervous, actually. After reading the story, I realised it required fresh faces—both the leads had to be newcomers. Hrithik and I had already collaborated on a few projects, and he had helped me with the script. This gave me a better understanding that he can pull off this role well. We worked closely together, and since I knew his potential and he understood my expectations, it wasn’t difficult to bring it all together.”

 Adding, “As for Ameesha Patel, we cast her just three days before shooting began. She was a complete outsider to the film industry but delivered an impressive performance. It never felt like Hrithik and Ameesha were debutants—they performed with confidence and looked more like veterans.” Having said that, when asked if the actor-director would ever think of making a sequel of the popular film for the Gen Z audience, Roshan discussed how he always likes to challenge himself with different genres. “I started with Khoon Bhari Maang, a heroine-centric film featuring Rekha, but instead of following that success with a similar theme, I chose a completely different path. Next, I made the double-role film Kishan Kanhaiya, followed by King Uncle with Jackie Shroff and a young girl in the lead. I’ve always challenged myself with diverse subjects. After that came Karan Arjun and Koyla. It was then that I realized I had never directed a romantic film, despite exploring various genres. That’s when the idea of Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai was born.” “Following its success, many expected me to make Hrithik a dancing star in another film. Instead, I challenged myself—and him—by casting him as a handicapped boy in Koi Mil Gaya. I knew his strengths as an actor and his ability to deliver deeply emotional performances,” the 73-year-old director concluded. Directed by Rakesh Roshan, the film also marked the debut of Ameesha Patel alongside Hrithik. The film’s re-release is special for fans as it is Hrithik Roshan’s 51st birthday as well.

Now, he has reacted to the reports that Triptii was dropped from the project because she was not suitable for the part.  Rumours suggested that Triptii was removed from the film for being 'too exposed' for the romantic drama, which reportedly required a 'purity in demeanour' from its female lead. Her bold scenes in Animal were cited as the reason, with claims that these scenes rendered her unsuitable for Aashiqui 3's traditional portrayal of innocence and purity.

However, the film soon fizzled at the ticket counter. Jackie Shroff, who played the antagonist in the film, recently reacted to its failure and said that he does feel bad for the producers. Speaking exclusively to India Today Digital, the actor discussed whether the dismissive performance of a film at the box office affects him. He shared, ""The producers do get affected. They put in a lot of money with trust in these projects. And when they do not recover it, that is sad. As actors, of course, you want to be liked for your performance but you also want it to work well."" When asked if, after so many years as an actor, a film's failure brings pain, Shroff dismissed it by saying, ""Dukh hota hai par khud ke liye nahi, producers ke liye (You do feel bad but not for yourself, but the producers). You tend to do your job with sincerity, but the people who have put in the money, you have to think about them too."" Made on a budget of over Rs 180 crore, Baby John opened to Rs 11.25 crore in cinemas. The film's numbers drastically fell on the second day, earning Rs 4.75 crore. As per a Sacnilk report, the film's daily earnings have dipped below a crore now. It is struggling to touch the Rs 40 crore mark domestically. In a recent interview with Bollywood Bubble, actor Rajpal Yadav also addressed Baby John's failure and spoke about Varun Dhawan's reaction to it. Reasoning the failure of the film for it being a remake, he said, ""If this wasn’t a remake, then this would have been the most well-made film of my 25-year career. But since Vijay had done it, the audience had already seen it and because it was a remake, it affected the box office of the film. Varun is such a sweet boy, very hardworking. He has always tried to do something different, and his attempts must be appreciated because it’s a big deal to take risks.” Baby John is the Hindi remake of Thalapathy Vijay's Tamil film, Theri.

The actor was speaking during the promotion of his latest film, Fateh, when he recalled his meeting with Dabangg's director Abhinav Kashyap and mentioned how the role of Chulbul Pandey and the song Munni Badnaam were written for him, but Salman Khan changed everything at the last minute.  The 51-year-old told Shubhankar Mishra on his YouTube show that Kashyap spoke to him about making a cop film with a protagonist named Chulbul, and that's when he got on board. Sonu added that later, when the director offered him the role of the villain named Chhedi Singh, he refused to play the character.  The actor said, ""Abhinav Kashyap (Dabangg’s director) was an assistant to Mani Ratnam earlier. He was a very good friend of mine. He told me that I am writing a cop story with the name Chulbul, we will do it together. I was also excited and told him that we would do it.""  He shared that it was Arbaaz Khan, Salman's brother, who informed everyone that the superstar wanted to work in the film. Sonu recalled Arbaaz mentioning how he narrated the film to his brother and he liked it.  While the lead role went to Salman, the director continued to pursue Sonu for the negative character. The actor shared that after sometime, he asked Kashyap to provide some depth to the character and give him a special song.  ""They asked me, 'What is the problem with the role, why aren't you doing it?' I asked Abhinav to twist the role a bit. Let’s write it more for the next 2–3 days. If I understand it, then I’ll do it. And, I need a song in the film. I asked them to include an item number. When Farah (Farah Khan, choreographer-filmmaker) was making the song, I was conversing with her about including certain steps and how it should be a hit,"" he said.    The actor, who is also known for his humanitarian work, went on to call Munni Badnaam 'my song'. Sonu highlighted that he was keen on doing the popular dance number, but Salman decided to take over it at the last minute.  He said, ""Abhinav came with one good and one bad news. Good news about one of the scenes and bad one about Salman taking the song. I said, 'It is my song, how will he come in between like that'. He said that he will do it through a raid scene. I told them that it's wrong, I only had one song. But finally, whatever happened, happened or the good. People still remember the song.""  Sonu's performance as Chhedi Singh was well appreciated by both the critics and the audience. Dabangg also featured Sonakshi Sinha and Dimple Kapadia in important roles. It turned into a franchise with Dabangg 2 and Dabangg 3 hitting the screens later.

 Emergency highlights the Indian Army and Indira Gandhi’s government’s role in the 1971 Bangladesh war of independence and the support given to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is called the Father of Bangladesh and who used to address Indira Gandhi as Goddess Durga. The film also showcases the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at the hands of Bangladeshi extremists -- factors which are believed to have led to the ban of the film in Bangladesh. Emergency, set to hit Indian theatres in just three days, has been surrounded by intense buzz for its bold depiction of the pivotal moment in Indian history. However, the ban of the film in Bangladesh highlights a growing trend where cultural exchanges are increasingly influenced by the political climate.

The attack prompted Salman Khan to bolster security at his Galaxy Homes apartment with bulletproof glass and electric fencing. In october 2024, former Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Baba Siddiqui, known to be close to Salman Khan, was shot dead outside his son's office in Bandra. The attackers were again linked to the Bishnoi gang. These attacks have raised questions about Bandra being a safe haven for Bollywood celebrities. Besides Saif Ali Khan and Salman Khan,other prominent actors who live in Bandra are Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt, Rekha, Zeenat Aman, Ananya Panday, Farhan Akhtar and Saira Bano. Responding to the attack on Saif Ali Khan, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi questioned the lapse of security in Bandra, despite being a high-profile residential area. She also questioned the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra Home Minister as the city witnessed""another high profile attempt on life"". ""What a shame that Mumbai sees another high profile attempt on life. The attack on Saif Ali Khan yet again raises questions on Mumbai Police & the Home Minister. This is after a series of incidents that show there is a deliberate attempt to undermine Mumbai by targeting big names,"" she tweeted. Citing the fatal attack on Baba Siddiqui, and shots fired at Salman Khan's home, the Uddhav Sena leader said, ""All in Bandra. An area which has the highest concentration of celebrities, which is supposed to have adequate security. If celebrities are not safe, then who in Mumbai is?""    Also sharing similar concerns, actor Pooja Bhatt said that ""we need more police presence in Bandra"". ""Can this lawlessness please be curbed?We need more police presence in Bandra. The city and especially the queen of the suburbs, have never felt so unsafe before,"" she tweeted.    Meanwhile, Mumbai Police said the attack on Saif Ali Khan was likely to be a suspected insider attack as CCTV footage from two hours prior to the incident did not show anyone entering his housing society. In addition to the actor, a female staff was also stabbed, the police added. The 54-year-old actor sustained injuries to his neck and near the spine after he was attacked with a sharp weapon at least six times.After the attack, he was admitted to Lilavati Hospital where he is undergoing surgery and was reportedly out of danger.

The film, which featured Saif Ali Khan and Urmila Matondkar in lead roles, showed off two A-list stars at their peak who were not afraid to go dark. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/ek-hasina-thi-is-21-saif-ali-khan-and-urmila-matondkar-classic-sriram-raghavan-2665658-2025-01-16,"There are not many films that have been able to stand the test of time after two decades of their release. However, filmmaker Sriram Raghavan's directorial, Ek Hasina Thi, manages to do exactly that. Yes, despite that illogical conclusion. A cave on a hill in the capital. What gives, writers? But despite some loose strings, what has kept Ek Hasina Thi fresh in the minds of the audiences were its terrific lead performances by Saif Ali Khan and Urmila Matondkar. While Saif relished and sunk his teeth deep into the skin of Karan, the sly, suave and unsuspecting baddie of the film, it was Urmila who carried most of the load on her pretty and avenging shoulders.  At times unhinged and merciless (especially in the end), Urmila was hypnotic as Sarika, who ends up falling for the scheming Saif.  Filmmaker and co-writer Sriram Raghavan was not afraid to break boundaries right from the beginning of his career -- making the film's leading lady sleep with a man she barely knows, and then turning her into a force to reckon with -- an upgraded (and more subtle) version of Rekha in Khoon Bhari Maang, if you will. 

 



A still from Ek Hasina Thi
 In an earlier interview with journalist Subhash K Jha, actor Saif Ali Khan had recalled his experience of working on the set and said, "" It was a great creative outlet. It was really low-budgeted. But the script had some immensely off-beat moments which made it a special film for the audience. It was truly liberating to work like that.” While this was perhaps Saif's first time doing an out-and-out dark role, he managed to convince the audience with his incredibly nuanced portrayal of the diabolical and debonair Karan.  The few loose moments that were hither-tither in the second half of the narrative came together to form an outlandish outro to the otherwise satisfying and edgy watch. Speaking about the same, director Sriram Raghavan had earlier told mid-day in an interview, ""It’s so illogical. They are in Delhi. She takes him to some place in the hills. There is a cave there. But emotionally, the scene worked. I got a phone call from my sister in Delhi. She loved the film."" Despite it being bizarre and slightly nonsensical, one couldn't help but root for Urmila's avenging character. And in the end, as they say, all is well that ends, because thanks to the film, we got our very own Alfred Hitchcock, Sriram Raghavan, and a courageous actor in Saif Ali Khan, who has since not been afraid to take up unconventional parts, be it a Langda Tyagi in Omkara or the zany fake Russian in the comedy, Go Goa Gone.  Also starring Seema Biswas and Aditya Srivastav in prominent roles, Ek Hasina Thi is available to stream on Prime Video.

9e23f045-5efc-470f-8a88-02f46cdab79f,Is Hindi cinema losing its theatre-going crowd?The diminishing footfall in movie theatres is raising concerns over ever-evolving audience taste and the future of Hindi cinema. Industry experts spoke to India Today Digital about the decline in film releases and evolving viewer habits post-pandemic.,https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/is-hindi-cinema-losing-its-theatre-going-crowd-2666450-2025-01-18,"Once upon a time, signboards on top of cinema hall ticket counters screamed ‘HOUSEFULL’, in all-caps. As you persuaded the salesperson sitting behind the counter to have mercy on you and get you tickets, your eyes would search for people selling the tickets in black. You wouldn’t mind paying some extra bucks or waiting in queues in the hot sun, to watch your favourite star in a film you’d long been waiting for. Those days, these desperations seemed worth it. Cut to now: Buying a film ticket is as easy as flipping a page. Go to movie booking apps and voila! You have the ticket with the seat of your choice. Still, movie theatres have never been emptier. When was the last time you truly waited with bated breath for a Friday to arrive so that you could watch the film of your choice? Do you remember counting days backwards or keeping track on the calendar for that one fateful Friday for a film to release in theatres? Most of the young audience can’t even relate to what is being talked about here. And that is where the problem lies. The movie theatre-going culture in India for Hindi films is steadily taking a hit. What could possibly be the reason(s)? Let’s decode.ARE FEWER FILMS RELEASING NOW? Every year, around 700-1000 films are released across languages in India. 150-200 are in Hindi alone. However, not many seem to enthral the audience enough to have them thronging the theatres. Do lesser films release in theatres now as compared to the pre-Covid days? Trade expert Taran Adarsh told India Today Digital, “The number of films has reduced when compared to the pre-Covid days. It is because projects are being banned, financials have been shaken, and there are a number of flops. Overall, the film industry is in the correction process. Corrective measures are being taken to actually rectify the mistakes that were committed earlier.” Trade analyst Akkshay Rathie spoke to India Today Digital about the ‘significant reduction’ of Hindi film releases. Reasoning it out, he said, “Post-Covid, the consumption patterns of people and choices changed drastically. And that resulted in a loss. The industry has actually gone back to the drawing board and weighing in what's working, what's not working, what sort of choices we are making which they want to try and mount on.” He added, “Big screen spectacles need a certain budget and grade of cast. There are only so many actors you can count on to be able to mount those scales. The number of smaller films that used to get made and go to the theatres has reduced drastically. That's why the overall count of Hindi releases has also reduced.WHAT IS CHANGING? Changes are important, sure, but what is leading to the rapid decline in footfall in theatres? Are the makers running out of ideas for good content or has the audience consumption pattern changed, leaning more towards OTT? Akkshay said, “Those two years of lockdown expedited the consumption pattern change drastically. What would have organically happened in, let's say 10 years, actually happened in 2 years. The audience got used to the convenience of sitting at home and consuming content. They've become a lot more selective about what they venture out to the cinemas for. People now actually prefer to watch films at home.” Anil Sharma, director of hitmaker Gadar 2, reflected on how OTT has played a huge role in people’s theatrical patterns. He told India Today Digital, “Movies start coming on OTT after eight weeks. People wait for films on OTT when they can watch them with the whole family. Tickets are so expensive these days. People think 'How many movies should I watch? I have already seen one'.” Higher costs of tickets also play a huge role in why a person can think twice before watching a film in a theatre. Not to forget the outrageous prices of popcorn and snacks. An average middle-class person might not want to shell out Rs 2000 in the theatres for a family of four. And to top it all, the audience’s taste is also changing. “The audience has become more ruthless. But then, the audience was ruthless earlier too,” said Taran Adarsh, further adding, “Today, going to a theatre is more expensive than it was earlier because the ticket pricing needs to be made more affordable.”

LACK OF BIG TICKET RELEASES AND A FORMIDABLE FILM CALENDAR A post shared by ZEE5 (@zee5)
 Let’s go back to 2007. Every second Hindi film, Chak De India, Dhamaal, Guru, Heyy Babyy, Om Shanti Om, Partner, Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Welcome, Taare Zameen Par, went on to become blockbusters. Can you imagine that happening in 2025? It is the lack of good scripts and big stars that is leading to a lack of audiences in theatres. “Every year has different kinds of films coming in different budgets and styles. Hopefully, this year we will have all the 52 windows, 52 Fridays, being grabbed by the movies because last year many important dates were left out. That was one of the reasons why there was scarcity of content and the lack of audience resulted in the bleeding of theatres. I hope things get better this year,” said Taran Adarsh, optimism running high. He said, “Yes, we need big films. We need to keep going. The big stars at least guarantee big openings, but, eventually, it all boils down to content. I'm not denying that, but big stars have to be there.” Taran added, “We must have a good and impressive film calendar. Only then will things work.”EVOLVING AUDIENCE TASTE PRE-COVID AND POST-COVID In 2018-2019, the two years before the pandemic hit us, we had both big ticket and small-scale films working for Hindi cinema. Take, for instance, Manmarziyaan, Padman, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, Sanju, Andhadhun, Gully Boy, Kesari, Mission Mangal, URI and Dabangg 3. This was followed by three years of duds (2020–2021) and the deadly Omicron wave in 2022, when stepping inside theatres would be considered an act of courage. In 2023, the Hindi film industry saw a resurrection with Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Sunny Deol, and others, belting out one hit after the other. It was a year that truly resurrected the Hindi film industry. 2024, unfortunately, was abysmal for Bollywood. You did have National Award-winner Alia Bhatt in Jigra, Akshay Kumar-Tiger Shroff's Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, Sidharth Malhotra's Yodha, Hrithik Roshan's Fighter, Randeep Hooda's Swatantrya Veer Savarkar, Kareena Kapoor Khan's The Buckingham Murders, and others, but none of them worked at the box office.  Simultaneously, small-scale films didn’t work either. Thankfully, films like Laapataa Ladies and Stree 2 did hold the fort, but then that’s it. When you have to strain your brain to recall the superhit films of the year, you know there's a problem.

 



Stree 2 was one of the highest-grossing films of 2023.
ARE HOLIDAY WINDOWS WORKING? Hindi film producers and distributors often eye a holiday release. However, that isn’t a shortcut to success. Neither does it guarantee a longer running time at 70 mm. “It does help to an extent, because you get the advantage of a holiday and people want to step out and watch movies. But having said that, eventually, it all boils down to the content and whether it is worth watching. Holiday or no holiday, a film will work if it’s good. Animal and Pushpa 2, both were non-holiday releases. Makers need to be aware of what the audience wants to watch instead of giving them what we want them to watch,” said Taran.IS THE WAIT FOR THEATRICAL RELEASES FADING AWAY? When was the last time you waited for a weekend, only to socialise all the way? All you want to do on a weekend now is to just stay indoors, cosy up in a blanket with a warm cup of cocoa, order your favourite food and watch content controlled by a remote. You can take as many pauses as you want and not finish the film at one go. The world is rapidly moving towards a faster life. Hence, a lot of youngsters and 9-5 corporate employees prefer staying indoors and consuming content, until the makers are creating films that will compel the audience to step out of their comfort zones and dedicate their time and energy to going to a movie hall and watching a film. Latching onto this thought, Akkshay Rathie said, “There's so much access to recreation now. But then, people were waiting for Pathaan and Animal. These days, there are only a handful of films which give you a theatrically worthy experience.” Agreeing that people’s enthusiasm to watch a film in theatres is indeed fading away, Taran believed that theatre’s good days might return soon. “Hopefully, there will be a corrective issue and, in the passage of time, we'll be able to sort it out and bring back the audience's trust.”PEAK OF OTT The rise of OTT platforms has played a huge role in reducing the number of people watching films in theatres. A film runs in theatres for as many as eight weeks. The audience know that even if they miss a big theatre experience for a film, they can always catch it later on OTT, at their own convenience. Akkshay said, “OTT has changed people’s theatre-going experience. But having said that, not just OTT, there are many other factors too. Cinema is not just competing with OTT. It's competing with every form of outdoor recreation, which includes going out to a restaurant, a live concert, and many other things.” Filmmaker Anil Sharma weighed in, and added how multiple forms of recreation and content-consuming platforms are leaving the ‘audience confused’. He said, “They consume content on OTT and TV. They are getting reels from all over the world and their patience level for reels doesn't last over two minutes. There have been changes in the way the audience sees things, but cinema is still a cinema. When good films come, the public will go in large numbers.” He observed why 2024 was a nil year in the Hindi film industry, as compared to 2023, when Pathaan, Jawan, Gadar 2, The Kerala Story, and Animal, left the cash registers ringing all year through. “2024 didn't perform well because the actors who gave superhits in 2023 will take a year or two to come back again,” concluded Sharma.
 


 2025, on the other hand, looks rather promising with almost every big star returning with a film. Salman Khan's Sikandar, Aamir Khan's Sitaare Zameen Par, Akshay Kumar's Sky Force and Housefull 5, Vicky Kaushal's Chhaava, Hrithik Roshan's War 2, and Tiger Shroff's Baaghi 4 - to name a few. But is the optimism worth it? One can only hope. Not that makers aren’t trying, but one can only wish for a set formula that would revamp the fate of movie theatres for the Hindi-speaking audience. Sadly, there’s none. The only way out of this loop is to create stories that trace back to our roots and remind you of simpler times; knowing and accepting the audience’s ever-evolving taste and creating stories that will prompt the audience to book a big screen experience. Its high time Hindi filmmakers took the road less travelled. And now, more than ever.Published By: Anindita MukhopadhyayPublished On: Jan 18, 2025ALSO READ |  Stree 3, Bhediya 2 to Maha Munjya: Maddock Films announce release datesMust Watch

In an interview, he shared that the highly-anticipated film might start this year.  In conversation with Pinkvilla, Akshay Kumar, who is promoting his upcoming film Sky Force, said, ""Even I am waiting to start Hera Pheri 3. I don’t know, but if everything goes well, it will start this year."" He continued, ""When we started Hera Pheri, we didn’t know it would go ahead to become such a cult. Even when I saw the film, I didn’t understand. Yes, it was funny, but none of us expected the characters of Babu Bhaiya, Raju, and Shyam to become a cult."" Earlier, in an exclusive conversation with India Today Digital, Paresh Rawal spoke about the film and his bond with Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty. He said, ""Agar ye achhi hoti hain, I always have this example of Munnabhai MBBS and Lage Raho Munnabhai."" He added, ""The sequel should be like that, radically different. Take a quantum leap. Take your character in a different background, different world. Take the audience also to a different world. That's how it should be. If it comes out like that, fine. But then let's see how it works out.” We asked Paresh Rawal about what it is like to be back on sets with Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty for Hera Pheri 3 and if their equation is still the same. He exclusively told us, “Yeah, we still have. After Hera Pheri, too, we have worked in many films together, and we respect each other as an artist, as human beings and friends. They are all secure actors. And we know what we have to do. It's not a kind of dark area where we don't know what is expected of us.

The 57-year-old underscored the importance of playing an unsung hero in his films. The actor mentioned the textbooks carrying the stories of 'Akbar and Aurangzeb', and not of our soldiers.   In an interview with News18 Showsha, Akshay said the stories about the valour of Indian soldiers should be a part of our history books. He shared, ""There are so many things which are not there in our books. I intentionally play roles which are not a part of our books. I want to do this. They are all unknown heroes.""  The Khiladi of Bollywood, as he is popularly called, added, ""People do not know anything about them because nobody goes deep. I go for these kinds of roles.""   He asserted, ""History books need to be corrected. A lot of things there need to be corrected. We read about Akbar or Aurangzeb but do not read about our own heroes. They need to be mentioned.""  Akshay went on to talk about the lives of those who have been conferred with the Param Veer Chakra, India's highest military honour, and the stories of their extreme courage in times of adversity. ""There are so many stories from the army. So many people have been honoured with the Param Veer Chakra. I think history needs to be corrected and these kinds of leaders should be brought in and told to our generation,"" he said.  Sky Force features the actor playing the role of Wing Commander KO Ahuja, a character based on Wing Commander Om Parkash Taneja, who fought during the 1965 India-Pakistan war. He was given a Vir Chakra for his bravery after he demolished the enemy's aircraft and runway during a risky mission in September 1965.  Akshay is joined by debutant Veer Pahariya, Nimrat Kaur and Sara Ali Khan in the film. Directed by Abhishek Anil Kapur and Sandeep Kewlani, Sky Force is releasing on January 24.

The film is ready to hit the screens as the big Republic Day release this year, and has already started getting positive reviews. An emotional war drama produced by Dinesh Vijay's Maddock Films, it also marks the Bollywood debut of Veer Pahariya.  The film's advance booking opened on a slow note, but gained momentum as positive word-of-mouth spread on social media. As of 6 pm on Thursday, Sky Force sold around 86,905 tickets, grossing around Rs 2.1 crore for its opening day, reported the trade website Sacnilk. The total amount so far, including block seats, stands at Rs 3.44 crore gross.  With the growth in advance booking from Thursday evening, the film might just end up collecting in the range of Rs 7-9 crore nett on Friday. The collections could also go up to Rs 10 crore considering the tickets for Friday are being sold for a price as low as Rs 30-70.  After the press screening that took place early on Thursday, many critics gave a thumbs up to the film on social media. The word-of-mouth is only expected to grow from here, which will further strengthen the film's performance at the box office. Not to forget, it is going to gain heavily from the Republic Day weekend at the ticket window, which means the collections on Saturday and Sunday could just beat our expectations.

 India Today Digital's review of Sky Force reads, ""It's difficult to keep Akshay from dominating the film with the kind of screen-space he's been given. But, to the writers' credit, even with him on-screen, you find yourself thinking about Veer. Because that's what the story demands. That's what they want you to look for. Sky Force uses all the basic elements of a commercial patriotic cinema in India, but avoids over-doing them. There are no romantic numbers, no dialogues that distract you from the agenda of the film, and no larger-than-life action sequences to impress you.""

The film earned a nomination for Best Live Action Short Film. As the buzz around the film heats up, the attention is on the 9-year-old lead star of the film. Directed by Adam J Graves and Suchitra Mattai, Anuja is the story of a talented 9-year-old girl, Anuja, faced with a life-altering choice between pursuing an education or working in a factory alongside her sister. The film features Sajda Pathan in the lead role, with Ananya Shanbhag portraying her sister. The movie is set against the backdrop of New Delhi. Now, while many fans are congratulating the makers for this new feat, others are guessing about the girl, Sajda Pathan. She has her own cinematic journey which we are sure not many have known. Sajda, who rose from the slums, was rescued from the streets by an NG. She had previously worked in The Braid (La Tresse), a French film directed by Laetitia Colombani, where she shared screen space with Mia Maelzer. Sajda was a former child labourer from Delhi. She was rescued by the Salaam Baalak Trust. Established in 1988 with proceeds from Mira Nair's Oscar-nominated film Salaam Bombay, the trust has co-produced the film in partnership with Krushan Naik Films. Anuja has the backing of a remarkable team of producers: Suchitra Mattai, Mindy Kaling, Guneet Monga Kapoor, Krushan Naik, Aaron Kopp, Devananda Graves, Michael Graves, Ksheetij Saini and Alexandra Blaney. Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Anita Bhatia are on board as Executive Producers. Co-Executive Producers include Archana Jain, Susan MacLaury, Albie Hecht. Anuja is currently streaming on Netflix.

d17c4afd-75b1-45f7-8fc5-e7acd26d8709,"Why Deewar is more iconic than Sholay While Sholay remains a cult classic, Deewar appears to be so much more. It is one of the finest examples of the kind of cinema which speaks to the audience, representing them and their issues. In the battle between Sholay and Deewar, here's some food for thought. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/why-deewar-is-more-iconic-than-sholay-2669633-2025-01-24,"There's cinema that's pure fantasy, a happy coincidence of imagination and creativity. Like Sholay. And then there's cinema that comes from around us, reflecting the very issues we are fighting. Like Deewar. It's not necessary for the latter to give you any solutions. It's the mere representation that matters.  Yash Chopra's 1975 drama about two brothers, Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) and Ravi (Shashi Kapoor), defines the very fabric of quintessential Bollywood. It's excessively melodramatic, full of whistle-worthy dialogues, appeals to the emotions of a common man, and leaves you entertained. Like any other good commercial cinema.  Now, Sholay, which over time earned the title of being a cult classic in the Hindi film industry, has all the elements that Deewar has. But, it is still light years behind in being this layered story that's relevant even today. 

 



A poster of Sholay
 In both Sholay and Deewar, a handsome and rugged Amitabh Bachchan commands your attention. Except, in the Ramesh Sippy-directorial, he is a criminal-turned-man with a newfound purpose, and in Deewar, his purpose in life turns him into a criminal. Bachchan's celebrated image as the 'angry young man' of the industry is more credited to Deewar than Sholay, even when both the films were released the same year.  Sholay, which wasn't a success when it was first released in theatres, is like a grand, loud play. Its characters are not real, neither is the situation it deals with. It became a mammoth success in the later years simply because it represents the escapist cinema at its best. You are invested in the story of two underdogs who will fight tooth and nail to bring down a dacoit, Gabbar Singh.  Each character in Sholay is so animated that you are left in awe of them. There's Thakur, an ex-cop, whose hands were chopped off by Gabbar, and he is living to avenge all that he lost years ago.  Jai and Veeru (played by Bachchan and Dharmendra, respectively) are like machine guns - very attractive, full of strength but all over the place in the absence of a steep direction. There's Basanti (Hema Malini), a colourfully nonchalant addition in a drama based on dacoits.  A jailer (Asrani) who is a perfect mockery of Hitler, rarely ever done in Hindi cinema. There's also a blind Imaam Saheb (AK Hangal) to provide the emotional relief amid action and comedy. Not to forget, a very muted Radha (Jaya Bachchan), the white saree-clad widow of Thakur's son who was killed by Gabbar. 

 



Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra in a still from Sholay
 The premise of Sholay is nothing short of extraordinary, because it's inscrutably unbelievable. The film can be watched at any age in any era, and it will remain unbelievable. Which is not the case with Deewar.  At its heart, Deewar, written by Salim-Javed, offers a powerful commentary on the socio-political shifts in the country, addressing issues that are not only believable but relevant. To the point that making a film like that wouldn't be an easy job today. The story cleverly operates in the disguise of a stellar drama between two sons and their mother, but all throughout its journey, it remains a poignant take on the changing fabric of the nation in the late 70s. Even before we are introduced to the heroes of the film, we are told about the significant issues of a common man - the loss of opportunities, the rich and the poor divide, the feeling of losing faith in the state, and that urge to speak up. One of the initial scenes in the film has Vijay and Ravi's father, Anand Verma, leading a strike by the factory workers against the owners' oppression, demanding decent wages.  That he is later silenced in the film following the kidnapping of his family is quite a representation of those being shushed by power, connections and access to riches. Not to overlook the fact that it was released in the same year as Indira Gandhi declaring an emergency, the darkest phase in the history of Indian governance. 

 



Shashi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan in a still from Deewar
 Deewar is also an unflinching way of showing the idea of the right and the wrong, what lies in between, and the idea of what needs to be done and what should be done.  When Ravi decides to kill his brother, Vijay, and their mother permits the killing, the message is quite clear: the criminal needs to be done away with. The fact that it was those painful circumstances that made Vijay a smuggler is irrelevant. His angst against the world doesn't matter. It is also not relevant if he was brutally bullied as a child, and was tattooed 'mera baap chor hai'. The only thing that's important is that in the battle between the right and the wrong, the wrong will never win.  In Deewar, the lines between this right and wrong are quite blurry. Probably that's the reason you never find yourself celebrating the death of Vijay with his own brother. In fact, you always find yourself rooting for that man, because him becoming this rich, powerful figure feels like a personal win. He is the hero. His success is a slap on the faces of those who bullied him in childhood, and made his mother start afresh in a grim world, in the face of adversity.  Deewar not just makes you sit up and clap everytime Vijay realises his power, it also makes you think. While Sholay could be a grand imagery, Deewar is a deep rumination about deprivation, social ascent and discontent.  Even with all its popularity and the celebratory status, Sholay will always be just a film. While Deewar is almost like a well-thought book about cinema itself. Also, Sholay will never have one thing that Deewar has: Maa.

On Cinematic Saturday, actor Unni Mukundan, senior trade analyst Taran Adarsh and National Award-winning critic Deepak Dua decode what is drawing the big screen audience to gruesome films.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/story/animal-kill-marco-why-indians-are-loving-gore-on-the-big-screen-2669858-2025-01-25,"Khoon ka fountain, lash ka mountain... Danger, danger, danger Ramsey Brothers might have used this iconic line for their horror films, but it looks more befitting for Indian cinema today. Action,in the last few years, has transcended from kicks and punches to slashing off villain's minions with axes and bludgeoning them to death with whatever is at hand - gas cylinders, fire extinguishers, or hammers. The hero, with the first few buttons of his shirt open, is more keen to get wet and dirty (no puns intended). And then starts the hacking, coupled with masochism in most films. What started off with KGF, and was explored more freely on OTT (remember how graphically Hathoda Tyagi bludgeoned his cousins to death with a hammer, earning his name, in Paatal Lok). But, what the audience has been watching on the big screen in the last few years has been unprecedented. Even more interesting to note is that the audience loves these films - though these are not U/A-certified films that can be watched with your family. So, why are such films being made, and why are they loved by the audiences?ANIMAL AND THE RISE OF STYLISED GORE Gore was presented on the big screen with Prashanth Neel's Kannada blockbuster KGF, featuring Yash as the lead. However, what really made an everlasting impact was Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Animal featuring Ranbir Kapoor. The audience was hooked to the lungi-clad Ranbir hacking the masked men to death one after the other as Arjan Vailly played in the background, heightening the tension and the thrill. That was just one of the gory sequences that the film had. advertisementIn just seven months, another film was released - Kill. It was already made by the time Animal was released. Being advertised as the 'goriest film of India', it was different from Animal in the sense that the masochism was missing, but the gore was indeed in abundance. This film, too, was well-received by the audience. The most recent film that left an indelible mark was the Malayalam film, Marco. Helmed by Haneef Adeni, the Unni Mukundan-starrer raised the bar by several notches. This was no longer a fight where men were shedding blood. From dogs being torn apart to the ear of a human being bitten off to children being hanged and bludgeoned to death to a pregnant woman being hit in the belly so that the baby comes out and then killed - Marco had reportedly made people throw up in theatres. But, its success, especially in the Hindi belt, scripted new history.At the same time, it needs to be noted that not all gory films have seen success. Films like Yudhra and Fateh failed to do well and leave a mark on the audience.WHY IS GORE WORKING ON INDIAN BIG SCREENSThe biggest question that comes to our mind is, why is gore working on the big screens. Sure, the Indian audience has seen gore in Hollywood and South Korean actioners, and even on Indian OTT, but never before has this worked so well in theatres.advertisementMarco actor Unni Mukundan feels that watching something gruesome on the big screen makes the audience, who want to fight back in their lives, feel validated.""I think people always want to fight back in their lives. From a layman to an office-goer to a big shot, everyone has this instinct to fight back and win. When you see a character trying to do the same on a big screen, you feel validated. In Marco, the cruelty and gruesomeness mirror the animal instinct that we all carry,"" Mukundan told India Today Digital in an exclusive interview. He added that on big screen, it becomes a cathartic shared experience. But, why resort to such detailed grisly sequences instead of leaving it to the audience's imagination?Mukunadan feels, ""We have also progressed as a society, we are more exposed. So just cutting off arms - like was shown in Sholay - does not suffice. For a filmmaker, it is now even more difficult to convince the audience. It was easier to make the audience believe earlier, but now we know the tricks behind the magic. So making them believe what is happening is real is a very difficult task and if we have done it, we should be appreciated.""advertisementSenior trade analyst and film critic, Taran Adarsh feels that the fact that OTT made the Indian audience accustomed to gore on small screens is why it might be doing well on the big screens too.""Action has been an integral part of Indian films, right from the 70s and 80s. But, with the advent of OTT, uncensored stuff was shown on screen. What happened was, people got used to the violence. Then, Animal came in between, which had a lot of gore and which shocked the audience. But, people loved it also and the film was a huge success. Then came Kill - again it was a different experience and people loved it. Most recently was the Malayalam film Marco, which also performed well in the Hindi belt,"" Adarsh told India Today Digital.Coming to why such films are doing well, Taran Adarsh opines, ""If something catches on with the audience, be it romance or action, then makers feel that they need to go notches higher.""advertisementNational Award-winning critic, Deepak Dua feels, ""Film with an overdose of bloodshed had not been released for a long time. So, when such films were released, the audience got to see something 'hatke'. For example, Animal was a well-packaged entertainer with great direction and big stars. Kill had a different vibe, but it was also gory.""THE GORE OVERDOSERecently though, there has been such a steep rise in films with an abundance of gruesome sequences that gore seems like a trend that everyone wants to follow. What's the reason for that?Deepak Dua attributes it to the herd mentality that Indian cinema, especially the Hindi film industry, follows.""When a certain kind of film works, people start following it, especially in the Hindi film industry that follows a bhedchaal.

   In just seven months, another film was released - Kill. It was already made by the time Animal was released. Being advertised as the 'goriest film of India', it was different from Animal in the sense that the masochism was missing, but the gore was indeed in abundance. This film, too, was well-received by the audience. The most recent film that left an indelible mark was the Malayalam film, Marco. Helmed by Haneef Adeni, the Unni Mukundan-starrer raised the bar by several notches. This was no longer a fight where men were shedding blood. From dogs being torn apart to the ear of a human being bitten off to children being hanged and bludgeoned to death to a pregnant woman being hit in the belly so that the baby comes out and then killed - Marco had reportedly made people throw up in theatres. But, its success, especially in the Hindi belt, scripted new history.   The most recent film that left an indelible mark was the Malayalam film, Marco.

But, its success, especially in the Hindi belt, scripted new history. At the same time, it needs to be noted that not all gory films have seen success. Films like Yudhra and Fateh failed to do well and leave a mark on the audience.WHY IS GORE WORKING ON INDIAN BIG SCREENS The biggest question that comes to our mind is, why is gore working on the big screens. Sure, the Indian audience has seen gore in Hollywood and South Korean actioners, and even on Indian OTT, but never before has this worked so well in theatres. Marco actor Unni Mukundan feels that watching something gruesome on the big screen makes the audience, who want to fight back in their lives, feel validated. ""I think people always want to fight back in their lives. From a layman to an office-goer to a big shot, everyone has this instinct to fight back and win. When you see a character trying to do the same on a big screen, you feel validated. In Marco, the cruelty and gruesomeness mirror the animal instinct that we all carry,"" Mukundan told India Today Digital in an exclusive interview. He added that on big screen, it becomes a cathartic shared experience. But, why resort to such detailed grisly sequences instead of leaving it to the audience's imagination?Mukunadan feels, ""We have also progressed as a society, we are more exposed. So just cutting off arms - like was shown in Sholay - does not suffice. For a filmmaker, it is now even more difficult to convince the audience. It was easier to make the audience believe earlier, but now we know the tricks behind the magic. So making them believe what is happening is real is a very difficult task and if we have done it, we should be appreciated.""advertisementSenior trade analyst and film critic, Taran Adarsh feels that the fact that OTT made the Indian audience accustomed to gore on small screens is why it might be doing well on the big screens too.""Action has been an integral part of Indian films, right from the 70s and 80s. But, with the advent of OTT, uncensored stuff was shown on screen. What happened was, people got used to the violence. Then, Animal came in between, which had a lot of gore and which shocked the audience. But, people loved it also and the film was a huge success. Then came Kill - again it was a different experience and people loved it. Most recently was the Malayalam film Marco, which also performed well in the Hindi belt,"" Adarsh told India Today Digital.Coming to why such films are doing well, Taran Adarsh opines, ""If something catches on with the audience, be it romance or action, then makers feel that they need to go notches higher.""advertisementNational Award-winning critic, Deepak Dua feels, ""Film with an overdose of bloodshed had not been released for a long time.

An objection has been made against a song featuring Vicky and Rashmika Mandanna. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/chhaava-chhatrapati-shivaji-maharaj-descendants-want-historians-to-pass-vicky-kaushal-film-before-release-2669916-2025-01-25,"Former Rajya Sabha MP Sambhjiraje Chhatrapati, who's also a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, on Friday suggested that the makers of Vicky Kaushal's Chhaava should make the historians watch their film before its release. He informed the media that director Laxman Utekar showed him the trailer recently, after which he told them to get a few historians on board to watch the film to ""address inaccuracies.""  Sambhajiraje, however, mentioned that the makers have not consulted any historians yet. The discussion emerged after a glimpse of a song was seen in the trailer. It featured Vicky and Rashmika Mandanna performing with the 'lezim', a traditional musical instrument representing the Maharashtrian culture.  Speaking to the news agency PTI, the former MP shared that he also told the makers about his wish to watch the film before its release. He said, ""It is commendable the film highlights the life and valiant reign of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. Director Laxman Utekar and his team showed me the movie's trailer. I told them I would like to watch the entire movie before its release.""  He added, ""I also offered to connect them with historians to address inaccuracies to ensure this significant story is presented authentically to audiences worldwide.""    Sambhajiraje went on to mention the use of lezim in a song featuring Vicky and Rashmika. The former MP said he is aware of the makers taking 'cinematic liberties' to make a film look more appealing, but he wants the representation of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj to be 'appropriate' and 'dignified'.  ""However, the filmmakers have not engaged with historians as yet. While the lezim is an important part of our cultural heritage, it is necessary to discuss whether taking such cinematic liberties aligns with the dignity and historical portrayal of Sambhaji Maharaj. Historians and experts should deliberate on the appropriateness of this depiction,"" he explained.  His statements came hours after a few Maratha outfits protested in Pune against the dance sequence in the film. One of the protestors mentioned what Sambhajiraje insisted upon in an interview later: to show the film to the historians and take their 'green signal' before the release.  The protestors further threatened to halt the film's release in Maharashtra unless historians are consulted.  Chhava, also starring Akshaye Khanna, Ashutosh Rana, Divya Dutta and Neil Bhoopalam, among others, is hitting the screens on February 14. It is produced by Dinesh Vija's Maddock Films.

She ultimately goes on to ditch Aman and marries Rahul. Ringing on the same, Kajol wrote, ""Is it bridal season still? Hey I got married onscreen quite a few times and ditched as well!

Here's everything you need to know about this new film. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/sanjay-dutt-to-return-as-gangster-raghu-in-mahesh-manjrekar-vaastav-2-all-you-need-to-know-2669967-2025-01-25,"Actor Sanjay Dutt might just reunite with filmmaker Mahesh Manjrekar for Vaastav 2, a possible sequel to his 1999 hit gangster drama. While there's no official announcement yet, talks are on between Sanjay and Mahesh to convert the film into a franchise 26 years after the release of the film.  A report published in Pinkvilla suggested that the director is still working on the screenplay and once that is locked, he will give a final narration to Sanjay, who is already excited about being on board. The report quoted a source close to the development mentioning that Vaastav 2 is likely to be a two-hero film, and one of the biggest gangster dramas ever made in India.  The source first said, ""It's a franchise film, and not a continuation. Mahesh has cracked an idea that is in sync with the world of Vaastav and has discussed the same with Sanjay Dutt, who is all excited and charged up to play Raghu again. Mahesh is presently working to develop the idea into a screenplay and Sanju is waiting to hear the entire subject.""  While Sanjay Dutt plays the main lead, the makers will be looking for a big name from the younger generation to cast alongside OG Raghu in the film. ""It's a two-hero subject and once the script is locked, Mahesh and his team will look at casting an actor from the younger generation to play the parallel lead,"" the source added.   A final structure for the film's production is yet to be created, but the work has already begun. The year has just started, and the team is expected to finalise the casting by mid-2025, with a hope of getting it on the floor by the end of the year.  Produced by Subhash Kale, Vaastav 2 is being envisioned as an out-and-out commercial cinema with heavy dialogues and entertaining songs. Of course, a lot of action will be seen too.

The actor was speaking during a promotional interview for his film Veda when he was asked to comment on director Imtiaz Ali's expectations of Geet and Aditya 18 years later.  In an interview with Indian Express, Shahid was shown a clip of Imtiaz in which he said that Geet and Aditya would be sitting at a ""divorce lawyer's office"" today. Reacting to the same clip, the 43-year-old said he is no one to question his director's vision if that's what he thinks about Geet and Aditya.  Shahid called it a 'fun idea', and agreed with Imtiaz. ""That's actually a fun idea that Geet and Aditya are now breaking up because they are frustrated with each other. Aditya is like, 'She is her own favourite, who can ever put up with her?'” he said.  The actor added, ""If our filmmaker thinks these two will divorce each other, then who am I to come in between? I am just an actor.""

Earlier, in an exclusive interview with India Today Digital, the filmmaker shared what the film would be about and why he did not name it The Bengal Files. ""I could have called it Bengal Files because the film is about direct action day in Bengal and how the politics of Bengal has influenced India,"" Vivek Agnihotri told India Today Digital during an exclusive interview. He added, ""The reason we called it Delhi Files is because the destiny of India is written in Delhi and not in Bengal. Bengal has suffered because of what happened in Delhi in the 1940s. But yes, the film mostly deals with direct action day, Noakhali and what happened in Bengal."" Speaking further about why he chose this topic for his next film, Agnihotri stated, ""Lots of great things about India have their origin in Bengal. The Bharat Mata that we visualise comes from Banga Mata, the entire movement of nationalism, then the Bengal renaissance. You name a field, and you'll realise that Bengal's contribution is immense. That is why I am concerned about where it is going. Therefore, it is very important to make Bengal Files so that the world knows Bengal's contribution and how it is being destroyed.""

The decision came after his meeting with MNS chief Raj Thackeray. In an official statement released to the media, Utekar shared that it was just a matter of a dance sequence and nothing is bigger than the legacy of the Maratha king.  Chhaava stars actor Vicky Kaushal playing the role of the celebrated Maratha warrior. The trailer of the film was released in Mumbai last week. ""I have met Raj Thackeray. He is an avid reader and studious person. So I have taken some suggestions and guidance from him. And I can say, his words are very helpful for me. And after meeting him, I have decided to delete those scenes where we have shown Sambhaji Maharaj was playing Lezim dance,"" the director said in a statement.  He added that the dance sequence featuring Vicky and Rashmika Mandanna, will be deleted from the film. ""Lezim dance is not a big deal. Sambhaji Maharaj is very much bigger than that Lezim dance. So we are going to remove those scenes from film,"" he said.  Chhaava is based on author Shivaji Sawant's book of the same name. The film highlights the story of Sambhaji Maharaj's valour and his reign after he became the Chhatrapati. Utekar shared that they imagined Sambhaji as a 20-year-old boy in the film. ""When Sambhaji Maharaj launched an attack in Barhanpur, he was just 20 years old. We have taken the rights of Shivaji Sawant's book titled Chhava where he wrote about Sambhaji Maharaj taking part in the Holi festival. He would remove a coconut from the holy fire. We thought of Maharaj as a 20-year-old. It was obvious that he had played the Lezim dance. And why not? Lezim is a part of Maratha culture. It is just our traditional dance. But, if anyone is hurt by those dance moves or Lezim dance, we will remove them. Lezim dance is not bigger than Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj,"" he explained.

He mentioned in a detailed official statement that he imagined the Maratha warrior and king Smabhaji Maharaj as a 20-year-old boy in his film, and therefore, included a sequence showing him celebrating with the 'Lezim dance' after winning a battle. However, something about the same dance sequence didn't go down well with many politicians.  On Sunday, Maharashtra Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis talked to the media in Mumbai and mentioned that the film shouldn't hamper with the legacy of the reverred Maratha king, Sambhaji Maharaj. He talked about the 'distorted history' and said a film made on Chhatrapati should be both 'creative and sensitive'.  ""Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj's history should be shown correctly. It is not right to distort history. Everyone has a lot of love and respect for Sambhaji Maharaj. This respect and honour should not be hurt. There should be creativity (in filmmaking) but we believe that there should be sensitivity along with it,"" he said.  His statement came after several ministers, including former Rajya Sabha MP Sambhjiraje Chhatrapati, who's also a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, suggested that the makers consult historians to avoid 'inaccuracies' in the film. His argument followed the release of the trailer, which featured a glimpse of Vicky and Rashmika Mandanna (who plays the role of Maharani Yesubai) performing the Lezmi dance.    The glimpse was from a song which was shot to capture the celebratory mood in the kingdom of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj following his successful attack on Burhanpur, a wealthy Mughal city in Madhya Pradesh, in 1681. What the descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj said about the song: In his statement to the media, the former MP revealed that he had expressed his wish to watch the entire film when the makers went to show him the trailer. Sambhajiraje said, ""I told them I would like to watch the entire movie before its release. I also offered to connect them with historians to address inaccuracies to ensure this significant story is presented authentically to audiences worldwide.""  He was one of the first people who talked about the media, objecting to the dance sequence in Chhaava. He mentioned the Lezim dance in his statement and said, ""While the Lezim is an important part of our cultural heritage, it is necessary to discuss whether taking such cinematic liberties aligns with the dignity and historical portrayal of Sambhaji Maharaj,"" adding that the makers should consult historians to get their green signal before the release of the film. A few hours before Sambhajiraje's interview, a few Maratha outfits protested in Pune against the same dance sequence in the film. The protestors demanded what the former MP said: show the film to the historians or face consequences. What minister Uday Samant said against the song in Chhava: On Sunday, before director Laxman Utekar met MNS chief Raj Thackeray and announced his decision to cut the dance scene, Maharashtra minister Uday Samant also objected to the sequence and shared a note on X against the release of Chhaava.  He wrote, ""It is a matter of joy that a Hindi film based on the life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the protector of religion and protector of freedom, is being made. Such efforts are necessary to make the world understand the history of Chhatrapati. However, many have expressed their opinions that there are some objectionable scenes in this film. Our position is that this film should not be released without first showing it to experts and knowledgeable people.

Laxman said the song was featured as a part of Holi celebration in the film, and asked if there was any harm in showing Chhatrapati participating in the festivities with a traditional dance.

He said in his statement to the media that the song, which has now been removed, only glorified the culture and helped the audience to understand it better. Laxman said the song was featured as a part of Holi celebration in the film, and asked if there was any harm in showing Chhatrapati participating in the festivities with a traditional dance.  ""When Sambhaji Maharaj launched an attack in Burhanpur, he was just 20 years old. We have taken the rights of Shivaji Sawant's book titled Chhava where he wrote about Sambhaji Maharaj taking part in the Holi festival. He would remove a coconut from the holy fire. We thought of Maharaj as a 20-year-old. It was obvious that he had played the Lezim dance. And why not? Lezim is a part of Maratha culture. It is just our traditional dance. But, if anyone is hurt by those dance moves or Lezim dance, we will remove them. Lezim dance is not bigger than Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj,"" he explained. Chhaava is Bollywood's first film depicting valour and the celebratory stories about Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire, ruling from 1681-689. He was the eldest son of Shivaji Maharaj, and held the reins of the kingdom when everybody thought that the empire was most vulnerable after the death of his father. He was captured and executed in 1688 by the Mughal forces.  Apart from Vicky and Rashmika, Chhaava also features Akshaye Khanna playing the role of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Actors Diana Penty, Ahustosh Rana and Divya Dutta also play important roles in the film. Produced by Dinesh Vijan's Maddock Films, Chhaava is hitting the screens on February 14.

Following the protest, the director said he would delete a dance sequence from the film. He mentioned in a detailed official statement that he imagined the Maratha warrior and king Smabhaji Maharaj as a 20-year-old boy in his film, and therefore, included a sequence showing him celebrating with the 'Lezim dance' after winning a battle.

In a candid conversation with India Today Digital, she shared her thoughts on the pressures of stardom, the challenges faced by today's actors, and the remarkable work of the younger generation. “After Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, Ranbir, Hrithik, and Kartik are definitely carrying the legacy forward, that's it. I feel that's where it might end. They’re the ones truly delivering, and it’s scary to think about what will happen to Bollywood after them,” said Ameesha.  Ameesha also highlighted the immense pressure on Bollywood’s top stars to meet sky-high expectations, “When a Shah Rukh Khan, Sunny Deol, Ajay Devgn, Salman Khan, Ranbir, or Hrithik release a film, there’s this expectation that it has to match up to their previous blockbusters. But realistically, it’s impossible for every film to be a colossal hit. Success like that is rare. Every film can not be a blockbuster."" The actor noted how the industry’s heavy dependence on just a few stars intensifies the burden on them. “If the pressure were more evenly distributed across a wider group, it would be easier. But since it’s concentrated on so few, it’s very challenging,” Ameesha added.  However, she also expressed her admiration for the younger generation of actors breaking barriers, “I think Kartik is fabulous. Ayushmann Khurrana has done some outstanding work, and Rajkummar Rao has broken the mould to become almost like a mainstream hero. Shraddha Kapoor is also doing some great work."" Ameesha applauded Ayushmann and Kartik for carving their own path despite coming from outside the industry. “Ayushmann has taken bold steps—whether it be playing a bald man or dressing as a woman—and made them work. Similarly, Kartik has proven his ability to deliver hits consistently. Hats off to both of them for taking risks and making them count.” Ameesha Patel was recently seen reprising her role as Sakeena in Gadar 2, which released in 2024.Published By: Anvita SinghPublished On: Jan 29, 2025ALSO READ |  Kartik Aaryan, Kabir Khan visit Supreme Court, call it a 'lovely experience'Must Watch

Talking about their early days in Bollywood, Ameesha described how both of them were like “two little buds blossoming together, uncertain of their future.” While acknowledging Hrithik’s preparation and the advantage of belonging to a film family, she praised him for never making her feel like he was the son of the film’s producer-director. “He was just as normal, insecure, and afraid—discussing things with me like any newcomer would,” she said. Their bond, she affirmed, remains irreplaceable. “He knows my flaws and strengths, just as I know his. And that first-time experience—no one can replace it.

Trade expert shares analysisShahid Kapoor's film Deva has received mixed response upon release, raising questions about its future box office performance. Trade expert Ramesh Bala discusses the film's initial reception and potential trajectory in the coming days.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/shahid-kapoor-deva-box-office-prediction-ramesh-bala-2673273-2025-02-01,"Shahid Kapoor’s action-thriller Deva has hit the big screens, but its opening has been met with a mixed response, both critically and commercially. But what does the film's business look like, and will it improve in the coming days? Trade expert Ramesh Bala weighed in on the film’s buzz, box office projections, and the road ahead.

Deva, which was released on January 31, has witnessed an average start at the box office. The film’s Day 1 collection was Rs 5 crore. Bala noted that early reactions to the film have been divided, with some audiences praising it, while others feel it could have been better.

Talking exclusively to India Today Digital, Ramesh Bala said, “The reviews for Deva have been mixed—some positive, some saying it could have been better. We have to wait and see how the audience reacts over the weekend."" advertisementUnlike big-ticket Bollywood films that thrive on pre-bookings, Deva has relied more on walk-in audiences. The film’s advance booking numbers were modest, which was expected for a mass entertainer of this nature.“The pre-booking was nominal around Rs. 2 crore—nothing extraordinary. For a movie like this, walk-ins will play a bigger role, especially on single screens,” Bala shared

The real test for Deva will be its performance over the weekend. Bala emphasised that for the film to sustain, it must show an upward trend on Saturday and Sunday. “If the film is on the right track, Saturday should be better than Friday, and Sunday should surpass Saturday. If the growth is flat or minimal, it could struggle in the long run,” he explained.

According to Bala, Deva’s final box office fate depends on word of mouth. If audiences embrace the film, it could reach Rs 70-73 crore nett. However, if it fails to pick up, it might settle around Rs 50 crore nett. “The weekend trend will be crucial. If word of mouth is strong, it can push towards Rs 70 crore nett. Otherwise, it may stay closer to Rs 50 crore nett,” he predicted.

So far, 2025 hasn’t been a promising year for Bollywood. Apart from Sky Force, which had a decent opening weekend but lost momentum later, no Hindi film has emerged as a clear winner. “We’ll have to wait till the end of the first quarter to see how Bollywood fares. Right now, the industry is facing a slow phase, except for films with major stars,” Bala noted.

The next big film that has the industry’s attention is Sikandar, starring Salman Khan and directed by AR Murugadoss, which will be released on March 27. “Sikandar has a strong buzz, mainly because it has Salman and it releases on Eid. That's one film the audience is early waiting for.""

With Deva’s opening being lukewarm, all eyes are on its weekend performance. If the film can build momentum, it may achieve a respectable total. Otherwise, it could join the list of recent Bollywood films that struggled to make an impact. The next two days will be crucial in determining its fate at the box office.

Meanwhile, the poster of Sky Force stated that the film wrapped up its first week's box office business at Rs 99.7 crore, and the second Friday added Rs 4.6 crore to the overall earnings.  Sky Force opened to a decent response from both the critics and the audiences alike. It marked the Bollywood debut of actor Veer Pahariya, who plays the role of Squadron Leader T Vijayya.

Featuring Arjun Kapoor, Bhumi Pednekar and Rakul Preet Singh in the lead, the film is the story of a trio who is stuck in the past and can't deal with the present as one of them gets amnesia.  Bhumi plays Arjun's bold ex-wife, Prabhleen, who, after getting diagnosed with amnesia, forgets her divorce. Ankur is now involved with Antara (Rakul) and the two try to navigate through Prabhleen's attempt at saving her marriage. That leads Ankur to choose between 'ex-pyaar' and 'current dildaar'. Hence, tons of confusion, laughter and arguments.  The film essentially focusses on the fight between two women to get the attention of a man - a commercial formula being used in Bollywood films since time immemorial. Check out the trailer of Mere Husband Ki Biwi here:    Mere Husband Ki Biwi is directed by Mudassar Aziz, who also helmed Akshay Kumar's Khel Khel Mein last year.  The film seems like a glamorous, romantic and sarcastic take on relationships. It also appears like a dig at people who plan their life in advance and life keeps throwing them a curveball.  At the trailer launch, director Mudassar Aziz spoke about the unfair treatment that comedy films have received in the industry. He underscored the importance of the viewing experience that these movies provide, especially when one is watching a film with the family.  The director said, ""Comedy doesn't get its due in the industry. If you look at the history of Indian cinema and the history of awards in Bollywood, you don't find any comedy films making it big, being remembered as great movies. This, despite the fact that most families love to watch comedy movies when they are together. I think it's only by the grace of God that I can write comedy and entertain people with laughter. Even if it means putting a tiny smile on someone's face. I'll keep making these comedy films as long as I can put a smile on people's faces.""

In 2013, Mohit Suri revived the love sage Aashiqui 2 which starred Shraddha Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur. Earlier in January 2025, there were reports that Triptii Dimri dropped out from the project as the makers felt she was not a good fit for the role.  Her bold scenes in Animal were cited as the reason, with claims that these scenes rendered her unsuitable for Aashiqui 3's traditional portrayal of innocence and purity. However, Anurag Basu told Mid-day, ""That’s not true. Triptii knows it too."" Meanwhile, Anurag is awaiting the release of his next film, Metro In Dino.

The period drama by Laxman Utekar features the two actors playing the roles of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Aurangzeb, respectively.  The film also stars Rashmika Mandanna who plays the role of Maharani Yesubai.  During his recent conversation with Bollywood Hungama, Vicky opened up about his experience of working with Akshaye. “It took Aurangzeb nine years to find and get hold of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. So, a lot of the film shows his quest to find him. There are some moments together (between Vicky and Akshaye), but the film is about them thriving to (meet each other) and that will leave you waiting for that face-off to happen. The muted sliminess and cunningness that he has brought into the character of Aurangzeb has blended beautifully with the roar of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.”  In the same interview, director Laxman revealed that Vicky and Akshaye never met each other before filming their intense face-off. “The day their scene together was to be shot was the day when they met each other for the first time and that too as characters.”  To this, Vicky added that they did not even interact on the sets personally, in order to remain in their character. “When we were shooting that scene, we exchanged no good mornings or goodbyes or hellos. He was Aurangzeb and I was Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and we went straight into shooting the scene. There was no communication as Vicky Kaushal to Akshaye Khanna,” the actor noted.

The film has generated interest due to its striking visuals and catchy songs. However, the Censor Board of Film Certification (CBFC) suggested five modifications before its premiere.  Recent censorship details from CBFC have revealed several significant modifications. The Examining Committee approved the film on January 29 after requesting changes, including blurring brand names for alcoholic products and visuals depicting the middle finger. According to Bollywood Hungama, sensual scenes were heavily scrutinised, with close-ups of a bikini-clad woman removed, and visuals focusing on cleavage and breasts altered. Scenes showing a man's hand moving sensually on a woman's thigh and buttock were also modified. Graphic violence was toned down, including a scene with a man being cut by a woodcutter machine. It is unclear if this is the same sequence shown in the trailer. Additionally, the term ""bi*ch"" was muted in the audio and omitted from subtitles to comply with guidelines.

Ahead of that, let's revisit Love Today, the original from which the film has been remade.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/revisiting-2022-tamil-film-love-today-ahead-of-remake-loveyapa-release-2675372-2025-02-06,"L-O-V-E-yapa yapa!!! While the lyrics of the title track of Loveyapa would make you wonder what they are yap(a)ping, most cine-goers might know exactly what the makers will show in the film. After all, the trailer of Junaid Khan and Khushi Kapoor's big-screen debut film was exactly the same as its original. Well, just in case you were not aware, Loveyapa is the official remake of the 2022 Tamil film, Love Today.  The film turned out to be a blockbuster at a time when its Bollywood counterparts were trying not to flop, earning over Rs 100 crore. Upon its release on Netflix, the film found more viewers (yours truly being one). And while it had its problems, it was a fun watch. But two years later, while so many of us might be wondering what the necessity of this scene-by-scene remake was, let's look back at Love Today and what might (or not) work in Loveyapa's favour.EXCHANGING PHONES - NEW FEAR UNLOCKED Exchanging phones can be one of the biggest fears of modern times. The concept was explored in the 2016 Italian film, Perfect Strangers (the OG from which Khel Khel Mein was remade). Just a year later, Pradeep Ranganathan, who directed Love Today and played the male lead, released a short film called App(a) Lock.  Watch App(a) Lock here:    The 4-minute film is what makes up for Love Today (and Loveyapa) trailer. The girl tries to convince the strict dad that she loves someone. The dad says he is ready to meet the guy and puts just one condition for their marriage - exchange your phones for 24 hours and see if you still want to get hitched. Legit, we would say.  In times when our internet persona is completely different from who we are and trying to live a life that is more mythical than real, exchanging phones can be a perfect way to test what the other person's true self is.PHONE EXCHANGE ENOUGH FOR 2-HOUR FILM Now, that begs the question - how can this concept be turned into a full-fledged film? Simple - discuss all the trials and tribulations that the couple goes through when the phone is unlocked and throw in some memories of their lovey-dovey moments and how they fell in love and a crisis, and viola! You have more than enough content for two hours. Then, there are their family members and their drama too to add. Need we say more? Here is the trailer of Love Today: advertisementHowever, the real test in Love Today came from the crisis. The crisis seems too apt in today's time, especially when deepfake and AI videos have become a menace. In Love Today, a fake adult video of the female lead is circulated. At that point, the male lead, played by Ranganathan, steps in, and lends support to the girlfriend even when her family members lose trust in her and set out to find the truth. He finds the culprit, becomes the boyfriend who will always be with his beloved, even in times of trouble, and proves his worth. Happy ending!WHAT LOVEYAPA MIGHT HIT RIGHT (OR MISS)A major part of Love Today was about the bickering that the couple engaged in, and the fact that, despite realising that none of them were perfect, they accepted each other. The chemistry was there, coupled with good performances.However, Loveyapa has bigger challenges. As a Hindi film, it would inadvertently face more scrutiny as the audience is more critical. If it is a scene-to-scene copy of Love Today (as it seems from the trailer), then it might court controversies with the jokes, often sexist digs, and even the male saviour to the damsel in distress trope. advertisementHere is the trailer of Loveyapa: However, with a different director helming the film (Advait Chandan), many of the loose ends of Love Today might be taken care of to make it a better film that delves deeper into the issue rather than flippantly addressing it. The dialogues, if done well, can also change the fate of Loveyapa. After all, it can make the whole theatre laugh and cry together. However, one department that seems to be a major miss is the chemistry between the leads. So far, Junaid Khan and Khushi Kapoor's chemistry does not look very promising, with many on the Internet claiming that they look more like siblings (Junaid being the older brother, of course).

Or, worse -- mouthing ""Tere sharir mein itna khoon nahi hoga, jitna Ravi Kumar ek baar mein m**t deta hai"" -- only to feel an existential cringe run down your spine, but then do it again nonetheless? Well, my friend, you are not alone. Welcome to Himesh Reshammiya's Expose Cinematic Universe, where the rules of logic don’t apply, cringe is embraced, and the only thing more powerful than Ravi Kumar’s punches and kicks is his self-awareness. Because let’s be honest—Badass Ravi Kumar is so bad that it's good. Himesh has played his ultimate UNO reverse card—he made something absurd, admitted that it was absurd, and in doing so, made it kind of iconic.    And guess what? People aren’t just laughing at it; they’re buying tickets in advance! In fact, the film has outdone the advance booking of Junaid Khan and Khushi Kapoor-starrer Loveyapa, the so-called ""bigger"" release of the week. Trade analysts are even predicting Rs 5 crore opening for Badass Ravi Kumar, compared to Loveyapa’s Rs 1–2 crore.But why is a self-proclaimed ""cringe-fest"" winning over audiences?   Because Badass Ravi Kumar doesn’t pretend to be something it’s not. The film wears its absurdity like a badge of honour. From the promos proudly screaming ""Badass Logic"" to its unapologetic over-the-top action and dialoguebaazi, this is a film that knows exactly what it’s doing. advertisementAnd let's not forget the gore in this film. While others are trying hard to pass the gore as real, this one promises a mass entertainment with exaggerated, CGI blood splatters that are so obviously fake, you can’t even be offended by them. Unlike certain films that try to glorify violence (ahem, you know the ones), Badass Ravi Kumar serves it up with a wink (quite literally).But the real trump card?

Check the early estimates here. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/badass-ravi-kumar-box-office-day-1-estimates-himesh-reshammiya-spoof-film-already-a-winner-2676194-2025-02-07,"When singer Himesh Reshammiya announced the spin-off of his 2014 film, The Xpose, nobody took him seriously. Now that the film has released in theatres, the box office response tells another story altogether. Badass Ravi Kumar finished its advance booking at around 2 crore gross for its opening day by selling around 59,054 tickets, reported the trade website Sacnilk.  The film, which also features Kirti Kulhari and Prabhudeva in important roles, registered the third-biggest pre-sales business for a Hindi film in India this year. While the excitement for this spoof film could be seen on social media ever since the trailer was released, this kind of box office response seemed unprecedented.  It's a film that can't be judged for its lack of sense. In fact, the very thing that it lacks is the only thing that makes it compelling.  As per the early estimates and considering the spot bookings that the film will enjoy today, it is safe to assume that Badass Ravi Kumar will wrap its opening day business in the range of Rs 4-5 crore nett in India. None of Himesh's previous films have ever gone even close to the number at the box office. The earnings could grow exponentially on Saturday-Sunday, since the Indian audience is not usually catered to a spoof on the big screen.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/ameesha-patel-advice-to-newcomers-2676234-2025-02-07,"Actor Ameesha Patel recently shared her thoughts on how the film industry has evolved over the years. In a candid conversation, she reflected on the differences between her generation of actors and the current crop of stars, emphasising the importance of prioritizing on-screen performances over social media presence. Speaking exclusively to India Today Digital, Ameesha said, ""I actually feel that our times were so much more real. And from then to now, actors like us—be it Shah Rukh, Salman, me, Preity, Rani, Kareena—all of us, our focus was on what we did in front of the camera."" Patel believes that today’s actors are more preoccupied with maintaining their image on social media rather than focusing on their craft. ""Whereas today’s generation is more worried about their Instagram portrayal. That is the biggest drawback—they’re not able to draw audiences to buy tickets for them at the box office because they’re more focused on making reels, showing what happens in their makeup van with their makeup artist, their stylist, their entourage. They seem happier being seen at parties than on the 70mm screen,"" she remarked. The actor pointed out that this shift in priorities is evident in the box office performance of newer actors. She compared the longevity of senior actors, such as Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Akshay Kumar, to the struggle of younger stars in pulling audiences to theaters. ""And it's evident from the box office numbers that this is the wrong approach. What we did back then is why today a Salman, a Shah Rukh, a Sunny, an Akshay, an Ajay, a Rani, a Preity, Kareena, and I still draw audiences to theaters. People still want to see us because we never placed so much emphasis on partying or being seen at events. Instagram is a tool, but it’s not our life,"" she stated. According to Patel, the absence of mystery around an actor’s life has also contributed to the lack of star power in today’s industry. ""There’s no curiosity anymore. You can’t be spotted everywhere you go because then the audience stops longing for you. Sometimes, you need to keep away to maintain that intrigue. That’s one of the biggest drawbacks of this generation, in my opinion,"" she added. She also drew comparisons with legendary actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra, noting that they achieved superstardom despite limited media exposure, ""There used to be loyalty to an actor that you don’t see as much now. Look at superstars like Mr Bachchan, Dharmendraji. They didn’t even have TV channels or interviews like this back then, yet people were crazy about them. Their films were released and caused havoc when they hit the big screen."" Patel concluded with a sharp message for today’s actors: “That’s what real cinema is—killing it on the big screen, not on Instagram.”Published By: Anvita SinghPublished On: Feb 7, 2025ALSO READ |  Ameesha Patel calls Kartik, Hrithik 'last of superstars' after SRK, Salman, AamirMust Watch

While Loveyapa was considered the bigger release, Badass Ravi Kumar overshadowed it at the box office on its opening day. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, Loveyapa earned Rs 1.25 crore on its first day at the box office, compared to Badass Ravi Kumar's Rs 2.75 crore. The Advait Chandan-directed romantic comedy managed a total Hindi occupancy of 9.56 per cent, with maximum footfall coming during the night shows. This seems to be a slow start for the film, which was actively promoted by Aamir Khan and endorsed by several industry bigwigs, including Karan Johar. However, it has a chance to grow over the weekend, given the positive response from audiences and film critics.   Keith Gomes' Badass Ravi Kumar took the lead at the box office with a total Hindi occupancy of 17.28 per cent. The film, starring Himesh Reshammiya in the lead role, generated significant buzz ahead of its release, thanks to a quirky trailer and catchy music. India Today’s Sana Farzeen gave the film a 3-star rating. A section of her review read, ""What works in the film’s favour is its sheer honesty and conviction. It may be chaotic and over-the-top, but you enjoy it because the actors are clearly having fun. And it’s not just Himesh or Prabhudeva—seasoned performers like Prashant Narayan, Sanjay Mishra, Johnny Lever, and Rajesh Sharma go full melodramatic in their roles.""

The film, directed by Vinay Sapru and Radhika Rao, has earned over 170 per cent of its original collection in just three days. When it was first released in theatres in 2016, it could hardly perform at the ticket window. However, it found an indelible space in the hearts of the audience, especially the ardent followers of romantic cinema now. In an exclusive chat with India Today Digital, Harshvardhan spoke about the film's re-release and recalled how he felt a void when it could not attract audiences to theatres initially.  The 41-year-old said he feels happier for the producer Deepak Mukut today because he is the one finally getting his due. ""Honestly, my prime motive and goal was to get him that respect. I didn't want the film to do well on the commercial aspect only, but also gain the respect it deserved. He's such a good guy, and an honest producer. I have been praying for him. I think it's all about time, and this time, it was time for him to win,"" he said.  When asked about what he remembered of the time when the film was first released in 2016, the actor smiled and shared, ""That there was a huge void. All of us, from the directors, producers, cast and crew - we were all expecting the film to do well. I can't pretend to say that we were happy. I remember feeling such a void, that's the only emotion I can still recall."" Harshvardhan also elaborated upon the decision to release the film again on its original release date - February 7. He said, ""I am just thankful that, through the years, people gave the film so much love. And this is why I reached out to the makers to release the film on 7 February (the same week as its original release). Even though there were multiple releases, they heard my request, and it's such a big thing for me."" While Sanam Teri Kasam didn't perform well at the box office, it slowly turned into a cult romantic Hindi drama for the audience. When asked if it was a 'bittersweet' feeling to see such contrasting reactions, Harshvardhan said, ""Nothing happened quickly, people also gradually started warming to the film. Only when people keep saying something again and again, do you get validation. It took so many years, but when I understood how serious people were, I felt it was my duty to pass on that message to the makers. I became the bridge between the fans and the producers to get this film back on screen.""   While fans have been demanding a sequel to the film, we also wondered if the actor will also finally get his due with the industry recognising his talent. ""Can you please start a movement? Can you tell people about this,"" Rane asked with a laugh.  But is he expecting the industry to accept him better now? He said, ""Honestly, I am not expecting anything. I am here in this industry to be used as a weapon. I don't want to be the person taking calls. I am rather on the lookout for a marksman who can use me to the extent that I am absolutely consumed and shattered. That's the purpose of this life.""

The film is releasing in theatres on February 14, and is selling tickets fast. As of 6 pm on Monday, the Laxman Utekar-directorial sold over 1 lakh tickets for its opening day at the box office.  The film has already grossed around Rs 3.1 crore and Rs 4.25 crore with block seats, as reported by the trade website Sacnilk. Chhaava has sold its maximum tickets in the Hindi 2D version, and the major part of its business is coming from Maharashtra. That is understandable considering the film explores the life and valour of Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.  While many reports claim that it has already gone past the pre-sales business of Stree 2 for its opening day, there's no official data justifying the same. Chhaava, however, seems to be on a path to registering the best opening for a Hindi film this year. However, there are three more days of advance booking to determine that.  In Chhaava, while Vicky plays the lead role, actor Rashmika Mandanna joins him in the role of queen Yesubai, and Akshaye Khanna plays the role of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Ashutosh Rana, Divya Dutta and Diana Penty are other actors seen in important roles.  The film is produced by Dinesh Vijan's Maddock Films. It is one of the most anticipated period dramas this year.

One notable modification includes altering the dialogue “Mughal sultanat ka zehar” (Mughal empire’s poison). It has reportedly been replaced with a more neutral phrase: “Uss samay, kayi shaasak aur sultanat khud ko zinda rakhne ki koshish kar rahe the” (At that time, many rulers and empires were trying to survive), ensuring a smoother release.

Word of mouth could push its opening weekend to Rs 40–50 crore.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/chhaava-box-office-rs-12-15-crore-opening-for-vicky-kaushal-film-2678695-2025-02-12,"With Vicky Kaushal’s starrer Chhaava set to release on February 14, trade experts are closely watching its advance booking trends. Trade expert Ramesh Bala and theatre owner Vishek Chauhan shared their insights on the film’s pre-sales, box office expectations, and potential hurdles. According to Chauhan, Chhaava should ideally target an opening of Rs 12–15 crore on day one. However, he believes it’s still too early to predict the final numbers. ""Vicky Kaushal is a strong performer, but he’s not at the level where advance sales open exceptionally strong. Having said that, there is movement, but not enough to suggest an extraordinary opening. We should get a clearer picture by Thursday,"" he explained. Ramesh Bala also believes that the film will have a double-digit opening. ""As for expectations—on the first day, a double-digit opening is expected since it’s being projected as a big movie. I’d say somewhere between Rs 10–15 crore."" Currently, advance sales are showing some momentum. In just 48 hours, Chhaava has sold over 2 lakh tickets at PVR Inox alone, signalling a massive opening at the box office. But according to Chauhan, the film’s buzz dipped after the trailer release, largely because its songs failed to make an impact. Adding to the challenge, one song was removed from the film due to controversy over a dance sequence. Given its Marathi-Maratha-centric storyline, Chauhan believes Chhaava might struggle to attract audiences across India. He pointed out that the title itself is a Marathi word and the film is an adaptation of the Marathi novel Chhava. ""The Maharashtra market will be key. If the film secures strong openings there, it could drive the overall numbers, similar to how other films centred around Shivaji Maharaj have performed well in the region,"" he said. Ramesh added, ""The film is about a Maratha warrior, and the Maharashtra crowd seems eager to watch it. There appears to be a strong buzz as the release date approaches. However, it’s too early to predict the final outcome. The audience is currently engaged with re-releases and last week’s new films, so we will get a clearer picture of Chhaava's box office potential closer to the release date. That being said, it is one of the biggest films of 2025, so expectations are high.""   Chauhan and Ramesh believe that, with positive word of mouth, Chhaava could target a Rs 40-50 crore opening weekend. However, they emphasised that anything below Rs 12-15 crore on day one would be disappointing. ""Spot bookings play a major role in every film’s performance, and Chhaava will be no different. If word of mouth is strong, we could see a significant boost in collections post-release,"" Chauhan added. Ramesh concluded, ""If it opens well, it could be in the range of Rs 40-50 crore. However, we’ll have to wait and see how the audience responds this week."" With the release just days away, all eyes are on Chhaava to see if it can defy expectations and register a strong opening. The Maharashtra belt is expected to be the biggest contributor, but whether the film resonates with audiences beyond the region remains to be seen.Published By: Arushi JainPublished On: Feb 12, 2025

During a recent Instagram live session, the singer addressed the ongoing struggle. The film’s delay is due to 120 cuts suggested by the censor board. During his Instagram Live, Diljit spoke in Punjabi about the upcoming film’s release and expressed his hope for an uncut version in India. “I will support only the film that is released fully without any cuts. If you release it without cuts, I will be there; otherwise, it doesn’t matter,” he stated. Dosanjh also emphasised that censoring the film would diminish its impact and defeat its message, adding that he hopes a solution is reached for its release in Punjab. Director Honey Trehan also extended his support to the Good Newwz actor by sharing his clip on Instagram. The filmmaker mentioned that he would also remove his name as the director if the film will release with cuts. Trehan criticised the CBFC's ‘unreasonable and politically coloured’ demands and stated his commitment to his film and team. The movie, based on the life of human rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra, was initially scheduled to release internationally on February 7. However, the release has been postponed, with a new date yet to be announced. The film was also screened for Jaswant Singh Khalra's family in 2022, and sources said they were extremely pleased with it. Panjab 95 is expected to show the life led by Khalra before he was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered tragically by the police. At least six officers had been booked for their involvement in the crime.Published By: Prachi aryaPublished On: Feb 13, 2025ALSO READ  |  Diljit Dosanjh on Panjab 95 facing delays: Truth will finally come outMust Watch

The debutant has been trolled for paid PR as well. His co-star Manish Chaudhary, in an exclusive chat with India Today Digital, discussed the negativity star kids face. He also spoke about how social media and public relations have become an integral part of an actor's life today. The actor said that PR machinery has become a part of the business of entertainment. Talking about Veer, he said, ""He has been very good, and quite interested as a young person coming into the industry. He put in all the efforts required from him, and I really had a very good experience with him. Honestly, beyond a point, I don't have much understanding of how PR works, and I can only talk about him from my personal interactions. We were all there to make a good film, and that's how it all works."" After Sky Force, Manish Chaudhary will now be seen in Vijay Deverkonda's next, which is set to have a pan-India release. He also has a pivotal role in Aryan Khan's directorial debut The Bads of Bollywood. Shah Rukh Khan's eldest son's web show will soon drop on Netflix and stars Bobby Deol and Lakshya in the lead roles. While he admitted that he's not allowed to talk much about the project, the actor shared that he had a wonderful time working with Aryan. Manish shared that the young filmmaker came on set without the baggage of being a superstar's son. ""My experience with him has been absolutely outstanding. He is a wonderful young man. I am working with a few more young directors and all of them have been so wonderful. Because a lot of them also come after proper film education, they are extremely confident on set,"" Manish added. As we further discussed his career, the mention of his first film, Rocket Singh, came up. Reminiscing about his time in the film, the actor said that he always knew Ranbir Kapoor would go on to become a star. Manish also mentioned how the film hardly ran for a week in theatres, and it's only in the last few years that people have started talking about it. Speaking about the same, Manish mentioned, ""The recall value is immense and that is what has held on. Honestly, things did not change for me immediately because the film did not work. Only after about two years, after a hit with Band Baaja Baaraat, did I catch the eyes of commercial producers. I did some projects with Bhatt saab, some really commercially driven films. It did take a little while for the industry to give me a chance, but when it did, it all worked out for the better."" While the actor is known for playing dramatic roles, something that he always aspired to do, Manish said that he would also love to do a comedy role. And when we brought up the fact that he seems to have a fascination with playing characters in uniform, he smiled to say, ""I think it's either me or the makers; it's a two-way street.

Sharing her happiness about the film, Richa said, "" From my experiences of growing up in a middle-class Punjabi household, from my childhood, watching older cousins be set up for arranged marriages, emerged this deeply personal story that I think a lot of families will resonate with. When we graduate from college, we are full of dreams and ambitions.

I think there is currently a dearth of family entertainment. And I think as an actor, my comic timing has been greatly under-utilized. Speaking as a producer, it is a monetisable asset',” she added.

Playing JP Singh allowed me to explore a world where power is defined by intellect, resilience, and quiet heroism. Uzma’s story is a testament to India’s strength and courage, and I’m proud to bring this inspiring journey to life on screen.” The film, directed by Shivam Nair, marks a shift for John Abraham, portraying a character rooted in strategy, intellect, and negotiation, something he has never played on the big screen.

 A special screening of Chhaava was hosted by the makers on Thursday, which was attended by Katrina Kaif, Vicky's parents, and his brother Sunny Kaushal.  India Today's review of Chhaava reads, ""Director Laxman Utekar embarks on this very ambitious journey with an earnest desire, but what seems to be missing in the film is the emotional connect. Thankfully, the second half picks up not just in pace but also gives direction to a somewhat sketchy and all-over-the-place first half. Akshaye Khanna as Aurangzeb has gone the distance to not just look the part with the prosthetic, but he also does a lot of acting through just his kohl-laced eyes."" Besides Vicky Kaushal, Chhaava also stars Rashmika Mandanna and Akshaye Khanna in supporting roles.

His intense prep, physical transformations, and emotional depth make history compelling on screen, cementing his legacy in Bollywood.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/vicky-kaushal-master-of-period-dramas-perfect-chameleon-chhaava-sam-bahadur-sardar-udham-2680500-2025-02-15,"""What can this man not do?"" - this thought lingers as you sit through the two-hour-and-35-minute-long Chhaava, watching Vicky Kaushal seethe with anger, display emotional vulnerability, unleash powerful war cries (his forte since 2019’s Uri), and deliver intense dialoguebaazi as he stares death in the face. Honestly, you endure Laxman Utekar’s Chhaava, a historical drama based on the life and valour of Maratha emperor Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, largely because of its leading man — Vicky Kaushal. But Chhaava is not the first film where Kaushal completely disappears into his role. His performances in Sardar Udham (2021) and Sam Bahadur (2023) showcased his ability to embody historical figures with remarkable authenticity. ""His craft of transformation is always immaculate,"" filmmaker Shoojit Sircar once said about the 36-year-old, who brought his ""dream project"", Sardar Udham, to life in 2021. The film narrated the story of the revolutionary who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

 



Vicky Kaushal in a still from Chhaava.
 History isn’t always the most exciting thing to watch on screen. But what is exciting is a great actor embodying a compelling character — someone with layers of complexity and an inner world that keeps you hooked. And that’s exactly what Kaushal does. He makes himself accessible to audiences and brings gravitas to real-life figures. Whether it’s Sardar Udham, Sam Bahadur, or now Chhaava, the actor transforms historical narratives into immersive cinematic experiences. In Sardar Udham, Kaushal seamlessly transitions from a 20-year-old youngster to a brooding revolutionary at 40. His physical transformation mirrored his character’s emotional evolution — he lost 14 kilos and regained it to reflect Udham Singh’s journey. ""There was a lot of physical and mental prep that went into the role,"" he told GQ India. He also tapped into Udham Singh’s long-held grief and rage—emotions the revolutionary carried for 21 years before exacting his revenge.

 



Vicky Kaushal in Sardar Udham.
 That same dedication extended to Sam Bahadur (2023). Vicky didn’t just imitate India’s first Field Marshal, Sam Manekshaw—he lived the part. He spent 3-4 years preparing, studying Manekshaw’s mannerisms, body language, and speech patterns. But beyond external mimicry, he immersed himself in the mindset of a military leader, undergoing intense military drills to internalise Manekshaw’s discipline. At Sahitya AajTak 2023, Vicky explained the depth of research that went into shaping the character: ""When this journey started, research was very important because he (Manekshaw) had a certain walk and a way of speaking. I read and watched his interviews, videos, books, and interacted with his family. After 3-4 years of work, I tried adapting the tonality and his walk, so that nowhere in the film could one find my voice.""

 



A still from Vicky Kaushal's Sam Bahadur.
 In Chhaava, where he plays warrior king Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, Kaushal once again pushes his physical and emotional boundaries. He bulked up to over 100 kgs to look the part but didn’t stop there — he also learned horse riding and sword fighting to add authenticity to the role. His preparation translates effortlessly on screen. Even when the film’s flawed screenplay wavers, Vicky's presence keeps you engaged. His resilience in the climactic sequences is what makes Chhaava’s ending bearable. So, what makes Vicky Kaushal the perfect fit for period dramas? His obsessive commitment to research, his ability to immerse himself in character, and his emotional depth. He doesn’t just play historical figures—he becomes them. His appeal as a pan-India star is rooted in his ability to make history accessible, engaging, and deeply human. From being a you-know-his-face-but-not-name-guy to one of Bollywood’s most reliable leading men, Vicky Kaushal has come a long way. His ability to breathe life into historical characters makes him the go-to choice for period dramas. With Chhaava, he adds another name to his growing list of unforgettable portrayals. And given his track record, it’s clear that history—and cinema—will continue to remember him.Published By: Arushi JainPublished On: Feb 15, 2025Must Watch

At the outset, their ability to display a wide range of emotions. Another, perhaps, is their skill to play off their peers. Yet another and unarguably, their ability to be so convincing in their character that one fails to notice the real face behind the reel persona. So, when the end credits roll, and you see their names, you can't help but wonder, 'Where did he come? What role did he play?' This is what happened as I sat through Chhaava's ending and saw Akshaye Khanna's name in the credits. Honest confession: I completely missed out on the promotional material of the film that revealed him playing the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Akshaye, whose excellence in his craft is well known, delivered a nuanced portrayal of Aurangzeb, someone who would put kingship above kinship and wouldn’t hesitate to kill a family member or two for power. His understated menace provided the perfect counterbalance to Vicky Kaushal’s fiery, war-driven energy.

 



Akshaye Khanna as Aurangzeb in Chhaava.
 Aurangzeb has long been a fascinating figure in Indian cinema, much like the Mughal Empire itself. Its royal courts, adorned with delicate ornaments, luxuriant drapes of gold, green, and red, and expansive courtyards with lush green gardens, have made filmmakers frequently reimagine this period, portraying emperors in different shades - from the austere disciplinarian Akbar in Mughal-e-Azam (1960) to the romantic, visionary Akbar in Jodhaa Akbar (2008). Chhaava adds to this lineage, offering yet another cinematic interpretation of Mughal history - this time through the eyes of its most feared emperor. Aurangzeb, as one of the most controversial rulers of the Mughal era, has been explored by filmmakers in different shades, from ruthless tyrant to strategic leader.advertisementEarlier, several historical period dramas have explored Aurangzeb, who ruled India for nearly 50 years from 1658 to 1707 and took the throne after imprisoning his father Shah Jahan and having his elder brother killed. In Shyam Benegal's acclaimed TV series Bharat Ek Khoj (1988), Om Puri delivered a remarkable performance as haughty Aurangzeb. He perfectly captured the character's complexities.  Chhaava adds to this lineage, offering yet another cinematic interpretation of Mughal history - this time through the eyes of its most feared emperor. Aurangzeb, as one of the most controversial rulers of the Mughal era, has been explored by filmmakers in different shades, from ruthless tyrant to strategic leader. Earlier, several historical period dramas have explored Aurangzeb, who ruled India for nearly 50 years from 1658 to 1707 and took the throne after imprisoning his father Shah Jahan and having his elder brother killed. In Shyam Benegal's acclaimed TV series Bharat Ek Khoj (1988), Om Puri delivered a remarkable performance as haughty Aurangzeb. He perfectly captured the character's complexities.    Actor Ashutosh Rana, who we see as Hombirrao Mohite, Sambhaji's uncle in Chhaava, took up the menacing character of Aurangzeb in MX Player’s 2021 web series Chhatrasal. In the 20-episode historical drama, which revisits Maharaja Chhatrasal’s battle for Bundelkhand, Rana aced as a ruthless usurper.  Rana, in an interview earlier, explained that the biggest challenge in playing a historical character is, “that people have already read about that character and have formed his/her image in their head. An actor never knows of that image, so meeting that expectation of the audience is tough.”  In his opinion, an actor has to focus not only on the physical persona of a historical character but also on the emotional, spiritual, psychological and social persona. “All that needs to be done is to get the psyche of a character right,” explained Rana who tried to understand the basic nature and instinct of Aurangzeb before playing it on-screen. Actor Yatin Karyekar won the audience’s hearts with his portrayal of Aurangzeb in Marathi shows, Swarajya Saudamini Tararani and Raja Shivchhatrapati. In Chhaava, Akshaye Khanna’s interpretation of Aurangzeb is both chilling and commanding. While the film primarily focusses on the valour of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj (played by Vicky Kaushal), Akshaye ensures that Aurangzeb is not reduced to a one-dimensional villain. Instead, he embodies the emperor’s calculated ruthlessness with measured intensity. His silence, alone, is explosive. 

 



Akshaye Khanna's Aurangzeb lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. 
 As you walk out of the theatre, thinking about Chhava's unimpressive dialogues, you still end up thanking the writers for letting Akshaye emote through his face, not his words.  At one moment, when Diana Penty as Zinatunissa, the feisty daughter of Aurangzeb, seems to be reading from a teleprompter about how Sambhaji is refusing to give in to their torture, Akshaye leaves more impact by just munching on grapes and indicating to go for Sambhaji's eyes next. His expression sends a chill down your spine thinking - what next.  300 years after his death, Aurangzeb continues to be a subject of intrigue in Indian historical dramas, often depicted as a tyrant, a zealot, or a ruthless strategist who placed power above kinship. While several actors have taken on the role, Akshaye Khanna’s restrained, quietly menacing portrayal in Chhaava stands out as one of the most compelling in Indian cinema. Ironically, Vicky Kaushal was once set to portray Aurangzeb in Karan Johar’s now-shelved Takht. But fate had other plans, leading to Akshaye's masterclass in restraint. His self-contained stillness is his greatest weapon, exemplified in the opening sequence where he surprises both his courtiers and the audience - not by celebrating Shivaji Maharaj’s death but by coldly announcing state-wide celebrations. Akshaye's Aurangzeb lingers in my mind long after the credits roll, proving that sometimes, the most fearsome rulers don’t need to scream wildly - they just need to exist.Published By: Arushi JainPublished On: Feb 17, 2025ALSO READ |  The Perfect Chameleon: What makes Vicky Kaushal master of period dramas

Actor Rajkummar Rao, who recently watched the film, expressed his admiration for the historical drama. In his review shared on Instagram, he praised Vicky Kaushal, saying he deserves all the appreciation he is receiving for the film. The Stree actor also commended director Laxman Utekar, the cast, music composer AR Rahman, and producer Dinesh Vijan. Sharing a poster of Chhaava on Instagram, he showered praise on Vicky Kaushal.

 Vicky Kaushal reacted to Rajkummar Rao's praise with gratitude, writing, ""Thank you so much Bhai!"" along with a heart emoji.  India Today's review of the film reads, ""Director Laxman Utekar embarks on this very ambitious journey with an earnest desire, but what seems to be missing in the film is the emotional connect. Early on we watch a long, tiresome introductory scene of Chhaava that is over-choreographed to look like it wants to ace Gerard Butler's now-plagiarised-by-all scenes from the iconic film, 300 -- the slow-mo shots with blood dripping, close-up frames of his fiery eyes and, of course, a lot of sword fights and hand-to-hand combat."" Directed by Laxman Utekar, Chhaava is a historical drama about the life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Vicky Kaushal plays the role of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, while Rashmika Mandanna portrays Yesubai Bhonsale. The film also features Akshaye Khanna, Ashutosh Rana, and Divya Dutta in significant roles.Published By: Anisha RaoPublished On: Feb 17, 2025ALSO READ |  The Perfect Chameleon: What makes Vicky Kaushal master of period dramasMust Watch

After earning Rs 116.5 crore over its first weekend, the film passed the first Monday test. The historical drama earned Rs 24 crore on Monday (17 February).

According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the film had an overall Hindi occupancy of 31.62 per cent, with the maximum footfall during night shows. Pune has shown strong occupancy at 70.25 per cent across 687 shows, while Mumbai follows with 52 per cent across 1,407 shows. The National Capital Region (NCR) recorded 18.25 per cent occupancy across 1,341 shows. Chhaava's total box office collection after four days stands at Rs 140.50 crore in India.

The romantic drama has gained a newfound popularity among the audience, and that seems to be translating into numbers. So much so that the film is now inching towards Rs 50 crore nett collection by the end of its second run at the ticket window.  Directed by Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru, Sanam Teri Kasam collected Rs 26.4 crore in its first week after re-release. The collections dropped in the second weekend, which was also expected considering the grand release of Chhaava in theatres on February 14. However, the film still maintained a decent pace and is currently standing at Rs 30.95 crore nett after 11 days in India.

Total: Rs 30.95 crore (approx)
 During its original run in 2016, the film only collected around Rs 10 crore nett in India. Add the existing Rs 30.05 crore to the original total, and it has already earned in the range of Rs 40 crore nett at the domestic box office.  Sanam Teri Kasam will easily collect around Rs 10 crore more to take its nett collection to cross the benchmark of Rs 50 crore nett in India. It will also surpass Tumbbad re-release soon. The Sohum Shah film collected Rs 32 crore nett in India during its second innings and Sanam Teri Kasam will go past this figure in no time.  Meanwhile, the film's directors are elated with the response from the audience.

In 'Aitraaz', which was released in 2004, Priyanka played a femme fatale role when women were only imagined as good-ideal wives and lovers on-screen.  While talking about the same in his announcement post, Ghai appreciated Chopra for agreeing to do a role which no other actor dared to.  He wrote, ""BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL

In a press release, FWICE emphasised the film’s historical significance and the need for wider audience reach. “The Hindi movie Chhaava depicts the incredible story of sacrifice, bravery, selflessness, and sense of duty of the legendary Maratha child Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. The movie is applauded by all age groups, and youth is greatly influenced by the story depicted in the movie,” FWICE stated.  They added, “We appeal that the movie reaches a wider audience, as the legacy and courage of this great Maratha king should be known to the generations to come. Our government strongly believes in ‘Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitah’. This movie portrays exactly the same sentiments through the life story of the great Maratha King Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.” FWICE confirmed that they have formally addressed the Chief Minister, urging him to grant Chhaava tax exemption status. “We strongly believe that the movie should reach out to people not only in Maharashtra but across the nation,” the statement concluded. Chhaava, directed by Laxman Utekar, stars Vicky Kaushal as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. Bankrolled by Maddock Films, Chhaava also features Akshaye Khanna, Rashmika Mandanna, Ashutosh Rana, and Diana Penty in pivotal roles.advertisementPublished By: Trisha BhattacharyaPublished On: Feb 18, 2025

In an interview with News18, Kirti Kulhari shared that she was shocked when she was approached for Badass Ravi Kumar. Recollecting her experience from the set of the movie, the Pink actor said, ""Himesh and I exist in parallel worlds. How can they ever meet? I remember there were a few dialogues and I wanted to improve them, add something to them, remove something or say them differently, and he told me no."" She continued, ""It was almost like take it or leave it but this is what it is. He made it clear that if I say yes to the film, I’ll have to do things his way or not do the film at all.

There would be moments where I would go, ‘Why am I doing this? Do I belong here?’ But after a point, I was like a little child in awe of everything that was happening on that set. I was at a certain level and the world of Badass Ravi Kumar was up there. Earlier, I used to look down upon the world of commercial, mainstream Bollywood. I would totally judge these films because they’re so different from how I see cinema.""

The romantic drama, which hit the screens earlier this month, has surpassed this figure by collecting around Rs 31.9 crore nett in 12 days.  'Sanam Teri Kasam' re-release is showing a decent pace at the box office right now, which was also expected with 'Chhaava' hitting the screens on a solid note.

 Interestingly, this is the highest that any Bollywood re-release has achieved at the box office so far.

The directors of the film, Vinay Sapru and Radhika Rao, in an interview with India Today, revealed that the studio didn't back the film despite it showing a steady performance even on weekdays. However, they agreed that the film's newfound popularity has taught them that their conviction in its story and faith in the audience are still intact after nine years.

She also mentioned how it's highly likely for the audience to be totally surprised by the film's story once it releases online.

The film, directed by Advait Chandan, was written by Sneha Desai of 'Laapataa Ladies' fame. In an exclusive interview with India Today Digital, she elaborated on the box office response of the film, and mentioned that 'Loveyapa' is not a conventional romantic drama, and it might just find a wider audience on digital platforms.  Desai underscored the importance of creative response over numbers while gauging a film's overall performance. She said, ""Box office numbers don’t always tell the full story of a film’s impact. 'Loveyapa' is a fresh, unconventional take on romance that caters primarily to Gen-Z and millennials, who relate deeply to its humour, sarcasm, and modern take on love, nanoships and infidelity.""  She added, ""However, because it is a unique style of rom-com, a remake at that, one that doesn’t necessarily follow the traditional Bollywood formula, it may take time for a wider audience to fully connect with it."" When asked to highlight the reasons behind the dull response to 'Loveyapa' at the ticket window, Desai said, ""There is also a tremendous change in the way audiences are now consuming content. There is stiff competition from OTT platforms and simply no formula works.: The screenwriter shared that the audience probably couldn't warm up to a fresh take on Bollywood love stories. ""People prefer to watch larger-than-life portrayals on screen and lesser-mounted films on OTT. Maybe a lot of people were shy of sampling the film in cinemas for this reason. It might just open to great numbers when we arrive on digital platforms. But the gratifying thing is that everyone who has seen it has come out pleasantly surprised with the film and performances,"" she explained.    But, don't they say that if a film has a good story, it will work for the audience? Then what went wrong in the case of 'Loveyapa'? Desai highlighted the significance of other elements that give the audience a successful theatrical experience. The writer went on to say, ""A good story is always key to a film's success, but audience reception also depends on factors like relatability, marketing, and perception. In the case of 'Loveyapa', the story itself is quite different from traditional Bollywood romances, it's more modern, dialogue and situation driven, and reflective of how younger generations approach relationships today.""  She continued, ""The humour, sarcasm, and tone are tailored to a younger audience, which means it might not immediately click with everyone, especially those expecting a more conventional rom-com structure."" Desai also recalled that 'Loveyapa' didn't have the presence of a well-established star, despite being backed by superstar Aamir Khan. Junaid, who is the superstar's son, is too new to the screen to pull off a film on his own.  The writer shared, ""In today's landscape, where films with massive theatrical pull often feature well established stars, it can also be challenging for a newcomer-led film to attract large footfalls in its initial days."" Desai said 'Loveyapa' has also received love and appreciation from a section of people who found it surprisingly refreshing. She said there are lessons to learn from how the audiences receive a film, and the team has learnt their lesson this time.  ""That being said, many viewers have connected with 'Loveyapa' and appreciated its fresh take on romance, while others may not have found it to their taste. We respect the dictum and prefer to grow from the lessons learnt,"" she shared.  Desai said she is hopeful about 'Loveyapa' getting its due with its digital release soon. ""Like many films that start with mixed reactions, it has the potential to grow on audiences over time. With streaming and digital platforms providing a second life to films, 'Loveyapa' has a chance to find an even wider audience in the coming weeks and months,"" she highlighted.  'Loveyapa' also featured Ashutosh Rana, Grusha Kapoor and Kiku Sharda, among others. The film dealt with the themes of dating and relationships in the digital time. It also featured a strong commentary on social media's impact on Gen-Z. Published By: Vineeta KumarPublished On: Feb 19, 2025Read more |  Exclusive: Taapsee Pannu in Subhash Ghai's Aitraaz 2?

In an exclusive chat with India Today Digital, Sapru spoke about the industry's reliance on formula-driven content and the significance of originality. He also spoke candidly about the need for change and his vision for storytelling. When asked about a risky idea the industry isn’t ready for, Sapru pointed out Bollywood’s reluctance to embrace fresh narratives. ""We have two film announcements coming up because we are in the universe of love—the universe of Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru. We will be coming up with a film every Valentine, which is going to be our universe of love, from the makers of Sanam Teri Kasam,"" he revealed. Sapru emphasized his and Rao’s expertise in young romance and heartbreak stories, a genre they have consistently excelled in. ""There are a lot of directors who make great comedies, a lot who make great action films and romantic films. And then there are directors like us, who make very good young heartbreak love stories. That is our genre—we specialize in it. Whether it’s our songs or our movies, this is the world of young romance and young love, what you call young adults. And that is where we are, it is our zone,"" he said. Highlighting the timeless appeal of their storytelling, Sapru added, ""Now Sanam Teri Kasam has worked, everyone would now want to make a love story. There is no soul connection at all. Just like some filmmakers are connected to great action films, for us, our soul connects with young adult love stories. That is why our style won’t go out of fashion in 10 years' time. Our moments don’t look outdated. Just imagine it's a 10-year-old film (Sanam Teri Kasam), it doesn't look outdated to anybody. Just now, someone watched a scene of ours in a theater—where a character breaks a wine glass in pain—and they felt that same emotion, breaking the glass in real life. These emotions don’t get dated. Every genre has a space in this industry, and every story has its own place. You just have to make the film. Now, Animal worked so everyone wants to make an action film like that. Horror is working so that is a new trend. One should understand there is space for everything and everything can work."" Sapru expressed his concern over Bollywood’s dependence on formulas, urging filmmakers to focus on soul-driven storytelling rather than calculated trends. ""I think the only trend Bollywood should get done with is making formulaic films. There is no formula, there is no arithmetic to making films. It should not be like let's put six kinds of music in the film, some action scenes, and big dialogues, this formula that they use has to stop. Music, dialogues, storytelling—it all needs to have soul,"" he asserted.advertisementQuoting legendary filmmakers, he stressed the importance of originality, saying, ""Prakash Mehra, Manmohan Desai, Raj Kapoor—they all made films that came from their hearts, from their own soul connections. That’s what we need to bring back. We should break the formulaic trend and focus on real storytelling.""

Sapru, who has produced numerous music videos and films, made his stance clear. ""Every hero is delivering these big, big dialogues in films. But why? Because someone else did it before? Salman did it in some films, so now every film must have the same big dialogue? That doesn’t work. You cannot recreate emotions by copying them,"" he remarked. Rejecting the idea of blatant recreations, he emphasised, ""There is nothing called recreation. When we work on songs or films, it’s always about originality. It’s about getting inspired and then creating something fresh. You cannot sit with a copy of a film on your TV screen, watching it, and then writing from it. No. Shut your eyes, disconnect, and write from your heart. If you start making films by adding 1+1, it will never work,"" he concluded.

Toot ke wapas joodna sikh gaya hoon (I have learnt to rebuild myself after being broken time and again). The last 30 minutes of Chhaava left an impact on audiences as they saw Kavi Kalash and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj being tortured by Aurangzeb's forces. Amid this, their poetry jugalbandi tugged heartstrings as they expressed their undying love and loyalty towards each other. Calling it his favourite sequence, Vineet Kumar Singh shared how something magical and divine happened on the day they shot it.advertisement

 ""It's all thanks to Laxman Utekar sir (director). When we were at the narration, he had briefed us exactly the same way. From how their pitch would grow louder as they go apart, to the pain and love. He knew what he wanted, and got us to do the same. On the day of the shoot, something happened, some divinity or magic. The brotherhood that I shared with Vicky since Gangs of Wasseypur translated on screen. It just seemed that we were destined to do this together. I never knew that poetry could be part of a climax, and have such an impact. It's nothing short of a miracle,"" the actor shared. While Chhaava is quickly inching towards the Rs 200 crore mark, Vineet Kumar Singh says that box office numbers are no longer important to him. ""Itni chhote lagi hai ke ab dard bhi nahi hota (I have been hurt so many times, that I no longer feel pain). I trained so hard for Mukkabaaz... apart from acting, I also co-wrote it, but it could only get a small release, and was soon out of theatres. Over the years, people may have given it a lot of love, but it could not work back then. With Chhaava, of course, I was confident given how the film was made and Maddock's plans to release it. As an actor, all that you can do is put in your work with full honesty. The rest it's all destiny.""

 Talking further about his experience, Vineet shared how he was the director's first choice, and he did not even have to audition for the film. He added that Utekar had thorough knowledge about the subject, making it easier for actors to just follow his vision. He also thanked Irshad Kamil for the words he wrote for Kavi Kalash that left such an impact. ""And added to that, AR Rahman's background score. I went for theatre visits and was left overwhelmed and speechless with the amount of love Chhaava was getting,"" he added. The actor will soon be seen in Superboys of Malegaon, another biggie at the start of the year. Singh added, ""A lot of people call me Mukkabaaz as they do not know my name. I am hopeful that things will change after these films, as they are both such different and strong parts. I feel blessed that God has empowered me to become someone else each time I take up a project.""

He discussed the dark theme of the film, and answered if it is a hundred per cent honest portrayal. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/sudipto-sen-brings-charak-an-unsettling-story-of-blind-faith-and-human-sacrifice-in-bengal-exclusive-2682473-2025-02-19,"Director Sudipto Sen, known for 'The Kerala Story' and 'Bastar: The Naxal Story', is back with his next, titled 'Charak'. This time, his film is set in West Bengal, and comments on blind faith and religious acrimony. Sen, in an interview with India Today Digital, explained the entire concept of the film, the festival in Bengal which allegedly requires human sacrifice to cure infertility, and why he decided to turn a producer with this film.  Before we discussed his thoughts behind 'Charak', we got to have an exclusive glimpse of the trailer. The film is set in a village where the preparations for a yearly festival are taking place. However, hell breaks loose as two children go missing, and one of them is found dead later. The trailer proceeds to show disturbing images of cult practices, black magic and mutilated bodies. The theme of his film appeared dark and Sen called it the 'truth'.  The director talked about exploring the disconcerting experience of his film, and highlighted the need to have a clear demarcation between faith and blind faith.  He said, ""As an artiste, I am very careful about bringing a story to the light without compromising on the cinematic values, and 'Charak' is exactly that. It is a very important story because it shows you the difference, that thin line between faith, belief and your understanding and education. It shows you where to stop while filtering things through your faith and through science.""  He mentioned that his film is rooted in Indian culture, especially Bengal: ""This is an interesting story to tell because 'Charak' has a lot to do with Bengali culture, Bengali modernism and Bengali realism.""  The director said 'Charak' is based on a two-page short story by a young Bengali writer. When asked why he decided to venture into film production with this story and open 'Sipping Tea Cinema', Sen said, ""We nurtured, brainstormed and realised that this could be the film which I should take to the world to tell that, 'See, this is the film I wanted to make, but you did not let me make'. So, I produced it."" Sen's previous works, 'The Kerala Story' and 'Bastar: The Naxal Story' were questioned and judged for their stories. While the former was called Islamophobic by a section of people, the other was criticised for sensationalising the violence and struggles faced by the people of Bastar without addressing the root causes of the insurgency. Can 'Charak', which is made by the same team, be considered an honest story then?  Sen said, 'yes': ""It is 100 per cent honest. We are not telling anything which is not true. For the Bengali Bihari civil societies, Charak is the main festival. It is a true story."" ""At the core of Charak is the concept of faith,"" he highlighted, adding, ""Faith is something which makes a common man do uncommon things. It is something which creates and destroys at the same time. And most importantly, faith is that need, that foundation which holds India, the oldest civilisation in the world, which holds the 78,000-year-old civilisation of our country.""  He went on, ""Charak is a testimony of that concept of faith where people go through unthinkable and unbelievable rituals, which question your integrity as a civilised human being."" What about sensationalising these stories? What is the aim here: to sensitise the audience or to titillate them? Sen said the idea is to present the truth, as brutally and formally as possibly.  ""I like the truth to be told. Tell the truth or go out of the way. I don't like to be politically correct. I don't like to shy away or move away from the dark reality and keep people in that darkness. That is exactly what politicians do. They don't tell you the truth. They don't tell you what you should know. I am not that politically correct director. I think a filmmaker's job is to take their audience to the core of reality. If it is dark, then let it be dark. If it is disturbing, let it be disturbing. But I shall not deviate from the truth,"" he explained.  Sen went on to say, ""Truth is the only driving force for me. I will keep doing that even if that makes me a dark filmmaker. I would love to be a dark filmmaker. You will not get anything but truth in my film.""  'Charak' is a hard-hitting portrayal of a man's blind faith. Human sacrifices are banned under law but Sen's film shows that the brutality continues.

However, crafting a historical film comes with its own set of challenges. Director Laxman Utekar once spoke about the delicate balance filmmakers must maintain while crafting such period dramas. In an earlier interview with India Today Digital, Utekar reacted to controversy and accusations that filmmakers face for distorting facts while taking creative liberties. The director acknowledged that creative liberties are often necessary to enhance storytelling but emphasised the responsibility of filmmakers to remain respectful of historical facts. ""The audience is never wrong. If you're portraying a warrior and a queen, and you insert a romantic song, people may question it—wondering how these figures, who spent their entire lives fighting for the country, could have had time for romance. That's when fingers start pointing. But if you can truly justify the life of the warrior, the audience will appreciate it. This is exactly what we’ve aimed for with Chhaava,"" he told us. Laxman also shared his opinion on challenges that often come while making a period drama. ""If your research is thorough, if your pre-production is solid, and as a director, you have a deep understanding of the era and the characters, then it becomes quite easy. Without that knowledge, it can be very difficult,” the filmmaker who has helmed films like Mimi, Zara Hatke Zara Bachke said. In January 2025, Chhaava sparked controversy over the dance sequence after several Maharashtra ministers objected to it. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis addressed the media in Mumbai, stating that the film should not tamper with the legacy of the revered Maratha king. ""Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj's history should be shown correctly. It is not right to distort history. Everyone has a lot of love and respect for Sambhaji Maharaj. This respect and honour should not be hurt. There should be creativity (in filmmaking), but we believe that there should be sensitivity along with it,"" he said. Following the backlash, the film’s director, Laxman Utekar, decided to remove the sequence. In a statement, he said the song, which has now been deleted, was meant to glorify Marathi culture and help audiences understand it better. Chhaava released in theatres on February 14. The movie, also starring Rashmika Mandanna and Akshaye Khanna in key roles, celebrates the valour of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.Published By: Prachi aryaPublished On: Feb 20, 2025ALSO READ  |  Vicky Kaushal on Chhaava row: Lezim dance was to take our culture globalMust Watch

Meanwhile, the maximum collection of 'Chhaava' is coming from Maharashtra, where most theatres in Mumbai, Pune and Nashik are registering a 90 per cent occupancy.

199b337e-3ca4-4d17-9962-e28f8472d237,"Chhaava's war scenes: Spectacle without soulChhaava, led by Vicky Kaushal, delivers relentless, violent war sequences that lacks emotional depth, making battles exhausting rather than engaging. Unlike Bajirao Mastani and Jodhaa Akbar, which balanced spectacle with storytelling, Chhaava overwhelms with its brutal scenes.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/chhaava-vicky-kaushal-war-scenes-2683832-2025-02-22,"Early in Chhaava, we meet Vicky Kaushal as Maratha Emperor Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, launching a ferocious attack on the Mughals. As a one-man demolition machine, he battles and eliminates hundreds of kohl-eyed Mughal soldiers single-handedly, all while his Maratha troop waits in the wings. Amid the action, he even pauses to save a Mughal child before wrestling a lion—ultimately breaking its jaw and emerging from a deep pothole, despite it being a trap with no visible escape. The movie is 155 minutes long, and I would guess that at least 100 of those minutes, maybe more, are dedicated specifically and graphically to the details of the war and torture of Sambhaji Raje. This makes it one of the most violent historical dramas in recent memory. Having watched Bajirao Mastani, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, Padmaavat, and Jodhaa Akbar, I expected Chhaava to deliver intense battle scenes, but not in an overwhelmingly brutal, relentless manner. As the film unfolds, its overpowering, ultra-violent war sequences, stacked one after another, without a moment to recover, become exhausting.   Walking out of the theatre, I couldn't help but think of Jodhaa Akbar and Bajirao Mastani, two films that handled war sequences with greater finesse, emotional depth, and cinematic grandeur. More on them later. However, a film should be judged on its own intentions rather than what we wish it should have been. To understand Utekar's style of presenting war scenes and what goes into the making of battle scenes, India Today Digital spoke to Om Raut, who has directed period dramas like Tanhaji and Adipurush.  He noted, ""It (Chhaava's war scenes) kind of suits Laxman Utekar's storytelling and his language of cinema, and it's a very distinct style. He focuses a lot on the foreground actors.""  Raut agreed that it was ""one vs plenty"" in Chhaava as he interpreted the film's action scenes saying, ""His (Utekar) wars are very suffocating, where the protagonist is surrounded by a lot of people. It is one versus plenty because he (Sambhaji Raje) was a lion. So, I think that aspect of the character has been brought in interestingly forward."" THE CHALLENGES OF CRAFTING WAR SEQUENCES War is bloody, chaotic, and, as many would argue, often tedious to watch on screen. This makes it even more crucial for filmmakers to craft battle scenes that emotionally engage the audience—so much so that we instinctively root for one side. While Utekar’s vision of warfare is relentless, what does it take to stage a truly impactful war sequence? Filmmakers must strike a balance between intensity and narrative depth. Raut, who has directed large-scale period dramas, broke down the intricacies of staging such scenes. ""Any battle is extremely difficult to film,"" Raut said, emphasizing that action sequences are among the most expensive aspects of filmmaking. ""Sometimes, the per-day cost goes up by four to five times compared to a drama scene."" Large-scale war sequences typically involve 300-500 crew members, trained horses and elaborate set pieces.   Working with skilled stunt performers is one thing, but handling horses brings an added layer of complexity. ""I put the actors on horseback months before the shoot so that they develop a relationship with the animal,"" Raut explained. ""But no matter how strong the bond or how skilled the horse masters, getting 20 horses to walk in a straight line is never easy."" For Tanhaji, Raut meticulously planned every action sequence, first writing a highly detailed version and then creating a storyboard. He stressed the importance of background action, saying, ""The foreground actors drive the narrative, but the world gets built in the background."" Cinematography also plays a crucial role in shaping the intensity of battle sequences.  ""Cinema is dependent on the camera. So, how you use it as one of the characters within an action sequence becomes a thing,"" noted Raut, before adding, ""Cinema is all about what you show and what you do not show. What you do not show is equally important, as that's how storytelling happens."" Visual effects, when used in action sequences, must follow two fundamental rules. ""First, the world you create must have its own internal logic. Second, you can’t break the laws of physics,"" Raut said. ""In Adipurush, a mythological setting allowed me to make characters fly. But in Tanhaji, realism was key—so I had to show soldiers scaling a 3,000-foot wall instead."" Then there’s sound design—often the difference between an amateur and a professional-looking film. ""In film school, my professor always told me that sound can make or break a movie,"" Raut said. In war scenes, every detail matters: the clash of swords against each other, the impact on different materials—metal, leather, wood, or chainmail—and even the rhythmic footfalls of marching soldiers.WHY CHHAAVA'S WAR SCENES FELT TIRING While Laxman Utekar followed the technical rulebook for crafting war sequences, he fell short of infusing them with emotional depth. Instead of being moved by the valour, triumphs, suffering, and sacrifices of a great Maratha Emperor, you feel exhausted. If you haven’t watched Chhaava yet, prepare yourself for relentless lashings, brutal beatings, the sickening crunch of bones, and anguished screams. The merciless tormentors show no restraint, leaving rivulets of blood streaking across Sambhaji Maharaj's body. For some viewers, enduring this brutality until the end may prove difficult.

 



Vicky Kaushal as Sambhaji Maharaj in Chhaava.
 Amid the deafening war cries, as you anticipate an intense showdown between the Marathas and Mughals—especially when Sambhaji Maharaj launches a surprise attack on Akbar’s unsuspecting army—the narrative abruptly jumps from one battlefield to another. This rapid shift leaves little room to process what you’ve just witnessed. Rather than making the war sequences emotionally compelling, they begin to feel mechanical and repetitive.BATTLE SCENES IN BAJIRAO MASTANI AND JODHAA AKBAR This lack of engagement reminded me of the masterful war choreography in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Bajirao Mastani and Ashutosh Gowariker’s Jodhaa Akbar. In depicting the Battle of Bundelkhand in Bajirao Mastani, Bhansali paid meticulous attention to every detail—from a pink-hued sky reflecting the fire below to sweeping aerial shots that captured the battlefield’s chaos. One of the most striking sequences shows Bajirao Peshwa (Ranveer Singh) charging towards the enemy leader in slow motion, slicing through soldiers with calculated precision. The scene unfolds like a poetic dance of war, making it easy to see why Mastani (Deepika Padukone), the daughter of Bundelkhand’s ruler, was transfixed by Bajirao. The battle culminates in a visually stunning climax, with Bajirao delivering a fatal blow to the Mughal leader atop an elephant.   Ashutosh Gowariker, on the other hand, opted for a more grounded, historically rich approach in Jodhaa Akbar while recreating the Second Battle of Panipat. Unlike Bhansali’s visual grandeur, Gowariker’s battle sequences focused on realism and strategy. The scene opens with the newly coronated teenage Akbar watching from a hilltop as his Mughal forces overpower the troops led by Hindu King Hemu. A Mughal archer strikes Hemu in the eye, and he is later presented before Akbar for a ceremonial execution. Through sweeping aerial shots, Gowariker effectively conveys the scale and might of both armies. His camera movements are deliberate, capturing the intensity of soldiers clashing while the bleak landscape reinforces the grim reality of war.   While Chhaava successfully captures the brutality of war, it misses the artistry that made its predecessors impactful. It had great ideas on paper, like the guerilla attacks by Sambhaji Raje and his men, Sambhaji hearing a Muslim child’s cry amid the thunderous noise of clanking swords, and even Sambhaji’s superhuman leap from the ground to the top of a fort. But, the execution fell flat.  Films like Bajirao Mastani and Jodhaa Akbar balanced large-scale battle sequences with emotional stakes, ensuring that every sword swing carried narrative weight. Chhaava, in contrast, overwhelms the audience with relentless action but fails to create moments of reflection or triumph that allow viewers to connect with the characters’ struggles. The film could have benefited from Bhansali’s poetic visual storytelling, where war felt like an extension of the protagonist’s personal journey, or Gowariker’s measured pacing, which allowed battles to unfold with strategic clarity. By focusing not just on the bloodshed but also on the emotions that fuelled the fight, Chhaava could have made its war sequences not just brutal but also profoundly stirring.   As an avid film lover, a small request to the filmmakers planning historical dramas in future: Besides showing us the factually correct historical events, please make us, the audience, connect and care about people and events that have gone by as if we are there. Historical events may already feel distant to audiences, but cinema can bring them alive—not just recount them.Published By: Arushi JainPublished On: Feb 22, 2025ALSO READ |  Silent and sinister: How Akshaye Khanna's Aurangzeb stole ChhaavaTrending Reel

Amid much appreciation, Laxman Utekar's directorial has upset the descendants of Maratha warriors Ganoji and Kanhoji Shirke and they are planning to file a Rs 100 crore defamation lawsuit.  The family members claim that the film presents an unfair and misleading portrayal of their ancestors as traitors to Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.
Laxmikant Raje Shirke, the 13th descendant of Ganoji and Kanhoji Shirke, has filed a lawsuit claiming that the period drama distorts historical facts and misrepresents his ancestors. He criticised the film for damaging his family's legacy and revealed their decision to file a Rs 100 crore defamation case. A legal notice has been sent to the director and the decendants have asked for clarification. As per Pudhari, Utekar reached out to Bhushan Shirke, one of the descendants, and apologised for unintentionally hurting the family. “We have only mentioned the names of Ganoji and Kanhoji in Chhaava, without referring to their surname. We’ve also made sure to not disclose the village they belonged to. Our intention was not to hurt the sentiments of the Shirke family. I sincerely apologise if Chhaava caused any discomfort,"" Utekar said. Meanwhile, Chhaava released in theatres on February 14.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/exclusive-yash-has-not-begun-ramayana-shoot-still-completing-toxic-2684704-2025-02-24,"Rumours have been rife about actor Yash shooting Nitesh Tiwari's 'Ramayana' series. However, India Today has exclusively learnt that the actor is still busy shooting 'Toxic' in Bengaluru, and it will take him a few more months to begin 'Ramayana'.  As per sources close to the actor, the 39-year-old is currently in Bengaluru for 'Toxic'. The source also mentioned that Yash is being extremely mindful of neither starting 'Ramayana' nor ending 'Toxic' in a hurry.  ""Yash is currently in Bengaluru and will prioritise completing the 'Toxic' shoot before commencing work on 'Ramayana'. As co-producer of both films, he plans to dedicate his full attention to each project sequentially,"" the source said.  ""His current focus is solely on 'Toxic,' ensuring its shoot completion before transitioning to the epic 'Ramayana'. He will be wrapping up 'Toxic' before stepping into the grand world of 'Ramayana'. He should start shooting for 'Ramayana' in the coming months,"" the source added.  The actor gained newfound stardom with the release of the 'KGF' series. In 'Ramayana', which is a two-part series, Yash plays the role of Ravana.  Once you get into the skin of this iconic character from the epic, you can't really focus your energies on something else at the same time. It would not be a wise creative decision to include other projects in between. Yash knows that and has, therefore, decided not to shuffle between two projects, rather finish one and then start with another.  The source further revealed that both projects, which are co-produced by Yash, are shaping up to be cinematic spectacles. And while fans can't wait to see the actor in his larger-than-life role of Ravana, he is taking one step at a time.  Since both the projects belong to far opposite worlds, Yash is going to go through a giant transformation on-screen. That is another reason why he is avoiding all the back-and-forth between the two films. The actor recently revealed a glimpse of his character from 'Toxic', which added to the excitement around the film.
 


 Directed by Geetu Mohandas, 'Toxic', a multi-starrer, is expected to hit the screens later this year. The film also features Kiara Advani, Darrel D'Silva, Nayanthara, Akshay Oberoi and Tovino Thomas, among others. Meanwhile, 'Ramayana' has got Ranbir Kapoor, Sai Pallavi, Ravi Dubey, Lara Dutta, and Sunny Deol, among others, alongside Yash. The first part of the film is slated for release on November 6, 2026, during the Diwali weekend.

In a candid conversation with India Today Digital, Sapru spoke about his long-standing bond with the superstar and the impact he has had on their filmmaking journey. Reflecting on their association with Salman, Sapru shared that they met him recently on the sets of Sikandar. He recalled how Salman was instrumental in launching their directorial career with Lucky: No Time for Love and how Sanam Teri Kasam felt like a redemption of the superstar’s faith in them. ""When he first saw the trailer of Sanam Teri Kasam, he told us that it's a blockbuster, and said you guys have excelled as writers and directors. So, when we met him this time, we told Salman sir that this film was a redemption of his trust in us. He gave us our first break as directors of the Salman Khan film, and while our songs were always successful, we were never able to give hit movies, and we were waiting for that one blockbuster film. Now that Sanam Teri Kasam has become a hit, we finally felt we had lived up to his expectations,"" Sapru said. He further shared, ""Recently, Radhika and I visited him with a small packet of mithai, and we told him, ‘Sir, finally, at least we have redeemed the faith that you had put in us.’ The audience has now confirmed that we are fine movie directors and fine storytellers. Before this, we felt we hadn’t lived up to expectations, but now, people are not just coming to watch the movie—they are celebrating it. They are dancing in theaters, making reels on our dialogues, and the film is everywhere!"" When asked about casting choices if Sanam Teri Kasam had been made in the 90s, Sapru didn’t hesitate. He said, ""100% it would have been Salman! The innocence in his eyes, the way he looks at and holds the girl, the purity of thought and emotion—he was the perfect romantic hero of that era, and he would be our perfect Inder."" As for the female lead, Sapru believed that any newcomer would have been a great fit, ""When Salman sir is in a film, he makes his co-star look special because he is so special. Anyone we could have cast opposite him would be special and, of course, it would be a newcomer. His presence alone elevates his leading ladies. He was the ultimate romantic hero of the 90s!"" Addressing whether they have plans to collaborate with Salman again, Sapru expressed his admiration for the actor’s unparalleled stardom. ""Who wouldn’t want to work with Salman sir? Like Radhika mam says, he is an institution in himself. He has been a superstar for over 30 years, and his longevity is unmatched. We are just waiting for the right script and the right time. Whenever our mentor decides, we would be honoured to work with him again,"" he signed off.

Here's exploring the phenomenon that this film has become in 2025. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/sanam-teri-kasam-and-its-incredible-journey-from-flop-to-phenomenon-2684829-2025-02-25,"Upon its original release in February 2016, 'Sanam Teri Kasam' collected around Rs 10 crore nett. It ran in theatres, not successfully, for around seven days. On Thursday, it crashed and collected Rs 0.75 crore nett. Cut to nine years later, the film re-released and created history for itself and for the entire Hindi film industry. It became the highest-grossing Hindi re-release, beating the likes of 'Tumbbad', 'Laila Majnu' and 'Rockstar', among others. What made it possible, though? For a film to run this well in theatres, to earn over Rs 50 crore nett upon its re-release while it was available on YouTube for free all this time - is not just a phenomenon, but a case-study for the makers and consumers of cinema.  In an exclusive interview with India Today, the directors of the film, Vinay Sapru and Radhika Rao, discuss the reason behind its massive success. 'Sanam Teri Kasam', with two new faces - Mawra Hocane and Harshvardhan Rane - with no prior promotions - becomes a distinct success story. For the film's directors, who are also the writers, the key to its success lies in its 'honesty'.  Sapru and Rao are clear about what or rather who failed the film upon its original release, and why it worked during its re-release. Guess the second time is the charm, then!  ""At the core of this film lies desperate and acute honesty. We conceived the film with the purest intention. We wanted to present the Shiva and Sati's story to the world, and that's how the film was conceived,"" says Rao.  Sapru, who seems completely attached to the film, especially to its emotional climax, adds, ""Honesty (is the one thing that worked for the audience). There's honesty in the writing, in the script; honesty in the characters, in the dialogues. Every word they both (Inder and Saru - the characters) are saying has a heart. There is this honesty in the belief. We cried ourselves while writing the scenes. This is as honest as a film can be made. Every scene speaks from the heart. There are real emotions put into writing it. This honesty has cut across (the audience).""  But, why didn't the audience accept it the first time, then? The directors say they are deeply hurt by the way things were handled by the studio which backed the film in 2016.  In a no-holds-barred interview with us, Sapru and Rao reveal that they were blind-sided by the studio, where presentations were made initially about promoting the film, but none of that got executed when the release date neared. The directors say, ""We knew that the film would do well, but it took the world nine years to see that,"" adding that the ""patronising"" marketing head of the studio wrote the film off. ""This patronising marketing head of the studio said 'Aapko lagta hai aapne masterpiece banaya hai? Aapko lagta hai aapke artistes koi superstars hain? Aapne jaisi film banayi hai, aapke liye hum jo kar rahe hain, aap usmein khush rahiye (What do you think of yourself? Have you created a masterpiece? Do you think you have cast superstars? You should be happy with whatever little we are doing for you and your film)."" Sapru presents the trade data in the interview, and informs us that the film collected as well on Monday as it collected during its opening weekend - a sign that the audience was interested in watching 'Sanam Teri Kasam'.  ""She went to the extent of saying that the film could be held on Monday because of them. Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday - the film collected equally well. It was extraordinary for the film to hold that well on Monday. I told them they should do something. They went into a mourning period there - they could not believe that the film was holding on,"" he revealed.  Sapru goes on to mimic the studio head and says, ""And then she told us, 'Let me just tell you some hard truths: I forced my entire team to watch the film'. We were brutally patronised. They came, tapped our shoulders and said 'Don't worry. Do better next time'."" The memories of that day are as fresh as yesterday in their minds. Who forgets insults and their share of unfair criticism, after all? For Sapru and Rao, this is more than just a new lease of life to their film. This is the biggest kind of validation they could have ever got - the validation from the audience. They say this is almost as if Lord Shiva himself woke up from his sleep and decided to bless them for the efforts they made nine years back.  ""Because He (Lord Shiva) says 'I will decide when and how to bless you'. Our job is just to act. He will reward us whenever He wants to. I keep telling Vinay that Shiva was in Yog Mudra then, and he suddenly woke up at the time of Maha Kumbh and realised 'oh this is my story', and here is our reward,"" said Rao, with utmost belief and faith in her work, and the blessings that came nine years later.  'Sanam Teri Kasam' is a painful love story, based on the Shiva Purana - the story of Lord Shiva and his first wife, Sati, who immolated herself while seeking her father's approval of her marriage all her life.  For Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru, the idea of this story not working would be a scathing hit on whatever we have read as part of our mythology while growing up. ""Honestly, we knew what we had made, we were sure about the intention and the efforts we had put into it. We didn't need anyone cajoling us or patronising us at that time. And if this is not working, then the texts are wrong, then everything that we have been taught by our parents and grandparents is wrong, then our values are a lie. This was the truth. And honestly, we see that the truth has been proven today (sic),"" she says.  A film like 'Sanam Teri Kasam' finds its audience in the millennials and the Gen-Z upon its re-release. These generations are often scolded for their lack of understanding of our spiritual texts and legends. The success of the film seems to prove counterproductive to this claim now.  Sapru highlights, ""The conflict of the film is inspired by the Shiva Purana. We believe that our youth believe in this culture, our value systems, our morals, our deeply-rooted culture. They say that Gen-Z is different, the youth think differently - it doesn't matter. People told us 'marriage is an outdated institution'.""  He continues, ""They asked us, 'You are talking about her seeking her father's approval - what do you mean? She (Saru - the character) doesn't care'. It was criticised all the way. We picked up poetry from Harivansh Rai Bachchan's work. We believed that all of that is seeped into the youth of the country. The cinema that we would like to see was completely wiped off.""  Rao echoes the same, and mentioned that the new generation, contrary to the larger perception, values our culture and roots far more than us. ""The youth have gone back to their roots. The youth is not as superficial as they say. They have gone back to their roots. I know so many people who don't go clubbing, they don't drink, they don't smoke, they all lead very genteel life, and they are into health and wellness. There is a change in their lifestyles,"" she comments. The cinema that is speaking to the audience today represents the culture that they themselves hold on to. Rao reflects upon the late success of 'Sanam Teri Kasam' and highlights how even Van Gogh's paintings were re-discovered by people years later. ""If you see Van Gogh's paintings, you'll see that nobody bought them for so many years, and then they became masterpieces,"" she says.  When they go back to the origin of 'Sanam Teri Kasam', they say it was that one line from the Shiva Puran which appealed to them the most. The line which defined the very essence of the story - something that they say - is resonating with the audience today.  Rao says, ""Vinay and I were looking for a conflict in the film. We picked up the Shiva Puran lying in our office, we opened it, and we read the lines which said 'if the wedding of the daughter is not blessed by the father, then even if it is Mahadev's wedding, it will not be successful'."" She goes on, ""We were so impressed by the thought. It was a very good translation of the Shiva Puran. We wept for a whole week, just feeling the pain of Lord Shiva. The way the agony was described. So, when we began to write the film, it came from a very place of real grief which we had felt. At every point, whether it was us or even the technicians who were involved, everybody came up with this intention of 'let's just make a good film'.""   Sometimes, when you are unfathomably hurt, and you feel helpless, you tend to speak. The vessel full of pain bursts open at the very first opportunity, and then there's no coming back. For Rao and Sapru, the injury from the betrayal by the studio seems so deep that they haven't fully healed from it. But, they say they at least feel ""heart-whole from heart-broken"" now.  Rao says, ""We are very heart-whole from heart-broken. We are very happy and redeemed. We are doubly guilt-ridden today. Apart from feeling terribly sorry for ourselves that we didn't make a good film or thinking about what went wrong, we were also wallowing in self-pity and feeling guilty... for the producer who backed the film and also for the artistes. Those young artistes whom nobody knew, who were so ecstatic to find two people who backed them on the basis of pure meritocracy, didn't receive the kind of appreciation that they should have.""  She adds, ""It was such an easy process of audition, nothing more. And they kind of believed that the universe had come together to reward them in some way. It all kind of just unravelled, and then, it all got back together in such a spectacular manner for them (referring to the successful re-release). So, it makes us feel very happy and unburdened that our two birds can finally fly and leave the nest, and they can find their own destiny.""  All's well if it ends well, they say. But, for Rao and Sapru, the successful ending of their nine-year-long journey with 'Sanam Teri Kasam' is actually the beginning of the entire romantic universe. ""Our promises are fulfilled,"" they sign off, but not without mentioning that they are working on the sequel, and will release one film from their newly-created universe in February next year.

In a recent interaction, he observed that Kapoor had not received any negative feedback despite the film’s intense nature, whereas he himself was heavily criticised for showcasing toxic masculinity through the film. According to a promo for his interview on Game Changers, Vanga noted the disparity.  Vanga said, ""People who criticised very badly, film related people, everybody said Ranbir was brilliant. I am not jealous of Ranbir but the point is ‘Ranbir was brilliant but writer director was...’ I don’t understand the disparity."" The filmmaker continued, ""I understood they want to work with Ranbir. That’s clear because if they say anything to Ranbir... It’s easy to make a comment about me because I am new for this place. A filmmaker will make a film in 2-3 years but an actor will appear five times. So the one with whom you can work more, you won’t say anything about him. That’s true."" Speaking to Deadline, actor Ranbir Kapoor confirmed that he would play a double role in Animal Park, a revelation teased in the climax of Animal. ""He wants to make it over three parts. The second part is called Animal Park. We’ve been sharing ideas from the first film itself, and how he wants to take the story forward. It’s very exciting because now I get to play two characters, the antagonist and the protagonist"", he said. The 2023 film Animal features Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol in key roles. It is currently streaming on Netflix.

The superstar is currently busy with 'King', daughter Suhana Khan's big-screen debut. A new report has now mentioned that SRK will be immediately moving to shoot 'Pathaan 2' with Aditya Chopra after finishing the Siddharth Anand-directorial.  A report in Peepingmoon mentioned that Chopra has been working on the script for around two years and the sequel is finally ready to go on the floor next year, with the preparations beginning by the end of this year.   The report quoted a source close to the director as saying, ""Aditya has been working on the script for 'Pathaan 2' since mid-2023. The sequel is designed not only to carry forward Pathaan's story, but also to lay the groundwork for larger conflicts in upcoming instalments of YRF's Spy Universe.""  The source went on to describe how the new 'Pathaan' film is going to surpass everything that the first film established - in terms of both the scale of the film and the narrative. ""It was due to the extensive planning and intricate storytelling that the scripting process took so long. Aditya, along with Sridhar Raghavan and Abbas Tyrewala, has crafted an exhilarating, high-stakes script that promises to surpass the first instalment in both scale and intensity,"" the source said.  The report added that SRK was ""thoroughly impressed"" by the script when Chopra got to him with the story.  While the story is set and SRK seems to be enthusiastic about beginning the shoot, the director of the film is not finalised yet. However, the report mentioned that Chopra will either get Ayan Mukerji or a new director altogether to helm the film.  The YRF chief is believed to be extremely happy with the way 'War 2' has shaped up under Mukerji's leadership, and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends up trusting the director with 'Pathaan 2' as well. Several reports have also suggested that Chopra is also considering returning to direction with 'Pathaan 2'.  'Pathaan', which was released in 2023, emerged as the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of all time. It also became the biggest film for YRF and the second biggest for Shah Rukh by collecting Rs 543.09 crore nett in its lifetime run at the box office. Directed by Siddharth Anand, it is also the highest-grossing film from YRF's coveted spy universe.

Earlier last year, while confirming that Khan is doing 'Race 4', producer Ramesh Taurani told the news agency PTI: ""Saif will be back in the 'Race' franchise, and we are excited to have him on board. He did a great job in the first two films. The film will boast an ensemble cast, and we are finalising the script and cast. We haven't finalised the director either.

He explained why Ranbir Kapoor was selected for the lead role.,https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/sandeep-reddy-vanga-on-why-he-didnt-cast-shahid-kapoor-in-animal-2687716-2025-03-02,"Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga has shared insights into his casting choices for the 2023 film Animal, explaining why he selected Ranbir Kapoor over Shahid Kapoor. In a recent interview, Vanga revealed that while Shahid delivered an exceptional performance in Kabir Singh, he wanted to explore a different dimension with Ranbir for Animal. In an interview with Game Changers Podcast, Sandeep Reddy Vanga said Shahid's name didn't come to him organically. Given Animal was an emotional story, Ranbir's name struck him. He added that it was ""organic"" because Ranbir would be the right fit for the role.  During the same interview, Sandeep Reddy Vanga praised Shahid and recollected his experience of working with him in Kabir Singh. He said, ""Faith was already there because Shahid was very interested in doing the remake. Since it’s a remake, there was less discussion."" He explained, ""While the camera was shifting, I told Shahid that this scene had been deleted and that we had an hour to spare. I explained the scene and mentioned the nice sunlight, suggesting we shoot it. He agreed, saying, ‘Okay.’ I told him the intention and dialogue, which wasn’t even on paper. He did it."" Sandeep continued, ""We discussed it and completed the scene in 90 minutes. It wasn’t in the original script, and we hadn’t planned to shoot it, but when the light shifted, I asked how much time it would take. He said an hour, so I said, ‘Shahid, why waste an hour? Let’s shoot it.’ That’s when I realised an actor like Shahid shouldn’t do remakes—he’s such an original actor. I told him that many times.""  Kabir Singh was the Hindi remake of Vijay Deverakonda and Shalini Pandey's Telugu blockbuster Arjun Reddy. Shahid Kapoor co-starred with Kiara Advani in 2019's Kabir Singh.  Shahid was last seen in Deva. Published By: Anisha RaoPublished On: Mar 2, 2025ALSO READ |  Sandeep Vanga: A big production house rejected actor because he acted in Kabir SinghMust Watch

So, what does this mean for the upcoming releases? Trade experts weigh in. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/vicky-kaushal-chhaava-breaking-records-affect-on-upcoming-films-2688099-2025-03-03,"Actor Vicky Kaushal's Chhaava has set the box office on fire, surpassing expectations and emerging as one of the biggest hits of the year. The historical epic, directed by Laxman Utekar, has not only impressed audiences with its gripping narrative and grand visuals, but has also established Kaushal as a formidable force in the industry. With record-breaking collections and strong word-of-mouth, the film's success can have a ripple effect on upcoming releases. The film’s performance is likely to influence release strategies for upcoming films. At least the trade experts think so. Trade expert Ramesh Bala told India Today Digital, ""Chhaava is performing well and is likely to continue doing so for another two weeks. This will affect upcoming releases, but not necessarily in a good way. If the new films have strong content, they can still perform well. They will have enough screens and the potential to earn. By the third week of Chhaava, its influence will start withering. Casual moviegoers might still opt for Chhaava in its later weeks, while frequent moviegoers will explore the new releases. The impact will depend on how compelling the upcoming films are."" Vishek Chauhan, theater owner and trade expert, shared his thoughts, ""I think it's great that Chhaava is doing fantastic business, but influencing the box office potential of upcoming releases—I really don't think that is going to change much because every film writes its own box office history, and Chhaava is no exception. It’s a fantastic success, and it is writing its own story. A couple of months back, Pushpa 2 wrote its own box office history, and I'm pretty sure the films that will come will write their own history. The good thing with Chhaava is that it's a non-franchise historical and led by a fantastic young actor, yet it's doing such lovely business. And I think that is the best part about it."" advertisementSeveral films are lined up in the coming weeks, including John Abraham's The Diplomat, Kesari Veer, etc. With Chhaava still commanding a significant share of screens, this could impact the opening figures of these films. ""Securing screens may not be a major issue, but capturing audience's attention is challenging. Many Hindi films are collecting just Rs 1-2 crore per day nationwide, whereas regional films in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are earning Rs10 crore per day during weekends. Audiences are only flocking to films with extremely strong word-of-mouth, while others are being rejected. With low theatrical revenue, many mid-budget Hindi films are barely making an impact before moving to OTT and finding an audience there. The trend suggests that for a pan-India release to be viable, a film should at least collect Rs 10 crore per week,"" said Chauhan.    Several films are lined up in the coming weeks, including John Abraham's The Diplomat, Kesari Veer, etc. With Chhaava still commanding a significant share of screens, this could impact the opening figures of these films.

The trend suggests that for a pan-India release to be viable, a film should at least collect Rs 10 crore per week,"" said Chauhan.  He continued, ""I really don't think the success will push other filmmakers because I think the film will release as planned. The period it was released in wasn’t exactly the best time to release a blockbuster, and I think it’s now the biggest February release by a huge margin. Other films are definitely on track and won’t be much affected by it. I think The Diplomat has moved a week, probably for other considerations. I really don't think there's going to be too much shake-up."" Talking about what worked in favour of Chhaava, Bala added, ""The film resonated with audiences because of its strong content, blending history and religion. It particularly struck a chord in Maharashtra, where Shivaji Maharaj is revered. The story also touches on sensitive historical conflicts between two kings of different religions, which added to its emotional impact. Unlike typical period dramas, Chhaava had the advantage of a deeper cultural and religious connection. Not all historical films can replicate this success—it depends on execution, storytelling, and audience sentiment."" The success of Chhaava has further cemented Vicky Kaushal’s position as a bankable star. Trade experts believe this will open doors for Kaushal to headline more ambitious projects in the future. Bala expressed, ""Vicky Kaushal has delivered a strong performance in Chhaava, elevating his stature. The film’s box office success and critical appreciation have solidified his position. While he isn’t at the level of the Khans or Hrithik Roshan yet, a few more successful films could push him into that league. If he continues to deliver consistently over the next couple of years, he will become one of Bollywood’s most bankable stars.""

 Vishek Chauhan commented, ""The success of Chhava is due to many reasons. One of them is Vicky Kaushal, but he isn’t really a star in the traditional sense. He is a very reliable actor, though, because in terms of openings, Chhaava is the biggest opener he's ever had. Before this, none of his films opened in double digits—not even Uri, which started in single digits. But this success is a combination of many factors—the production team, the producers, the director, and the historical appeal. Vicky Kaushal led it very well and did a fantastic job, but had this been an SRK or Salman Khan film, it would have been a different story altogether. This is a Vicky Kaushal film, and opening at Rs 30 crore plus is something he has never done before. So, this success is more about the film than just Vicky Kaushal himself."" Chauhan added, ""When Uri became a sleeper hit and crossed Rs 250 crore mark, Vicky found himself in a strong position, but he blew that momentum. He couldn't capitalize on the action-hero image Uri gave him. Now, with Chhaava, he is in the same position again, and I hope and pray he capitalises on it this time. There is a huge void in star power among the younger generation of actors. Vicky was in Patna, and I told him that the real audience lies in the smaller towns—Patna, Lucknow, Kanpur, Bareilly, Raipur. The younger generation of actors has not been able to connect with these places deeply. The deeper you connect with the audience, the bigger a star you become. That has been the strength of Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, and Hrithik Roshan—they penetrate deep into the heartlands, and that’s why they are so huge."" On a concluding note, both Bala and Chauhan said they foresee an increase in actors’ remunerations, especially for period dramas.  ""With Chhava’s success, stars might demand higher salaries or opt for profit-sharing models. Big-budget period films often have soaring production costs, and actors may negotiate deals where they take a percentage of the profits rather than a fixed fee. Given the current uncertainty in theatrical collections, this approach helps reduce financial pressure on producers and studios,"" Bala said. However, Chauhan disagreed and said, ""I don't see any increase in remuneration for historical films. One successful film doesn't guarantee the entire genre will thrive. Indian producers need to realise that audiences are willing to watch all kinds of films, provided they are worth their time and money."" Chhaava is currently running successfully in cinemas.

Deol said that he has never hesitated to reach out to people for work. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/bobby-deol-says-he-asked-for-work-during-low-phase-aashram-final-season-2688617-2025-03-04,"Actor Bobby Deol's career trajectory should be taught in schools. From getting a dream break and ruling hearts to hitting rock bottom after a few years, the actor has seen it all. However, what makes him worth celebrating is his quest to get up again, and pack the much-needed punches. In his second stint, Deol has portrayed strong characters in Aashram, Class of 83, Love Hostel and Animal. In an exclusive chat with India Today Digital, Bobby recently spoke about the low phase and how he did not let negativity get the better of him. Given that it's said hard times lead to desperate measures, we asked the actor if he too had to make some difficult decisions. Deol replied, ""I mean desperate definitely, but I think it's part of an actor’s journey and it hasn't been just mine. I think every actor goes through that journey, and that’s part and parcel of this profession, as nothing stays forever. But one must never give up hope and keep trying. I always encourage everyone that they also need to stay disciplined and respect their work; be focused and manifest."" The actor added that he really believes in manifestation and working towards achieving one's goals. ""It's not like baithe baithe sab mil jayega, one must work hard (You won't get things by not trying). And with hard work, even if it seems far, you would be getting closer to your goal. Desperation does bring negativity, but you go through that and come out. There is no one to help you swim through it. When you realise that, the journey becomes easier.""advertisement   The actor added that he really believes in manifestation and working towards achieving one's goals. ""It's not like baithe baithe sab mil jayega, one must work hard (You won't get things by not trying). And with hard work, even if it seems far, you would be getting closer to your goal. Desperation does bring negativity, but you go through that and come out. There is no one to help you swim through it. When you realise that, the journey becomes easier."" While many actors have often spoken about reaching out to filmmakers for work, given the Deol surname that he carries, we asked Bobby if that did become a hurdle for him. ""Pehle zamana alag tha, jab shuruat ki thi toh aisa nahi tha, pehle log khud aate the (It was different when I started out, as people would offer me work by themselves). Then the population of actors increased, it's sad that we forget that there are so many people coming in, and will continue to,"" stated Bobby Deol.  Deol said he has never be hesitant to reach out to people for work, ""However, I did that too (ask for work). When I was going through a bad phase, maine logo ke darwaze khatkhataye hain and bola hai ki main Bobby Deol hoon aur mujhe kaam dijiiye (I have knocked on doors and told them I am Bobby Deol, and please give me work). I don't think there is anything wrong in that, as you need work. At least they will remember that Bobby Deol had come to meet me. This also gets translated to work sometimes. So, there is nothing to be ashamed of."" Bobby Deol further added that there were times when he was offered films that he did not really like, but he went on to do it, to continue working. He said that it was important to be seen to keep getting work, and that's how the industry works. On a final note, we asked if, in retrospect, he thought about the mistakes he made back in the time, and how he makes sure he doesn't make them again. ""Honestly, you never know when you'd make the mistakes again; you only work on yourself on becoming better at making them. Mistakes teach you a lot, and you cannot not make mistakes, no one is perfect. There are times when people ask me what I would tell the young Bobby. Arey main kya bolu usko, wo thodi na samjhega jo main bol raha hoon usko (what do I say, he wouldn't understand at that age what I am trying to tell him). You just have to learn with experience and life does teach you a lot,"" Bobby Deol concluded.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/rajinikanth-date-clash-delays-salman-khan-atlee-film-makers-hunt-for-hollywood-star-2689688-2025-03-06,"Actor Salman Khan and filmmaker Atlee were expected to collaborate on a massive film soon. However, the latest report suggests that the project has been put on an indefinite hold due to casting issues. As per a report published in Pinkvilla, the film warranted two big heroes to lead the story, and while Khan had already agreed on playing one role, Atlee was trying to get either Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan on board for the other. The grand film has been mounted on a Rs 650 crore budget and needs two big heroes, preferably one from the North and another from the South. The report quoted an insider source mentioning that while Haasan refused the role, Rajinikanth couldn't agree to do it either, citing date issues. The mega-budget film is a reincarnation drama and Haasan didn't want to play a father to Khan on screen. Rajinikanth's schedule is packed until 2026 and there is no possibility for him to accommodate such a big film in his schedule for the next two years. The report further mentioned that this new Atlee film has been imagined in the league of 'Game of Thrones'. ""While Kamal Haasan wasn’t too sure about playing the role of Salman Khan’s father in the film, Rajinikanth is committed to shooting for 'Coolie' and 'Jailer 2' until the start of 2026. He is on the verge of green lighting another project post 'Jailer 2', which means his dates are blocked till 2026,"" the source said. The report quoted the source explaining why Atlee and Sun Pictures were keen on getting Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan on board. ""After both the conversations fell through, Atlee and Sun Pictures were looking for options all across but couldn’t find an ideal replacement for Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan. They wanted to cast someone who could bring in big revenue from Digital and Satellite in the local language (e.g. Rajinikanth / Kamal Haasan in Tamil), but the options of senior superstars with that market value were limited,"" the source added. Interestingly, the makers are now trying to have an international actor join the film with Khan. While the conversation with actor Sylvester Stallone didn't result in anything fruitful, the discussions with other biggies from the West are still underway. The report quoted the source as saying, ""The team is still exploring options for casting other international names and the process will take longer than usual due to complexities of contracts and other barriers."" All this chaos regarding casting has led Khan, Atlee and Sun Pictures to put their film on hold for now. This is one project which can't do away with the collaboration of two industries and the makers are trying their best to achieve what they have imagined, irrespective of how long it takes. Meanwhile, Salman Khan is gearing up for the release of his latest film, 'Sikandar'. The film will hit the screens as the big Eid release on March 28. Directed by AR Murugadoss, the film is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala, and also features Rashmika Mandanna, Sharman Joshi, Kajal Aggarwal, Sathyaraj, Prateik Babbar and Suniel Shetty, among others.Published By: Vineeta KumarPublished On: Mar 6, 2025Read more |  Alia Bhatt calls daughter Raha 'new girlfriend in family', reflects on acting at 17Must Watch

""It is my responsibility to deliver box office because we are in the business of filmmaking also. This is why I need to analyse. Something has happened, right? Something has happened where people have stayed away, something that they have not bought, something that they didn’t feel the need to come to the theatre. If at all any other actor decides to give their time, his or her, then you know, make it worth it"", he said. Jigra was a action-thriller revolving around the relationship between a brother and sister. Alia will be next seen in Love and War and Alpha.

The character demands Jr. B to obtain a certain kind of body. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/abhishek-bachchan-to-undergo-menacing-transformation-for-srk-king-report-2693026-2025-03-13,"Filmmaker Siddharth Anand is currently gearing up to begin the shoot of ‘King’ with Shah Rukh Khan and Abhishek Bachchan. The film is going to be the big screen debut of SRK’s daughter, Suhana Khan, and the team wants everything to go perfectly with it. This also includes a massive transformation planned for Bachchan, who is playing the negative lead in the film. As reported by Pinkvilla, Anand has designed a specific character for Bachchan in ‘King’, which requires him to have a lean body. The director is reportedly aiming at giving the actor a ‘menacing’ look and Bachchan has begun his preparations for the same. The report quoted a source close to the production confirming that both Bachchan and Khan have to appear in never-seen-before avatars in ‘King’ and the entire team is making sure they are on track with their respective appearances. “Siddharth Anand is planning to present Abhishek Bachchan like never before in King as Jr. B will have a special look in this action-packed entertainer. The idea is to create a character that has a menacing appearance, with a certain kind of physique. Abhishek has already started to hit the gym to attain a lean physique in King. It’s going to be a face-off like never before between Shah Rukh Khan and Abhishek Bachchan in ‘King’,” the source said. The report further mentioned the source, adding, “Abhishek has always been a versatile actor, and 'King' would mark his first time in an out-and-out negative space alongside Shah Rukh Khan. His lean appearance in King will blow over the audience, and Sid will be unleashing his characters with special assets once the film goes on floor.” For Anand, it’s important that SRK and Bachchan’s clash in ‘King’ looks like the clash of ‘two alpha on-screen personalities’. Even the superstar is hitting the gym to obtain a certain kind of body required for his character in the film. The film also features ‘Munjya’ fame Abhay Verma in an important role. The shoot of the film is expected to begin in May-June this year, and it will be released next year. Speculations are also rife about the film featuring a cameo by either Deepika Padukone or Kareena Kapoor Khan.Published By: Vineeta KumarPublished On: Mar 13, 2025Read more |  Nora Fatehi's bodyguard comes to little girl's rescue in theatre.

These are the words of appreciation one longs to hear in a world where gratification and encouragement feel increasingly rare. Imagine being trapped in an environment that slowly engulfs you in toxicity, stripping away your essence and shine. What can one do in such a situation? The answer lies in breaking free, embracing your individuality, and living your life with main character energy. By doing so, you can at least take some control of your narrative, shaping and twisting it according to your will. Ahead of Bollywood actor Aamir Khan’s 60th birthday, I decided to watch his last film, Laal Singh Chaddha, for reasons that most people are aware of -- the film’s underwhelming box office performance, despite being an adaptation of the cult classic Forrest Gump. I began watching with apathy but finished with a sense of fulfillment. Hear me out. Laal Singh Chaddha offers valuable life lessons that transcend its lacklustre commercial success. As we step into 2025, amid a lot of confusion and a lack of motivation, this film serves as a reminder of the perseverance, stability, and calmness that this generation often lacks despite the passion and drive.advertisement    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Aamir Khan Productions (@aamirkhanproductions) A post shared by Aamir Khan Productions (@aamirkhanproductions) When was the last time you followed your mother’s advice to the letter? Can’t remember, right? Neither can I. But Laal Singh Chaddha did. He obediently stayed in his hostel room for two weeks because his mother warned him, “Bahar malaria phail gaya hai, kamre me hi rehna (Stay inside, otherwise you might get malaria).” If my mother told me that, I would probably dismiss it or find a way to sneak out. But Laal was truly the “laal” of his mother, and stayed true to his promise. Laal Singh Chaddha, portrayed by Aamir Khan, is a character brimming with optimism, drive, and innocence -- traits we all possess somewhere, but life gets in the way and corrupts us. Khan does justice to the role, conveying Laal's emotions beautifully. Throughout his life, Laal forms deep connections with three individuals: Rupa, his childhood friend (played by Kareena Kapoor Khan), Bala from the army (played by Naga Chaitanya), and Mohammad, a leader of an enemy terrorist gang.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Aamir Khan Productions (@aamirkhanproductions) A post shared by Aamir Khan Productions (@aamirkhanproductions) The film beautifully captures the idea that life is a series of unpredictable events, and how we respond to those moments defines us. Laal’s unconditional love for Rupa and his ability to forgive and move forward without bitterness struck a chord with me. In a generation burdened by the pressure of perfection and social media validation, Laal's character teaches us the power of embracing imperfections and staying true to oneself. Moreover, the film's portrayal of friendship and human connections is timeless. From his bond with Bala to his profound relationship with Mohammad, Laal’s journey emphasises the importance of empathy and compassion. For someone like me, who cherishes meaningful relationships in an increasingly digital world, this aspect of the film resonated deeply, offering a profound sense of what it feels like to be acknowledged by a fellow human. Another highlight of the film was its cinematography. Laal Singh Chaddha offered a refreshing portrayal of key events without being heavy-handed. From the 1984 anti-Sikh riots to the Kargil War, the film wove real-life events into Laal's narrative, reminding us of the resilience of the human spirit. For a generation that is vocal about social justice and equality, it was relevant and inspiring. Laal Singh Chaddha also struck a chord, thanks to its soulful soundtrack. As someone who listens to music 24/7, I can confidently say that the film's songs are perfectly timed, adding emotional depth to the narrative. When Laal runs across the country simply because he feels like running, Arijit Singh’s voice in the background evoked something akin to an emotional release.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Aamir Khan Productions (@aamirkhanproductions) A post shared by Aamir Khan Productions (@aamirkhanproductions) Adding to the magic was the soundtrack composed by Pritam. Songs like 'Kahani' and 'Phir Na Aisi Raat Aayegi' evoke nostalgia and longing, while 'Tur Kalleyan' inspires hope and self-discovery. The music not only enhances the storytelling but lingers in the heart long after the film ends, making it an integral part of the cinematic experience. Laal Singh Chaddha is not just about one man's journey but a reflection of life’s simplicity and beauty. It serves as a gentle reminder to slow down, embrace the moment, and cherish human connections, lessons that are timeless and essential for a generation like ours.

While at times, it has been shown as the juncture where love is professed, thus adding a new colour in the lives of the characters, at others it has been used as a backdrop for a crucial sequence to advance narratives. This cinematic Saturday, have a look at how Holi has been showcased through the years.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/picturisation-of-holi-in-bollywood-through-years-rang-barse-balam-pichkari-lahu-muh-lag-gaya-2693789-2025-03-15,"The best way to represent India on celluloid is to capture the varied colours of its many cultures. Colours of its people, traditions, and celebrations. Luckily, for the filmmakers, and those trying to gauge the fabric of our very vibrant country, festivals come in handy. While Diwali makes you feel a sense of glory, Holi adds a bit of fun to your life. Filmmakers in India have, over the years, used the festival to establish a shift in their narratives, push the story forward, and sometimes, simply, and literally, to add colours to the screen. Holi, like Diwali, finds its roots in one of the most celebrated legends of Hinduism, where it is connected to the story of God Narasimha, the fourth avatar of Lord Vishnu. The movie-viewing population of the country has hardly ever found any Holi song or Holi-related trope in a film uninteresting. The festival, by virtue of being the festival of colours, has never been anything but colourful on the screen. Either it is used to add romance to the story, or contributes to a thrilling experience, becomes a symbol of an emotional turn-around, or serves as the perfect breather in between melodrama and action. Holi also means grandeur on screen. It's always been a collective, larger-than-life experience for the audience. Of course, there's no match to the kind of unbelievably large settings that we see in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's movies today. However, if you trace back the representation of Holi in Indian cinema to the 1959 film 'Navrang', the festival still looks as grand as one could hope for in a newly-free India. advertisement   That's the magic of the festival. And when it combines with the magic of the 70 MM, it becomes a joyous experience like no other. There are no rules here. The idea is to have fun, in abundance, carefully but in the wildest fashion ever. Holi gives you the licence to be whatever you want, whoever you want, for that one day. And cinema has time and again used the spirit of this festival with the utmost precision. In V Shantaram's 'Navrang', you see a fabulous 'Ja Re Hat Natkhat', where you see a woman teasing her lover. The classical beats of the number and the lively dance make it a one-of-its-kind cinematic celebration of the festival. In the 1971 film 'Kati Patang', Rajesh Khanna uses the festival to express his love, and break stereotypes around a widow who's not allowed to wear any colour but white. This comes across as the ultimate confession of his feelings, to see the woman he loves embracing and appreciating a life full of colours. In 1975, 'Sholay' director Ramesh Sippy used the colours of Holi to establish a tragic twist in the story. As soon as the colours subside, the bloodbath begins. The festival, which is supposed to add colours to life, takes away the same from the characters. Then, in the 1981 film 'Silsila', 'Rang Barse' provides the biggest conflict in the narrative, which sets the story distinctly on the brink of right and wrong. You understand the freedom that comes with Holi, but also the repercussions of taking it for granted. In the 1982 film 'Nadiya Ke Paar', you see a young village boy wondering when he will get to play Holi with the woman he loves. The celebrations are about finding joy in longing for the one, and hoping that you get to celebrate the next time with her.There's hope in these colours and cinema has almost never failed to capture that. What is cinema any way if not a canvas of hope, happiness and heart?In the 90s, the filmmakers started using Holi to introduce the vantage point in their stories. This is the twist which makes or breaks their stories, a point which either intrigues the audience or makes them feel restless about what's coming. In 'Damini' (1993), the festival sets the stage for the big tragedy in the film, which goes on to become the fulcrum of the entire story. A domestic help gets raped at the festival, and a woman, despite witnessing the crime, is forced to stay mum.advertisementIn the same year, Shah Rukh Khan brings 'Darr' and becomes the most fearful stalker that Bollywood has ever seen. With a face smeared in colours, he visits the house of the woman he's crazy about, and burns seeing her celebrating Holi with her husband. That he would be the same man teaching us all the importance of love and how that makes your life colourful is where cinema peaked in its representation of Holi's spirit.SRK proposed the idea of unconditional love in the 2000 film 'Mohabbatein', and healed an entire generation which had started associating Holi with fear and crime. When he imagined his dead lover singing, dancing, and playing Holi with him in 'Soni Soni Ankhiyon Vali', we screamed a collective sigh of relief. There was love in the air along with the fresh scent of colours. Amitabh Bachchan, too, found his way back to Holi after 'Silsila'. This time, he showed that colours don't discriminate and there's no age to feel playful. In the 2003 film 'Baghban', Bachchan teamed up with Hema Malini to bring a folk Holi number, 'Hole Khele Raghuvira', that remains one of the most enthusiastic versions of cinematic Holi ever.advertisementIt was only a coincidence that the next Holi song which got added to the audience's Holi playlist was also from one of his films - 'Waqt: The Race Against Time'. The song 'Let's Play Holi' featured an extremely stylish Priyanka Chopra and Akshay Kumar. This is where the swag entered Holi celebrations on-screen.Later, Bhansali took the celebrations notches ahead by using Holi to add more aesthetics to his cinema. In his 'Goliyon Ki Rasleela: Ramleela', he used the festival to establish attraction. 'Lahu Muh Lag Gaya', featuring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's scintillating chemistry, gave the audience a taste of the seductive beauty on screen. Subtle but bewitching beauty! In the same year, Deepika appeared in another Holi special number, a hit with all generations - 'Balam Pichkari'. A modified folk number, the song became a raging symbol of celebration among youth, and was used for character enhancement in the film 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani'. This is where a timid and reserved Naina finds her inner badass diva, and goes all out. This is the point where that girl finds her confidence, embraces the colours, has fun, and agrees to live her life to the fullest.advertisementIn 2015, Deepika again took over the screens with grace in the Holi song 'Mohe Rang Do Laal'. This was also the time when Bhansali continued to express his fondness for the festival. He once again used the enigma that Deepika is, to highlight beauty, grace and the colour of seduction. 'Mohe Rang Do Laal', a classic number, became the setting for the titular characters to fall in love by gazing deep into each other's eyes.If you look at it, Holi has always been special to Hindi cinema. While our makers might still be learning about the representation of ethnicities and cultures in cinema, they have got the celebration bit right. They have got the colours right - of relationships, aspirations and heartbreaks. Holi could be one medium of expression in cinema, but it has never got out of style.

However, it looks like the obstacles in the path of this superhero film are far from being over. The Hrithik Roshan-starrer, which was earlier to be produced by Siddharth Anand's Marflix, will reportedly be under a new banner now as Anand has exited the project. Moreover, a new director will be roped in and Rakesh Roshan has confirmed that he is ""passing the baton."" Recent reports suggest that the budget of Krrish 4 is Rs 700 crore.  Bollywood Hungama reported that the estimated budget makes it challenging for studios to commit. Initially, Hrithik Roshan tasked his friend Siddharth Anand, who was involved as a producer, with finding a suitable studio. Concerns about the film's relevance in the post-Marvel era have led to studios' hesitance, resulting in Siddharth Anand and Marflix stepping away from the project. The report quoted a source, who said, ""The studios were not confident about Krrish at this budget in the post-Marvel era as it has been more than a decade since the release of Krrish 4."" The source further added, ""Hrithik and Rakesh Roshan had a closed-door meeting and have now decided to speak to studios all across India personally and lock a lucrative deal for the film. Krrish 4 will now be produced by FilmKraft with a leading studio, whereas Marflix will focus on other projects outside of Krrish."" The film will also be helmed by a new director as Karan Malhotra has also exited the film. A new creative team will reassess the budget before proceeding. Moreover, director Rakesh Roshan also confirmed that he will not don the director's hat. “The day has to come when I have to pass on the baton. So, it’s better I do it when I am in my senses, so that I can overlook the process as well and ascertain whether he’s doing it correctly or not. Tomorrow, if I am not in my senses and I’ll have to pass it on, I will not know what they are making,” Rakesh Roshan told Bollywood Hungama. He also remarked that there is no guarantee that his direction would ensure a blockbuster, acknowledging the need for change. Rakesh Roshan launched the Krrish franchise with the 2003 sci-fi film Koi Mil Gaya, featuring Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta. The film's success led to Krrish in 2006, starring Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra. Krrish 3 followed in 2013, with Hrithik, Priyanka, Vivek Oberoi, and Kangana Ranaut in key roles, further cementing the franchise's popularity.Published By: Zinia BandyopadhyayPublished On: Mar 16, 2025ALSO READ |  Hrithik Roshan to start Krrish 4 shoot after wrapping War 2: ReportMust Watch

d1b515a1-a37f-48b0-977d-0ef942f22896,Is Bollywood making money with multiple re-releases? Trade experts weigh inBollywood has been seeing a lot of classics being re-released in theatres. Trade experts spoke to India Today and shared their thoughts about the financials and whether it is a short-lived trend.,https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/bollywood-re-releases-minting-money-trade-experts-weigh-in-2694583-2025-03-17,"With a lull in new film releases, Bollywood has seen a surge in re-releases of past hits, hoping to capitalise on nostalgia and fill the content gap. But are these repeat screenings truly making money, or is it just a temporary experiment? India Today exclusively spoke to trade experts to decode the financial viability of re-releases. According to trade experts, the trend gained momentum with the success of films like 'Tumbbad', 'Sanam Teri Kasam', and 'Rockstar', which encouraged producers to re-release older films. However, the results have been mixed. While some movies have found renewed success, others have struggled to attract audiences. Unlike fresh theatrical releases, re-releases come with minimal marketing expenses. The production cost has already been recovered, and in most cases, theatres and distributors have worked on revenue-sharing models to reintroduce old films. This means that any earnings from re-releases are direct profit. Trade expert Taran Adarsh explained, “With the success of 'Tumbbad' and 'Sanam Teri Sanam', 'Rockstar', 'Laila Majnu', and other films, a lot of producers got the confidence to re-release the films. Now what has happened is that, obviously, there is a vacuum in the market in terms of new releases. So the producers of those films, or the studios associated with those films, are considering re-releasing their films because this is a trend right now. They're making a harvest at the box office. Here's the trailer of Tumbbad: advertisementHowever, not all re-releases are crowd-pullers. While 'Tumbbad', 'Sanam Teri Kasam' crossed Rs 50 crore in its re-release, many others fail to replicate similar success.   However, not all re-releases are crowd-pullers. While 'Tumbbad', 'Sanam Teri Kasam' crossed Rs 50 crore in its re-release, many others fail to replicate similar success. Taran stated, ""But not every film can hit gold at the end of the day. I mean, it has been noticed that last week there were a few more films, then there were big star-cast films which were re-released but didn't work at the box office. Right now, there are 'Sanam Teri Kasam' and 'Tumbbad' that people are watching, but they are not seeing the other 10 films that have gone for a toss, during the re-release. Maybe the original releases were superb and did remarkable business, but not during the repeat run. Now, repeat run is something that you try your hand at when there is no film in the market. So it's up to the audience whether they want to watch or not, and it's a very competitive market."" Trade expert Ramesh Bala added, ""One thing is that the pipeline of new releases is very limited in Bollywood this year. I think after Chhaava, none of the new movies did well. It's been four weeks now. So the studios have these movies already lying in the cans, and with minimal publicity, they are releasing them. Also, it is just to fill the gap between the two new releases as theatres need some content. If you have a 10-screen multiplex, there's no harm in giving one screen to a re-release, while the rest of the screens can play new Hollywood or Bollywood films. Some movies have made significant collections while others haven't done so. But a lot of people are jumping onto the bandwagon, and every week I see some announcement. They are not spending a lot of money on re-release - they are hoping at least it will make at least Rs10 crore or Rs 20 crore."" When asked if re-release is more of a marketing strategy than a financial necessity for the film industry, Taran said, ""It all boils down to financials. You are just following that trend because, as I said, those few films have worked at the box office. When they see those numbers, they get excited and there is no harm in thinking along those lines. But not every film is going to be a big grosser in a repeat run. Take, 'Sanam Teri Kasam', for example. It did not work when it was first released and ended up as a failure. I distinctly remember talking to the producers and the director after the film. The director, especially, was very heartbroken. Even the actor went into a shell. But the repeat run after so many years revived the film. The re-release has changed its status from a flop to a hit. Similarly, 'Tumbbad' never got its due when it was released. It is now a hit, after the re-release."" Here's the trailer of 'Sanam Teri Kasam': Decades ago, re-releases were a profitable business venture. “Unlike in the 70s and 80s, repeat runs used to be a big business and I know it because my father was a distributor. Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna, and Shashi Kapoor's films had a great market, and they used to be released alongside the new releases. There was no vacuum in those days of new releases, no dearth for new releases. Yet the repeat runs used to do so well at the box office. But today, I think, somewhere the audience has become very selective,"" Taran said.Taran added, ""The market was always there [for re-releases], but not for all films. Imagine Karan Arjun - with such a big star cast (Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan), the film did not work. 'Padmaavat' did not make money either. It all depends on what the audience wants to see and sometimes, out of the blue, there will be a 'Tumbbad' or a 'Rockstar', 'Sanam Teri Kasam'. 'Tumbbad' and 'Sanam Teri Kasam' are big eye-openers for the industry and their success has triggered the revival of the re-releases.""advertisementRamesh seconded the thought and stated, ""The trend will continue unless we have new releases every week. To be honest, every Friday or every other Friday you need a good big movie. Maybe one Ajay Devgn film, then two weeks later an Akshay Kumar film, and so on. If one is not getting that kind of release once a month, certainly the trend of re-releases will continue.""However, Taran stressed the fact that Bollywood needs a steady flow of new content. “Producers shouldn’t just cater to metro audiences. Films like 'Pushpa 2: The Rule' and 'Chhaava' have proven that audiences are eager for big-screen experiences. The key is giving them fresh, compelling stories.”Ramesh believed the re-release could affect the box office collection of new releases. ""It will impact. In some cases, if there is a craze for an old movie [with a big star cast], then it will do exceptionally well. I have seen this happen in the South. If a new movie that is releasing on a Friday doesn't have A-listers as part of the star cast and doesn't have a lot of things going for it, then Gen-Z kids might just go there just to have a good time with their friends. See if there is no competition and if somebody is bored and if there's no re-release, they'll definitely go for the new release even if it has received an average review.""For now, Bollywood’s re-release strategy remains a mix of calculated risk and rewarding nostalgia.Published By: K JananiPublished On: Mar 17, 2025ALSO READ  |  Explained: Business and future of the trend of Bollywood re-releasesTrending Reel

On Wednesday, Salman Khan shared a new poster of the film and wrote in the caption, ""See you in theatres worldwide on 30th March! #Sikandar (sic).""    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) A post shared by Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) This is not the first time Salman Khan has taken an unconventional approach to releasing his films. His 2023 film Tiger 3 was also released on a Sunday as it coincided with Diwali. However, trade experts questioned the decision, as the actor missed the opportunity to capitalise on the weekend before the festival. Addressing the decision, the VP of Distribution for Yash Raj Films, Rohan Malhotra, explained, “I always believe that it is absolutely fine to do the conventional, and there is no need to reinvent if there is no need for it. In this case, however, what came to our mind was that it is important for us not to look at the opening day numbers but to focus on what is eventually going to benefit the film. In the case of Tiger 3, we definitely felt that releasing on Laxmi Puja day, which is considered the weakest day to release a film, would be a better fit for our film.” Tiger 3, also starring Katrina Kaif and Emraan Hashmi, earned over Rs 280 crore at the box office. Sikandar, helmed by AR Murugadoss, also stars Rashmika Mandanna and Kajal Aggarwal. It is one of the most anticipated films of 2025.Published By: Arushi JainPublished On: Mar 20, 2025Must Watch

fc3b22c7-829a-4b2b-a015-c745c187a960,"'Kitne aadmi the?' Not enough to remember today's filmsBollywood's golden era gave us iconic dialogues, music, and moments. Today, films have become forgettable and do not have a lasting impact. Experts blame weak writing, fleeting music, and OTT overload for cinema's declining recall value.",https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/why-new-bollywood-films-lacks-iconic-dialogues-music-scenes-2696981-2025-03-22,"""Mogambo khush hua!"" ""Bade bade deshon mein aisi chhoti chhoti baatein hoti rehti hain!"" ""Kitne aadmi the?"" Reading these iconic dialogues instantly brings to mind the equally iconic characters that played them - Mogambo (Amrish Puri), Raj (Shah Rukh Khan), and Gabbar (Amjad Khan). These lines aren’t just words — they’re memories and moments that transport us back to the thrill of watching them unfold on screen. But here’s a question: can you recall a single dialogue or a scene from a film released in the last five years that has had the same impact? A dialogue that you use regularly while looking like a Bollywood nerd? Ever since the pandemic receded, I’ve been asking myself this. Have films stopped delivering those unforgettable moments or have we simply changed as an audience? Maybe the sheer volume of content has tangled our wires to retain any impactful dialogues? Or, maybe the comfort of streaming has made us less willing to venture back into darkened cinema halls. Or maybe, just maybe, nothing is compelling enough to make us return for a second viewing. Earlier, watching a film multiple times in theatres was the norm. Film trade analyst Taran Adarsh once watched Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan’s 'Abhimaan' three times on the same day. Can you imagine doing that for any recent release? If you look at the cinema of the 80s and 90s, it’s deeply ingrained in our collective memory - especially for those in their 30s and 40s right now. Back then, you could instantly tell apart a David Dhawan film from a Mahesh Bhatt one. A Nadeem-Shravan composition had a distinct flavour that set it apart from a Jatin-Lalit tune. It was an era when asking ""Holi kab hai (When is Holi)?"" was incomplete without someone chiming in, Gabbar-style - ""Holi kab hai, kab hai Holi?""

 



Amjad Khan played the iconic role of Gabbar Singh in Ramesh Sippy's Sholay.
 Aditya Chopra’s 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' gave us the ultimate wedding song with ""Mehendi Laga Ke Rakhna"", while Subhash Ghai’s 'Pardes' made ""I Love My India"" - a staple for school performances on Independence Day and Republic Day. Raj waiting for Simran at the railway station and Babuji (Amrish Puri) finally saying, 'Jaa Simran ja jee le apni zindagi', satiated the die-hard romantic in us. And if you wanted the perfect family entertainer, you had 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun'!WHY TODAY'S FILMS STRUGGLE WITH RECALL VALUE While these films continue to thrive in our memories, today's cinema feels more like fast food - quickly consumed and easily forgotten, as Taran Adarsh puts it. The veteran film critic, who has seen Bollywood evolve for over four decades, believes that today’s films lack strong writing. ""I grew up on 70s and 80s movies, I have seen that era. I still recall those films, songs, iconic lines and characters. Somewhere down the line, we are missing that. If you look at films today, where would you find that dialoguebaazi, that writing, those confrontations which you would look forward to? Earlier, there were so many multi-starrers. Today we don't make multi-starrers. Everyone wants to do solo projects,"" he expressed. The film trade expert also believes that it is all because of subpar writing. Sharing how he was once in the same room when prolific Indian filmmaker BR Chopra conducted a meeting with his team of writers, Taran said, ""We don't give importance to film writers, which used to happen earlier. The film directors and producers used to conduct meetings with their writers. Those things that you want in a film are not there."" But is weak writing the only culprit? Or has the sheer volume of content diluted our ability to retain impactful moments? Sometimes, I end up only scrolling through the list of shows and films on an OTT, only to have wasted half an hour without making a decision. And, it feels like they are all just emulating one another’s ever-expanding mix of content. That, however, is a discussion for another time. Kajol once aptly told Pinkvilla about the abundance of content available these days, ""People had a lot less to remember, so they remembered it much better.”PRODUCERS TODAY WANT READY-MADE SONGS OVER WHATSAPP To make it worse, Adarsh added, is the music. Songs today no longer serve the story. They have been reduced to mere marketing tools, often added for promotional value. Music is made for Instagram Reels. If it’s popular on Reels, then there’s excitement around it, otherwise who cares? Raise your hand if you know the 'Nadaaniyan' song 'Ishq Mein' beyond those 45 seconds that you heard on an Instagram reel just a few moments ago. ""Today's music is to see, not listen to. All they do is mount huge sets and make actors dance. A song doesn't work because it has been shot beautifully,"" popular music composer Lalit Pandit, known for crafting iconic music for 'DDLJ', 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar', 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai', among others, said while expressing his strong disapproval of today's film music. One reason for this shift, according to him, is the excessive interference from producers and directors. “Earlier, we had creative freedom. There wasn’t this kind of interference. Today, music directors are very talented, but how will they work if every song needs a producer’s or director’s approval?” he questioned. ""Producers today demand ready-made songs over WhatsApp. That’s not how music is made,"" Lalit Pandit argued, lamenting the loss of creative collaboration. ""Lyrics no longer hold meaning,"" he said, while adding, ""A song stays with you because of its words, not just its tune. That’s why Kishore Kumar’s songs still resonate, while today’s music is forgotten in weeks."" Despite his concerns, Lalit Pandit believes the hunger for good music still exists. ""Kesariya (from Alia-Ranbir's 'Brahmastra') became a hit because people are starving for quality music. If you try, it’s possible,” he said, offering hope that Bollywood can still find its way back to making timeless melodies. Just like songs, some of the films also gave us memorable moments. Case in point: 'Jawan' (Bete ko haath lagaane se pehle baap se baat kar), 'Animal' (sunai de raha hai, behra nahi hun main), 'Pushpa 2' (Flower nahi fire hai hum). These definitely have become a part of pop-culture. But as Taran Adarsh says, these are so fewer that you can count them on your fingers.  WE NEED WHOLESOME FILMS Popular Bollywood director Rakesh Roshan thinks that filmmakers need to bring back the ‘wholesome’ feeling. “Even if the films are doing well, they aren’t big box-office successes. It is just break-even revenue coming back, usi ko hit boldete hain (they call that a hit). You have to make a wholesome film; people are coming for entertainment. There is no romance or songs. Even if there are 2-3 tracks, they serve no function, koi sir per nahi hota hai. There is no point putting a peppy song at the end,” he told The Indian Express. Whether it’s dialogues, music, or storytelling, Bollywood's golden touch feels lost in an era of fleeting entertainment. But as Lalit Pandit says, the hunger for quality still exists - perhaps all it needs is the right film to reignite the magic.Published By: Arushi JainPublished On: Mar 22, 2025
