But, the 1800-ChatGPT feature is free for only 15 minutes. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-is-now-available-on-call-but-here-is-the-catch-2652073-2024-12-19,"OpenAI is offering users a new way to interact with its popular chatbot through a dedicated phone line: 1-800-CHATGPT. By dialing the US number (1-800-242-8478) or messaging via WhatsApp, users can now easily access the AI assistant through familiar communication channels. OpenAI announced the feature on Wednesday, emphasising that it provides a convenient and affordable way to explore ChatGPT. Initially, users will receive 15 minutes of free usage per month.
 


advertisement1800-ChatGPT: How does it work? Calls to the 1-800 number does not require an account, although OpenAI mentioned in a livestream that it is working on integrating WhatsApp messages with individual ChatGPT credentials for a more personalised experience. The tool was developed by the OpenAI team in just a few weeks, according to a company representative during the livestream. And the company has clearly stated that the phone calls will not be used to train the chatbot.
 


OpenAI views this new feature as a key step in making AI more accessible to newcomers, offering a simplified version of ChatGPT compared to its web-based platform. It provides an affordable way for users to experience technology through familiar channels. However, the company advises existing users who need more advanced features, higher usage limits, and personalisation options to continue using their regular ChatGPT accounts via traditional methods. The feature is currently exclusive for US users. 
 


Interestingly, Google launched a similar service in 2007 called GOOG-411, which provided free voice-based directory assistance. The service was discontinued in 2010 without an official explanation, but some speculate it was shut down once Google had collected enough voice data to improve its speech recognition technology. ChatGPT search can now be your default search engine In a similar development, ChatGPT Search will now be accessible to all users with an account on OpenAI's mobile apps and website. By offering an AI-driven alternative to traditional search engines, OpenAI aims to redefine the search experience, positioning itself as a formidable competitor to Google and other established players in the space. The integration of advanced natural language processing tools promises to enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results, making ChatGPT Search an appealing option for users looking for more than just a list of links. mbedded entity widgetmbedded entity mbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetPublished By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Trending Reel

In a recent post on Weibo, Instant Digital shared that their source confirmed the iPhone 17 Pro’s three-camera setup will remain in the triangular arrangement, even though the back of the phone will look different from earlier models. This directly challenges other recent reports coming out from China that claimed the new design would feature a horizontal bar or an elongated oval-shaped module. Apple’s triangular camera layout first appeared on the iPhone 11 Pro and was a big shift from the traditional vertical designs seen on earlier iPhones. The move to this layout wasn’t just about looks; it allowed Apple to fit in a third camera, which introduced the Ultra Wide lens, along with improved sensors and better overall performance. Since then, this triangular camera design has stuck around, shaping the look of every iPhone model up to the current iPhone 16 Pro. However, while the triangular layout might not be going away, the iPhone 17 Pro's design could still bring some big changes. According to Wayne Ma of The Information, the back of the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max may feature a new rectangular camera bump made out of aluminium instead of the usual 3D glass. The bottom half of the phone will reportedly remain glass to support wireless charging. If this is true, it would mark a big departure from Apple's traditional design choices. As mentioned above, Instant Digital has a mixed record when it comes to Apple leaks, but they’ve been right about some big details in the past. For example, they correctly predicted the 2023 launch of the Yellow iPhone 14, the frosted glass design of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and even the spatial video feature on the iPhone 15 Pro. They’ve also nailed details about the Apple Watch Series 9 and future iPads. While they’ve got things wrong before, their track record makes their insights worth paying attention to. So, while it seems clear that the iPhone 17 Pro’s design is changing, the exact details remain uncertain. For now, fans of the triangular camera layout can probably rest easy — or at least until Apple officially unveils the device. As with all rumours, it’s best to stay sceptical but curious.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

This flagship lineup will include the high-end OnePlus 13, the mid-range OnePlus 13R, and the new OnePlus Buds Pro 3 earbuds. Since the OnePlus 13 has already launched in the China market, ahead of the launch, we have a pretty good idea about what we can expect from the smartphone. There could be some little tweaks here and there, but we already know a lot about the OnePlus 13. Let’s dive into it.advertisementOnePlus 13: Specs and Features  DisplayThe OnePlus 13 features a 6.82-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and QHD+ resolution. It offers a peak brightness of 4,500 nits. There are also 2 standout upgrades to the OnePlus 13 over its predecessor. It includes:

- Dynamic local high refresh rate: The screen adjusts its refresh rate intelligently, conserving battery during less intensive tasks and ramping up for smoother performance during actions like scrolling.   Performance and battery Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The phone also packs a large 6,000mAh battery, a notable upgrade from the 5,400mAh unit in its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. OnePlus claims the battery can last nearly two days on a single charge.   For charging, the device supports 100W wired and 50W wireless charging, along with a new magnetic wireless charging feature via compatible cases. Camera specifications

While the 50-megapixel LYT-808 primary sensor remains unchanged, the telephoto and ultrawide cameras on the OnePlus 13 now feature 50-megapixel sensors as well.  The Hasselblad camera system also supports 4K/60fps Dolby Vision video recording. Build and other features

OnePlus 13’s durability gets a boost with IP68 and IP69 ratings. This means that the device is protected against dust and high-pressure water jets. Additional features include:  
- Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor: Allows unlocking the device even with wet hands.  
- Enhanced vibration motor: Designed for an immersive gaming experience.  OnePlus 13R and OnePlus Buds Pro 3 The OnePlus 13R will also be launching alongside the OnePlus 13 on January 7. The R-series by OnePlus caters to a more budget-friendly yet premium smartphone experience. While details about its specifications are scarce, it is expected to share some design and performance elements with the flagship model, albeit with scaled-down features. There are also rumours that the OnePlus Ace 5, which is scheduled to launch in China next week, will be rebranded as OnePlus 13R in India. Additionally, OnePlus will also be bringing the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 to the Indian market at the same event. These earbuds, already available in India, are likely to introduce a new variant with added features.OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R price and availability   While OnePlus hasn’t officially disclosed the pricing for the OnePlus 13, it is expected to stay under Rs 70,000, considering the OnePlus 12 was launched in India at Rs 64,999. The mid-range OnePlus 13R will likely offer a more affordable alternative. All devices will be available across major online and offline platforms post-launch.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

Here is everything we know about Nothing's next flagship phone, so far. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/nothing-phone-3-to-launch-next-year-price-specs-features-and-all-we-know-so-far-2652377-2024-12-19,"The Nothing Phone 3 has been delayed quite a bit. It was supposed to be launched earlier this year. It was then rumoured to be delayed by a few months, and then the company CEO Carl Pei clarified that we shouldn’t expect the Nothing flagship until 2025. All this delay was largely credited to an artificial intelligence (AI) integration that the company was working on. They said they wanted to get it right and not rush it. Fair point. However, we are now just days away from 2025, and the excitement for the Nothing Phone 3 is building once again.  Nothing has been fairly quiet about the Nothing Phone 3, but considering all the AI that has been teased for the phone, and that it is going to be the company’s next big flagship, there have been several reports that give us some idea what to expect from the phone.  The Nothing Phone 3 is expected to come with a bunch of new features, including an iPhone-like Action Button, and a 6.5-inch display, according to leaks. The Nothing Phone 3 is also expected to be accompanied by a Pro version –– the Nothing Phone 3 Pro –– which is believed to sport a larger 6.7-inch screen. The Action Button, inspired by a similar feature on the iPhone, is expected to offer customisable controls, enabling users to launch apps, switch settings, or create personalised shortcuts. This new feature underscores Nothing’s focus on user-centric innovations, and contemporary design trends.  While the Nothing Phone 2 uses a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset on a more premiumly-priced phone, the Phone 3 is anticipated to feature a more mid-range chipset, like the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 or MediaTek Dimensity 9200+. Which also gives us context about the possible pricing of the phone. The Nothing Phone 1 debuted in India at a starting price of Rs 32,999, while the Phone 2 missed the ball with a slightly higher price tag, where its base variant was priced starting Rs 44,999. The potential shift back to a mid-range offering could make the Phone 3 more accessible to a broader audience, while the Pro variant could cater to users seeking higher-end specifications. As per rumours, there is also going to be a third phone –– likely called the Nothing Phone 3a –– but rumours about it are still scarce. But the rumour does sound likely, considering Nothing launched the Nothing Phone 2a in India just earlier this year. You can also read our review of the Nothing Phone 2a.

According to the authorities, the company offered vague or insufficient information. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/netflix-fined-rs-423-crore-for-not-being-transparent-about-how-they-were-using-user-data-2652354-2024-12-19,"The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) has imposed a €4.75 million (Rs 42.35 crore) fine on Netflix for failing to adequately inform its customers about how their personal data was used between 2018 and 2020. The fine follows an investigation that began in 2019, revealing that the streaming giant did not meet the requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The DPA's investigation found that Netflix’s privacy policy lacked clarity, particularly in explaining how the company handled customer data. According to the authorities, the streaming service did not provide enough information in its privacy statement regarding the use and collection of personal data. Moreover, when customers enquired about the specifics of the data collected by Netflix, they were not given sufficient details. This lack of transparency constitutes a violation of the GDPR, which mandates that businesses must be clear about how personal information is handled and must respond appropriately when customers request data information.Netflix has objected to the fine The Dutch regulator emphasised that these shortcomings in Netflix’s data protection practices occurred between 2018 and 2020. The fine is a result of Netflix’s failure to meet its obligations under EU privacy laws during that period. In response to the fine, Netflix stated that it had been fully cooperative with the DPA throughout the investigation and had made significant improvements to its privacy policies. The company acknowledged that it had updated its privacy statement to offer greater transparency regarding how customer data is collected and used. Additionally, Netflix stressed that these changes were made proactively, long before the fine was issued. A spokesperson for Netflix informed Reuters, “Since the investigation began over five years ago, we have worked closely with the Dutch Data Protection Authority and continuously evolved our privacy information to provide greater clarity for our members. We have objected to this decision.”DPA against Netflix In a statement to another news agency, AFP, DPA chairman Aleid Wolfsen said: “A company like that, with a turnover of billions and millions of customers worldwide, has to explain properly to its customers how it handles their personal data. That must be crystal clear. Especially if the customer asks about this. And that was not in order.”  The data protection authority also noted that Netflix offered vague or insufficient information in various aspects. The regulator pointed out that Netflix was not clear about the purposes for collecting personal data, the sharing of data with third parties, the duration of data retention, and the security measures in place for data transfers outside of Europe. While Netflix has improved its transparency and compliance with GDPR regulations, the fine underscores the growing scrutiny of companies' handling of personal data, especially as data privacy continues to be a key issue in the digital age. This penalty marks a significant move by European regulators, who have been increasingly vigilant in enforcing GDPR rules against companies operating within the EU. The fine serves as a reminder that businesses must remain diligent in protecting personal data and providing customers with clear and comprehensive privacy policies.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  EU asks Apple to make more changes to the way iOS worksAlso read |  Apple has reportedly cancelled plans to launch an iPhone hardware subscription serviceAlso read |  Elon Musk says stop using hashtags on X because you don't need them and they look uglyMust Watch

This update is now gradually making its way to Nothing Phone 2 and Phone 2a users. If you own one of these devices, you may not see the update immediately as it’s being released in stages, so some users might have to wait several days or even weeks before it shows up. The company has mentioned that the rollout process could take until the end of the year to reach every device. To check if the update is available for your Nothing smartphone, you can manually look for it by heading to Settings > System Update. If it’s not there yet, don’t worry — it should arrive on your phone soon. The Nothing OS 3.0 stable update brings a lot of exciting features that aim to make the user experience smoother and more personal. One of the standout additions is the new Nothing Gallery app. It’s designed to help you find photos more easily with improved search options. You can also make quick edits to your pictures using simple tools like filters, markup, and smart suggestions. The lock screen has also been given a fresh look. You can now customise it to make it feel more like your own. One cool feature is the ability to add Shared Widgets to the lock screen, which lets you stay connected with friends and family. There’s also a Countdown Widget, so you can keep track of important events right from your lock screen. Another handy addition is the Smart Drawer, which uses AI to automatically organise your apps into folders. This can save you time by making it easier to find what you need. Other updates include revamped Quick Settings for faster access to controls, an improved Pop-up View for multitasking, and new system fonts that are cleaner and easier to read. While Nothing has revealed a lot of these features, they’ve hinted at other performance and visual improvements that haven’t been detailed yet. For those using other Nothing devices, there’s good news too. The update will roll out to the Nothing Phone 1, Nothing Phone 2a Plus, and CMF Phone 1 in early 2025.

The lineup includes the OnePlus Ace 5, which is expected to debut in India as the OnePlus 13R on January 7, 2025. While the Ace 5 Pro will also be unveiled in the series, the focus for Indian fans remains on the Ace 5, which will succeed the popular 12R model. This also puts the rumours to rest that suggested that OnePlus could be working on a ""mini"" smartphone, which was expected to launch as part of the Ace 5 series.  The OnePlus Ace 5 features an impressive set of features, making it an exciting device for gaming enthusiasts and power users alike. It is expected to come with a 6.78-inch BOE X2 8T LTPO display, offering a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Under the hood, the Ace 5 will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. But according to official China teasers, OnePlus is taking it up a notch by optimising the chip with its in-house “Fengchi Game Core” (translated from Chinese via Google Translate) technology. According to the company, this fine-tuning pushes the SoC’s performance to a level comparable to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.5, providing a smoother gaming experience with better power efficiency and heat management. In fact, the company claims the phone can maintain a steady 120fps frame rate even after five hours of heavy gaming. In terms of memory and storage, the OnePlus Ace 5 is expected to offer up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. A massive 6,000mAh battery is also rumoured, which should keep the phone going all day long. Charging won’t be an issue either, as the Ace 5 supports 100W fast-wired charging. For photos and videos, there could be a triple-camera setup on the back. The phone is expected to feature a 50-megapixel primary camera with OIS, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 2-megapixel macro lens. On the front, there will likely be a 16-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. The OnePlus Ace 5 will run on ColorOS 15 based on Android 15. However, the Indian version of the phone, i.e. the OnePlus 13R, is expected to boot OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15. Other features include an IR blaster along with the classic alert slider that many OnePlus fans love.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The rumour indicates that Apple plans to include the SE 4 in the iPhone 16 lineup and, might call it the iPhone 16e. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-may-be-called-the-iphone-16e-launch-timeline-price-and-all-we-know-2652121-2024-12-19,"A recent leak suggests that Apple might rebrand the upcoming toned-down version, iPhone SE 4, as the iPhone 16e. The speculations are that the phone could debut in March 2025. The Weibo tipster Fixed focus digital posted that the company may be dropping the SE branding altogether, and instead, it will add the SE 4 to the iPhone 16 line-up. The rumour has it that the phone is expected to carry several iPhone 16 features, including camera and display specs. If this holds to be true, the iPhone 16e makes a lot of sense. Let's delve deeper into the details of the upcoming iPhone 16e. advertisementiPhone SE 4 rebranding as iPhone 16e: What to expect It looks like the iPhone SE 4 or 16e is shaping up to be a significant upgrade compared to its predecessors. The shift from the iPhone 8-inspired design to one more in line with the iPhone XR or iPhone 12 will provide a more modern and immersive user experience. The larger 6.06-inch OLED display, compared to the previous 4.7-inch LCD, will enhance the overall viewing quality, making it more comparable to the high-end iPhones. The move away from the Touch ID home button in favour of Face ID is another major change, modernising the device further by slimming down the bezels. This will make the phone more in line with Apple's design language in their latest models. Additionally, the Weibo tipster also reveals that the iPhone 16e will have the same screen size as the standard iPhone 16 and will feature a full-screen design.

Additionally, the Weibo tipster also reveals that the iPhone 16e will have the same screen size as the standard iPhone 16 and will feature a full-screen design. With the rumoured A18 chipset, the 16e will have a substantial performance boost, bringing it closer to the iPhone 16 series in terms of processing power. The increase to 8GB of RAM (up from 4GB) is especially notable, offering better multitasking capabilities and support for more demanding apps, including Apple's latest AI and machine learning features. Combined with 128GB of storage, this represents a substantial upgrade in terms of performance and user experience. This update suggests that the iPhone 16e will be positioned as a more affordable but still powerful alternative for users who want the latest hardware in a more compact and budget-friendly package. The inclusion of a 48-megapixel rear camera in the iPhone 16e would be a major upgrade, aligning it with the capabilities of the iPhone 16. If the SE 4 or 16e indeed adopts the same camera setup, it would mark a significant leap for Apple’s budget-friendly lineup, offering a similar level of photography performance to the higher-end models. The 48-megapixel ""Fusion"" lens, as seen in the iPhone 16, allows for both high-quality standard and 2x zoom photos without sacrificing detail, which would be a notable feature for the 16e. This camera system could enable much sharper, more versatile photography, especially for users who are upgrading from older SE models that have more basic camera setups. Additionally, the 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera would improve selfies and video calls, further enhancing the device's overall imaging capabilities. This front camera is likely to bring improved depth-sensing and portrait mode features, thanks to its advanced technology. iPhone 16e or SE 4: India price (Expected) Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has revealed that Apple will begin mass production of the fourth-generation iPhone SE in December. The company plans to manufacture approximately 8.6 million units of the new model during the first quarter of 2025, with a possible launch in March or April, according to Kuo's recent blog post.  Leaks indicate that the iPhone SE 4 will be priced between $499 and $549, reflecting an increase from the iPhone SE 3’s starting price of $429. In India, where the SE 3 was launched at Rs 43,900, the iPhone 16e or SE 4 is expected to be priced between Rs 51,000 and Rs 56,000.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  iPhone 17 Pro design details leaked online, will Apple make changes to it?Also read |  Apple has reportedly cancelled plans to launch an iPhone hardware subscription serviceAlso read |  EU asks Apple to make more changes to the way iOS worksMust Watch

The JioTag Go is designed to help users track their belongings, such as keys, wallets, luggage, and more. It features Bluetooth v5.3 connectivity, and is powered by a CR2032 battery, which promises up to one year of usage.   When within Bluetooth range, users can activate the Play Sound option via the Find My Device app, prompting the tracker to emit a beeping noise for easy identification. If the tracker is outside Bluetooth range, the app uses the Find My Device network to show its last known location on a map, along with navigation assistance to reach the spot.   The compact device measures 38.2 x 38.2 x 7.2mm and weighs just 9g. However, the JioTag Go is only compatible with Android smartphones running Android 9 or later, excluding iPhone users.  Jio’s tracker evolution The JioTag Go is Reliance Jio's second foray into Bluetooth trackers this year. In July, the company launched the JioTag Air, which is compatible with Apple’s Find My network and supports both iPhones (iOS 14 and later) and Android devices. With these two trackers, Jio has strategically catered to users of both major ecosystems, broadening its market appeal.  JioTag Go: How it stacks up against Apple AirTag At Rs 1,499, the JioTag Go is significantly more affordable than Apple’s AirTag, which is priced at Rs 3,490 in India. While the AirTag offers advanced features like ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for precision tracking and seamless integration with Apple devices, the JioTag Go stands out as a cost-effective solution for Android users with reliable Bluetooth tracking and Find My Device network support.

This law aims to stop large tech companies from using their power unfairly. However, the European Union (EU) now wants Apple to do even more. The EU is asking Apple to make iOS work better with other platforms and to share features and technologies that are currently exclusive to Apple. According to Bloomberg, the European Commission released a document on Wednesday as part of its antitrust investigation into Apple. In the document, the EU lists specific changes it wants Apple to make. For example, it asks Apple to allow users to easily connect devices like smartwatches and headphones from other brands with iPhones. Right now, it’s often easier to use Apple accessories like AirPods and Apple Watches. The EU also wants Apple to let third-party apps work fully in the background. Currently, only Apple’s first-party apps can do this. The document also mentions that features like AirPlay and AirDrop should be open to devices that aren’t made by Apple. The EU has set a deadline of January 9, 2025, to review this case. If Apple doesn’t comply, the EU could start a formal investigation. This could lead to Apple paying fines of up to 10 per cent of its global annual revenue. That’s a huge amount of money for the company. Apple has responded by pushing back against the EU’s demands. In an online document, Apple argued that the DMA rules could harm user privacy and security. The company said it’s being unfairly targeted and claimed that opening up its technologies would make iPhones less safe. Apple also pointed out that companies like Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) have been asking for access to sensitive iOS features. Apple argues that if it grants all of Meta’s requests, it could allow apps like Facebook to track users’ calls, messages, and activities. The company said it has deliberately chosen not to collect this kind of data to protect its users. Meanwhile, Meta says it needs access to Apple’s features to improve products like Ray-Ban smart glasses and Meta Quest headsets. Apple counters by saying its current system already allows these devices to work with iPhones without any special permissions. This isn’t just an EU issue. In Brazil, regulators are also pushing Apple to open up its ecosystem. Apple is fighting that decision but might have to allow sideloading there as well. As the January 2025 deadline approaches, Apple’s next steps will be closely watched by regulators, developers, and users worldwide.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

However, reports suggest that Apple is no longer working on the project. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-has-reportedly-cancelled-plans-to-launch-its-iphone-hardware-subscription-service-2652085-2024-12-19,"Apple has reportedly stopped developing its much-anticipated iPhone hardware subscription service, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Initially unveiled in early 2022, the program was designed to offer users an alternative way to access Apple’s flagship devices by paying a recurring fee, enabling subscribers to receive a new iPhone each year. Despite its promising concept, the project has faced multiple delays and is now officially discontinued.   The service, which was part of Apple’s growing subscription ecosystem, was delayed due to technical challenges, including software bugs, and regulatory concerns. Originally slated for launch the same year, it was announced, which was 2022, the project has since been deprioritised, with team resources reportedly redirected to other initiatives within the company.   This decision comes on the heels of Apple’s discontinuation of Apple Pay Later , a feature that allowed users to split payments into instalments. Despite its recent launch, Apple Pay Later was shuttered after a brief run, signalling a potential shift in Apple’s approach to financial services tied to its hardware ecosystem.  Alternative payment options remain  While the hardware subscription service will not move forward, Apple continues to offer various payment plans for customers seeking flexibility in purchasing its devices. The iPhone Upgrade Program allows users to finance a new iPhone and AppleCare+ coverage over 24 months. Subscribers can upgrade to a new iPhone after making payments equivalent to 12 months.   For those with an Apple Card, Apple Card Monthly Installments provide another way to spread out the cost of new Apple products, including iPhones, over time. These options remain part of Apple’s strategy to make its devices accessible while maintaining customer loyalty.   The iPhone hardware subscription service represented a bold move to solidify Apple’s dominance in the smartphone market. By tying customers to a recurring payment model, the company could have ensured a steady revenue stream and reinforced user retention. However, the challenges of launching such a service in an increasingly scrutinized regulatory landscape may have outweighed its potential benefits.   Apple’s focus now appears to lean more heavily on its suite of digital subscription services, such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple One bundles. These offerings have proven successful in building a recurring revenue model while complementing the company’s hardware business.   Despite this strategic shift, Apple’s existing payment plans provide consumers with flexible alternatives, ensuring that its devices remain within reach for a broad audience. However, the shelving of the hardware subscription service may leave some wondering what could have been for the Cupertino tech giant.

Until now, it might have been the case that its devices were not powerful enough for AAA games. Now they are, and Apple might do well to create a new Apple TV that can challenge Xbox and PlayStation in gaming. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/talking-points/story/apple-needs-to-make-apple-tv-that-can-run-aaa-games-challenge-xbox-and-playstation-2651840-2024-12-18,"Technology journalists who keep a close eye on Apple know one thing with certainty every time they cover the company's call analysts after its quarterly results. They know that Gene Munster, an analyst, would ask Apple when the company is releasing its television. Munster has done that for years, quarter after quarter. But so far no television from Apple has appeared. Now, there are reports again that an Apple TV — the actual big-screen television and not the streaming box that Apple already sells — is in work again. Possibly, we will see an Apple television come out of the company's labs and factories in a few months, or more likely in a few years. But I believe that instead of a television it should create a different Apple TV.  A different Apple TV, which is more than a streaming box, is now such a low-hanging fruit that it would be almost a sacrilege on the part of Apple to not do it. All the ingredients are there for Apple to create an Apple TV that is not only a streaming box but is also a gaming console similar to the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.  Look at it from this angle: for a device like the Xbox Series X or the PlayStation 5 Pro, there are three essential components. One, is the chipset that gives these consoles the ability to run games. Two, the gaming ecosystem and availability of games people would want to play. And three, people willing to buy it. Apple already, I believe, has two of these components. The M4 is powerful enough In terms of hardware, Apple is already at the level of the latest Xbox and Playstation. The Xbox Series X has a chip made by AMD. It has a performance of around 12 Tflops. The PlayStation 5 Pro, which is a slightly beefed up variant of PS5, also has a chip made by AMD and that chip performs at around 16 Tflops. These numbers are in line with what the M4 Pro and the M4 Max, the latest Apple chips, can offer through their graphics units. The numbers for Apple chips range from 8 Tflops to 17 Tflops depending on the variant but it is safe to say that if Apple wants to have a chip that is equivalent to the chips in the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X  it can do so tomorrow just by tuning and binning one of the M4s. 

 



M4 Max is already as powerful as chipsets in the latest Xbox and PlayStation 5.
 In fact, Apple has chips that are significantly faster. The Ultra variant of the M3 has a graphics core that is already over 20 Tflops. And some variants of the M4 Ultra, which is bound to come out in 2025, are likely to be close to 30 Tflops, offering almost double the horsepower that PlayStation or Xbox can manage.  Apple has also, by putting these chips in the MacBook Pro and Mac Mini, demonstrated that they can go into small boxes without requiring elaborate cooling. In other words, except the economics that I am not privy to, nothing is stopping Apple from putting one of these ultra-fast M series chips in Apple TV and then turning that into a gaming console.  The third part of the equation — consumers — too I believe are there. According to some research firms, there are around 34 million Apple TVs in use in the US in 2024. Even if we are a little more conservative in estimates, it is safe to say that there would easily be around 55-60 million active Apple TVs worldwide, which is not a small number for a device that is not ""essential"" like an iPhone or Mac. In fact, Apple rarely promotes Apple TV and so far has been happy keeping it almost like a side project, updating it every two or three years. If this small box, apart from performing its streaming and entertainment duties, can also help people play AAA games, I am certain that it would find more favour among consumers. AAA games needed The tricky for Apple, however, is the second component: the availability of AAA games. But this too, I believe, can be solved by a more robust Apple TV. In recent years it has become important for Apple to crack the AAA games puzzle. The company is trying — hence Hideo Kojima at last year's WWDC in Cupertino — but so far the games haven't appeared. Nowadays whenever I am reviewing something with the M series chipset in it, I find that it is missing AAA games that hold it back. Something like a MacBook Pro M4 is an incredibly powerful laptop, but for a lot of regular consumers, it is an overkill. Less than stellar availability of top games is keeping a lot of consumers away from the MacBook Pro. A lot of people want to work and play. And not just work on their Rs 2 lakh laptop. Unless they are editing videos, or doing programming or running simulations, they don't need the power that chips like M4 Pro or the M4 Max offer.  An incredible list of AAA games — think the latest Call of Duty — will make Apple computers even more attractive than they are. And an Apple TV, which has a robust graphics chip, might entice more game developers to come to Apple camp and create games for it.  In a way — but not entirely because I think matters of business, Apple's cut in purchase and the entire cost-benefit ratio are also there — the lack of AAA games on Apple platforms could be a chicken and egg problem for game developers. What comes first? Games or the devices that can play them? Previously, Apple didn't have chipsets that could be used for serious gaming, and while it could always use a graphics chip by AMD or Nvidia to make its platform more gaming-friendly, probably the math never worked out. Now, however, Apple has an opportunity to do so.  Personally, in my drawing room under the TV I will love a device that can be a do-it-all box. Apple, I believe, has an opportunity to create one such box. The company can potentially call it Apple TV Pro. The price, obviously, will go up because such a box would also need a bigger chip and associated gaming hardware such as more storage. But if it competes with Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 Pro, which are priced above Rs 50,000, I am not sure if consumers would mind a reasonable hike in price.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

Priced at Rs 3,499, these outdoor speakers look cool and sound great. More details on it in this review by India Today Tech. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/xiaomi-sound-outdoor-speaker-review-affordable-price-great-sound-cool-design-2651719-2024-12-18,"Xiaomi recently launched a range of mid-budget devices in India, including the Redmi Note 14 series, Redmi Buds 6, and Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. We have reviewed the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ and the Redmi Buds 6. We have also been testing the Xiaomi speakers and it is such a fun device. At Rs 3,499, the speaker looks good, they are portable, they sound great, and of course, they are priced very well. Yes, the speaker has some issues, but they are smaller things that aren't ignorable –– for most people. Let’s get into the details. advertisementXiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: The good thingsThe Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is a total green flag at this price segment. It is equipped with a 30W driver with dual subwoofer. Weighing 597g, the device is light and easily portable. The speaker is enveloped with a grille structure that helps grip the device easily. Additionally, it has an in-built loop to make it easier to carry. By the looks of it, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor design is similar to the Sony ULT Field 1, which is priced at Rs 16,990. The Xiaomi speaker is cylindrical and sleek –– a design that quickly catches the eye. We received the black variant, but it is also available in blue and red.

 



The Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker’s body has a running grille pattern with its branding etched on the face.
While other colours feature a monochromatic pattern, this one has an orange strap in contrast. The strap runs along the back of the device like a spine and sports three buttons: power, Bluetooth and linking. All these buttons require a long press to function. For instance, you have to long press the power button for 3 seconds to switch the speakers on or off. It goes the same for Bluetooth settings as well. There are three additional buttons placed on the mesh of the speakers that are dedicated for play/pause, increasing and decreasing volume. The buttons are clicky and offer good haptic feedback. 

 



The connect button can only be used with multiple Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. Long press the connect button on the strap for 3s on each speaker, and all speakers will pair automatically playing the same content. The Type-C charging port is also placed on the strap.
For durability, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor comes with IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Overall, Xiaomi's latest speaker offers a solid, well-built design that stands out in both form and function. advertisementBut this is not its best part. The best part is its “big speaker energy”. For its size and price, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is capable of filling small to medium-sized rooms pretty well. It delivers a clear and consistent sound quality. The bass delivers a strong punch without overshadowing the mids and highs, maintaining a well-balanced sound profile. This ensures that the audio output remains clear and detailed across different frequencies and a wide range of music genres. 
 


At a price of Rs 3,499, it is equipped with dual large subwoofer radiators on both the sides for a fuller and richer bass sound. Whether you're listening to bass-heavy tracks or more vocal-centric tunes, the sound is dynamic and full, with no one element dominating.The speaker is also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, offering stable connections. It is super easy to connect to the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker. Additionally, the speaker includes a 3.5mm audio jack, providing the flexibility for wired connections, further enhancing its versatility. advertisementComing to the battery life, this speaker does a good job. With a full charge and volume set between 80-90 percent, the speaker offers up to 10 hours of playback, making it ideal for most scenarios such as parties, day outings, or even an entire workday. I took the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker to a party and it played music for 4 hours non-stop. In that time, its battery dropped only 20 per cent. 
 


Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: Things that could be betterAs we mentioned above, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is great, but it has a few drawbacks. The speakers are missing LED indicators. Sure, it isn’t a critical feature, but it definitely adds more functionality to the design. And since we are talking about what could be, some RGB lights on it would be a cool addition. And no, at its price, expecting RGB lights isn’t outrageous. Boat Stone Spinx Pro sports dynamic RGB lights, and the speaker is priced at Rs 2,499. advertisementA subjectively bigger flaw in the speaker is that it only connects via Bluetooth. There are no AUX or other connectivity options.  Xiaomi Sound Outdoor: Should you buy it? For fear of repeating ourselves a third time, Xiaomi Sound Outdoor isn't perfect, but its list of Pros is definitely longer than the Cons. The speaker has great design and sound quality, a solid battery life, and it’s water-resistant. With all that, at Rs 3,499, the speaker comes highly recommended from our side.

The strap runs along the back of the device like a spine and sports three buttons: power, Bluetooth and linking. All these buttons require a long press to function. For instance, you have to long press the power button for 3 seconds to switch the speakers on or off. It goes the same for Bluetooth settings as well. There are three additional buttons placed on the mesh of the speakers that are dedicated for play/pause, increasing and decreasing volume. The buttons are clicky and offer good haptic feedback. 

 



The connect button can only be used with multiple Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. Long press the connect button on the strap for 3s on each speaker, and all speakers will pair automatically playing the same content. The Type-C charging port is also placed on the strap.

 For durability, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor comes with IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Overall, Xiaomi's latest speaker offers a solid, well-built design that stands out in both form and function.  But this is not its best part. The best part is its “big speaker energy”.  For its size and price, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is capable of filling small to medium-sized rooms pretty well. It delivers a clear and consistent sound quality. The bass delivers a strong punch without overshadowing the mids and highs, maintaining a well-balanced sound profile. This ensures that the audio output remains clear and detailed across different frequencies and a wide range of music genres. 
 


 At a price of Rs 3,499, it is equipped with dual large subwoofer radiators on both the sides for a fuller and richer bass sound. Whether you're listening to bass-heavy tracks or more vocal-centric tunes, the sound is dynamic and full, with no one element dominating. The speaker is also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, offering stable connections. It is super easy to connect to the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker. Additionally, the speaker includes a 3.5mm audio jack, providing the flexibility for wired connections, further enhancing its versatility.  Coming to the battery life, this speaker does a good job. With a full charge and volume set between 80-90 percent, the speaker offers up to 10 hours of playback, making it ideal for most scenarios such as parties, day outings, or even an entire workday. I took the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker to a party and it played music for 4 hours non-stop. In that time, its battery dropped only 20 per cent. 
 


Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: Things that could be better As we mentioned above, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is great, but it has a few drawbacks.  The speakers are missing LED indicators. Sure, it isn’t a critical feature, but it definitely adds more functionality to the design. And since we are talking about what could be, some RGB lights on it would be a cool addition. And no, at its price, expecting RGB lights isn’t outrageous. Boat Stone Spinx Pro sports dynamic RGB lights, and the speaker is priced at Rs 2,499.  A subjectively bigger flaw in the speaker is that it only connects via Bluetooth. There are no AUX or other connectivity options.  Xiaomi Sound Outdoor: Should you buy it?  For fear of repeating ourselves a third time, Xiaomi Sound Outdoor isn't perfect, but its list of Pros is definitely longer than the Cons. The speaker has great design and sound quality, a solid battery life, and it’s water-resistant. With all that, at Rs 3,499, the speaker comes highly recommended from our side.

One of the rising concerns is the increasing number of QR code scams, which are catching people off-guard. Scammers are tricking users into scanning fraudulent QR codes, leading to the loss of large sums of money in seconds. Here is how QR code scams work and how you can protect yourself from them.advertisementHow do QR code scams work?QR codes are typically seen as a quick and easy way to make payments, but they have become a tool for scammers. In a QR code scam, the victim is presented with a fake or malicious QR code, often in places where trust is assumed, such as local shops, delivery services, or social media platforms. A scammer generates a QR code that appears to be linked to a legitimate transaction but instead triggers a money transfer to the scammer’s account. The victim scans the code, thinking they are paying for a product or service, but unknowingly authorises a transfer of funds to the scammer. A QR code could also include a fake APK link, which can ask you to download a malicious app or software to gain access to your bank details and other personal data. In some cases, this automatically downloads onto your device once you click on the fake URL present in the QR codes.

Do this to avoid QR code scams in online payments When making a UPI payment, it is better to transfer money directly to the recipient's verified UPI ID or mobile number instead of relying on QR codes, especially if you are unsure of the source. Scammers often exploit the trust people place in QR codes to disguise fraudulent transactions. Be cautious of scanning QR codes in unfamiliar locations or businesses that seem suspicious. Scammers can easily place fake QR codes in public places like restaurants, kiosks, or markets. Always ensure that the QR code belongs to a legitimate and trusted merchant before proceeding with the payment. For additional safety, consider creating a separate bank account that you link solely to your UPI platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe, or Paytm. Keep only a minimal amount (e.g., Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000) in this account. Even if a scam occurs, this measure limits the amount of money you can lose. This approach adds an extra layer of protection to your main savings account, ensuring larger amounts remain untouched in case of fraud. If you receive any suspicious payment requests or links, be sure to cross-check the URL or payment details. Fraudulent links often contain minor spelling errors or unusual domain names that differ from official websites. Taking a moment to verify can save you from falling into a scam.

Recently, there have been multiple incidents of scams involving QR codes, including a case where a police officer lost Rs 2.3 lakh after scanning a fraudulent QR code at a bakery. Now, a new scam involving DHL package delivery has surfaced, causing concerns among citizens who are receiving suspicious notifications. A DHL package delivery notice has been circulating on WhatsApp and X (previously Twitter), warning people not to scan the QR code printed on the paper. The message reads, ""New scam. They will leave this at the door. Do not scan the QR code.""  According to people who have received this poster, this notice is being delivered to their doorstep, which includes a QR code and a prompt to ""re-arrange your delivery now by following 3 simple steps."" The first step asks recipients to scan the QR code to visit the DHL website, followed by entering their DHL Waybill number to choose delivery options.  However, DHL has cleared up the confusion. The company's official DHL Express India account on X (formerly Twitter) responded to a tweet about the so-called scam, clarifying that this notice is legitimate. While this may not be a scam, it is important to remember that QR code scams are the easiest way for scammers to dupe people because these codes could include a malicious link, which a user can click and lose big money in any other scam. ""The paper in the shared image is a legitimate Customer Notification document issued by DHL Express and is commonly referred to as a Not Home (NH) card,"" DHL stated, explaining that the notice is from DHL Singapore and is not a scam. While the paper notice is authentic, a separate scam involving a fake DHL SMS is also making rounds. The fraudulent text message claims, ""Your package is currently processing at our facility. For the most up-to-date information on import charges, please visit our website: http://dhlhub.com.""   The URL in the SMS is not an official DHL link, suggesting that this is a scam aimed at deceiving users into clicking on a malicious link. To protect themselves, users are advised to be cautious when interacting with QR codes, links, and messages from unknown sources. Checking for minor details such as incorrect URLs, poorly written English, or unusual fonts can help identify a scam. It is always safer to verify the legitimacy of such messages directly through official channels or customer service to avoid falling victim to these schemes.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

For anyone looking to get a stylish, feature-packed phone without burning a hole in their pocket, this one might just be worth your consideration. Poco has always focused on delivering speed, power, and value, and this phone seems to stick to that winning formula. Here's a quick look at the 4 reasons why you should consider buying the Poco M7 Pro and one reason you might want to think twice.advertisementPoco M7 Pro 5G: 4 reasons to buyA stunning 120Hz displayThe Poco M7 Pro 5G comes with a 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED display that is not only smooth, thanks to its 120Hz refresh rate, but also incredibly bright for a phone in the sub-Rs 15,000 price segment. With a peak brightness of 2,100 nits, Poco claims this to be one of the brightest displays in its price segment. That means you can comfortably use the phone outdoors in bright sunlight without any issues (though I’ll have to wait for a sunny day to test it myself!). Rest assured, the colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and the overall experience is top-notch for streaming, gaming, and everyday use.

Rest assured, the colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and the overall experience is top-notch for streaming, gaming, and everyday use. Sleek and lightweight design Poco has nailed the design with this phone. The M7 Pro feels great to hold, thanks to its lightweight build and slim profile. It doesn’t have a glass back like its predecessor, but the plastic back with a pastel two-tone finish still looks gorgeous. The Lavender shade, in particular, stands out without being flashy. It’s a phone you’d enjoy carrying around. It feels comfortable, easy to handle, and doesn’t weigh you down like some bulky devices in this range. Reliable performance and battery life Under the hood, the Poco M7 Pro 5G packs the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra processor, which delivers good performance for daily tasks. Whether you’re scrolling through social media, messaging, or running basic apps, the phone runs smoothly. It also has up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which ensures multitasking is hassle-free. On the battery front, Poco has included a 5110mAh battery that easily lasts over a day with moderate usage. The icing on the cake is the 45W fast charging support, and yes, the charger is included in the box! 50MP camera with OIS Cameras are often a deciding factor when buying a phone, and Poco delivers well here. The M7 Pro has a 50MP Sony LYTIA LYT-600 primary camera with OIS (optical image stabilisation), which is a rare feature in this price range. This means steadier photos and videos, especially in low-light conditions. There’s also a 2MP macro camera for close-up shots and a 20MP selfie camera that does a decent job for video calls and selfies.Poco M7 Pro 5G: 1 reason to skip Limited software support Now, here’s the catch — while the Poco M7 Pro 5G runs on Android 14 with HyperOS, Poco is only promising two years of OS updates along with four years of security patches. That means the phone will get main OS updates only up to Android 16. In a world where brands like Samsung offer longer update cycles even on budget phones, this feels like a missed opportunity. To make matters worse, the phone doesn’t come with Android 15 out of the box, which would have been a nice touch for a brand-new device.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

They can mislead people into clicking on videos, only to find content that doesn't match their expectations.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/new-youtube-rules-in-india-as-platform-bans-videos-with-clickbait-titles-2652709-2024-12-20,"YouTube is stepping up its fight against misleading content, especially in India. The platform recently announced that it will be cracking down on videos with misleading titles and thumbnails, often called ""egregious clickbait."" This is part of YouTube's ongoing effort to ensure viewers have a trustworthy experience when they visit the platform, particularly for news and current events. What does this mean for creators? Essentially, YouTube plans to increase enforcement against videos whose title or thumbnail promises something the actual video does not deliver. For instance, a video titled ""The President Has Resigned!"" might attract attention. However, if the video itself doesn't discuss such a resignation, it would fall under the category of ""egregious clickbait."" Similarly, a thumbnail that claims ""Top Political News"" but features no real news would also be flagged. Clickbait titles and thumbnails have long been a frustration for YouTube viewers. They can mislead people into clicking on videos, only to find content that doesn't match their expectations. This not only wastes time but also erodes trust in the platform. YouTube says that this issue becomes even more serious when it involves breaking news or current events, as people often rely on the platform to get timely and accurate information during important moments. To address this, YouTube will start rolling out stricter measures in India over the coming months. The company explained that this gradual rollout will give creators time to adapt to the new rules. Initially, YouTube will focus on removing videos that violate the new policy without issuing strikes against creators' channels. The goal is to educate creators and help them adjust their content to align with the updated guidelines. One of the reasons for starting this enforcement in India is the high volume of news and current events-related content uploaded by Indian creators. As YouTube's user base in India continues to grow, the platform wants to ensure that viewers are not being misled by sensational or dishonest titles and thumbnails. The new policy will prioritise recent uploads, meaning older videos that violate the rules may not be the immediate focus of enforcement. However, creators are encouraged to review their existing content and make the necessary adjustments to avoid future issues. YouTube is also planning to offer educational resources to help creators understand what qualifies as ""egregious clickbait"" and how to stay compliant with the platform's policies. For viewers, this is a welcome move. Misleading titles and thumbnails often leave people feeling tricked or frustrated. By enforcing these new rules, YouTube hopes to create a better experience for its users, where they can trust the videos they click on to deliver the content they were promised. As these changes are rolled out, it will be interesting to see how creators in India respond and adapt to the new guidelines.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

 The teaser gave us a glimpse of how the AI preserves details, even during rapid movements. For instance, when Mosseri moved his arms or face, the edited elements like his outfit and added objects remained impressively intact. But as polished as these previews look, we've seen similarly dazzling demos from competitors like OpenAI’s Sora, which when released, didn’t fully meet expectations.

The Movie Gen AI model was unveiled in October. At the time of launch, the company had said that the AI model aims to “preserve human identity and motion”. While the timeline for its wider availability remains unclear, Instagram’s Adam Mosseri says it will roll out sometime next year. The feature enters a competitive space, going head-to-head with other AI video tools like Adobe’s Firefly, which is already making waves with beta text-to-video editing in Premiere Pro.When is the big launch? Adman Mosseri revealed in his Instagram announcement that the AI tool is expected to roll out in 2025. The exact timeline for the launch has not been revealed. We are hoping the tool will start rolling out soon because if the final product lives up to its teaser, creators could soon edit videos with unprecedented ease, making Instagram a more dynamic playground for creativity.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Trending Reel

With online scams becoming more frequent, this initiative is a step toward ensuring safer digital transactions for everyone. Shield offers a comprehensive protection plan that safeguards users from fraud, phishing attempts, and unauthorised transactions, even if the user loses their phone. What makes Shield appealing is its accessibility and affordability. For the first 30 days, users can enjoy the service for free. After the trial period, it costs just Rs 19 per month, which is a small price to pay for peace of mind. The plan provides coverage of up to Rs 5,000 against fraudulent activities. Getting started with Shield is easy. The service is available on the BharatPe app, which can be downloaded on both Android and iOS devices. Users can activate Shield directly from the app’s homepage by clicking on the relevant banner. However, first-time users must make a payment of at least Rs 1 to any contact or business to activate the feature. If a user faces a fraudulent situation, registering a claim is also straightforward. BharatPe has partnered with OneAssist to streamline the process. Users can either download the OneAssist app or call their toll-free number, 1800-123-3330, to report the incident. However, there’s a crucial requirement — users must report the fraud within 10 days of it happening to be eligible for a claim. Depending on the situation, certain documents may need to be submitted, such as a UPI transaction statement, a copy of the police report or FIR, a claim form, and proof of blocking the UPI account. Additional documents might be required, depending on the nature of the fraud. In today’s world, where digital payments have become a part of daily life, initiatives like Shield are a much-needed safety net. While this service provides valuable protection, users must still stay vigilant. Avoid clicking on unknown links, downloading apps from unverified sources, or sharing sensitive payment information with strangers. BharatPe’s Shield is a timely and thoughtful addition to the digital payment ecosystem. With an increasing number of people like you and me relying on UPI for everything from grocery shopping to bill payments, having a safety net like Shield is reassuring. While it can’t eliminate the risk entirely, it’s a practical step toward making digital transactions safer for everyone.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

A live image of the Oppo Reno 13 has surfaced, showcasing a deep blue or purple colour that looks nothing short of stunning. This new shade, which isn’t available in China, is likely aimed at grabbing attention in India, where unique colour options often create a buzz amongst buyers. The leaked image shows the Reno 13 with its signature triple-camera setup labelled “AI” and a ring-shaped flashlight positioned next to the lenses. What makes this design stand out is how the camera bump seamlessly blends with the phone’s glass back, giving it a premium, unified look. The edges of the phone feature visible antenna bands, hinting at a metal frame. Another interesting detail is the subtle glow around the camera setup, which adds to the phone's charm.

It's somewhat of a crackdown, but not as harsh as Netflix’s rule for piggybackers. Essentially, Amazon says that starting January 2025, Amazon Prime subscribers will only be able to login to 5 devices per account, of which only two devices can be televisions. Which means, you can only be running your Prime video account on two TVs simultaneously, the minute you login to a third, you will be prompted to log out of your other devices.  “As part of your Prime membership, you and your household are entitled to enjoy Prime Video on up to five devices. Starting January 2025, we are updating our usage terms in India to include up to two TVs as part of your five devices entitlement. You can manage your devices on your Settings page or buy another Prime membership to watch Prime Video on more devices,” Amazon’s new policy note reads. Currently, the Prime subscribers are allowed to be logged into 10 devices at a time. As for the devices, these include phones, laptops, tablets, and TVs. The account will be supported on all devices as usual, however, at one time, Prime subscribers will only be able to access Prime Video on 5 devices, which includes 2 TVs.  Amazon’s new policy also states that you can “remove, and replace, up to 2 existing devices in any 30 day period”. Basically, if you have devices registered to your account (example, for streaming or using Amazon services), you are allowed to deregister or delete up to two devices from your account within a 30-day period. You can also replace or add 2 new devices to your account in place of the ones you removed during the same 30-day window. Essentially, you can manage or swap out two devices every 30 days. This likely aims to limit frequent changes, ensuring better control over device registration and account security. Amazon Prime membership plans in India start at Rs 299 per month, Rs 599 for a quarterly subscription, and Rs 1499 for an annual membership. Additional options include the Annual Prime Lite plan priced at Rs 799 and the Prime Shopping Edition available for Rs 399 per year. After the policy change, which will be applicable in January 2025, membership benefits for Prime Video will include unlimited ad-free streaming and access on up to five devices, with support for up to two TVs.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  YouTube says it will remove videos in India that have clickbait titles and thumbnailsAlso read |  Instagram teases AI video editing tool that will change backgrounds, outfits with a simple text promptAlso read |  Nvidia's most affordable Gen AI supercomputer, Jetson Orin Nano, is here: What is it and how it works

This time, the company plans to cut 10 per cent of the managerial roles. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-layoffs-ceo-sundar-pichai-announces-10-per-cent-job-cuts-says-it-is-to-boost-efficiency-2652915-2024-12-20,"In a significant development at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai has announced a reduction of 10 per cent in management and vice president-level roles. The decision is part of a broader organisational restructuring aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and aligning resources with the company's strategic priorities. According to a report by Business Insider, this move underscores Google's commitment to streamlining its workforce amid ongoing economic challenges.   According to two individuals familiar with the matter, Pichai stated that Google has implemented changes over the past few years to streamline operations and improve efficiency, as per the report. It also stated that Pichai highlighted a 10 per cent reduction in managerial, director, and vice president roles as part of these efforts. The recent changes emphasise Google’s ongoing efforts to optimise its operations in response to growing competition, especially from AI-focused companies like OpenAI, which are posing a challenge to its leadership in the search market. During the same meeting, Pichai discussed the evolution of Google’s corporate culture, recognising the need to reassess the company’s defining value of “Googleyness.” This cultural transformation is designed to better align with the demands of today’s business environment and respond to competitive pressures, particularly those arising from the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. The changes underscore Google’s dedication to cultivating a culture that promotes agility and innovation in an ever-evolving industry. The restructuring comes on the heels of broader cost-cutting measures implemented by major tech companies over the past year. Google, despite its robust market position and strong revenue streams, is not immune to the economic headwinds facing the tech industry. Rising inflation, slowing ad revenues, and global uncertainties have prompted the company to reassess its workforce and operational strategies.   Google’s restructuring follows a trend seen among other tech giants. Amazon, for example, has focused on reducing middle management layers under CEO Andy Jassy, with an emphasis on empowering individual contributors and speeding up decision-making. These approaches, widely adopted across the tech sector, are intended to foster innovation and enable companies to adapt more rapidly to technological progress. This is not the first time Google has resorted to layoffs in recent months. Google has been focused on improving efficiency for over two years. In September 2022, Pichai set a goal for the company to become 20 per cent more efficient. The following January, this initiative led to a historic round of layoffs, resulting in the elimination of 12,000 jobs. As Google implements these changes, the tech giant is also exploring ways to optimise its operations further, including investments in automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity.

This new sharing option bridges the gap between creating and connecting, allowing users to quickly show off their creations or collaborate on ideas. While these updates are rolling out across all platforms, mobile users will need to wait a little longer to access the redesigned homepage. Despite this slight delay, the improved features are already making a big impact for desktop users, with many appreciating the speed and convenience the latest updates bring.  If you’re curious about trying AI-powered image creation, these updates make Bing Image Creator much easier to use. Whether you’re playing around with AI art for fun, working on a project, or just seeing what it can do, these changes help make the process quicker and less complicated.

This new integration allows users to chat with ChatGPT directly through WhatsApp, without needing to open a separate app or website. If you’re wondering how to get started, the process is simple and user-friendly. OpenAI has made it very easy for anyone to connect with ChatGPT on WhatsApp. All it takes is a few quick steps, and you’re ready to chat. To begin, you’ll need to scan a QR code attached in the image below. This QR code is also available on OpenAI’s official website.   Once you scan it, you’ll be redirected to WhatsApp, where you can start chatting with ChatGPT. It’s important to make sure you’re interacting with the official ChatGPT account. How can you check? The official account will have a blue verification badge next to its name, and the phone number will be 1-800-242-8478. These details confirm that you’re chatting with the real ChatGPT and not a fake account. Once you’ve verified these details, you can start typing your messages and enjoy the experience. Using ChatGPT on WhatsApp is as straightforward as chatting with a friend. You simply type your questions or requests, and the chatbot responds almost instantly. Whether you’re looking for answers to specific questions, help with writing, or general information, ChatGPT is there to assist you. The convenience of having this powerful AI tool in a platform you already use daily is a game-changer for many users. However, there are some limitations to keep in mind. Currently, you can’t link your paid ChatGPT Plus account to WhatsApp. The integration is free for everyone to use, but there are daily limits on the number of messages you can send. If you hit these limits, you’ll receive a notification letting you know. For those who need more extensive use or access to additional features, the ChatGPT app or website remains an option. It’s also worth noting that the version of ChatGPT available on WhatsApp is powered by the GPT-4o mini model. This ensures efficient and accurate interactions, but it’s slightly scaled down compared to the full GPT-4 model available through OpenAI’s other platforms. Despite this, the chatbot is more than capable of handling a wide range of queries and tasks.

At the heart of this conflict lies Qualcomm's strategy to reduce its reliance on Arm’s technology, with the potential for billions in savings if successful. However, the case also holds major implications for Qualcomm’s future in the laptop market, its relationship with Arm, and the broader chip ecosystem that relies heavily on Arm’s architecture.advertisementThe Case: Qualcomm’s Nuvia acquisitionIn 2021, Qualcomm acquired Nuvia, a chip startup founded by former Apple engineers, for a substantial $1.4 billion. The acquisition was part of Qualcomm's strategy to challenge Intel and reduce its dependence on Arm, which has long provided the foundation for Qualcomm's chip designs. Qualcomm believed that by acquiring Nuvia, it could create custom chip designs more optimised for mobile and computing devices, particularly in the competitive laptop market.However, Arm, which licenses the architecture for most mobile and computing chips, objected to Qualcomm’s use of Nuvia’s designs, claiming that Qualcomm’s acquisition of the startup violated their licensing agreement. The core of the dispute hinges on whether Nuvia's technology is sufficiently independent of Arm’s architecture or if it is derivative, and therefore subject to Arm's licensing terms. Arm is arguing that Qualcomm should destroy all Nuvia technology developed under a license that it terminated, which Qualcomm disputes.

The core of the dispute hinges on whether Nuvia's technology is sufficiently independent of Arm’s architecture or if it is derivative, and therefore subject to Arm's licensing terms. Arm is arguing that Qualcomm should destroy all Nuvia technology developed under a license that it terminated, which Qualcomm disputes. According to industry analyst Prakash Sangam, who is covering the trial on grounds, the case currently focuses on three key questions that must be resolved unanimously by the jury: 1. Whether Nuvia breached section 15.1(a) of Nuvia's Agreement with Arm (ALA) — a provision relating to the protection of Arm's confidential information after the agreement’s termination.
2. Whether Qualcomm itself has breached this provision — despite the fact that Qualcomm was never a party to the Nuvia ALA, Arm claims that since Qualcomm benefits from the technology, it should be held liable.
3. Whether Qualcomm’s products are covered under Qualcomm’s own license with Arm — Qualcomm’s counterclaim aims to protect itself from any future legal actions regarding the use of Nuvia’s technology. At the heart of this battle is the potential for Qualcomm to save significant sums on royalty payments to Arm — estimated at $1.4 billion annually — by moving away from Arm’s designs. This savings would come from Qualcomm’s reliance on Nuvia’s custom computing cores, developed by a team that previously worked on Apple’s iconic chip designs.There is also a Qualcomm vs Apple angle here  Apple's custom silicon is a major player in this legal battle. With the introduction of the M1 and M2 chips, Apple transformed its entire product lineup, leaving traditional chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm scrambling to keep up. Which is why, Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia is a huge driving force behind the company’s ambition to challenge Apple’s dominance in the laptop and mobile chip markets. This also forced Qualcomm to enter the PC chip market so it could counter Apple's investments in its own custom silicon.  The acquisition of Nuvia and the use of its technology could allow Qualcomm to create chips tailored for Windows devices, offering an alternative to Intel’s x86 architecture and Apple’s ARM-based silicon. Qualcomm's CEO, Cristiano Amon, testified that this move was essential for Qualcomm to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving market, and the $1.4 billion savings projected from moving away from Arm royalties would be critical in funding this push. Basically, if Qulcomm succeeds in defending its use of Nuvia's tech, it could create a more diverse and competitive market for PC chips, giving Microsoft an alternative to Apple’s tight ecosystem. However, if Arm prevails, Qualcomm may be forced to abandon its plans to use Nuvia’s designs, which would further cement Apple’s dominance in the chip market.The larger picture: Implications in the global chip market The outcome of the Qualcomm vs Arm battle could have significant ripple effects across the chip industry. Arm’s architecture is the foundation for billions of devices, from smartphones to servers, and any shift in the relationship between Qualcomm and Arm could alter the dynamics of the entire market. Qualcomm’s efforts to develop its own computing cores could open the door for other companies to follow suit, reducing their reliance on Arm and potentially leading to more competition in chip design. At the same time, if Qualcomm is forced to comply with Arm’s demands and destroy Nuvia’s technology, it could create a precedent that limits the ability of chipmakers to innovate independently of their licensing agreements.  But what’s most interesting here is that the Qualcomm vs Arm battle is not just about one company's acquisition of a startup — it’s a fight for the future of chip design, with profound implications for the competition between Apple, Qualcomm, and other major players in the tech industry. We don’t know what direction this trial will take, but the outcome could (re)shape the global chip market and the devices that we use.

This new feature lets users get real-time assistance directly within their favourite apps, enhancing productivity and workflow.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-for-macos-now-compatible-with-apple-notes-and-other-apps-2653472-2024-12-21,"OpenAI has introduced a new update for the ChatGPT app on macOS. On Thursday, the company announced that its popular AI chatbot now works with several note-taking and coding applications. This new feature, described by OpenAI as agentic, allows ChatGPT to access on-screen information in these supported apps and assist users with their queries in real time. Currently, this feature is available only to paid subscribers of ChatGPT, including those on the Plus, Pro, Teams, Enterprise, and Edu plans. However, OpenAI has reassured users on the free tier and Windows users that they won’t be left behind for long. The update will roll out to them sometime next year.  OpenAI revealed this update as part of its 12-day shipping event, where the company has been releasing new features and improvements for its platforms daily. The announcement was made on day 11 through a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Kevin Weil, the Chief Product Officer at OpenAI, shared additional details about the feature, emphasising that ChatGPT can now work with approximately 30 macOS apps. The supported ones include Apple Notes, BBEdit, VSCode Insiders, Notion, Quip, and more specialised coding apps like MatLab, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.  So, whether you’re jotting down ideas in a note-taking app or debugging code in a developer tool, ChatGPT can now assist without users needing to switch between applications. Here’s how it works — once the feature is activated, users can open any supported app and use the shortcut Option + Space. This opens a compact ChatGPT window that appears over the app. The AI can then see the same information the user sees on the screen. From there, users can interact with ChatGPT by typing queries or using the Advanced Voice Mode. For example, if a user highlights a specific section of text or code in the app, they can ask ChatGPT for help by using natural language commands like “how can I improve this?” or “what does this code do?” The chatbot understands the context and responds accordingly. This makes it easier for users to get real-time feedback or explanations without disrupting their workflow. While OpenAI calls this feature “agentic,” the technology behind it is more vision-based. ChatGPT doesn’t actually interact with the apps themselves — it can’t write new text, edit code, or make changes to any existing content. Its role is purely advisory, based on what it sees on the screen. Privacy has been a top concern for OpenAI with this update. Users will have full control over when and which apps ChatGPT can access. OpenAI has also assured users that the data collected during these interactions will be handled just like any other data in their conversation history.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The news comes from the French website iPhoneSoft.fr, which cites a source within Apple. If true, this means Apple won’t be dropping support for any iPhone models for the second year in a row. This would be great news for anyone still holding onto older devices, as iOS 18 already supports many models. Based on the report, iOS 19 will be compatible with the following iPhones: — iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max
— iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max
— iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max
— iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max
— iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max
— iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max
— iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max
— iPhone SE (2nd generation and later) The oldest iPhones on this list are the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max, first released in September 2018. While it’s exciting to see these models still being supported, it’s worth mentioning that some of the newer iOS 19 features may not be available on older devices due to hardware limitations.  Apple’s decision to maintain compatibility for older iPhones could be seen as part of a larger trend. iOS 18 didn’t drop support for any models either, sticking to the same list as iOS 17, which had removed the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X from the lineup. This move might make it easier for users to hold onto their devices longer without feeling left behind. However, there is slightly less good news for iPad users. The same report claims that iPadOS 19 will drop support for the iPad 7, which was released in 2019. However, all other iPads that can run iPadOS 18 will reportedly be compatible with the new update. For those eagerly waiting to try iOS 19, the first public beta is expected to roll out during Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2025. The final version of iOS 19 will likely be released in September 2025, in line with Apple’s usual schedule. Not much is known yet about the features iOS 19 will bring, but one exciting rumour is that Siri will become more conversational, similar to ChatGPT, in a later iOS 19.4 update, which could arrive around March 2026.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Slated for a potential release by late 2025, the device could change the way we use home security devices. As per Gurman, the smart doorbell would function similarly to Face ID on iPhones, unlocking the door automatically when it recognises you or other residents. Like other Apple devices, it is expected to feature the Secure Enclave chip, which processes and stores biometric data independently from the main hardware, ensuring better privacy.   Mark Gurman suggests the doorbell could be compatible with existing third-party HomeKit smart locks, offering flexibility for Apple users already invested in the ecosystem. Alternatively, Apple may collaborate with a smart lock manufacturer to deliver a comprehensive system at launch. The device will likely leverage Apple’s in-house “Proxima” chip, a hybrid Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology rumoured to power next-generation HomePod Mini and Apple TV products.   This ambitious smart doorbell project is part of a larger effort by Apple to expand its smart home ecosystem under the umbrella of Apple Intelligence. Beyond the doorbell, the company is also working on a range of innovative smart home products. These include a new smart home hub with a 6-inch display for controlling devices, FaceTime calls, and video playback. Additionally, Apple is reportedly developing a security camera to complement the hub, further integrating privacy-focused features into its offerings.   While the Face ID-equipped doorbell aims to rival established players like Amazon’s Ring, it also raises potential security concerns. Critics point out that any malfunction or exploitation of the system could lead to significant risks, such as unauthorised access to homes. Apple, however, has a strong track record of prioritising user privacy, which could give it an edge in this space.   The doorbell camera remains in early development stages, meaning its final features and release date are still uncertain. If successful, this device could bring a new level of convenience and security to Apple users while seamlessly integrating with the company’s broader ecosystem.   Apple’s vision for the smart home doesn’t stop at doorbells.

According to the Wall Street Journal, there are two reasons for it: lack of quality data and financial demands. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openais-next-flagship-model-is-running-late-researchers-blame-low-quality-data-2653924-2024-12-23,"OpenAI’s highly anticipated GPT 5 model, which was expected to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, is reportedly behind schedule and incurring significant development costs. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the AI powerhouse is grappling with the dual challenges of advancing its technology and managing its financial demands. The delay in GPT 5’s release has sparked speculation across the tech industry, given OpenAI’s track record of timely launches for its language models. The report suggests that the complexity of training and scaling large language models (LLMs) like GPT 5 is one of the primary reasons for the setback. These models require enormous computational resources, specialised hardware, and vast datasets, all contributing to spiralling expenses. To recap, the GPT 4 model was released in March 2023 and since then, OpenAI has been working on its next flagship level model, GPT 5.  The Wall Street Journal highlights that OpenAI’s goals for GPT 5 include improving reasoning capabilities, enhancing factual accuracy, and addressing biases. However, meeting these objectives has proven to be more challenging than initially anticipated. And it also includes details about the 18-month development of GPT-5, code-named Orion.GPT 4: Reasons why it is running late A key challenge for Orion lies in data scarcity. OpenAI researchers have determined that the public internet no longer offers the high-quality, diverse datasets required for the model's advancement. To tackle this issue, the company has begun generating synthetic data, enlisting software engineers, mathematicians, and theoretical physicists to produce original content.  Another reason is on the financial side as OpenAI’s expenditures have been a growing concern. Training GPT 4 reportedly costs tens of millions of dollars, and industry analysts estimate that GPT 5’s development could surpass these figures significantly, the report stated. The company has been exploring ways to offset these costs, including partnerships, subscription models for its products, and new investment rounds. Microsoft, a key investor, has played a vital role in supporting OpenAI’s infrastructure through Azure cloud services, but even with such backing, the financial strain remains substantial. Despite these challenges, OpenAI is still pushing forward with its plans to redefine AI capabilities. Experts believe that the delay could ultimately benefit the company by allowing more rigorous testing and refinement of the model, ensuring it meets user expectations and industry standards. The delay in GPT 5’s release also reflects broader trends in the AI industry, where companies are facing mounting pressure to deliver advancements while addressing ethical, technical, and financial challenges. As the tech world eagerly awaits GPT 5, OpenAI’s ability to overcome these hurdles will likely determine its future leadership in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. While a few previous reports have pointed out that the GPT 5 will be out by December 2024, the launch date of the flagship model is still under wrap.

The discontinuation of support means that WhatsApp will no longer provide updates, bug fixes, or security patches for affected devices.  The decision impacts several devices, including some models from prominent brands like Samsung, LG, and Sony, that were released over a decade ago. Users are encouraged to upgrade to devices running newer Android versions to continue accessing WhatsApp services. Here is the full list of Android phones that will not be able to access WhatsApp in a few days. 
Samsung: Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy Ace 3, Galaxy S4 Mini
Motorola: Moto G (1st Gen), Razr HD, Moto E 2014
HTC: One X, One X+, Desire 500, Desire 601
LG: Optimus G, Nexus 4, G2 Mini, L90
Sony: Xperia Z, Xperia SP, Xperia T, Xperia V
 This is not the first time Meta has ended support for older operating systems. The company periodically reviews its minimum requirements for Android and iOS to ensure the app remains compatible with current security standards and features. In recent years, similar moves have been made to phase out older iOS devices and earlier Android versions.  WhatsApp will end support for these iPhones WhatsApp has announced that it will stop supporting older iOS versions starting in 2025. From May 5 onwards, devices running iOS versions earlier than 15.1 will no longer be able to access the app, including through older beta versions on TestFlight. While WhatsApp currently supports iOS 12 and above, the upcoming changes will require iOS 15.1 as the minimum version for continued functionality. To give users time to adapt, WhatsApp is providing a five-month notice period, allowing them to update their devices or explore other options if their hardware cannot support the latest iOS versions.   This update will mainly affect users of older iPhones, specifically the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which are limited to iOS 12.5.7. These models, released over a decade ago, represent a small segment of WhatsApp’s user base. For users with newer iPhones still running older software, upgrading to iOS 15.1 or higher will ensure uninterrupted access to WhatsApp.   The changes will impact both the standard WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business, as both rely on the same system requirements. With this move, WhatsApp aims to enhance performance, security, and compatibility for users on modern devices.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Qualcomm has won the battle against Arm: Here is what it means for the future of laptops and phonesAlso read |  OpenAI's next flagship model is running late, researchers blame low quality dataAlso read |  WhatsApp will soon end support for iPhone 6, iPhone 5s and more: All details hereTrending Reel

Qualcomm says the results affirmed its right to innovate, however, Arm has vowed to seek a new trial.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/qualcomm-has-finally-won-the-battle-against-arm-here-is-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-laptops-and-phones-2653946-2024-12-23,"Qualcomm's central processors are properly licenced under an agreement with Arm Holdings, a jury found in a trial in US federal court that removed some, but not all, uncertainty around the mobile chipmaker's expansion into the laptop market. A week of courtroom arguments and deliberations ended in a mistrial after the jury failed to resolve one of three questions put before it in the trial between the two chip giants. Qualcomm said the result affirmed its right to innovate, but Arm vowed to seek a new trial. Arm's shares were down 1.8 per cent in extended trading after the news, and Qualcomm's opens new tab shares were up 1.8 per cent. The outcome means the case could be tried again in the future - something Arm vowed to pursue in a statement following the verdict. Judge Maryellen Noreika, who presided over the case in US federal court in Delaware, encouraged Arm and Qualcomm to mediate their dispute. ""I don't think either side had a clear victory or would have had a clear victory if this case is tried again,"" Noreika told the parties. After more than nine hours of deliberations over two days, the eight-person jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on the question of whether startup Nuvia breached the terms of its license with Arm. But the jury found that Qualcomm - which purchased Nuvia for $1.4 billion in 2021 - did not breach that licence. The jury also found that Qualcomm's chips, created using Nuvia technology and central to Qualcomm's push into the personal computer market, are properly licenced under its own agreement with Arm, clearing the way for Qualcomm to continue selling them. ""The jury has vindicated Qualcomm's right to innovate and affirmed that all the Qualcomm products at issue in the case are protected by Qualcomm's contract with Arm,"" Qualcomm said in a statement. An Arm spokesperson said the company was ""disappointed"" that the jury was unable to ""reach consensus"" about the company's claims and said from the outset the goal has been to protect the company's intellectual property. For now, the outcome paves the way for Qualcomm to continue to push what it calls the ""AI PC"" in laptop chips that are aimed at handling tasks such as chatbots and image generators. That is a market where Nvidia, opens new tab, Advanced Micro Devices, and MediaTek are also planning to make Arm-based processors. ""My biggest worry was what happens to the future roadmap if they (Qualcomm) no longer have access to Nuvia (computing) cores,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. ""At this point, that risk is a lot closer to being off the table."" The dispute between Arm and Qualcomm centred on what royalty rate Qualcomm should pay for each chip. Nuvia was set to pay higher rates than Qualcomm before Qualcomm bought the startup firm and wove its technology into chips under its own license with Arm at lower royalty rates. Ben Bajarin, chief executive of tech consulting firm Creative Strategies, said that Arm's current growth projections have not depended on reaping higher rates from Qualcomm as Arm chips enter the PC market. ""They haven't factored in, via their quarterly (earnings) calls, a win,"" Bajarin said. ""So none of this changes their economic upside. It's really just a matter of contractual argument."" However, the trial's outcome leaves open the question of where Arm's technology begins and ends. Arm licenses its computing architecture to firms but also sells designs for computing cores as off-the-shelf products. Some of Arm's more sophisticated customers, such as Apple, Qualcomm and Nuvia, licence Arm's architectures but develop their own custom cores. During the trial this week, Arm's attorneys insisted its architecture license terms with Nuvia gave it rights to demand the destruction of Nuvia's custom core designs. ""This does have ramifications for the entire industry,"" Jim McGregor of Tirias Research said in an interview. ""Whether you're using a standard Arm core, or developing your own Arm core, it has been the rock of everything from electric toothbrushes to satellites.""Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  OpenAI's next flagship model is running late, researchers blame low quality dataAlso read |  Forget keys, Face ID may soon lock and unlock your house doors: Apple exploring smart doorbellsAlso read |  Next-gen AirPods Pro could sport health features like heart rate and temperature monitoring

The company has yet to reveal the exact date of launch, but it has confirmed that it will take place in January 2025. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oppo-reno-13-series-confirmed-to-launch-in-india-next-month-design-details-revealed-2654010-2024-12-23,"The next round of flagship smartphones are ready to roll. Oppo has confirmed the launch of its flagship series –– the Reno 13 series 5G. As with this year’s Reno 12 series, we expect the Reno 13 series to also include two smartphones, the Reno 13 5G and Reno 13 Pro 5G. Oppo has yet to confirm the exact date of launch, however, the company has revealed that the launch in India will take place in January 2025. This was confirmed in a post shared by the company on X.  Oppo has also revealed in the teaser that the Reno 13 series 5G will feature an aluminium frame, and a sculpted rear-panel, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for protection. The post says, the Reno 13 series will use “aerospace-grade aluminium Frames, One-Piece Sculpted Glass Backs, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for unrivalled elegance and durability”.
 


 Additionally, the image accompanied by the teaser post also confirms that the Reno 13 series will sport a triple camera setup, and a flat display. If we look at last year’s Reno 12 series, the Reno 13 series’ camera setup has been slightly redesigned. Based on the image, the phone will have three cameras, of which two will be aligned vertically, with the third placed on the right to make a triangle. The image also shows an LED flash inside the camera house, which will likely be a ring light, looking at the camera design trends lately.  The teasers from Oppo only reveal so much for now. However, the Reno 13 series has already been launched in the China market, which gives us a bit of an idea about what to expect from the smartphones. In China, the Reno 13 series boasts a 6.59-inch flat AMOLED display with a sharp resolution of 2760x1256 pixels and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, ensuring vibrant visuals and fluid performance. It’s powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8350 chipset, an upgrade over its predecessor with an enhanced GPU for improved gaming experiences and faster app loading times. Backing this power is a robust 5,600mAh battery that supports 80W fast wired charging, promising quick top-ups and long-lasting usage.   Camera performance has always been a strong suit for the Reno series, and the Reno 13 continues the tradition. It features a 50-megapixel primary sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) for sharp and stable shots, paired with an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens for expansive captures. On the front, there’s a 50-megapixel selfie camera, ensuring stunning self-portraits and video calls.   Running on ColorOS 15, based on Android 15, the Reno 13 offers a refined software experience with the latest features and optimisations. Durability is another standout feature, with the device boasting IP66, IP68, and IP69 certifications, making it resistant to dust and capable of withstanding various water exposure scenarios.   As for pricing, the Reno 13 series starts at CNY 2,699 (approximately Rs 31,400) in China. While official India pricing hasn’t been confirmed, the Reno 12 launched at Rs 32,999 in the country, hinting that the Reno 13 could be priced similarly when it debuts in India.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Oppo Reno 12 Pro review: It makes premium AI experience more accessibleAlso read |  OPPO Reno 13 live image leak reveals exclusive blue colour for India

In short, the iPhone 15 Pro offers great value for money, especially for those looking to experience the iPhone Pro series without spending extra on the latest model.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Apple, Google, OnePlus, Samsung, Oppo, and several other tech giants will follow their usual routine of unveiling their ""best phone ever."" However, a few devices always manage to stand out from the crowd. While other notable devices may grab our attention next year, based on what we know so far, two smartphones scheduled for launch in 2025 are already generating significant interest. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim and Apple iPhone 17 Air are both already among the most exciting phones of 2025.  Why is that? It’s all in the name. Samsung and Apple are once again moving back to a more compact design with these phones –– well, sort of. While the iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to be just 6.25mm thick, and is touted as Apple sleekest iPhone ever, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to be just 6mm in thickness. For perspective, the Galaxy S24 is 7.6mm thick. There is, of course, more to the phones than their dimensions.  Let’s have a look at what you can expect from the two of the most exciting phones of 2025. What to expect from Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim According to multiple tipsters, Samsung’s ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Slim will launch in Q2 2025. While this brings the phone’s launch timeline around the same time as the annual iPhone launch –– where we can expect the iPhone 17 Air to launch –– it deviates from the traditional January debut of the Galaxy S series. Reports, however, suggest that Samsung will align the S25 Slim's release with the Galaxy A and FE lineups. Design and form factor As the name suggests, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is sleek. In fact, it will likely be Samsung's slimmest smartphone yet. To put that into perspective, it’s significantly thinner than the 7.6mm Galaxy S24 and even slimmer than the anticipated 6.25mm iPhone 17 Air.  Battery and performance Besides its design, one of the standout features of the S25 Slim is its 4,700 to 5,000mAh battery*, an impressive feat for a device this thin. Reports suggest Samsung might be leveraging advanced silicon-carbon anode battery technology, similar to what we've seen in the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro. This would ensure long-lasting performance without compromising the phone’s slim design. Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to pack the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.  Display and camera capabilities The Galaxy S25 Slim is tipped to feature a 6.66-inch display, placing it in the same league as the Galaxy S24+ in terms of screen size. On the photography front, the device could sport a 200-megapixel HP5 primary camera, accompanied by a 50-megapixel ultrawide lens, and a 50-megapixel 3.5x telephoto snapper.What to expect from the iPhone 17 Air   The iPhone 17 Air is slated for a potential September 2025 launch. As a successor to the iPhone 16 Plus, this device is expected to deliver premium features with a refreshed design, all while maintaining a competitive price point. Based on current trends, the iPhone 17 Air could start around Rs 85,000, positioning it slightly below the iPhone 16 Pro, which is priced starting Rs 1,19,900 in India.  Design and display   Apple is rumoured to introduce a titanium frame in the iPhone 17 Air, a feature that promises to enhance both durability and weight reduction. The phone is likely to sport a 6.6-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, delivering vibrant colours, deep contrasts, and an immersive viewing experience. In a much-anticipated upgrade, the device might finally adopt a 120Hz refresh rate. Performance and efficiency   At the heart of the iPhone 17 Air will be Apple’s new A19 chip, which is expected to deliver notable gains in performance and energy efficiency, making multitasking, gaming, and graphics-heavy applications a breeze. Enhanced machine learning capabilities could further improve features like photography, augmented reality (AR), and on-device intelligence. Camera enhancements   Photography enthusiasts can look forward to significant upgrades, including a 48-megapixel primary sensor for sharper and more detailed photos. On the front, a 24-megapixel selfie camera is rumoured. As we inch closer to the anticipated Q2 2025 launch for both the smartphones, more details about the Galaxy S25 Slim and the iPhone 17 Air are likely to emerge. While it seems like the two devices could set a new standard for slim smartphones, it will also be fascinating to see how the two will fare against each other.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai geek out over Google's new quantum chip WillowAlso read |  Why has the Indian government issued a notice to Wikipedia?

It delivers up to 50 TOPS NPU with premium features. At Rs 1,49,990, the laptop has some great specs and features, but is it worth it? Let's find out in this review by India Today Tech. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/asus-zenbook-s16-review-powerful-lightweight-and-gets-most-things-right-2654079-2024-12-23,"The Asus ZenBook S16 debuts as the company's first CoPilot+ PC featuring an AMD Ryzen AI processor. The device retains a similar design as its predecessor, the ZenBook S14, but it takes a significant leap when it comes to specs and features. Powered by AMD's newly launched Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, the ZenBook S16 aims to deliver a boost in AI performance and daily tasks. Priced at Rs 1,49,900, the Asus ZenBook S16 comes with a 3k OLED display, an ultra-thin profile and a powerful chipset, but is it worth it? Let’s find out in this review. 
 


advertisementAsus ZenBook S16: The best partsThe Asus ZenBook S16 carries a similar design language as the ZenBook S14. The laptop features an innovative Ceraluminum –– a blend of aluminium and ceramic –– finish on its lid. This material gives the laptop a premium, matte look that is both visually appealing and durable. It stands out for its lightweight design, weighing just 1.5kg, which makes it highly portable and ideal for users who are always on the move. I have been using the laptop as my primary work device for 2 weeks. This means that I carry it everywhere with me, including to work, where I travel in a Metro. It even accompanied me during a recent work trip to Bangalore. Whether it was daily travel or a longer flight to another city I took, the device always felt comfortably portable. 
 


Another highlight of the Zenbook S16’s build is its ultra-thin lid. Despite being just a couple of millimetres in thickness, it feels sturdy. It is also supported by a good hinge mechanism that allows you to easily open the lid with just one hand. The keyboard is also well-designed with decent spacing between the keys. Moreover, the keys offer snappy feedback. While the keys make a clicky sound, it is not too loud. Nothing compared to a mechanical keyboard, at least. 
 


Additionally, the ergonomic pad, just below the keyboard, is now bigger than ever. According to Asus, the ZenBook S16’s mouse pad is 40 per cent larger than its predecessor. The Asus ZenBook S16 is a 10 on 10 when it comes to the design. It is light but sturdy, stylish but functional, and is quite portable.

The experience is just as good when it comes to the laptop’s display. The Asus ZenBook S16 features a huge 16-inch 3k OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The display is a visual treat, offering vivid and crisp colours. With a brightness of 400nits (peaking at 500nits in HDR mode), the display looks attractive when indoors. The huge display makes multitasking very easy. Even after splitting the screen into two, it did not feel cluttered. Furthermore, binge watching Christmas movies has been a delight on this laptop. But that is not it. The speakers make it a complete entertainment box. The audio system is impressive in the ZenBook S16. It features 6 built-in speakers. Despite the laptop’s compact size, the sound quality is surprisingly good. It can produce a clear and full sound, with a bit of bass. 
 


The user-friendly nature peaks with its touch display. I generally use a mouse while working on a laptop but the smooth touch makes it easier to use. The touch interface offers a seamless and intuitive navigation experience, making tasks like web browsing, file management, and creative projects easy. With 120Hz refresh rate, the touch screen is quick to respond and simplifies interactions. 
 


advertisementComing to the performance, the laptop is a cool combination of style and functionality. It features a geometric grille design with over 3,500 CNC-machined cooling vents.

For a device that sports a powerful AMD Ryzen AI chipset –– which is apparently able to offer three times the processing power of previous AMD laptop processors –– it does not heat up easily.

The ZenBook S16 has been a wonderful machine so far. It runs all tasks smoothly and does not complain. Over the period of 2 weeks, it did not give me a hard time, even when I opened over 10 tabs and was working on two browsers simultaneously. Asus claims the ZenBook S16 can achieve a peak of 50 tops (trillion operations per second) in neural processing power. As a number that’s impressive, but what does it mean in real life? Before we explain that, here are some more numbers we got when we did our own benchmark test for the laptop. advertisementThe Zenbook S16 scored 12,305 on Geekbench (multicore score) and 503 on Cinebench. The AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor gives a tough competition to the Apple’s M3 chip, going by the benchmark scores. But big, powerful processors also mean big battery consumption. Asus claims that the ZenBook S16’s 78 Whr battery can easily last a day. After testing the device, we can say Asus’ claim stands true. I used the ZenBook S16 for 6 hours straight after charging it to 100 per cent. For context, my daily tasks include using Google Docs, opening several tabs, switching between work and Apple Music, watching YouTube videos, scrolling X posts and more. And after all of it, the laptop still had 30 per cent battery left.
 


advertisementIt is true that while performing heavy tasks the battery will drain faster, but for me one 100 per cent charge was good to get me through my entire work day.That said, as we mentioned before, the Zenbook S16 is impressive in many departments, but it’s surely not perfect. Let’s look at some of the drawback of the device.Asus ZenBook S16: Drawbacks The ZenBook S16 not only carries ZenBook S14’s design language, it has also inherited some of its flaws. The lack of fingerprint sensor makes the login process a bit tardy. The Asus ZenBook S16 is equipped with a face-lock biometric tech and I found it hard to work with. On paper, a face-lock makes more sense for a laptop. Ideally, it should unlock as soon as you sit in front of the screen. But the ZenBook S16’s biometric is unpredictable. Sometimes, it unlocks within a few seconds, but many-a-times, I found myself adjusting my face and still ending up typing the password.Another issue I encountered, despite loving the display, the glossy finish causes significant reflection in bright environments. Throughout the testing period, I found myself constantly adjusting the screen to improve visibility, especially when working outdoors. 
 


Additionally, the glossy surface is also highly prone to smudges and fingerprints. As someone who enjoyed the touch screen feature, this drawback hindered the overall viewing experience. The third issue I encountered was noticeable lag when the laptop was charging. The ZenBook S16 supports Type-C charging, and while the battery performance is commendable, plugging in the charger causes a significant delay, with the screen briefly blacking out for a few seconds. This interruption was quite noticeable during use.Verdict: Should you buy the Asus ZenBook S16? If you are looking for a laptop with great performance skills, stylish and good battery backup, the Asus ZenBook S16 is a solid choice. While it has its demerits, the list of Pros is much longer. At Rs 1,49,900, the laptop is on the expensive side, but also delivers all premium specs and features. It offers top-notch performance, giving a tough competition to Apple’s M3 MacBook Air.

 The user-friendly nature peaks with its touch display. I generally use a mouse while working on a laptop but the smooth touch makes it easier to use. The touch interface offers a seamless and intuitive navigation experience, making tasks like web browsing, file management, and creative projects easy. With 120Hz refresh rate, the touch screen is quick to respond and simplifies interactions.

Here is what we know about it Xiaomi 15 Ultra has recently been listed on the BIS certification website, which suggests that the smartphone may soon be launched in the Indian market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/xiaomi-15-ultra-launching-in-india-soon-here-is-what-we-know-about-it-2654440-2024-12-24,"Soon after the Xiaomi 15 was listed on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification website in November, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has now been spotted on the same certification website. A listing on the BIS website usually means that the company is now just going through the process of getting all the approval for a phone, before launching it in the market. Interestingly, unlike the Xiaomi 15, which has already been launched (along with the Xiaomi 15 Pro) in the market, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has yet to be unveiled even in the China market. For the uninitiated, Xiaomi phones usually always launch in its home market in China first.  Coming back to the Xiaomi 15 Ultra listing that has surfaced on the BIS certification website. The handset, identified by the model number 25010PN30I, reportedly received approval on December 20, hinting at its imminent arrival in India.   While the BIS listing does not explicitly confirm the device’s name, earlier reports from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) associate this model number with the Indian variant of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. The global version of the device is expected to carry a similar model number, with the final letter changed to ‘G.’  Xiaomi 15 Ultra: What to expect The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is rumored to feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. This aligns with Xiaomi’s tradition of equipping its Ultra-series devices with cutting-edge hardware. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is also expected to feature 90W wired charging, and a 2K quad-curved display. On the camera front, it is expected to boast a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto sensor with a large aperture, alongside a 1-inch main sensor with an f/1.63 aperture.   The device might also come with IP68 and IP69 certifications, providing protection against water and dust. Wireless charging is anticipated to be part of its feature set, while the battery capacity is likely to remain unchanged from its predecessor, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra –– which was a 5,000mAh battery.Xiaomi 15 Ultra: India price expected Although Xiaomi has yet to announce an official launch date, the appearance of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra on BIS suggests that the Indian debut might not be far off. If we consider past trends, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra made its global debut in February 2024 at Mobile World Congress Barcelona, followed by its Indian release in March 2024. The device was priced at Rs. 99,999 for the single 16GB RAM and 512GB storage variant.

The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16 per cent jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalisation. The latest rally in Apple shares reflects ""investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades,"" said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a ""hold"" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800 per cent over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase ""low- to mid-single digits"" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. ""Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's ""top pick"" heading into 2025.  The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. ""I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today,"" said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if US President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10 per cent on goods coming from China. ""We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018,"" Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. ""Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action ""could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology."" ""Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

This design integrates key components like the CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) into a single chip. Apple has improved performance and power efficiency across its devices by combining these components and tuning them in tandem. However, a recent report by well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests a major shift with the upcoming M5 Pro chip. Apple might step away from its fully integrated SoC design and instead adopt a new approach that separates the CPU and GPU. This change is reportedly being made for two key reasons — better performance and improved production yields. By separating the CPU and GPU, Apple can take advantage of TSMC’s latest chip-packaging technology, known as SoIC-mH (System-on-Integrated-Chips-Molding-Horizontal). This advanced method of packaging chipsets is said to significantly improve thermal performance, which means the chip can run at full power for longer periods without overheating. Additionally, the SoIC-mH process reportedly reduces manufacturing defects, resulting in higher-quality chips and fewer production losses. According to Kuo, this new design will not only be used in the M5 Pro but also the M5 Max and M5 Ultra variants. These high-end chips will be built on TSMC’s N3P node, an advanced chip-manufacturing process. Mass production timelines suggest the base M5 chip will roll out in the first half of 2025, followed by the M5 Pro and M5 Max later that year, and the M5 Ultra in 2026. Interestingly, the report also ties this development to Apple’s plans for artificial intelligence (AI). The M5 Pro chip is expected to power Apple Intelligence servers, part of the company’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC) infrastructure. These servers are designed for AI inferencing, a critical function for processing AI-driven tasks. Once these high-end chips are ready, Apple plans to ramp up its AI infrastructure, furthering its ambitions in the AI space. This potential shift in design is a significant departure from Apple’s usual approach. While Apple hasn’t confirmed these plans, the rumoured changes show that the company wants to adapt and innovate with time. It also highlights the growing complexity of balancing performance, efficiency, and production challenges in the tech industry.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Now, all eyes are on the company’s second generation foldable phone, the OnePlus Open 2. For a while now, there were rumours suggesting that the Open 2 will be launching by the first quarter of 2025. However, the launch timeline seems to have been revised. Latest reports suggest that the OnePlus Open 2 will now only launch by the second half of 2025. Of course, an early release would have been great, but OnePlus has traditionally done its big launches in August, and maybe that’s the timeline it is going to stick to in 2025.  As to what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2, the foldable is expected to be a rebranded Oppo Find N5. Now, to just get things in perspective, the Find N5 will obviously be launched before the OnePlus Open 2. But we don’t know when the Find N5 will launch. However, Oppo’s product manager, Zhou Yibao, confirmed in a social media interaction with a user that it will launch before the Find X8 Ultra. There is no official launch date for the latter either, but it is rumoured to be released in Q1 2025. Some reports also suggest that the Oppo Find N5 could be released in February next year.  There have also been several leaks around the Oppo Find N5 aka the OnePlus Open 2. From what the reports suggest so far, the OnePlus Open 2 is expected to feature the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Which could be a big leap over the OnePlus Open, which sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset.  The OnePlus Open 2 is also rumored to feature foldable displays with 2K+ resolution. The foldable phone is also believed to come with a 50-megapixel triple-lens setup, possibly featuring a circular periscope telephoto lens, building on the 3x optical zoom offered by its forerunner. The Open 2 might also support 3-stage wireless charging, complementing their large form factors. In terms of design, the foldable phone may adopt a slimmer, lighter frame with a choice of plain leather and glass materials for a refined aesthetic.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Oppo Find X8 Ultra battery and camera specs surface in latest leakAlso read |  Apple approaches historic $4 trillion valuation, it is now also ahead of Nvidia and MicrosoftAlso read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

 While the battery capacity of the Oppo Find X8 Ultra is certainly impressive, the real excitement lies in the camera specifications. As per Digital Chat Station, the Find X8 Ultra is expected to feature a 50MP Sony IMX906 periscope zoom camera with 3X optical zoom. Alongside it, there will be another 50MP Sony IMX882 periscope zoom camera, offering 6X optical zoom. This dual periscope setup is a big upgrade from its predecessor, the Find X7 Ultra. Rumours also suggest that the Find X8 Ultra will sport a 50MP primary camera with a 1-inch Sony LYTIA LYT-900 sensor. This is also a step up from the Find X7 Ultra, which used a slightly smaller sensor for its main camera. Additionally, the new model is said to have a 50MP ultra-wide camera, though it’s unclear whether it will use the same 1/1.95-inch Sony LYTIA LYT-600 sensor as the Find X7 Ultra or a new sensor altogether. While these specs look promising, it’s unclear if the Oppo Find X8 Ultra will launch in India. The Find X8 and Find X8 Pro have made their way to the Indian market, but the Find X7 Ultra never did. If Oppo decides to skip India again with the Ultra model, it could disappoint fans who are excited about the high-end flagship smartphone.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Another intriguing part of the rumour is that the Dutch company BE Semiconductor will be supplying the technology for the aperture blades—the mechanical components that will allow the aperture to change size. This technology will make it possible for the iPhone 18 Pro's camera to adapt its light intake for different shooting conditions. While this feature was also rumoured for the iPhone 17 models previously, it seems Apple will reserve it for the iPhone 18 Pro, which is expected to debut in September 2026. Whether or not Apple will also upgrade the iPhone 18 Pro’s sensor size is still unclear, but such an enhancement could pave the way for even more natural and dynamic bokeh effects in photos. As the story of the iPhone’s camera capabilities continues to evolve, the addition of variable aperture stands out as one of the most exciting rumours to date, promising a new level of control and creativity for iPhone photographers. Since the iPhone 18 series is speculated to come in 2026, there are still several months to go before the launch. Hence, we advise you to take this information with a pinch of salt. The exact details will be released during the launch. Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

The upcoming model follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, the Galaxy M15 5G, with some notable design and feature upgrades. While the M16 is still part of the budget M series, it brings a few fresh touches to its design, along with improvements under the hood. Leaked renders of the Samsung Galaxy M16 5G indicate a few design changes over the last generation model. The M16 will be available in three new colours — a dark grey, a minty green reminiscent of the Galaxy S23 FE green colour, and a light pink shade reminiscent of the iPhone 13 Mini pink shade. As seen in the renders, the rear panel of the phone — while expected to be plastic — gets a new glass-like reflective finish, replacing the textured finish seen on the M15. One of the most noticeable updates is the redesigned rear camera island. The camera setup has been modified, with the bottommost sensor separated from the other two lenses, which gives the phone a slightly more distinct look. The rear flash is still placed separately next to the lenses, staying true to the M-series design. When we look at the front of the phone, we can see that the Galaxy M16 5G keeps the familiar Infinity-U cutout for the front camera, just like the M15. However, the thick chin on the bottom still suggests that the M16 is targeting the budget segment. While the design may not be as sleek as some high-end models, the M16 offers a modern feel thanks to its flatter sides with metallic finish and rounded corners. However, the frame will likely be plastic, just like the back of the phone. The power button and volume rocker are placed on the right side, with a SIM card slot on the left side. 

Source: Android Headlines
 On the inside, the Samsung Galaxy M16 5G brings a performance boost. According to a recent Geekbench listing, the phone will run on a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 SoC. This chipset includes two powerful Cortex A76 cores, clocked at 2.4 GHz, and six efficiency-focused Cortex A55 cores at 2 GHz. The M16 also features the Arm Mali-G57 MC2 GPU, which promises improved graphical performance compared to the Dimensity 6100+ chip in the M15. Samsung will likely ship the M16 with Android 14, and the phone will come with 8GB of RAM. In terms of performance, the M16 scored 552 in the single-core CPU test and 1,611 in the multi-core test. The Samsung Galaxy M16 5G appears to be a rebranded version of the Galaxy A16 5G, a mid-range device in Samsung’s A-series lineup. This similarity in specifications suggests that the M16 will be targeting budget-conscious buyers who want good performance without the high price tag. Samsung has already listed the device on India’s BIS website, confirming that it will be launched in the country. If it follows the same timeline as the M15, we can expect the Galaxy M16 5G to hit the shelves in early 2025.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

With this addition, WhatsApp users can quickly capture a document using their device’s camera without needing external scanning tools or apps. The rollout is happening gradually, with more users expected to gain access over the coming weeks, as confirmed by the latest WhatsApp changelog, reported by WABetaInfo.advertisementWhatsApp scanning: How to use This innovation is a significant leap for WhatsApp, particularly for those who need to share documents quickly while on the go.

Moreover, the quality of the scan is optimised for clarity and readability, ensuring that the scanned documents are presented in a professional manner. This makes the feature ideal for both personal and business-related needs, whether for sharing receipts, contracts, or notes. WABetaInfo first reported this feature as part of the WhatsApp iOS 24.25.80 update, and the company has continued to refine and expand access to the feature. By including it in the app’s document-sharing menu, WhatsApp is positioning itself as a comprehensive platform for communication and document exchange, further streamlining the user experience. As this feature continues to roll out, more users will benefit from the convenience it offers, saving time and reducing the need for third-party applications.WhatsApp withdraws support for these iPhones WhatsApp has announced that it will discontinue support for older iOS versions starting in 2025. Beginning May 5, devices running iOS versions earlier than 15.1 will no longer have access to the app, including older beta versions available on TestFlight. Currently compatible with iOS 12 and later, WhatsApp will soon require iOS 15.1 as the minimum version for continued use. To help users prepare, the company is offering a five-month notice period, allowing time to update devices or explore alternatives if their hardware cannot support the newer iOS versions. This update will primarily affect older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which are limited to iOS 12.5.7. These models, released over 10 years ago, account for a small portion of WhatsApp’s user base. Users with newer iPhones running outdated software can maintain access by upgrading to iOS 15.1 or later.

While the date is yet to be made official by the company, another report claims to reveal the day the new smartphones will hit the shelves. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-is-expected-to-go-on-sale-on-this-date-2654555-2024-12-24,"Samsung is set to launch its flagship smartphones in 2025. The launch date has yet to be made official by the company, but there have been several reports that suggest that the launch will take place on January 22. Now, as we wait for Samsung to confirm the launch date, another leak suggests that the Galaxy S25 series will launch in Samsung’s home market, South Korea, on February 7, 2025. This would be two weeks after the rumoured Galaxy Unpacked event. This timeline aligns with Samsung’s typical two-week pre-order period for new Galaxy devices.
 


 Pre-orders for the Galaxy S25 in South Korea are reportedly set to run from January 24 to February 3, 2025, with deliveries and in-store availability starting on February 7. For international markets, including the US, pre-order dates are expected to be similar, possibly starting around January 22 or 23 and closing in early February. For context, Samsung followed a similar schedule for the Galaxy S24, which was announced on January 17, 2024, with pre-orders opening immediately and the phone hitting shelves by January 31. Traditionally, the flagship Galaxy series is launched the same day as the global release takes place, which is generally around the first week of February. The leaked timeline seems to be in line with it, making it seem credible.  The latest leak also confirms that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will come with 16GB RAM, but this will be exclusive to the 512GB and 1TB storage variants. The base 256GB model will feature 12GB RAM instead. Meanwhile, the standard Galaxy S25 and S25+ are rumoured to offer 12GB RAM as a default, a noticeable improvement over the Galaxy S24, which only came with 8GB RAM in its base configuration. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to include four smartphones: the Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Slim, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, the Galaxy S25 Slim –– Samsung’s slimmest phone ever, with a waistline of about 6mm –– is believed to only be showcased at the event. Its availability is rumoured to be scheduled for sometime in the second half of 2025.  Along with the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung is also expected to unveil the next-generation Galaxy Ring at the Galaxy Unpacked event next month. The ring is also expected to be made available a few months after the official launch.

The rumour has it that the OnePlus 13 in India will mimic the Chinese variant, launched in October 2024. In this article, let's look at what the OnePlus 13 is expected to bring. OnePlus 13: Expected India price While official pricing is yet to be announced, rumours suggest that the OnePlus 13 could be priced starting at Rs 59,999 for the base variant, with higher configurations costing more.

The smartphone is expected to go on sale by mid-January through both online platforms and offline retail stores in India.OnePlus 13: Specs and features According to leaks and early reports, the OnePlus 13 is expected to feature a refined design with slimmer bezels and a sturdier build.

Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 is confirmed to be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, promising top-tier performance and energy efficiency.  OnePlus has consistently focused on improving its camera technology, and the OnePlus 13 appears to be no exception. The smartphone is rumoured to sport a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, a name synonymous with premium photography. The primary sensor could be a 50-megapixel LYT-808 with optical image stabilisation (OIS), accompanied by telephoto and ultrawide lenses, both of which now feature 50-megapixel sensors. This setup is expected to deliver exceptional photography and videography capabilities, including 4K video recording and advanced night mode. On the front, the device may house a 32-megapixel selfie camera with AI enhancements for sharper and more vibrant portraits. The OnePlus 13 is confirmed to pack a 6,000mAh battery, supporting 100W fast wired charging and 50W wireless charging. Reverse wireless charging is also rumoured to be included, allowing users to charge accessories like earbuds. With cutting-edge technology and premium features, the OnePlus 13 is poised to be a strong contender in the flagship smartphone segment.

However, the M4-powered MacBook Air is yet to make its debut. So far, there is no official communication from Apple regarding when the M4 MacBook Air will be launched. However, according to Apple analyst Mark Gurman, who writes for Bloomberg, the MacBook Air with M4 chip may launch sooner than we expect.  In a post shared on X, Gurman has once again confirmed that the iPhone SE 4, iPad 11, and the next-generation iPad Air will be launched in Spring 2025. This means, around May or June 2025 –– closer to Apple’s annual WWDC or may be at the event –– the three devices could be expected. However, for the MacBook Air M4, Gurman suggests that it could launch even earlier than the iPhone SE 4, iPad 11, and the upgraded iPad Air.  Considering, the timeline Gurman is hinting at isn’t Apple’s usual launch event timeline –– WWDC in June, iPhone hardware event in September, and a Mac event later in the year –– the MacBook Air M4 could be announced in a press announcement.  Apple is expected to release a 13-inch and a 15-inch MacBook Air, powered by an M4 chip. The launch of the MacBook Air was recently also revealed by Apple accidentally. In the macOS 15.2 release, the company had accidentally confirmed that new MacBook Air models are coming in 2025.  A recent report also suggests that Apple is “deep” in manufacturing the new MacBook Air. Based on this report, Apple could possibly start selling the laptop in the first quarter of 2025. As for what to expect from the new MacBook Air, it is unlikely to see significant design updates, with most rumours pointing to the inclusion of the M4 chip and a few minor enhancements. Potential upgrades might feature a Center Stage camera for improved video calls and a shift from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 4 ports.   Apple has already refreshed the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini with M4 chip options earlier this year. According to Geekbench results, the M4 chip delivers approximately a 25 per cent boost in multi-core CPU performance compared to the M3 chip.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  OnePlus 12 price drops just two weeks before OnePlus 13 India launch eventAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateAlso read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

Now, imagine describing that dream and watching it transform into a high-definition video. Sounds impossible? Not anymore. Enter Veo2, Google DeepMind’s latest text-to-video platform, which creates realistic 4K videos from simple text prompts. Its capabilities have stunned the internet with mesmerising demo videos, leaving many in awe — and some video creators worried about their jobs. But Veo2 isn’t alone. OpenAI’s Sora is another challenger in the fray, bringing its approach to this exciting new age of AI-generated video creation. So, how do these platforms compare? Which one is better? And what does this mean for the future of video creation?Veo 2 vs Sora Sora, launched in early December this year, is available to ChatGPT Plus users globally. While the OpenAI video maker has gained a headstart with general users being able to use the platform, Google’s Veo2 is still in its beta testing. Seemingly, Google’s Veo2 has an advantage over Sora thanks to multiple reasons: 
4K video resolution: Veo2 offers users video resolution up to 4K which means better quality videos. In contrast, Sora offers a maximum resolution of 1080p which isn’t bad but still 4K is 4K.
Video duration: Veo2 renders videos up to 2 minutes in length. Compared to this, Sora creates shorter videos of up to 20 seconds.
Cinematic control: Veo2 offers virtual camera control with options for adding cinematic movements like pan, tilts, etc. Its accuracy has stunned many users online. You can even play around with the lighting for a particular scene. This helps enhance storytelling. Sora focuses more on style presets and storyboarding. It’s similar to editing photos on your phone. You can choose between each adjustment manually or use the presets that phones offer.

Despite the prompt telling the camera to rotate, the output in Sora has rendered a static camera shot. This stifles a creator’s vision in many ways.
Realism: Some Veo2 renders online show its true ability to output photorealistic videos. This is also true in the case of physics-based motion accuracy which makes animations look more natural. This is an area where Sora struggles.
 The following video by X user Ruben Hassid shows the differences between the two video engines. There are several inconsistencies in the results Sora has generated whereas Veo2 has been able to render more lifelike results.

Google’s DeepMind has made the tool available only to a select few users, with no clarity on when the final version will be rolled out. Sora, on the other hand, is available for commercial use with a ChatGPT Plus subscription that costs around Rs 1676 in India.Room for improvement Many X users have posted similar renders comparing the two and most feel that Sora is losing the battle in many departments. While Sora might not be the most refined version of itself, there’s still room for improvement. It is still in the initial stages of its release and I believe that an improved version of this platform will be released in the coming days, especially after Veo2’s superior performance. Right now, it feels that Sora focuses more on motion rather than physics and accuracy, a sentiment echoed by an X user.
Sora vs. Veo 2:

I spent a few hours running prompts on both models and wanted to share some comparisons â¬‡ï¸.

IMO - Sora biases towards more motion, whereas Veo focuses more on accuracy / physics. And a larger % of clips from Veo are usable.

— Justine Moore (@venturetwins) December 18, 2024 The company recently launched a rebranded version of the platform called Sora Turbo but had to halt new signups due to an avalanche of users overwhelming the servers. This is also an issue that online video platforms will face in the coming days. Google has set a high benchmark for OpenAI to improve upon, but the real challenge is the time at hand. With 2024 almost over, OpenAI will now have to shift focus to 2025 on how it can beat Google at its own game. No matter who takes the crown in the end, eventually, it’s the users who win.A boon or threat? Now to address the elephant in the room. The possibility of these AI tools eating up the jobs of people who create (shoot or edit) video content for a living. This pickle is the same as ChatGPT killing writing jobs. Gradual improvements to Veo2, Sora and other similar tools will result in a substantial decrease in requirements for conventional video-creation methods. Why would anyone pay for a cameraperson, equipment, travel and logistics when they can just write a prompt on a computer and generate a 4K video with specific details about lighting, environment and colour accuracy? This would cater more to industries or creators that require more stock footage. It would be more cost-effective to ask Veo2 or Sora to generate stock videos instead of creating them from scratch or paying stock video platforms like Envato, Adobe or iStock. However, some videos cannot be created (for commercial use) by AI due to copyright issues. Videos of celebrities, interviews with politicians, sports events and live TV. All of these profiles still need people to function within the ecosystem. However, you can make similar videos like this awesome Game Of Thrones trailer made using Veo2.

In fact, thanks to these tools, more high-quality content will be created, which means more consumption and that will lead to more creators cropping up shortly. Rest assured, the future of video creation is about to be transformed with tools like Veo2 and Sora at the helm of it.

The iPhone 16 is selling at a discount of up to Rs 16,000. But there is a catch. The deal is part of a Christmas Carnival sale by Apple’s exclusive retail seller Imagine, and the sale ends today, December 26. Which means, you have only until today to avail the offer, if you are interested.  As for the deal, the iPhone 16 was launched at a starting price of Rs 79,900. During the ongoing sale at Imagine, you can get a discount of Rs 3,500, which brings the price of the phone down to Rs 76,400. Additionally, SBI, ICICI and Kotak Bank users can also get a discount of Rs 4,000 on the purchase. Which means, a further price reduction of Rs 72,400. On top of that, you can also get further discounts by trading-in or exchanging a smartphone. According to the Imagine website, you can get up to Rs 8,000 on exchange. If you do get the highest value for exchange (which is honestly rare) you can get the iPhone 16 for around Rs 64,400. Which is a great deal.Why is the iPhone 16 deal so good? The iPhone 16 is arguably one of the best smartphones in the new iPhone lineup this year. The Pros are great, but the iPhone 16 sits in the goldilocks zone. It has the new chipsets, and Apple hasn’t cut corners with the vanilla model this time by excluding the good stuff (like a camera capture button or Apple Intelligence). And if you are someone who loves a compact device, the iPhone 16’s form factor is an added bonus.  The iPhone 16 features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits and the innovative Dynamic Island for an enhanced user experience. At its core lies the powerful 3nm A18 chipset, comprising a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core neural engine, delivering top-notch performance. It supports dual SIM functionality and runs iOS 18 out of the box, complete with Apple Intelligence features for a seamless smart experience.   Photography enthusiasts will appreciate the dual-camera setup, which includes a 48-megapixel wide-angle lens with 2x in-sensor zoom and an f/1.6 aperture, alongside a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with an f/2.2 aperture and autofocus. For selfies and video calls, the 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera ensures sharp and detailed captures.   On the connectivity front, the iPhone 16 offers support for 5G, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, and a USB Type-C port, ensuring modern and versatile usage. The device is also built to withstand challenging environments, boasting an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The iPhone 16 comes in three storage options—128GB, 256GB, and 512GB—with ongoing offers applicable to all variants. It is available in five striking colors: Black, Pink, Teal, Ultramarine, and White, catering to diverse aesthetic preferences.

Priced at Rs 601, the new mobile plan offers unlimited 5G data for a whole year. What’s even better? You can buy it for yourself or gift it to your friends or family. Here’s how it works: — To enjoy unlimited 5G, you must already be on a Jio recharge plan that offers at least 1.5 GB of 4G data per day. 
— Plans like Rs 199, Rs 239, Rs 299, and others in this range are eligible. 
— Unfortunately, if you’re using Jio’s more basic 1 GB per day plan or the Rs 1,899 annual recharge plan, this voucher won’t work for you.What you get with the Rs 601 voucher When you purchase the Rs 601 Jio True 5G gift voucher, you’ll receive 12 upgrade vouchers. These can be redeemed one by one through the My Jio app. Once activated, users can enjoy unlimited 5G data and an increased 4G daily data limit of 3 GB per day. It’s important to note that the validity of this voucher aligns with your existing base plan’s validity, with a maximum limit of 30 days per voucher. This means if your base plan has 28 days of validity, the unlimited 5G benefits will last the same number of days for that period. However, the annual voucher provides a total of 12 such vouchers, giving you the freedom to activate them when needed over 12 months.Who Can Use This Plan? Jio’s unlimited 5G voucher will work with several popular recharge plans, like Rs 199, Rs 239, Rs 299, Rs 319, Rs 329, Rs 579, Rs 666, Rs 769, and Rs 899. If you’re already on one of these plans, you’re good to go. Just make sure your base plan is valid when you activate a voucher.How to Gift It to Someone Else The Rs 601 plan is designed not just for yourself but also as a gift option. You can purchase it for family or friends directly through the My Jio app. But before you gift it, make sure the recipient is on an eligible plan so they can enjoy the unlimited 5G benefits.Other 5G Plans from Jio Apart from the Rs 601 voucher, Jio also offers smaller 5G upgrade plans. These are priced at Rs 51, Rs 101, and Rs 151, with validity lasting one, two, and three months respectively. These are great for short-term needs or for those looking to try out Jio’s 5G services without a long-term commitment.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

7cff180b-2882-407e-a296-3c774db98888,TRAI directs telcos to provide call and SMS-only tariff plansThe latest TRAI mandate directs telecom operators to now also offer mobile tariff plans that focus only on SMS and voice calls.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/trai-directs-telecom-operators-to-provide-non-data-tariff-plans-2655486-2024-12-26,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has announced new regulations to make telecom services more affordable and consumer-friendly. The Telecom Consumers Protection (Twelfth Amendment) Regulations, 2024, issued on Monday, include several key changes to benefit users, especially those who rely heavily on basic calling and SMS or use secondary SIM cards for specific purposes like calls and SMS. One of the biggest changes is that telecom operators must now offer tariff plans that focus only on SMS and voice calls. This is a big relief for millions of users, particularly the estimated 150 million (15 crores) people in India who still use basic mobile services. Many of these users don’t need data services but are forced to buy expensive plans that bundle data along with calls and SMS. These new SMS-and-call-only plans will allow such users to pay only for the services they actually use. The change is also expected to benefit users who keep a secondary SIM card exclusively for making calls or sending messages. Until now, these users had no choice but to pay for data benefits they didn’t want. TRAI’s new rules aim to fix this imbalance and make telecom plans more tailored to user needs. However, this move could impact telecom companies like Airtel and Vi. Reliance Jio, which operates only 4G and 5G networks, is unlikely to be directly affected by this regulation. Telecom companies have been focusing on increasing their Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by offering bundled plans that include a mix of data, calling, SMS, and even benefits like subscriptions to OTT platforms. This new mandate might force them to rethink their strategies. The regulations also bring another consumer-friendly change — increasing the validity of Special Tariff Vouchers (STVs). These vouchers, which are usually more affordable than standard plans, will now have a validity of up to 365 days, compared to the earlier limit of 90 days. This means users can enjoy the benefits of these special plans for a longer period without frequent recharges. In addition, TRAI has instructed telecom operators to ensure that top-up vouchers are available in various denominations, starting from as low as Rs 10. This step is aimed at making small-value recharges more accessible and convenient for consumers, especially those with limited budgets. TRAI’s decisions are based on extensive consumer surveys and stakeholder feedback. The telecom authority has emphasised that these changes are designed to ensure users get the best value for their money and aren’t forced to pay for services they don’t use.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Along with the two phones, the company will also launch an updated variant of the OnePlus Buds Pro 3. Leading up to the event, the company has been teasing a bunch of details about the phone. For instance, OnePlus has confirmed that the OnePlus 13 will launch in India in three colourways: Black Eclipse, Arctic Dawn, and Midnight Ocean. The company has also revealed that the smartphone will feature  IP68 and IP69 rating. The OnePlus 13 is also confirmed to be powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.  OnePlus has also revealed that the OnePlus 13 will come with OxygenOS 15 out-of-the-box. The smartphone will also be integrated with a bunch of AI features like Intelligent Search, AI-powered photography tools, and more.OnePlus 13: Expected specifications and features While that’s all OnePlus has confirmed about the OnePlus 13 in India so far, however, considering that the phone has already launched in China, there is already a lot we know or can expect from the OnePlus 13. In China, the OnePlus 13 features a 6.82-inch display — matching the size of its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. It boasts a 120Hz refresh rate and QHD+ resolution, delivering stunning visuals. The screen remains impressively bright, with 1,600 nits of standard brightness and a peak of 4,500 nits. However, two standout upgrades set this model apart: glove compatibility and a dynamic local high refresh rate feature.  The glove usability feature is particularly handy for colder regions, like Delhi during winter, allowing users to operate the phone effortlessly while wearing gloves. The dynamic high refresh rate feature intelligently adjusts the screen’s refresh rate based on activity—for instance, lowering it while watching videos but switching seamlessly to 60Hz, 90Hz, or 120Hz for smoother scrolling. Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 runs on Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, ensuring top-notch performance. One of its major upgrades is the battery. The device now packs a larger 6,000mAh battery, an upgrade from the 5,400mAh unit in the OnePlus 12, promising nearly two days of use. It supports 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, with the addition of magnetic wireless charging via a special case, a first for OnePlus. On the camera front, the OnePlus 13 retains the 50-megapixel LYT-808 primary sensor but enhances the telephoto and ultrawide lenses to 50 megapixels each. The Hasselblad branding remains a highlight, complemented by 4K/60fps Dolby Vision video capabilities for stellar photography and videography. Durability has also been a focus, with IP68 and IP69 certifications ensuring the phone is not just water-resistant but can withstand high-pressure water jets. It includes an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor for precise unlocking, even with wet hands. Additionally, the phone introduces a new vibration motor, enhancing the gaming experience with more immersive feedback.  Packed with cutting-edge features and thoughtful upgrades, the OnePlus 13 sets a new benchmark for premium smartphones.OnePlus 13: Expected price in India The price of the OnePlus 13 has not yet been revealed, but it is anticipated to remain under Rs 70,000. For context, the OnePlus 12 launched in India at a starting price of Rs 64,999. Even if OnePlus decides to slightly raise the price for its latest model, it is expected to stay within the Rs 70,000 range.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Apple MacBook Air with M4 chip could launch even before iPhone SE 4Also read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateAlso read |  OnePlus Open 2 launch timeline leaked: Here is when it will launch in 2025

However, a new report reveals that some technical challenges make this difficult to achieve.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-18-to-be-apples-first-bezel-free-display-phone-here-is-what-the-fresh-leak-revealed-2655544-2024-12-26,"Apple has long been working towards creating a completely bezel-free iPhone, and a recent supply chain leak suggests the company was hoping to achieve this with the iPhone 18, set for release in 2026. However, according to the TheElec report, technical challenges are making this goal uncertain, despite the efforts of display suppliers Samsung and LG. 9To5Mac reported that the idea of a bezel-free iPhone stems from former Apple design chief Jony Ive's vision of a ""single slab of glass."" This would involve the entire front of the phone being a seamless display, with no visible bezels or edges. While Apple made strides towards this concept with the iPhone X in 2017, the progress since then has been gradual, with smaller bezels but no complete elimination. Apple is aiming for a design where the display wraps around the sides of the phone, creating a continuous screen without any interruptions, according to reports. However, suppliers have struggled to meet Apple's requirements for this advanced design. According to TheElec site, the discussions between Apple and its display partners are still ongoing, and some hurdles remain unresolved. Several practical issues need to be addressed before a truly bezel-free iPhone can become a reality. These include ensuring that the joint between the curved display and the phone’s body is waterproof, preventing distortions like the ""magnifying glass effect"" that can occur with curved edges, and maintaining antenna performance without interference from the new design. Additionally, the durability of the curved screen edges is another concern, as they could be more vulnerable to impact damage. While Apple had reportedly hoped to introduce this bold design with at least one model of the iPhone 18, the timeline is now unclear due to these challenges. But, there is still a lot of time for the launch of the iPhone 18 series and if Apple manages to make it possible by 2026, then we might get to see it. For now, the company is rumoured to launch a new model iPhone 17 Air or Slim by the end of next year, which is said to be the slimmest ever device from Apple, according to the leaks.

Expected to launch in September 2025, the next-generation iPhones might include a bunch of major updates, including the long-awaited ProMotion display on all models to a brand-new design and improved cameras. But there’s more — Apple might also introduce a new model, the iPhone 17 Air, replacing the Plus model. The iPhone 17 Air could be the thinnest iPhone ever, even slimmer than the iPhone 6, which was just 6.9mm thick. Some reports suggest the 17 Air will measure around 6.25mm, which is a big deal considering modern iPhones have been getting thicker to accommodate larger batteries, better cameras, and Face ID.  According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone 17 Air will be about 2mm thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro, which measures 8.25mm. To make this possible, Apple is rumoured to be using its own custom-designed 5G modem chip. This chip is reportedly smaller than Qualcomm’s, saving much-needed space inside the device. Apple has also optimised the internal layout, ensuring the 17 Air doesn’t sacrifice battery life, camera quality, or display performance. Analyst Jeff Pu predicts the thickness of the iPhone 17 Air could be about 6mm, while The Information suggests it might range between 5mm and 6mm.  For years, Apple’s ProMotion technology, which offers a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, has been exclusive to the Pro models. But in 2025, this feature might come to the entire iPhone lineup. This means even the standard iPhone 17 models will benefit from smoother scrolling and improved touch response. Moreover, ProMotion also supports a variable refresh rate, ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz. This helps save battery life when high refresh rates aren’t needed. On top of that, the iPhone 17 series is expected to feature a new anti-reflective display layer, similar to what we have also seen on the Galaxy S24 Ultra.  The iPhone 17 Pro models are rumoured to be powered by Apple’s next-generation A19 Pro chip. Speculated to be built using TSMC’s advanced 3nm process, this chip will likely deliver faster performance and better energy efficiency. Apple might also introduce its own Wi-Fi 7 chip, replacing the Broadcom chips used in earlier models. When it comes to RAM, there’s some debate. Higher-end models like the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are expected to feature 12GB of RAM, a significant upgrade from the 8GB in the iPhone 15 Pro and the 16 Pro. The standard iPhone 17 and the 17 Air will likely come with 8GB of RAM, which is the same as the standard iPhone 16.  All iPhone 17 models are expected to include a new 24MP front-facing camera, a big jump from the current 12MP selfie cameras. At the rear, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is rumoured to have a triple-camera setup, with three 48MP sensors. This includes a primary camera, an ultra-wide camera, and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. Meanwhile, the standard iPhone 17 and the 17 Air will likely stick to a single 48MP rear camera. One standout rumour is that at least one iPhone 17 variant will include a mechanical aperture. This feature would allow users to adjust the aperture size, giving them more creative control over their photos. The iPhone 17 series might also introduce a fresh design. Reports suggest the iPhone 17 Air model will have a centred camera bump, moving the rear camera from the upper-left corner to the middle of the device. This could give the phone a unique look while maintaining functionality.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The latest update is live on the App Store and if you are an iOS user, you can download it. With the new update, WhatsApp now offers tools that make it more engaging and practical, especially for those who love using the camera or frequently sharing documents. One of the standout features in this update is the addition of AR (augmented reality) effects. When using the camera within WhatsApp, users will now notice a new image wand icon next to the gallery button in the viewfinder. This opens up a variety of AR effects that can be applied to photos and videos. Whether it’s adding playful confetti, magical sparkles, or even creating the illusion of being underwater, these effects bring a creative twist to your captures. Other available effects include starry windows, teardrops, and even a karaoke mode for fun, music-themed content.  In addition to AR effects, WhatsApp has also introduced new backgrounds that can be applied during video recording. These backgrounds are designed to obscure the user’s surroundings, offering more privacy or simply creating a different mood for the video. Along with this, the app now lets users adjust the colour tone of their videos, allowing for subtle tweaks to make your footage look just right. Another practical feature in this update is the document scanning option, which is now integrated into the file-sharing menu. When you open the document-sharing window, you’ll find a new option labelled “Scan Document.” This feature is incredibly handy for anyone who needs to quickly digitise physical documents. Once you capture an image of the document, the app automatically crops the edges for a cleaner look. It also provides options to adjust the image using filters like colour, greyscale, and black-and-white. For added convenience, there’s an auto-shutter mode that captures the document automatically when it’s perfectly aligned in the frame. Users can also manually adjust the borders if needed.  These new tools come shortly after WhatsApp rolled out a series of festive updates to enhance video calls and messages ahead of the New Year celebrations. Users can enjoy new animations, stickers, and even themed calling effects that reflect the season’s cheer.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Krishnan’s appointment comes at a time when debates around immigration and tech policy are more charged than ever. Critics have taken to social media to accuse Krishnan of undermining Trump’s “America First” agenda, and they are demanding a ban on the H1-B Visa. Basically, they want fewer Indians in Silicon Valley. Krishnan’s opposition on X (formerly Twitter) was led by far-right political activist Laura Loomer. Her ire was particularly focused on Krishnan’s advocacy for removing country-specific caps on green cards, a reform that is aimed at addressing the lengthy backlog that disproportionately affects Indian applicants.   In a post on X, Loomer wrote, “Deeply disturbing to see the appointment of Sriram Krishnan @sriramk as Senior Policy Advisor for AI.” She alleged that Krishnan’s policies would encourage foreign workers to dominate Silicon Valley, sidelining American STEM graduates. Her stance struck a chord with parts of Trump’s base that remain skeptical of high-skilled immigration.  
 



 


Silicon valley vs Trump supporters The backlash didn’t stop there. New York-based conservative columnist Gavin Mario Wax amplified the criticism, warning of the dangers of relying on “cheap foreign tech workers.” Loomer quickly backed him, arguing that such conflicts predated Trump’s re-election. Their argument painted a picture of Silicon Valley as a battleground between “tech bros” and nationalist populists, a coalition bound to fracture under pressure.  
 


 However, prominent figures in the tech world quickly came to Sriram’s defence. Venture capitalist David Sacks, dismissed the accusations. “Sriram is definitely not a ‘career leftist,’” Sacks tweeted, attempting to distance Krishnan from the ideological tags pinned by his detractors. Meanwhile, Joe Lonsdale, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, argued that the US must continue to attract the “best and brightest” to maintain its global edge.  
 



 


The Immigration conundrum  At the heart of the debate is the controversial H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire skilled foreign workers. While proponents see it as a vital tool for attracting top talent, critics argue that it displaces American workers and suppresses wages. Trump supporters view Krishnan’s appointment as a signal of a shift in immigration policy, one they believe undermines domestic talent.   At the heart of the debate is the controversial H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire skilled foreign workers.

Trump supporters view Krishnan’s appointment as a signal of a shift in immigration policy, one they believe undermines domestic talent.   Krishnan’s advocacy for reforms like removing country-specific caps on green cards further fuels the controversy. Currently, US immigration laws allocate green cards equally among all countries, a system that disproportionately affects Indian applicants due to high demand. While applicants from smaller countries face minimal delays, Indians often wait over a decade. Krishnan has called for a merit-based system that prioritises efficiency, a stance that has drawn support from figures like Elon Musk but enraged immigration skeptics.  Silicon valley’s response   The tech community has rallied around Krishnan, highlighting the indispensable contributions of high-skilled immigrants to the US economy. Jason Calacanis, a tech investor, was among those who pushed back against the anti-immigration rhetoric, emphasising that immigrants are integral to innovation and economic growth. Krishnan himself remained assertive, defending his stance on policies designed to make the US a magnet for global talent.   The divide between Silicon Valley and Trump’s base is emblematic of a broader cultural and political conflict. On one side are tech leaders advocating for open borders to foster innovation, while on the other are populists who believe unchecked immigration threatens American jobs and values. For now, the debate rages on. Trump’s base sees Krishnan’s nomination as a betrayal of the “America First” ethos, while Silicon Valley views it as a step toward preserving US leadership in technology.

While not perfect, it stands out with its ergonomic build, vibrant display, and solid battery life.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/poco-m7-pro-5g-review-strong-on-the-fundamentals-2655685-2024-12-26,"After spending two weeks with the Poco M7 Pro 5G, I can confidently say — Poco knows exactly what people want. Speed, power, and value, all at a price tag that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket. And with the M7 Pro priced at just Rs 14,999, it’s hard to find much to complain about. You see, this phone isn’t just a small step up from last year’s M6 Pro, which, let’s be honest, didn’t feel like much of an upgrade over the M5 itself.  The Poco M7 Pro is different — it brings noticeable upgrades across the board. From the camera to the display, to the chipset that powers it all, Poco has made sure this phone isn’t just another budget option — it’s the one that stands out. But here’s the big question — are these upgrades good enough to warrant a purchase? How do these upgrades stack up in real-world performance? Read our review of the Poco M7 Pro to find out.  Poco M7 Pro 5G: Quick look at the specs — Display: 6.78-inch FHD+, 120Hz refresh rate, AMOLED, Gorilla Glass 5 protection, in-display fingerprint sensor
— Dimensions: 8mm thickness, 190g weight
— Chipset: MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra, 6nm fabrication process
— RAM and storage: 6GB + 128GB (Rs 14,999), 8GB + 256GB (Rs 16,999)
— Battery: 5,110mAh
— Charging: 45W, charger included in-box
— Software: HyperOS based on Android 14, 2 years of OS updates plus 4 years of security patches
— Camera: 50MP Sony LYTIA LYT-600 primary rear camera, 2MP depth sensor, 20MP front
— Miscellaneous: IP64 rating, 3.5mm headphone jack, IR blaster, dual-stereo speakers, USB type-C portA phone can look good and be ergonomic The Poco M7 Pro carries the typical Poco design that looks good, feels robust and just clicks right. Of course, there are a few tweaks to the phone’s design over the M6 Pro, such as the curves around the corner at the rear for a better grip, a camera island for the rear lenses and a two-tone finish. Speaking of which, this two-tone finish gives the M7 Pro a distinct character. Granted, the Lavender Frost colour, aka the light mauve colour, may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but trust me when I say this — you have to see this colour in person to believe how beautiful it looks. It isn’t as gaudy as it looks in the promotional images. In fact, after using the lavender shade for myself, I wonder how cool the Lunar Dust (silver) colourway would be. Not to mention, there’s also a third colour option — Olive Twilight, which honestly, I don’t like that much.  Having said that, while liking a particular colour or design is always a subjective matter, what can’t be denied is how ergonomic this phone is. There are a bunch of phones in this price range that I have seen and used, that don’t look and feel the part. But, the Poco M7 Pro has the right balance of good looks, and a good build that makes it comfortable to hold and operate. Don’t get me wrong, it is still 190g in weight and about 8mm thick, but for some reason, the phone feels lighter and sleeker when you actually use it.   Bonus: To add good ergonomics to the phone, Poco has fortunately not skipped on the practical additions, like an IR blaster, dual-stereo speakers, a type-C port, and an in-display fingerprint reader.  For added peace of mind, there’s also an IP64 rating for dust and water resistance. Last I remember, similar phones — for instance, the Galaxy A16 that launched in October 2024 –– come with just an IP54 rating and are priced higher than the M7 Pro for the same RAM and storage configuration. For the unaware, the first digit in an IP rating indicates the level of protection against solids. In Poco's case, the ""6"" in IP64 offers a higher level of solid protection than the ""5"" in IP54. As for the overall design of the phone, it looks like a Poco phone. Some may say Poco is recycling the same design –– which isn’t entirely wrong –– but, truth be told, Poco has played it safe here, and that’s not always a bad thing. In Poco’s defence, the overall experience is solid here. After a long time, I have tested a phone in the budget segment that looks the part, doesn’t cut corners on the necessary features, and is supremely comfortable to use. A display that surprised me, in a good way Smartphone companies these days boast a lot about their device’s peak brightness, where in reality — peak brightness is just a number to describe the maximum brightness a smartphone's display can achieve, even if it's only in a small area of the screen. It's often used to describe the brightness of HDR content, like videos. So, when I was going through the phone’s promotional material on X — Poco claimed that the M7 Pro has the brightest display on a phone in its segment. I honestly thought how good can it be, considering we are talking about a sub-Rs 15,000 device here? To be frank, quite good. First of all, the Poco M7 Pro has some of the slimmest bezels you would see on a budget smartphone. Looking at the front profile, you can easily mistake it for a more expensive phone.   And if we talk about the brightness, the M7 Pro has a peak brightness of 2,100nits, and while I can’t confirm the number in high brightness mode, you can rest assured the phone gets plenty bright, both indoors and outdoors. When indoors, of course, the display is pretty nice and vibrant when watching videos, playing games or simply gawking at the screen. The viewing angles are spot on. But, it is decently legible even when using it outdoors.  I am glad that Poco didn’t fall for the curved display trend that’s coming back with the likes of Lava Blaze X. Sure, they look good, but curved display also means accidental touches and glare. The Poco M7 Pro has a flat display. Which means, reduced chances of mistouches and glare around the edges. Overall, the 120Hz AMOLED screen is also bright and smooth. It's a big step up from its predecessor and definitely, one of the best panels you can get on a phone at this price point. Good real-world performance with a few minor niggles Performance in budget phones has often been a hit-and-miss. In fact, in recent memory, I can only remember the CMF Phone 1 to be a device that is priced under Rs 15,000, and is probably the smoothest phone you can get on this budget. And, while, I won’t say, the Poco M7 Pro has the best performance in a phone at this budget, it is definitely one of the best.  Part of the reason is the Dimensity 7025 Ultra chip, which is also there inside the recently launched Redmi Note 14. Now, we won’t get into the nitty gritties on how similar the Poco is to the Redmi and vice versa. But, for what it’s worth — the M7 Pro performs pretty well in day-to-day use. Granted, minor hiccups and frame drops do appear here and there, but speed and responsiveness on a whole easily get 8 out of 10, which is quite good considering we are talking about a budget phone.  HyperOS atop Android 14 is also feature-loaded. However, there are a couple of things to point out here. The phone is loaded with pre-installed apps. It’s annoying for sure, but it’s through bloatware and ads that brands are able to offer such solid smartphones like the M7 Pro under Rs 15,000. Also, you can always uninstall most of the apps.   Downside of the OS, though: Not having Android 15 on a brand-new phone is kind of a missed opportunity. Not that Android 14 is bad, but, the whole purpose of having two years of main OS updates is defeated with a year-old Android software version.  That said, coming from MIUI on the M6 Pro, HyperOS on the Poco M7 Pro feels like a big upgrade. It has faster app loading time, and surprisingly good background memory retention, despite my unit only having 6GB RAM. There are also a bunch of other things that make the software experience good. For instance, there are several customisations you can do on the lockscreen. The quick settings menu that we have recently seen on OxygenOS 15, is already there on HyperOS. They are both quite iOS-inspired, but I am not complaining. Additionally, the Home Screen layout is more stable, with no excess space at the top and neatly displayed folder icons. This phone easily lasts a day The Poco M7 Pro stands out with its amazing endurance numbers. It comes with a solid 5,110mAh battery, which can easily get you through an entire day on regular use without needing to charge it again. Even if you’re someone who uses their phone a bit heavily — streaming videos, gaming, or video calling — you’ll probably only start looking for a charger by the end of the day, which is still pretty good. When it’s time to charge, the Poco M7 Pro doesn’t keep you waiting for long. It takes about 30 minutes to go from 0 to 60 per cent, and about 65 minutes for a full charge, which is impressive when you compare it to similar phones in this range. Plus, you don’t have to worry about buying a fast charger separately because the phone comes with a 45W charger included in the box. Decent camera performance across different lighting conditions The main camera on the Poco M7 Pro takes 12.5-megapixel photos by default, and it does a pretty good job in daylight. The pictures come out nice, with balanced brightness and colours that look lively. It also handles both bright and dark areas well, so you get decent detail across the image. The photos are sharp and clear, which is great for everyday shots.  If you want to use the full 50-megapixel resolution, there’s a special mode for that. The photos in this mode appear noticeably sharper than the regular ones, but there’s a trade-off — you might notice a bit of grain in the pictures, in some cases. Also, the colours slightly lean towards a warmer tone. It’s not a huge difference, but it’s something to keep in mind.  The portrait mode is also quite good and does a fine job with edge detection. However, in some cases, it tends to over-brighten the image. But it only sometimes happens, so if there’s an issue like this, you can always retake the photo and hopefully, the phone will get it right at the next attempt.  Click on any photo below to access all the camera samples When it comes to low-light photography, the cameras do an okay job if you use night mode. The pictures look much better and capture more detail in the night mode, but without it, you might see some graininess and light streaks ruining the shot. The 20-megapixel front camera’s performance is surprisingly good for a phone at this price. Casual selfies captured in good lighting turn out great. The skin tones look pretty natural and even portrait photos come out with accurate edge detection. There are also a bunch of fun filters you can play around with, which add a bit of fun to the selfie-taking experience.Poco M7 Pro 5G: Final verdict Poco has put a lot of thought into this phone that punches well above its weight.  At a starting price of Rs 14,999, it feels like Poco has hit the sweet spot for folks on a budget, who don’t want to compromise on features or performance.  The phone's design, while safe and typical of Poco, stands out with its ergonomic build and gorgeous two-tone finishes, especially the Lavender Frost colourway. Using the phone daily feels comfortable, and it doesn’t feel like you’re lugging around a bulky device despite a 6.78-inch display. The addition of practical features like an in-display fingerprint sensor, dual-stereo speakers, and an IP64 rating shows that Poco hasn’t cut corners. The display was a surprise package for me. It’s bright, sharp, and vibrant, and using it outdoors or indoors is a treat.   Performance-wise, the Dimensity 7025 Ultra does its job well, handling everyday tasks with ease. Sure, there are minor hiccups and frame drops now and then, but that’s expected in this price range. HyperOS feels smooth and loaded with features, though it would’ve been nice to see Android 15 right out of the box. Battery life is another big win for the M7 Pro. It can easily last a full day of moderate to heavy usage, and the 45W fast charger in the box ensures you’re not stuck waiting when it’s time to juice up. The cameras are decent for a budget phone. The main camera performs well in good lighting, and the selfies from the front camera are a pleasant surprise. The low-light performance is where it struggles a bit, but night mode does help improve the results. Overall, I wouldn’t call the Poco M7 Pro, the perfect sub-Rs 15,000 smartphone. But, it’s certainly a fantastic choice if you’re looking for a budget-friendly phone that delivers on design, display, and battery life while offering solid day-to-day performance.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Lured by promises of easy money for minimal work, the man ended up transferring a large sum of money over a period of time before realising he had been scammed. The cybercrime police have since filed an FIR against 14 people under various sections of the IPC and IT Act for their involvement in the case. The scam began on August 16, when the victim received a Telegram message from a woman named Ansuya. She introduced him to a part-time job that promised earnings of Rs 4,650 for just three hours of online work each day.  After two days, another woman, Abhinaya, contacted him claiming to be associated with a company called 'Mango Fashion.' She guided the businessman to register on the company's platform, where his digital wallet was credited with a Rs 10,000 bonus. As he continued completing tasks, his wallet balance grew, making him believe the opportunity was legitimate. Encouraged by the increasing wallet balance, the man was convinced by Abhinaya to invest in Mango Fashion, with promises of even greater returns. Over time, he transferred a total of Rs 58.06 lakh to 11 different bank accounts provided to him by the scammers. His digital wallet showed Rs 76 lakh, including profits, but when he attempted to withdraw the funds, he was only able to retrieve Rs 30,858 in two small transactions.  As repeated attempts to withdraw larger sums failed, he realised he had been duped. On August 29, he reached out to the cybercrime helpline and filed a formal complaint, which led to an investigation. Finally, on December 24, the police registered an FIR against 14 individuals connected to the fraud. This case highlights the growing number of part-time job scams that target unsuspecting victims through messaging platforms. To avoid falling prey to such schemes, it is better to verify the legitimacy of any job offers, especially if they arrive unsolicited. Genuine companies do not ask for money or investments upfront. Any request for payments should raise suspicion. If you find yourself in a similar situation, it is important to report the matter to the authorities as quickly as possible to prevent further financial loss.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 26, 2024

The company confirmed that its AI models, including its video model, Sora and ChatGPT, were down for several hours. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-faces-second-major-outage-in-december-2656015-2024-12-27,"This is the second time that OpenAI's ChatGPT has suffered a major outage. At around 1:30 PM ET (12 AM IST), many users experienced issues with ChatGPT, as the chatbot abruptly stopped responding to queries, according to an outage tracking website, DownDetector. Some users were met with an ""internal server error"" message.  According to DownDetector, tons of US users reported that the site wasn't working for them in the early afternoon, though the reports started receding after half an hour or so. Noticing the outage, OpenAI posted on X claiming that it has identified the issue and is working on it.  OpenAI didn’t specify the “upstream provider” linked to the issue, but its exclusive cloud provider, Microsoft, reported a “power issue” at one of its data centers that started around the same time as the OpenAI problems and affected North America, and problems with Xbox cloud gaming.
 


 API and Sora were also experiencing outages, according to OpenAI. A few hours later, the company posted that the Sora issue has been fixed and it is currently working on ChatGPT and API, which are also almost fixed. ChatGPT has experienced multiple outages this month, with the latest occurring on December 11, the same day Apple launched iOS 18.2 featuring GPT integration in Siri. Consequently, some users may be unable to use the OpenAI chatbot through Siri at the moment. 
 


 Last time, in December 11, ChatGPT underwent a similar outage. All three platforms were affected during the last outage as well: Sora, ChatGPT and API. According to Downdetector, there were 2,483 outage reports during that time.  The AI model has been suffering such outage for quite some time. On November 8, ChatGPT was unavailable to over 19,000 users worldwide for 30 minutes. At the time, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted that ChatGPT had been down for 30 minutes, adding a frown emoji and saying, ""We are much, much better at reliability than we used to be, but clearly more work in front of us.""  That said, since its debut in November 2022, ChatGPT has gained 250 million weekly active users. OpenAI's valuation has skyrocketed to $157 billion, up from $14 billion in 2021, with revenues soaring to $3.6 billion from zero, far surpassing the projections made by Sam Altman at the time. Earlier this month, Altman mentioned that the company’s technology was now reaching 300 million active users weekly.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

Samsung has been building an ecosystem that helps its phones, tablets, and laptops work better together. The new update improves these features further, adding small but handy tools like Camera continuity. With Camera continuity, you can take a photo or scan a document on your Galaxy phone and then immediately continue working on it on another Galaxy device, like a Galaxy Book laptop. This can be helpful if you’re switching between your phone and laptop during work or study. The feature will work with Samsung apps like Samsung Internet and Samsung Notes. However, there are some requirements. Your devices need to be signed in to the same Samsung account, connected to the same Wi-Fi network, and close enough for Bluetooth to work. Samsung already offers cross-device syncing in apps like Samsung Notes. You can manually add photos or documents to notes, and they’ll automatically sync between devices. Camera continuity builds on this, making the process a bit smoother by automatically connecting your phone and laptop. This could save time for users who often use both devices for tasks like editing documents or managing photos. Another improvement in the One UI 7 update is a change to the feature previously known as Continue apps on other devices. Samsung has renamed it to “Continue on other devices” to better reflect its expanded functionality. Now, in addition to switching between apps like Samsung Internet and Notes, the feature also syncs your saved Wi-Fi networks across devices. This isn’t entirely new, as Samsung devices could already sync Wi-Fi through Samsung Cloud, but it’s now a more visible part of the system. One UI 7 also suggests that more apps may eventually be included in this feature. Earlier versions of the software specifically mentioned only Samsung Internet and Notes. The updated settings page now mentions “other apps,” which could mean that more third-party apps will be supported in the future. If you already use multiple Galaxy devices, the new features in One UI 7 might make your experience more convenient. While they aren’t revolutionary changes — something that we haven’t seen before — they’re part of Samsung’s effort to make its ecosystem a little more user-friendly with each update.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Rumours suggest the event will be held on January 22, as per some leaked documents. However, the company has yet to confirm the official launch date. At the event, the company is expected to launch four new smartphones: the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and the new and highly-anticipated Galaxy S25 Slim. The latter may be revealed at the event but is expected to be made available later in 2025. Along with the smartphones, Samsung is also expected to release the next-generation Galaxy Ring at the event. Ahead of things going official, there have been several leaks around the phones. The latest reveals a new colourway for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Shared by the popular Samsung leaker @iceuniverse on X (formerly Twitter), the phone will come in a new blue variant this time. But honestly, when we looked at the post, it took us a minute to understand things. The leaker has put up a picture of a grey colour swatch, but the post reads “S25 Ultra. Blue.” Had it not been for the text in the post, we would never have guessed it to be a shade of blue.
 


 Anyway, nitty gritties of the post aside, the leaker suggests that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be coming in a blue, almost-grey colour.   Anyway, nitty gritties of the post aside, the leaker suggests that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be coming in a blue, almost-grey colour.  In the past, the smartphone has also been leaked in a space grey-ish colour, a deep blue, a light blue, and grey. 
 


 At this point, it’s hard to distinguish one from the other, but shades of grey and blue seem to be the general colourway for the phone. It’s unclear if these colors will also be available on other Galaxy S24 models. There have also been other leaks regarding the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Recently, a report revealed that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will feature 16GB of RAM, exclusive to its 512GB and 1TB storage variants. The base model with 256GB storage will come with 12GB of RAM. This configuration is a notable distinction within the Galaxy S25 lineup.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra launch date, pre-order, sale details Pre-orders for the Galaxy S25 in South Korea are expected to take place from January 24 to February 3, 2025, with deliveries and in-store sales beginning on February 7. In international markets, including the US, pre-orders are likely to follow a similar timeline, starting around January 22 or 23 and closing in early February. This schedule mirrors Samsung’s approach with the Galaxy S24, which was unveiled on January 17, 2024, with pre-orders starting immediately and the phone becoming available by January 31.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateAlso read |  OneUI 7 adds improved continuity features for Galaxy devicesAlso read |  OnePlus Ace 5 aka OnePlus 13R launched: Price, specs and more

Contractors noticed that Claude has stricter safety settings, avoiding unsafe prompts, while Gemini flags such inputs more explicitly.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-collaborates-with-anthropic-to-improve-gemini-ai-using-claude-2656066-2024-12-27,"Google is reportedly relying on Claude, an AI model developed by Anthropic, to help improve the performance of its own AI system, Gemini. According to a report from TechCrunch, contractors hired by Google are tasked with comparing responses generated by Gemini and Claude to the same user prompts. Their job is to evaluate the quality of the output based on factors such as truthfulness, clarity, and verbosity. The process works like this: Contractors are shown responses from both Gemini and Claude for a specific prompt. They then have up to 30 minutes to carefully assess each answer and rate how well it meets the evaluation criteria. This feedback helps Google identify areas where Gemini may need improvement. Interestingly, the contractors started noticing some unusual patterns during this evaluation process. On occasions, Gemini’s output included references like, “I am Claude, created by Anthropic,” sparking curiosity about how closely the two systems might be connected. One thing that stood out in the comparison was Claude’s strict approach to safety. Contractors reportedly observed that Claude tends to avoid replying to prompts it deems unsafe, staying firm on maintaining high ethical standards. On the other hand, Gemini sometimes flagged these unsafe prompts but did so in a way that contractors found more detailed yet possibly less strict. For instance, in one case involving prompts related to nudity and bondage, Claude refused to engage, while Gemini identified the input as a huge safety violation. Google has a system in place for these comparisons, using an internal platform that makes it easier for contractors to test and review multiple AI models side by side. However, the use of Claude for this purpose has raised some questions. Anthropic’s terms of service explicitly state that users are not allowed to access Claude to create or train competing AI products without approval. This rule applies to other companies using the model, but it’s unclear if it extends to investors like Google, which backs Anthropic financially. In response to the speculation, Shira McNamara, a spokesperson for Google DeepMind, clarified the situation. She emphasised that comparing AI models is standard practice in the industry and essential for improving performance. McNamara firmly denied any claims that Google has used Anthropic’s Claude to train Gemini, calling such suggestions inaccurate. For now, the collaboration highlights how competitive the AI industry has become, with major players like Google leveraging a mix of internal development and external partnerships to enhance their models. At the same time, it also raises questions about ethical boundaries and how companies balance collaboration with competition.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The company has yet to announce an official launch date, but Oppo has been teasing the new smartphone series on X (formerly Twitter) quite frequently now. We are expecting the Reno 13 series will launch sometime in the second week of January 2025. The Reno 13 series will likely include two smartphones: the Reno 13 and Reno 13 Pro. Ahead of the launch, the company has revealed the design of the smartphones.  The Reno 13 and 13 Pro have been confirmed to sport two vertically aligned cameras and a third on its right. The two vertically aligned cameras are so big and prominent that your eye doesn’t go to the third one, and the camera setup gives off a very iPhone-like design. In the teaser, there are two colours that we notice. There is white and a beautiful lavender. You can tell that we are already feeling a little inclined towards the lavender colourway. Both variants have a pattern on the back, which in the white model gives off a marble-like appearance. Oppo says it is a “one piece sculpted glass” back.

— OPPO (@oppo) December 25, 2024 The teaser confirms that the phone has an aluminium frame. Interestingly, the phone uses an almost flat display, with slight curves on the edges, which can possibly give you the best of both worlds –– thinner bezels, less glare, and reduced accidental touches. In previous posts, Oppo has also confirmed that the rear panel of the Reno 13 series will be protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 7i. Oppo hasn’t gone into details about it yet, but the teasers do list the phones as AI phones, as were last year’s Oppo Reno 12 series. Which means, we could expect a few upgrades in terms of the AI features on the phone. The Oppo Reno 12 Pro was loaded with AI features like AI Best Face, AI Eraser 2.0, and AI Clear Face. For productivity, it offered AI Summary, AI Record Summary, AI Clear Voice, AI Writer, and AI Speak. Oppo Reno 13 series: What to expect The Reno 13 series, already launched in China, provides a glimpse of what to expect from these smartphones. In China, the series features a 6.59-inch flat AMOLED display with a crisp 2760x1256 pixel resolution and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, offering vibrant visuals and seamless performance. Powering the devices is the MediaTek Dimensity 8350 chipset, a notable upgrade with an improved GPU for enhanced gaming and faster app performance. This is paired with a substantial 5,600mAh battery that supports 80W fast wired charging for quick recharges and extended use. Continuing the Reno series’ focus on camera excellence, the Reno 13 comes equipped with a 50-megapixel primary camera featuring optical image stabilisation (OIS) for sharp and steady photos, complemented by an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens for capturing broader perspectives. For selfies and video calls, a 50-megapixel front-facing camera ensures high-quality images and videos. The Reno 13 runs on ColorOS 15, based on Android 15, delivering a polished software experience with modern features and optimisation. Durability is another highlight, as the device boasts IP66, IP68, and IP69 certifications, making it dustproof and resistant to various water exposure conditions. In terms of pricing, the Reno 13 series starts at CNY 2,699 (approximately Rs 31,400) in China. While the official India pricing remains undisclosed, considering the Reno 12 launched at Rs 32,999 in India, the Reno 13 is likely to be priced in a similar range upon its Indian debut.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Oppo Reno 12 Pro review: It makes premium AI experience more accessibleAlso read |  Sriram in White House, Trump supporters demand ban on H1-B Visa and fewer Indians in Silicon ValleyAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim vs Apple iPhone 17 Air: All we know about the 2 most exciting phones of 2025

The company has a track record of introducing new budget or mid-range phones at the start of the year to give users better options. Although, Xiaomi has seemingly changed its strategy for a few smartphones. Why am I saying that? Well, the Redmi Note 14, which should have been announced in January 2025 like the previous model, debuted a month before in December 2024. Similarly, the successor to the Redmi A3 also arrived one month early. It's not just Xiaomi, several brands are racing to churn out new phones faster than their expected launch timelines to give consumers new options before others. However, this doesn't seem to be working for them because many of them are doing the same, something that we saw with flagship phones. The Vivo X200 Pro, Oppo Find X8 Pro, Realme GT 7 Pro, OnePlus 13 (only in China) and iQOO 13 debuted at the end of 2024. Coming back to the Redmi 14C, this will be a successor to the Redmi 13C, which made its debut in December last year. Xiaomi has just started teasing this product and hasn't confirmed the launch date. But since it has started teasing it and only a few days are left for 2024 to end, the budget Redmi 14C smartphone is likely coming in January 2025. The teaser suggests that the Redmi 14C will have a design similar to the Redmi A4, which is fine because this entry-level phone looks stunning. Its premium design can make anyone feel that this could be a mid-range premium device. It has a circular camera module at the back, including multiple sensors. But, the Redmi 14C will seemingly be available in a new blue hue, which looks quite attractive in teasers. It is believed that the new Redmi 14C will be a rebranded version of the recently launched Redmi 14R. So, we know its possible specifications. The Redmi 14C could be powered by a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 SoC and a 5,160mAh battery with support for 18W wired charging. It is reported to come with a massive 6.68-inch HD+ LCD screen with support for 120Hz refresh rate and 600nits of peak brightness. At the back, we might see a 13-megapixel dual rear camera setup. The new Redmi budget phone is expected to be priced under Rs 15,000 in India. You can stay tuned to India Today Tech to get all the latest updates.

Set to launch on January 22, 2025, leaks and rumours suggest that Samsung has focused on delivering meaningful upgrades to the Galaxy S25 vanilla variant, making it a solid choice for those seeking a powerful yet compact flagship device. However, it’s also important to consider its predecessor models, the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23, especially when price and value are key factors.advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25: Everything we know so farThe Galaxy S25 is rumoured to feature a similar design approach we are already accustomed to for that compact feel, making it more comfortable to hold and use daily. The display is expected to remain a dynamic AMOLED panel, likely around 6.3 inches. However, improvements in brightness levels and colour accuracy could make this screen one of the best in its class. Samsung has always been a leader in display technology, and it seems the Galaxy S25 will continue that trend. Performance is another area where the Galaxy S25 is expected to shine. Rumours suggest it will be powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The phone is expected to feature 12GB of RAM from the base version, which will again be a first for a vanilla Galaxy S phone. Battery life on the Galaxy S25 is another aspect to watch out for. While leaks suggest that it will feature a 4,000mAh battery like its predecessor, the more efficient chipset and optimised software could result in better overall performance.

In terms of cameras, the Galaxy S25 might once again include a triple-camera setup, headlined by a 50MP main sensor. The addition of improved AI processing for photos and videos could also enhance the overall experience. The front-facing camera is rumoured to be upgraded as well.Samsung Galaxy S24, Galaxy S23: Should you buy? Considering the aforementioned points, the Galaxy S25 seems like a fantastic upgrade in many ways. If Samsung takes a similar route in terms of pricing as the Galaxy S24, expect the S25 to launch in India at around Rs 80,000. Now, as good as the Galaxy S25 would be, this higher price point does put it out of reach for many consumers.  Fortunately, Samsung’s last-generation flagship models, the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23, offer excellent alternatives at much more affordable prices. The Galaxy S24, for example, is currently available for 50,999 online on Amazon. For those on an even tighter budget, the Galaxy S23 can be purchased for just Rs 37,999 on Flipkart, making it an incredible deal for a premium smartphone. The Galaxy S24, despite being almost a year old, still provides top-tier performance with its Exynos 2400 processor and a versatile camera system. It also features a gorgeous AMOLED display, similar in size and quality to the one expected in the S25. These similarities make the S24 an excellent choice for those who don’t need the very latest hardware but still want a modern and capable device. For budget-conscious buyers, the Galaxy S23 is even more appealing. At about Rs 38,000, it offers fantastic value with its compact 6.1-inch design, relatively powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, and dependable cameras. While it may lack some of the refinements found in the S25, it remains a solid choice for users who prioritise performance and reliability over having the absolute latest technology. Another key advantage of choosing the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S23 is their availability. As these models have been on the market for a while, they are widely supported by software updates, and accessories like cases and screen protectors are readily available at discounted prices. Additionally, the more established presence of these devices means that any software or hardware bugs have likely been resolved, providing a more stable user experience. The Rs 50,999 price of the Galaxy S24 on Amazon and the Rs 37,999 price of the Galaxy S23 on Flipkart make these models far more accessible while still delivering excellent performance and features.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

First introduced at the beginning of 2024 alongside the Galaxy S24 series, Circle to Search has quickly become one of Android’s most useful features. Initially, it was exclusive to select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy flagship phones. However, after about eight months, Google expanded its availability to other brands, including Xiaomi, Oppo, and Motorola. Now, Nothing has joined the list, bringing the feature to its smartphones. In a community post, Nothing shared that Circle to Search is now available on the Phone 2, Phone 2a, and Phone 2a Plus. These devices must be running Nothing OS 3.0, which is based on Android 15. The company explained that the feature wasn’t included in the initial release of Nothing OS 3.0 because it required additional testing.

 To use Circle to Search on Nothing phones, you’ll need to enable it first. Head to Settings > Special features > Gestures > Navigation mode > Circle to Search. If you don’t see the option right away, Nothing suggests rebooting your phone and trying again. The feature works with both gesture navigation and the traditional 3-button navigation, so you can use it no matter how you’ve set up your phone’s interface. Circle to Search is a simple but powerful tool. It lets you search for anything on your screen by drawing a circle around it. Whether it’s an image, text, or even a location, you can quickly get more information without having to copy and paste anything into Google Lens. This makes searching easier and faster for everyday tasks. For instance, you can use Circle to Search to look up a word’s meaning, translate text from an image, find details about a place, or even get directions. Google has also been improving Circle to Search since its launch. One of the latest updates added the ability to search for songs, making it even more useful. There are hints that Google is working on more upgrades, like enabling Circle to Search within videos. As for Nothing’s other devices, the company noted that Circle to Search will roll out to them once they receive the Android 15-based Nothing OS 3.0 update. This includes Phone 2a models sold in Japan and possibly the CMF Phone 1, which should also get the feature with its stable Android 15 release.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

While the standard and Pro models are now available globally, the tech community is buzzing with rumours about the upcoming Vivo X200 Ultra. According to fresh leaks, this high-end Ultra variant could debut in China in April 2025, with a slight possibility of arriving as early as March, according to tipster Digital Chat Station (DCS). However, for those wondering whether the Ultra model will be launched in India, the chances appear slim. The Vivo X200 Ultra model may not make it to India, much like its predecessor, the Vivo X100 Ultra, which never reached global markets. Noted tipster Yogesh Brar has further fuelled speculation by stating that the X200 Ultra isn’t expected to expand beyond China. However, we believe that if sales of the existing X200 series see an unexpected surge, it could force a strategic rethink by Vivo. However, it mostly seems that Indian consumers may have to settle for the standard and Pro models without the Ultra in the lineup. As for the features of the Vivo X200 Ultra, early leaks suggest that the device could offer a camera setup similar to the Vivo X200 Pro. Reports hint at a 50-megapixel primary sensor, a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto lens. While this configuration mirrors the Pro model, there are whispers that the Ultra could bring subtle upgrades, including larger apertures. We might also see it offering 5x optical image stabilisation (OIS) like the iPhone 16 Pro, but nothing is confirmed.  When it comes to video capabilities, the Ultra model is tipped to support 4K video recording at 120fps, like the Pro model. Under the hood, the Vivo X200 Ultra is tipped to be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, in contrast to the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chip found in the Pro model. We have already tested the devices that are using the same chipsets and their benchmark results have shown that the Snapdragon chip offers slightly better performance and efficiency compared to the MediaTek.  The Ultra may also feature a 2K display, a slight upgrade over the Pro’s 1.5K panel. As for battery life, rumours suggest a 6,000mAh battery with 100W fast charging, slightly faster than the Pro’s 90W charging support. For reference, the Vivo X200 currently retails at Rs 64,999, while the Pro version is priced at Rs 94,999. Whether the Ultra model will bring enough new features to justify a higher price remains to be seen. With the launch still a few months away, more details will likely emerge in the coming weeks. However, Indian consumers may have to watch from afar as the Ultra remains exclusive to the Chinese market, unless Vivo surprises with a broader release strategy.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

Alongside the regular Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and the top-end Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to stand out with a thinner and more compact design. While we wait for Samsung’s official announcement at the Galaxy Unpacked event, rumoured to be on January 22, 2025, a new leak sheds light on what makes the Galaxy S25 Slim unique. Reportedly, the Galaxy S25 Slim might use Samsung's latest ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) technology for its telephoto camera. This tech was recently announced by Samsung Semiconductor and promises to make smartphones thinner without sacrificing image quality. According to tipster Jukanlosreve on X, citing Meritz Securities, ALoP could be the key to giving the Galaxy S25 Slim its sleek profile while still packing a punch in the camera department.

 So, what exactly is ALoP? In simple terms, it’s a clever design for telephoto cameras that helps reduce the size of the camera module. Traditional telephoto cameras use folded optics, which can be bulky and lead to large camera bumps on the back of phones. ALoP solves this by positioning the telephoto lens flat, along the plane of the phone, and using a 40-degree tilted prism with a 10-degree tilted sensor. This setup not only shortens the camera’s length by about 22 per cent compared to older designs but is also capable of capturing sharp images. Thanks to the ALoP tech, the Galaxy S25 Slim could feature a much smaller camera bump while maintaining great zoom capabilities. The phone is rumoured to include a periscope telephoto lens with 3.5x optical zoom, a 200-megapixel ISOCELL HP5 main sensor, and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera. That’s impressive for a device that’s rumoured to come with a 6.66-inch display.  Interestingly, it looks like the Galaxy S25 Slim will have some features that even the standard Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+ won’t include, such as the advanced telephoto camera. However, all four models in the lineup are expected to debut at the same time, with rumours suggesting that the pre-orders will start on January 24, 2025, with the sales kicking off on February 4, 2025. We’ll have to wait for Samsung’s official reveal to know for sure what exactly the Galaxy S25 Slim is going to be, come January.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The controversy gained traction earlier this week following Indian-American venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan's appointment as Senior Policy Advisor for AI in Trump’s administration, sparking accusations from far-right figures that the move undermines the ""America First"" agenda. While some blame immigration policies for displacing American workers, entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has offered a different perspective: the issue lies not with immigration but with American culture itself.   Ramaswamy took to X (formerly Twitter) with a bold critique of what he sees as America’s systemic failure to foster excellence among its youth. In his post, he argued that top tech companies hire foreign-born and first-generation engineers not because Americans lack innate talent but because American culture prioritises mediocrity over excellence.

— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) December 26, 2024 “Normalcy doesn’t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent,” Ramaswamy tweeted. He pointed to the cultural glorification of prom queens and jocks over math prodigies and valedictorians as a fundamental flaw in American society.   In a long-form post, Ramaswamy has primarily highlighted the broader concern about the cultural upbringing of American children. He juxtaposed the values of immigrant families, who often emphasise academic rigor, discipline, and achievement, with what he described as the “normalcy” celebrated by mainstream American culture.   Citing examples from popular 90s TV shows like Boy Meets World and Saved by the Bell, Ramaswamy highlighted how American media has long idolised the charming but average protagonist while relegating the “nerdy” characters to comic relief. “A culture that venerates Cory from ‘Boy Meets World,’ or Zach & Slater over Screech in ‘Saved by the Bell,’ will not produce the best engineers,” he wrote.   Immigrant families, he noted, often avoided such cultural distractions. Many imposed strict limits on television and social outings, encouraging their children to focus on math competitions, science projects, and other intellectually enriching activities. The results, Ramaswamy argued, speak for themselves — these children often grew up to become leaders in STEM fields.  MAGA is furious Of course, Vivek Ramaswamy’s post offended a lot of Americans. Many took issue with Ramaswamy’s framing of the issue as cultural rather than systemic. Some have also condemned his remarks as dismissive of American workers and overly sympathetic to H-1B visa holders.  One recurring argument was the prevalence of fraud and manipulation within the H-1B visa system. Some commenters claimed that unqualified individuals (from India) with fake credentials often secure jobs in the US, posing significant risks to national security. “It’s an incentive in India to issue fake education documents to acquire US jobs,” one user wrote. 
 


 Some have pointed out that relying on foreign workers undermines the accomplishments of past American generations, such as those who propelled the US to the moon or built its aerospace industry, achievements made long before the influx of H-1B workers.  
 


 Others call out the economic realities behind hiring preferences, asserting that companies favour foreign workers not because of cultural excellence but due to cost advantages. Temporary visa holders, they argued, are often paid less and subjected to exploitative conditions, with their residency tied to employment. This creates a power imbalance, enabling corporations to suppress wages and control working conditions, which harms both American and foreign workers.   However, at large, Ramaswamy’s dichotomy between excellence and normalcy drew sharp criticism. “Framing success as requiring the abandonment of social experiences or leisure is damaging,” one commenter noted, emphasising that balance and well-being are crucial to sustainable achievement. They argue that immigrant families’ focus on academic rigour, while admirable, represents only one path to success and shouldn’t be seen as the gold standard for all.

— Alb (@amandalouise416) December 26, 2024 Perhaps the harshest criticism accused Ramaswamy of bias, with some alleging that his comments were designed to defend a system that disproportionately benefits individuals from his own ethnic background. “This is all I needed to read to understand Vivek is defending the system that promotes more of his people coming to America,” one critic remarked.   The backlash underscores the deep divisions surrounding the H1-B visa debate. While Ramaswamy intended to spark introspection about cultural values, many Americans interpreted his post as an attack on their way of life and a defence of exploitative labour practices. For a nation grappling with questions of identity, fairness, and global competitiveness, his remarks have struck a nerve that is unlikely to calm anytime soon.The H-1B debate Ramaswamy’s critique arrives amidst a heated debate over the H-1B visa program. MAGA supporters argue that the program allows companies to prioritise cheaper, foreign talent over domestic workers, undermining American job security. Conservative activist Laura Loomer has been particularly vocal, accusing Sriram Krishnan, senior policy advisor for Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the White House, of betraying Trump’s “America First” policy by advocating for reforms to green card backlogs that disproportionately benefit Indian workers.   On the other hand, advocates for high-skilled immigration, including Silicon Valley leaders, argue that attracting top global talent is essential for maintaining America’s competitive edge. Ramaswamy aligns with this view but takes it a step further by urging Americans to focus on cultivating their own homegrown talent.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Sriram in White House, Trump supporters demand ban on H1-B Visa and fewer Indians in Silicon ValleyAlso read |  What is the Qualcomm vs Arm battle that could have huge implications on future laptops, phonesAlso read |  Ahead of Donald Trump taking charge, tech CEOs from Cook to Zuckerberg lineup at his residence for dinner

Performance-wise, the iPhone 16 Pro surpasses even flagship Android phones powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. If you’re into gaming, this phone handles high-demand titles like Genshin Impact at 60fps on high settings smoothly —something most Androids still struggle with. The iPhone 16 Pro is powered by Apple’s A18 Pro chipset, built on second-gen 3nm fabrication process. Apple claims the A18 Pro’s 6-core GPU is 20 per cent faster than the A17 Pro. It also includes next-gen machine learning capabilities, faster USB 3 speeds, and ProRes video recording. Battery life has seen a slight improvement, with the phone comfortably lasting a full day with average use. When it comes to videography and photography, iPhones are known for their quality, and the 16 Pro doesn’t disappoint. The standard iPhone 16 offers average photography, but if you're after top-notch camera performance, the 16 Pro is a better option. It boasts a triple rear camera setup, including a new 48MP main camera with a second-gen quad-pixel sensor, which eliminates shutter lag in 48MP ProRAW and HEIF photos. The cameras support 4K120 video capture, delivering crisp clarity, natural colours, and excellent audio. The ultra-wide camera has been upgraded to 48MP with autofocus, and the third sensor is a 12MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom and a 120mm focal length. It’s worth noting that the iPhone 15 Pro doesn’t offer 5x optical zoom, but the 16 Pro does. Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro brings meaningful upgrades across performance, display, and camera capabilities, making it a solid choice for those who want the best from Apple.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

The 128GB base version of the iPhone 15, originally priced at Rs 69,900, is now available for Rs 59,999 on Flipkart. That's a flat Rs 9,901 discount, making it one of the most attractive prices for Apple’s last-generation standard flagship model. But wait, there’s more. If you’re a fan of the green colour variant, Flipkart is offering it at an even lower price of Rs 58,999. That’s an extra Rs 1,000 off for those who don’t mind picking a specific colour. Also, if you're planning to exchange your old phone, you could save even more. Flipkart’s exchange program offers up to Rs 56,500 off depending on the device you trade in. Here are some examples to give you an idea of the savings you could enjoy:
— If you exchange an old iPhone 12, you can get up to Rs 22,700 off.
— If you trade in an old Samsung Galaxy S22, you can get up to Rs 20,300 off.
This means that with the right exchange, you could bring down the effective price of the iPhone 15 to almost half its original cost. That’s a huge steal for anyone looking to upgrade to a new iPhone.iPhone 15: Should you buy it? Now that you know about the deal, the big question is: should you buy the iPhone 15 right now? Well, the iPhone 15 is equipped with Apple’s A16 Bionic chip, which offers top-notch performance. Whether you’re gaming, editing reels, or just browsing, this phone delivers a smooth experience. It also comes with a bright and vibrant OLED display that’s great for watching content. Apart from this, the iPhone 15 features a 48-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, which captures stunning photos and videos, even in low light. If you’re someone who loves photography, this phone will not disappoint at this price. The iPhone 15 was also the first iPhone when Apple adopted the USB-C port for charging, which is more universal and convenient. This might not sound like a big deal, but for people tired of carrying multiple cables, this was a game-changer. Moreover, the iPhone 15 has a premium build with Ceramic Shield glass, making it more resistant to drops and scratches. Plus, it’s lightweight and comes in a range of colours to suit your style. However, here’s the main reason why this deal makes so much sense. The iPhone 16, which offers more or less the same user experience, minus Apple Intelligence, retails for Rs 79,900. If you don’t really need Apple Intelligence, you are better off with the iPhone 15. Unless you’re someone who always wants the absolute latest tech, the iPhone 15 at this discounted price offers great value for money.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The new regulation, designed to reduce e-waste and simplify charging for consumers, requires phones, tablets, cameras, and other electronic devices sold in the EU to feature USB-C ports.   The move spells the end of proprietary charging standards in the region, forcing even giants like Apple to adapt. While most Android smartphones have embraced USB-C in recent years, Apple’s transition has been more gradual. The tech giant introduced USB-C ports with the iPhone 15 series in 2023, but older models, such as the iPhone 14 and the iPhone SE (3rd generation), retained the now-outdated Lightning connector.  advertisementApple discontinues iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in the EUTo comply with the EU’s new rules, Apple has discontinued the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in the region, as these models feature the lightning port. While they remain available through third-party sellers until stocks last, the regulation prohibits brands from selling non-USB-C products directly. Outside the EU, including major markets like the United States, India, and China, these models continue to be available for purchase.   To comply with the EU’s new rules, Apple has discontinued the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in the region, as these models feature the lightning port. While they remain available through third-party sellers until stocks last, the regulation prohibits brands from selling non-USB-C products directly. Outside the EU, including major markets like the United States, India, and China, these models continue to be available for purchase.   Apple’s decision aligns with its broader strategy to phase out the lightning port in favour of USB-C, a transition expected to culminate in the launch of a USB-C-equipped iPhone SE in early 2025. This move not only adheres to regulatory demands but also addresses consumer expectations for streamlined charging solutions.  One charger to rule them all The European Commission (EC) celebrated the enforcement of this regulation with a playful yet impactful tweet, highlighting the benefits of having a common charging standard for all devices. “Today’s the day! USB-C is officially the common standard for electronic devices in the EU! It means: The same charger for all new phones, tablets & cameras; Harmonised fast-charging; Reduced e-waste; No more ‘Sorry, I don’t have that cable,” EC’s post on X reads.   
 


The law aims to alleviate the frustration of juggling multiple chargers while addressing the growing environmental concerns posed by e-waste. By standardising charging technology, the EU expects to simplify consumer choices and extend the lifecycle of accessories like cables and adapters.  A global shift in the making?

By standardising charging technology, the EU expects to simplify consumer choices and extend the lifecycle of accessories like cables and adapters.  A global shift in the making? Although the regulation currently applies only within the EU, its impact resonates globally. With USB-C becoming the universal standard in Europe, manufacturers may increasingly adopt the technology across all regions to streamline production and meet consumer demand.   For Apple, the EU’s push accelerates its broader shift toward USB-C, ensuring compliance and future-proofing its product lineup. As other countries watch the EU’s progress, the USB-C revolution might just become the global standard for electronics, leaving tangled cables and mismatched chargers in the dustbin of history.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Sriram in White House, Trump supporters demand ban on H1-B Visa and fewer Indians in Silicon ValleyAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim vs Apple iPhone 17 Air: All we know about the 2 most exciting phones of 2025Also read |  What is the Qualcomm vs Arm battle that could have huge implications on future laptops, phones

Of course, it’s not the iPhone 17. For that, we’ll have to wait another nine months until September 2025. Instead, Apple’s next big release will be the iPhone SE 4, and it’s expected to launch as early as next spring, just three months from now. This will be a big moment for the iPhone SE series. The upcoming model will be the first update in three years and promises the biggest changes the lineup has seen since its debut. Here’s everything we know so far about the iPhone SE 4 and the top five upgrades it will likely bring.advertisementA newer design and a bigger, better displayFor about three years, the iPhone SE has stuck to the older iPhone 8 design, i.e., a 4.7-inch LCD screen, rounded edges, and a home button. But that’s about to change. The iPhone SE 4 is expected to adopt the look of the iPhone 14. This means a larger 6.1-inch OLED display with flat edges and a smaller notch. It’ll also drop the home button in favour of Face ID, giving the SE a more modern feel. While it won’t have the dual cameras of the iPhone 14, it will still feature a single rear camera. According to display expert Ross Young, Apple will use the same OLED screen as the iPhone 14, supplied by BOE and LG Display.Apple Intelligence featuresOne of the more surprising upgrades could be the inclusion of Apple Intelligence. This also suggests that the iPhone SE 4 will be powered by the A18 chipset paired with at least 8GB RAM, which is also the same configuration used in the iPhone 16.  With the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, advanced features like Writing Tools, Genmoji, Photos Clean Up, and the all-new Siri, will come for the first time to the iPhone SE lineup.Switching to USB-C For about three years, the iPhone SE has stuck to the older iPhone 8 design, i.e., a 4.7-inch LCD screen, rounded edges, and a home button.

With the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, advanced features like Writing Tools, Genmoji, Photos Clean Up, and the all-new Siri, will come for the first time to the iPhone SE lineup.Switching to USB-C One of the more practical changes coming to the iPhone SE 4 is the move to USB-C. Apple has already made the switch to USB-C with the iPhone 15 lineup in 2023, and now it’s the SE’s turn. This change is largely driven by European Union regulations, which require all devices with charging ports to use a unified connector. For SE users, this means you’ll finally be able to charge your iPhone with the same cable you use for your iPad or MacBook.Big camera upgrades The camera system on the iPhone SE 4 is expected to get a major boost. Reports suggest it will feature the same 48-megapixel rear camera found on the iPhone 15, which is a big leap from the current model’s 12-megapixel sensor. The front-facing camera is also set for an upgrade, jumping to a 12-megapixel sensor, up from the 7-megapixel camera on the iPhone SE 3. These improvements should make a noticeable difference for both casual photos and selfies.Apple’s first in-house modem Finally, the iPhone SE 4 is also expected to be the first to include Apple’s in-house modem, which has been in development for years. Codenamed Centauri, this modem will handle 5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. This is a big move for Apple, as it allows them to reduce reliance on Qualcomm’s expensive modems. Not only does this help lower production costs, but it also gives Apple more control over its hardware.Price and availability Rumours suggest the iPhone SE 4 might cost a bit more than its predecessor, possibly starting at $499 (around Rs 47,000). While this is a price increase, it’s still a great deal for what’s essentially a modernised version of the iPhone 14. For reference, Apple currently sells the iPhone 14 for Rs 59,900 in India, though during sales and offers, you can find it for around Rs 45,000 to Rs 50,000. If the SE 4 is priced at $499 and considering Apple’s usual pricing approach of $1 equalling Rs 100, the iPhone SE 4 could start at Rs 49,900 in India. This would make it a great choice for those looking for an updated iPhone at a more affordable price. Apple is also expected to discontinue the iPhone 14 once the SE 4 is launched, giving budget-conscious buyers another reason to pick the SE.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

The Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to arrive months later than the rest. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-expected-to-arrive-later-than-the-rest-of-the-series-2657077-2024-12-30,"As Samsung gears up to release its flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S25, rumour has it that the series will bring a new entry -- the Galaxy S25 Slim. As the name suggests, the company is speculated to be focusing on the sleek and slim design language. Based on the current leaks, this variant will be competing with the iPhone 17 Air. However, the Samsung's Slim will take its sweet time to enter the market.  The Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim will not be launched on the same day as the others. The expected launch date of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is January 22 and a new report supports this claim, based on Samsung's latest One UI 7 beta. The beta includes a list of US carrier-specific Samsung phone models, but the Galaxy S25 Slim's model number is notably absent. This suggests that the Slim won’t be part of the initial wave of devices launching with One UI 7 based on Android 15. Earlier rumours indicated that the S25 Slim would debut in the second quarter of next year (between April and June), which aligns with the findings in One UI 7.Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim: Leaks and rumours  While Samsung has traditionally leaned into larger, high-performance models, the Slim variant is anticipated to appeal to users who prefer a more manageable form factor without compromising on high-end specs. The device could sport a thinner profile, possibly under 7mm, making it one of the most pocket-friendly premium smartphones on the market. One of the standout features of the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to be its impressive 4,700 to 5,000mAh battery, a remarkable achievement for a phone with its slim profile. Reports suggest that Samsung may be utilising advanced silicon-carbon anode battery technology, similar to the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro, allowing for extended battery life without sacrificing the device's sleek design. In terms of performance, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, ensuring top-tier processing power. The device is also likely to feature a 6.66-inch display, positioning it similarly to the Galaxy S24+ in terms of screen size. On the camera front, the S25 Slim may come equipped with a 200-megapixel HP5 primary sensor, paired with a 50-megapixel ultrawide lens and a 50-megapixel 3.5x telephoto camera, promising impressive photographic capabilities. According to reports, the Galaxy S25 Slim could feature Samsung's new ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) technology for its telephoto camera. Recently introduced by Samsung Semiconductor, this innovation is designed to allow smartphones to maintain a slim form factor without compromising on image quality. A recent tip suggests that ALoP could be the key to achieving the Galaxy S25 Slim's sleek design while still delivering powerful camera performance.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

Finally, it seems like the wait might be coming to an end. Reports suggest that Apple is working on two foldable devices — a clamshell-style iPhone and a large 20-inch foldable iPad. Of the two, the foldable iPhone is likely to hit the market first, and it’s already generating plenty of buzz and curiosity. Apple’s first foldable iPhone is expected to have a clamshell design, much like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola’s Razr. It will feature a standard-sized smartphone screen that folds inward, making it compact and easy to carry around. But there’s more to it. According to recent leaks, this foldable iPhone will actually offer a screen larger than the current iPhone 16 Pro Max. This could mean a display size of at least 7 inches, giving users plenty of room to enjoy their apps, games, and videos without sacrificing portability. The Wall Street Journal recently shared some insights into Apple’s plans. The company is also developing a larger foldable device, a 20-inch foldable iPad. This product is being designed to double as a laptop, with a screen size that rivals some desktop monitors. While the foldable iPad is an exciting concept, the smaller foldable iPhone is expected to be Apple’s first release in this category, and the company seems to be putting a lot of effort into getting it right. Developing foldable technology hasn’t been easy for Apple. Challenges like reducing the visibility of creases on the screen, designing durable hinges, and finding the right materials for the display have all slowed progress. However, Apple’s commitment to quality means the company is determined to tackle these issues before releasing its product. They’re not rushing it, and that’s likely a good thing for consumers who expect nothing but the best from the brand. Interestingly, Apple’s move into the foldable market could shake things up. While foldable phones have been growing in popularity, the market is showing signs of slowing down. According to Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), the foldable smartphone market grew by an impressive 40 per cent annually from 2019 to 2023. However, growth is expected to drop to just 5 per cent in 2024, with a decline of 4 per cent projected for 2025. Demand has levelled off at around 22 million units per year. That’s where Apple could make a difference. Many people love the idea of foldable phones like the Galaxy Z Flip but hesitate to switch from their trusted iPhones. Experts believe Apple’s brand power and loyalty along with its reputation for innovation might be just what the foldable segment needs to get back on track. As for when we’ll see this new iPhone, sources suggest a release in the second half of 2026. It’s likely to launch alongside the iPhone 18 lineup, provided there are no further delays. Reports also mention that Apple has given the project a codename, V68, which indicates that development has progressed beyond the early stages.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

A floating “Play something” button has been spotted in the YouTube app for Android, as reported by 9to5Google. This button sits just above the bottom navigation bar in the app and works as a random video picker. When you tap it, YouTube selects a video for you to watch. This isn’t the first time YouTube has experimented with this idea. Over the past year, the platform has tested different versions of the Play something feature. Previous versions included a banner with the same name and a simpler black-and-white button resembling the YouTube logo. Now, YouTube seems to be focusing on a more prominent floating button. Interestingly, the Play something button in its current form uses the YouTube Shorts player to show videos. This is the same player designed for portrait-oriented Shorts videos. However, it doesn’t just stick to Shorts, it also plays standard YouTube videos. The only catch is that all videos — whether Shorts or standard, are displayed in the vertical Shorts player format. Some users may find this odd, especially for regular videos that aren’t meant to be viewed vertically. Hopefully, YouTube will address this before rolling the feature out in a wider release. If the name Play something sounds familiar, it might remind you of Netflix’s Surprise Me feature. Netflix originally launched it as a similar feature to YouTube’s Play something in 2021, but the streaming service retired the feature last year. Both features serve a similar purpose — helping users quickly find something to watch without scrolling endlessly through options. YouTube’s Play something button could be especially helpful for people who want to discover new content or just can’t decide what to watch. It’s similar to flipping through TV channels back in the day, letting you stumble upon something interesting by chance. For creators, it could also mean more visibility for their videos, as the feature randomly showcases content from YouTube’s vast library.  While the idea is promising, some things still need tweaking. For instance, the Shorts player’s vertical format may not be the best fit for standard YouTube videos. A mix of formats that adapt to the type of content being played would likely make the feature more appealing. YouTube hasn’t announced when or if this feature will become widely available. For now, it’s just another experiment in the app’s ongoing evolution.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Previous leaks suggest that this series will debut with a new design pattern. However, a new rumour sheds light that the Pro model might follow the OG design pattern. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-17-pro-design-rumours-divided-over-design-will-it-follow-a-new-pattern-2657147-2024-12-30,"A recent leak indicates that there are still chances that the iPhone 17 Pro might not undergo a design change like the standard iPhone 17 variant. Based on previous leaks, the iPhone 17 series has been speculated to follow a new design language. It is thought that the upcoming Apple flagship model (which might debut in September 2025) will do away with the traditional rear panel and will bring a Google Pixel-like rectangular camera bump. While it could be true for the iPhone 17 variant, the Pro models might not be tweaked that much.  The iPhone 17 model is anticipated to debut with a vertical camera setup, but the iPhone 17 Pro might stick to its triangular one. Take a look at the rendered images of the iPhone 17 Pro. 
 


 But even with the new leak, the rear panel is anticipated to be revamped, staying true to the previous rumours. The iPhone 17 series is also expected to take a design shift from titanium to aluminium and might debut with a dual-tone rear panel. The move to aluminium could result in a lighter device, potentially enhancing user comfort during prolonged use. Additionally, aluminium is generally more cost-effective than titanium, which might influence the device's pricing strategy. iPhone 17 Pro: Leaked specs The upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are set to include Apple’s next-generation A19 Pro chip, built using TSMC’s cutting-edge third-generation 3nm technology. This upgrade is anticipated to bring improved power efficiency and incremental performance boosts over current iPhone models. Furthermore, one version of the iPhone 17 is rumoured to debut an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, replacing the Broadcom components used in previous iterations.   Both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are expected to feature 12GB of RAM, a specification previously thought to be exclusive to the Pro Max. This memory upgrade, compared to the 8GB found in all four iPhone 16 models, promises enhanced multitasking capabilities and improved support for Apple’s advanced AI features. The added RAM is likely to deliver smoother performance across the board, making it a standout improvement for the Pro lineup.   Camera upgrades also take center stage in the iPhone 17 series. All models are rumoured to feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, a significant jump from the 12-megapixel resolution on the iPhone 16 lineup. For the Pro models, the Telephoto camera is expected to receive a substantial boost to 48 megapixels, a marked improvement over the 12-megapixel Telephoto lens on the iPhone 16 Pro. These enhancements aim to elevate both front and rear photography, offering sharper images and greater versatility.   Another notable design change is a smaller Dynamic Island, achieved by integrating a metalens into the Face ID system. This innovation would increase the screen-to-body ratio, providing a more immersive display experience. Altogether, the iPhone 17 Pro lineup is shaping up to deliver substantial upgrades in performance, memory, camera capabilities, and design, setting a new benchmark for Apple’s flagship devices.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Apple discontinues iPhone SE and iPhone 14 as EU officially adopts USB-C as universal charging standardAlso read |  iPhone SE 4 said to launch soon, likely to get 5 big upgradesAlso read |  iPhone 18 Fold leaks: When is Apple's first foldable phone coming?

However, a new feature in iOS 18 has raised concerns about how the tech giant handles user information, especially when it comes to photos. A fresh report by developer Jeff Johnson has revealed that iPhones and Macs running iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia are sharing photo data with Apple by default, potentially without users' explicit consent. India Today Tech also verified this and found it to be correct. The feature in question is ""Enhanced Visual Search,"" which Apple has automatically enabled in the latest software updates. This functionality allows users to get more detailed information about landmarks in their photos, but it also means that certain data from those images is shared with Apple for processing. What is Enhanced Visual Search? The feature uses machine learning to analyse images and detect landmarks. For example, if you take a picture of a famous monument or building, the system scans the photo to identify regions that may contain some landmarks. Once a potential landmark is detected, the device creates a vector embedding, a digital representation of the image's characteristics. This embedding is then encrypted and sent to Apple's servers, where it is compared with a global database to identify the landmark, according to the developer. So, what is the need for this feature? It is basically designed to improve the Photos app experience, allowing users to look up information about landmarks they've captured easily. Users can see its name and other related details by swiping up a photo of a recognisable building. The idea is to provide more context about the places in your photos, making them searchable within the app.
 


How serious is this matter? Despite Apple’s efforts to anonymise data through on-device processing and encrypted vector embeddings, the automatic sharing of photo data with Apple raises privacy concerns. Although the data sent to Apple is claimed to be anonymised, the fact that this feature is enabled by default means users may unknowingly share information. While this may not be a serious concern for everyone, there might be users out there who might not be comfortable with this feature. The vector embeddings — condensed digital representations of images — are sent to Apple’s servers for comparison with its database. In a machine learning research blogpost, Apple suggests that the data is not personally identifiable, but this still involves transmitting image data to the company. This raises questions of whether Apple’s privacy practices align with users' expectations of control over personal information. Apple’s technical explanations may be difficult for the average user to understand, and the fact that users must opt-out rather than opt-in highlights a lack of transparency in the company's approach to privacy.How to disable this feature on iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia For those concerned about their photo data being shared with Apple, disabling this feature is possible. If your iPhone is running iOS 18 version, you can go to Settings, Scroll down and tap on Apps. Now, select Photos, Scroll to the bottom and turn off Enhanced Visual Search. If your Mac is running on the macOS Sequoia version, then you need to visit the Photos app, and Settings and disable the ""Enhanced Visual Search"" feature.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 30, 2024

And with so many people using the app, every now and then, people face issues with it. However, in places like India particularly, we are used to picking up calls on customer care in case of an issue with a device, gadget or any appliance we own. If your Blinkit order doesn’t get delivered in 8 minutes, we like to pick the phone and enquire about every detail. But what happens if you face a problem with WhatsApp? The only choice you have is to Google and see if someone else on the internet found a solution to your problem. It’s not the best way out, and not the most convenient either. But things may change soon.  A WABetaInfo report claims that WhatsApp is working on a new feature which will bring access to human support on the web app. The blog claims that WhatsApp is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to shorten response times and deliver a more tailored and efficient customer support experience. The platform is basically experimenting with ways to provide users with direct access to the support team, making it easier and more seamless to address their concerns. Currently, the mobile app offers no way to contact customer care. There is only a Help Centre with some frequently asked questions (FAQs) in case they address your issue. On the web app, however, there is still no way to interact with a human agent to get an issue resolved, but there is the Contact Us option, which lets you send WhatsApp your issues. You can choose to send it via an in-app chat box or via email, accordingly someone from WhatsApp will reach out to you either through a WhatsApp chat, or via email. Many times, this chat is actually with an AI agent.  However, with the new WhatsApp feature coming in, contacting with a human agent will be an additional layer added to the WhatsApp support.

ec98b33d-dd5d-4ea7-8904-6fd398c29420,"Vivek Ramaswamy is an American-Indian that Trump supporters love to hate Vivek Ramaswamy, once a MAGA favourite, now faces backlash after a tweet on American parenting ignites fierce debates on culture, immigration, and American values.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/talking-points/story/maga-darling-a-month-ago-vivek-ramaswamy-now-an-american-indian-trump-supporters-love-to-hate-2657276-2024-12-30,"In the volatile world of American politics, the tides of admiration can shift dramatically. Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and 2024 presidential candidate, has seen this firsthand. Just a month ago, he was a rising star within MAGA circles, celebrated for his alignments with conservative values, his critique of the “woke” culture, his advocacy for national sovereignty, among other things. But today, he finds himself at the centre of a growing backlash, accused by some of being unpatriotic, divisive, and even complicit in undermining American workers. The tipping point? A single tweet that sparked a firestorm of debates about parenting, culture, and immigration.A month ago Ramaswamy’s ascent in the MAGA universe was swift and, at first glance, unstoppable. As a self-made entrepreneur with a knack for headline-grabbing rhetoric, he seemed to embody the American Dream that Trump supporters revere. His critiques of “woke” culture and Big Tech resonated with a base hungry for intellectual firepower to back their grievances.  Then came his now-infamous tweet, a cultural critique that questioned how Americans raise their children. In the tweet, Ramaswamy argued that top tech companies hire foreign-born engineers not due to any inherent IQ deficit among Americans, but because of a cultural gap that prioritises mediocrity over excellence. He blamed American parenting practices and pop culture for fostering complacency, contrasting this with the disciplined upbringing of immigrant families. 
The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over “native” Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers & if...

A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers & if...
— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) December 26, 2024 What followed was an explosion of anger from MAGA supporters, many of whom accused him of being ungrateful and elitist. Some even took his remarks as an attack on American identity itself –– a cardinal sin in a movement centred on nationalism.From favourite to foe  The fallout was swift. Immediately after his tweet, prominent MAGA influencers took to X (formerly Twitter) to denounce Ramaswamy. The comments ranged from critiques of his “anti-American” tone to outright xenophobia, with some questioning his loyalty as an Indian-American. The debate spiralled into a larger cultural clash, with hashtags like #AmericansFirst and #NoH1Bs trending as users debated immigration, the H1-B visa program, and the role of Indian professionals in the US economy. 
 



 


 Ramaswamy’s critics framed his tweet as proof that he aligns more with immigrant interests than with the American working class. Others latched onto his background –– a child of Indian immigrants –– to argue that he was out of touch with the average American’s struggle. Ironically, this rhetoric came from the same crowd that had championed him as a symbol of the American Dream just weeks earlier. Indians vs Americans: The latest debate The controversy has reignited long-simmering tensions between Indian immigrants and native-born Americans, particularly in the Silicon Valley. Critics argue that the influx of highly skilled Indian professionals through visa programmes like H-1B has displaced American workers and driven down wages. Supporters counter that these professionals fill crucial gaps in a hyper-competitive global market, bringing expertise that keeps US innovation alive.  On X, the debate has taken on a life of its own. Indian-Americans have rallied to Ramaswamy’s defence, emphasising the sacrifices and discipline that immigrant families embody. They have highlighted the success stories of Indian-origin engineers, doctors, and entrepreneurs who have contributed to America’s global leadership. Meanwhile, the MAGA crowd has doubled down on their critique, accusing Indian immigrants of exploiting American opportunities while undermining their culture.The broader implications Ramaswamy's experience underscores how quickly admiration can turn to animosity when a politician’s message deviates from the script.  His predicament also reveals the precarious balancing act of being an immigrant –– or the child of immigrants –– in American politics. While his rise was fuelled by his ability to speak to American values, his cultural critiques have exploded a fault line within the MAGA movement. Moving forward For Ramaswamy, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. He must reconcile his vision of American exceptionalism with a base that feels increasingly alienated by his cultural critiques. His supporters argue that his message –– though controversial –– is necessary for sparking a much-needed national conversation about meritocracy, parenting, and education. But whether that message resonates or further alienates MAGA supporters remains to be seen. In the end, Ramasway’s journey from being a MAGA darling to a divisive figure serves as a cautionary tale. It highlights the complexities of navigating identity, nationalism, and ideology in today’s polarised America. For a movement that prides itself on loyalty, the question now is whether MAGA can forgive one of its own for speaking a truth it may not want to hear.

The tech billionaire and CEO of SpaceX believes that direct democracy, where decisions are made by the people themselves rather than through elected representatives, would be the ideal system for governing the Red Planet. Musk’s thoughts came in response to a user query on X, the social media platform he owns, regarding whether Martian governance would mirror the systems found on Earth. Musk’s response was clear and forward-looking. He stated that it would be up to the Martians themselves to decide how they are ruled but suggested that direct democracy could be the best approach. ""The Martians will decide how they are ruled. I recommend direct democracy,"" Musk wrote, hinting that he imagines a more participatory form of government than is typically seen on Earth. This means that Musk wants people to have more power, bypassing the often complicated and slow processes of representative governments. Beyond governance, Musk also provided updates on SpaceX’s progress toward making Mars exploration a reality. According to Musk, uncrewed Starships could begin landing on Mars within the next two years, potentially as early as 2026. He added that fully crewed missions to Mars might follow within four years, a timeline that could see the first humans stepping foot on Mars by 2028. These timelines are dependent on several factors, including the continued development of SpaceX’s Starship, which is designed to carry both cargo and crew on long-distance space missions. Musk also discussed the enormous financial and technological challenges associated with establishing a human colony on Mars. He estimated that building a self-sustaining city on the planet would cost over $1,000 trillion — a staggering amount that far exceeds the current GDP of the United States, which stands at around $29 trillion. This immense cost stems from the need to transport at least a million tons of equipment and materials to Mars to support human life. Musk has previously mentioned that current Mars missions cost roughly $1 billion per ton of payload delivered to the planet, and he stressed the need for a 1000-fold improvement in rocket and spacecraft technology to make these missions economically viable. One of the major hurdles SpaceX faces is reducing the cost of sending cargo and people to Mars. Currently, the high cost of space missions makes it prohibitively expensive to think about building a colony, but Musk remains optimistic that advances in reusable rockets and other technologies will help bring these costs down. If SpaceX succeeds in its plans, the future could see humans not only living on Mars but also deciding their system of government in a way that has never been done before. But, there is still a lot of time for this to become a reality.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 30, 2024

It’s the most used messaging app in the world with about 2 billion monthly active users. It's where people like you and me connect with family, friends, and even colleagues. But with WhatsApp constantly evolving and adding new features, some older devices will no longer support the app. Starting January 1, 2025, over 20 Android smartphones will lose access to WhatsApp. This change is linked to the fact that these devices are running outdated versions of Android, particularly Android 4.4 aka KitKat or earlier software versions. According to a recent report from HDblog, Meta, the company behind WhatsApp, is phasing out support for these older devices as part of its ongoing updates to ensure better security and functionality. It’s worth noting that all the affected phones are nearly a decade old or more, meaning they are no longer compatible with the latest software and features. While this decision makes sense from a technical standpoint, it can feel a bit unsettling for those who still rely on these older phones.  Brands like HTC and LG, which stopped making smartphones years ago, are among the ones affected. If you’re still using one of these phones, now might be the time to consider upgrading. Here’s the full list of Android smartphones losing WhatsApp support in 2025:Samsung
Galaxy S3
Galaxy Note 2
Galaxy Ace 3
Galaxy S4 Mini
Motorola
Moto G (1st Gen)
Motorola Razr HD
Moto E 2014
HTC
One X
One X+
Desire 500
Desire 601
LG
Optimus G
Nexus 4
G2 Mini
L90
Sony
Xperia Z
Xperia SP
Xperia T
Xperia V
 If you think your phone might be on the list, don’t panic just yet. WhatsApp recommends backing up your chats to a Google account before the support ends. This way, all your important conversations can be easily restored on a new phone. To do this, open WhatsApp > go to Settings > tap Chats > select Chat Backup. Follow the instructions to save your chats safely. This step will make transitioning to a new phone much smoother. If your phone is relatively new, you don’t need to worry. WhatsApp will continue to run as usual. But for those holding onto these older devices, it might be time to say goodbye and move on to something newer. The good news? There are plenty of affordable, feature-packed smartphones available today.

To recap, the iPhone SE 4 has previously been rumoured to be the most affordable phone to offer Apple Intelligence features. It was also tipped that the company may be dropping the SE branding altogether, and instead, it will add the SE 4 to the iPhone 16 line-up. The rumour has it that the phone is expected to carry several iPhone 16 features, including camera and display specs. If this holds to be true, the iPhone 16e makes a lot of sense. Now, the recent price leak also adds up to it. advertisementiPhone SE 4: Leaked Price According to a report from Korean outlet Naver, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to be priced at $500 (approximately Rs 42,700) or lower. This information reportedly comes from an unnamed Japanese carrier. Notably, this aligns with previous rumours about the iPhone SE 4’s $499 price point.  
 


For context, the iPhone SE 3 was launched in India in 2022 at a starting price of Rs 43,900, and it was priced at $429 (approx Rs 36,700) in the US. And with the upcoming iPhone SE 4, we must expect this price gap as well. If the iPhone SE 4 or 16e is to follow the traditions, the price in India could go up to Rs 49,900.

Previously, the rumour has it that the iPhone SE 4 is up for a potential price reduction, which may be attributed to Apple’s decision to utilise its own in-house 5G modem in the SE 4. By transitioning away from Qualcomm’s modems—like the Snapdragon X70/75 modems used in the iPhone 16 series—Apple avoids paying licencing fees, thereby reducing production costs.   However, while this cost-saving measure could lower the overall manufacturing expense, it doesn’t necessarily mean Apple will pass the savings directly to consumers. Pricing strategies often consider factors beyond production costs, such as market positioning, profit margins, and competitive dynamics.   If the $500 pricing rumour holds true, the iPhone SE 4 could become an even more attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. However, it is important to note that the exact prices and specs will only be disclosed during the launch of the phone. Till then, we advise you to take it with a pinch of salt.  iPhone SE 4: Specs and features (rumoured) The iPhone SE 4, also referred to as the iPhone 16e, is shaping up to be a major upgrade over its predecessors. Departing from the iPhone 8-inspired design, it is expected to adopt a look similar to the iPhone XR or iPhone 12, featuring a more modern and immersive user experience. A 6.06-inch OLED display will replace the previous 4.7-inch LCD, delivering significantly improved viewing quality comparable to Apple’s premium models.   Another notable change is the shift from the Touch ID home button to Face ID, which will slim down the bezels and align the device with Apple’s latest design trends. The 16e is rumoured to share the same screen size and full-screen design as the standard iPhone 16, providing a cohesive design language across Apple’s lineup.   Under the hood, the iPhone 16e will reportedly be powered by the A18 chipset and upgraded to 8GB of RAM from 4GB, resulting in a substantial performance boost. This improvement will enhance multitasking and support demanding apps, including Apple’s latest AI and machine learning features. Coupled with 128GB of storage, the 16e promises a better overall user experience while maintaining affordability.   The camera system is another area of improvement. The 16e is rumoured to feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, similar to the iPhone 16, marking a significant leap for Apple’s budget-friendly lineup. The advanced ""Fusion"" lens enables high-quality standard and 2x zoom photos without compromising detail, providing sharper and more versatile photography for users upgrading from older SE models.   Positioned as an affordable yet powerful alternative, the iPhone SE 4/16e aims to deliver premium features in a compact, budget-friendly package, bridging the gap between entry-level and flagship Apple devices.

IT department now has your entire details, says reportThe IT department's alleged use of DigiYatra data has raised privacy concerns, but the app's CEO denies storing personal user information. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/used-digiyatra-it-department-now-has-your-entire-details-and-will-check-it-for-tax-evasion-says-report-2657356-2024-12-30,"In an eyebrow-raising report, The New Indian Express recently claimed that India’s Income Tax Department is leveraging passenger data collected via the DigiYatra app to identify potential tax evaders. The report has sparked concerns about privacy, surveillance, and the scope of government data usage, with the claim being contested by DigiYatra's CEO, Suresh Khadakbhavi. DigiYatra, a civil aviation ministry-led initiative, was launched to simplify and streamline air travel by making it seamless and paperless. The process uses facial recognition technology. The app captures passengers' biometric data, travel details, and ID documents to facilitate a smoother airport experience. However, the recent report suggests that the IT Department has begun cross-referencing DigiYatra’s passenger data with income tax filings to flag discrepancies — specifically targeting high-spending frequent flyers whose declared income does not justify their expenditures.
 


advertisementWhat does DigiYatra's CEO have to say?Khadakbhavi’s strongly-worded response dismisses the allegations as baseless. He has clarified that DigiYatra does not store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in a central repository. Instead, the data is stored locally on passengers' devices, aligning with the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework. This approach ensures data security, privacy, and scalability — making it impossible for the government or any other entity to access this information directly. Khadakbhavi’s strongly-worded response dismisses the allegations as baseless. He has clarified that DigiYatra does not store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in a central repository. Instead, the data is stored locally on passengers' devices, aligning with the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework. This approach ensures data security, privacy, and scalability — making it impossible for the government or any other entity to access this information directly. “Such baseless articles overshadow the achievements of DigiYatra,” Khadakbhavi said, highlighting the app’s milestone of crossing 9 million active users in 2024. According to the DigiYatra CEO, the app's privacy-first design safeguards passengers from any potential misuse of their data.But is there a loophole here?! While the privacy claims are reassuring, the mechanism by which DigiYatra verifies passenger identities at airports raises some questions. If no central repository exists, how does the system ensure seamless data retrieval for identity confirmation during check-in? The process involves users uploading Aadhaar details or passport information, a selfie, and their boarding pass to the app, which then generates a unique QR code for airport use. Critics argue that some form of data cross-verification must occur behind the scenes, leaving room for potential privacy vulnerabilities.“Stupidification of governance?” The controversy has also reignited broader debates about data usage and governance in India. A widely shared tweet criticised DigiYatra, equating it with past measures like demonetisation, claiming that such initiatives focus on catching small-scale violators while ignoring systemic issues like large-scale loan fraud and government-enabled corruption. According to the tweet, the government remains “stupid” to the real sources of black money generation, which often stem from big-ticket loans for government contracts.
 


 The allegations, if true, mark a significant shift in how travel data could be weaponised for tax enforcement. The IT Department reportedly plans to scrutinise frequent international travellers, particularly those whose spending habits don’t align with their reported income. While this aligns with the government's broader push for accountability and transparency, it also raises ethical questions about the scope of surveillance.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

And if not heard: The OnePlus 13 series — the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R — is set to arrive in India on January 7. Given that these are the phones from OnePlus, a brand with a tremendous fan-following in India, there is a lot of buzz around the next OnePlus flagships. Already a lot is known about the phone. For example, we know — and this is big — that the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R are going to come with lifetime display warranty.  At the same time, with an emphasis on AI in OxygenOS 15, durable display technology, and optimised software, this latest flagship lineup is expected to cater to both enthusiasts and average consumers alike. Now, we will know more about the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R once they arrive. The full details, and in what respect they are different from their China variants, will be revealed on January 7. And, of course, we will get to know about their price on the same day. But even before the launch, there is a lot we know about the two phones. So, let's take a closer look. OxygenOS 15 with AI smarts  One of the key highlights of the OnePlus 13 series — and the one that makes it different from other phones in the market — is OxygenOS 15, which is based on Android 15. There's a big focus on AI in the company's latest software approach, with several features designed to improve user productivity and experience. The key to AI smarts in the OxygenOS 15 is going to be Google Gemini. Using Gemini, along with its own algorithms and fine-tuning, OnePlus is going to offer a number of key AI features in the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R.  For example, the OnePlus 13 series will have Intelligent Search — a feature that aims to make finding information on your phone simple. Rather than opening multiple apps or scrolling through long files, users can simply input natural language queries to search across their devices. This feature will help save time and improve efficiency for anyone managing a large number of files or documents. For photography enthusiasts, the OnePlus 13 series brings several AI-powered tools that promise to enhance your photo-taking experience. The AI Detail Boost feature enhances low-resolution or cropped images, instantly improving their quality to 4K resolution. The AI Unblur fixes blurry photos, by automatically sharpening images and the AI Reflection Eraser helps users remove unwanted reflections in their photos. Apart from the new AI features, OxygenOS 15 also brings optimisations that improve the overall performance of the device. One of the biggest improvements is the reduction in system storage requirements. For context, the system's storage footprint is down by nearly 20 per cent compared to OxygenOS 14 on the OnePlus 12. This optimisation not only frees up space for more apps and data but also leads to faster system performance, providing a smoother and more responsive experience for users.

Here are the details.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-17-to-get-a-big-display-upgrade-that-iphone-16-lacks-2657433-2024-12-30,"The iPhone 17 is said to bring a big display upgrade, one that is missing from the iPhone 16 series. A known tipster claims that Apple is planning to introduce its high-refresh-rate ProMotion technology to the standard model of the iPhone 17, marking a first for the base variant of the flagship lineup. This news will likely bring relief to users who have avoided the standard model due to the lack of high refresh rate support. According to a report by Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station on Weibo, supply chain materials have confirmed that the upcoming iPhone 17 will feature a higher refresh rate display. Although the exact refresh rate has not been mentioned, it is widely speculated that Apple will include the 120Hz ProMotion feature, which has so far been limited to the Pro models. This move would be a big leap from the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models, which use LTPS (low-temperature polycrystalline silicon) panels capped at 60Hz. For the iPhone 17, Apple is expected to switch to more advanced LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) panels, which enable dynamic refresh rates ranging from as low as 1Hz to 120Hz. This technology is not only more power-efficient but also allows features like always-on display, which brings always-visible time, widgets, and notifications—currently available only on the Pro models. With a higher refresh rate, users can expect smoother scrolling, faster animations, and an overall better experience when using the phone for tasks like gaming or video streaming. This upgrade could make the standard iPhone 17 a more attractive option for those who don’t want to pay a premium for the Pro models but still want top-end features. The potential inclusion of ProMotion technology would mark a major shift in Apple’s strategy, as this has been one of the key differentiators between the standard and Pro variants in recent years. By bringing this feature to the base model, Apple could make the iPhone 17 more competitive in the market, especially considering that many Android phones in similar price ranges already offer higher refresh rates. Apple has not officially confirmed any details regarding the iPhone 17 series, but if this rumour turns out to be true, it could be one of the biggest upgrades to the standard iPhone lineup in years. Along with this display upgrade, the iPhone 17 is likely to come with other new features and performance improvements.

One of the most common scams involves part-time jobs, but this time, it wasn’t a job scam. A man ended up losing a large sum of money while trying to apply for a loan. Surprisingly, this incident happened through the Flipkart app. Here’s what happened. A postmaster from Ludhiana lost Rs 87,000 after falling prey to a loan-related cyber fraud. The victim, Sarabjit Singh, a resident of Kaille village in the Sudhar area, had applied for a loan of Rs 2 lakh through the Flipkart app. Days after submitting the application, on December 4, he received a call from an individual posing as a representative of the app, claiming that his loan was approved. However, the caller informed him that the loan couldn’t be disbursed due to incomplete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. To rectify this, Sarabjit was asked to click on a link and complete an online KYC form. Believing it to be a legitimate process, he followed the instructions and was asked to make a token payment of Rs 5 to finalise the verification. But instead of Rs 5, a hefty sum of Rs 86,998 was deducted from his bank account. Shocked by the sudden deduction, Sarabjit immediately contacted the individual, but the person cut off the call and switched off the phone. Sarabjit then approached the Jagraon police station, and the case was forwarded to the cyber crime department for further investigation. According to ASI Jagroop Singh, an FIR has been lodged under section 318(4) for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under the BNS, as well as section 66(D) of the Information Technology (IT) Act. The authorities are now working to trace the bank accounts into which the stolen money was transferred. To prevent falling victim to such frauds, it is essential to stay cautious when dealing with unknown callers or suspicious links, particularly in financial matters. Always verify the authenticity of calls or messages, especially when asked to complete KYC or make any payments. Avoid clicking on unsolicited links and never share personal details or banking information without cross-checking the source. Using official banking apps and authorised websites is the safest way to handle transactions. It is always better to apply for loans via authorised banks and not through third-party apps like Flipkart. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

It has an aluminium frame and a flat screen within a 8mm thin body. The volume rocker and power buttons are conveniently placed on the right edge, while the iconic alert slider is located on the left.  While the black variant has a matte finish, the white variant might reflect a pearl-like colour. Take a look at the images. 
 


OnePlus 13R: Specs and features  Ahead of its official launch, OnePlus has confirmed that the OnePlus 13R will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, a notable upgrade from its predecessor, the OnePlus 12R, which featured the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. As is typical for the R series, OnePlus is using the latest flagship chip for this model. The device will also come equipped with a suite of AI features, including AI Notes, AI Cleanup, AI Imaging, and Intelligent Search, along with a Snapshot feature for its camera system. Additionally, the OnePlus 13R will feature a large 6,000mAh battery, a substantial increase from the 5,500mAh battery found in the OnePlus 12R, promising extended usage time. It will also support SuperVOOC fast charging, with rumours suggesting a 100W fast-charging capability. As with previous models, OnePlus is expected to include a charger in the retail box.

Meanwhile, the current Snapdragon 8 Elite is just starting to appear in flagship phones worldwide.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-2-may-launch-soon-check-details-here-2657602-2024-12-31,"Qualcomm seems to already be gearing up for its next big flagship chip release, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2. Just a few months after introducing the Snapdragon 8 Elite at the Snapdragon Summit in October 2024, rumours suggest that its successor could be arriving sooner than expected. The upcoming flagship chipset is expected to bring significant upgrades, and if leaks are to be believed, it could hit the market earlier than Qualcomm’s usual timeline. According to tipster, Digital Chat Station, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2, internally referred to as the SM8850, might debut much earlier than expected. This would be ahead of Qualcomm’s typical schedule, as this year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite was unveiled on October 22. An early launch could give smartphone brands additional time to work with the new chipset, allowing them to integrate it into their devices ahead of key launches later in the year. One of the most exciting aspects of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 is its expected improvement in GPU performance. Reports suggest the chipset will be built using TSMC’s advanced N3P fabrication process, a step up from the N3E process used for the current Snapdragon 8 Elite. This upgraded fabrication process could deliver better power efficiency and enhanced performance, making it ideal for power users. Performance gains are also expected to be substantial. The new chip could offer at least 20 per cent better performance than its predecessor, according to the tipster. Another leaker, Jukanlosreve, also highlighted the possibility of a 20 per cent jump in both single-core and multi-core CPU performance. Considering that the Snapdragon 8 Elite already delivers a 30 per cent improvement in CPU performance compared to last year’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 could push the limits of mobile processing even further.  It’s worth noting that the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is still in the early stages of making its way to global markets. So far, it has only debuted in the iQOO 13, but that’s set to change soon as brands like Samsung and OnePlus prepare to launch their flagship devices — Galaxy S24 and OnePlus 13 — powered by the latest Qualcomm chipset. With the first generation just beginning to roll out, the idea of an accelerated timeline for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 might seem a bit surprising. While the leaks are intriguing, it’s always wise to take such early information with a grain of salt until Qualcomm makes an official announcement.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

While the specs and features are still under wraps, the rumour suggests that there could be a new entry in the series. It looks like Samsung might be diversifying its foldable lineup further with a more budget-friendly option, following the same philosophy as its Galaxy FE (Fan Edition) devices. The potential of the ""Galaxy Z Flip XE"" was spotted in the GSMA database (via SmartPrix), which could target consumers who are interested in foldable tech but find the flagship Galaxy Z Flip models too pricey.  If the GSMA database listing is accurate, this could mark an exciting shift for Samsung's foldable strategy. A ""lite"" or ""affordable"" foldable might feature slightly scaled-down specs—such as a lower-tier processor, simpler materials, or fewer premium features—while retaining the signature clamshell foldable design.  In late November, rumours hinted that Samsung might launch the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7, with the FE model reportedly powered by the Exynos 2400e. This chip, which also powers the Galaxy S24 FE, is designed to deliver solid performance while helping Samsung keep costs lower. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to feature the more advanced Exynos 2500, a processor yet to be officially unveiled. Unfortunately, the available code snippets provide little insight into the specifics of these foldable devices. Even the exact names of the phones aren't confirmed, though the Android Authority has speculated based on the limited information available. So far, there hasn't been much information about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, aside from indications that they are in development. Details about potential upgrades remain unclear. For now, attention is largely focused on the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 series, anticipated to debut in January. This year's lineup may expand to include a new Galaxy S25 Slim edition, in addition to the usual three models. That said, the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2025 is expected to take place on January 22, which will disclose the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. According to recent reports, the Galaxy S25 Slim will not be released at the same time as the rest of the phones. The Slim variant might arrive a few months later and a new report supports this claim, based on Samsung's latest One UI 7 beta. The beta includes a list of US carrier-specific Samsung phone models, but the Galaxy S25 Slim's model number is notably absent. This suggests that the Slim won’t be part of the initial wave of devices launching with One UI 7 based on Android 15. Earlier rumours indicated that the S25 Slim would debut in the second quarter of next year (between April and June), which aligns with the findings in One UI 7.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 slim expected to arrive later than the rest of the seriesAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim tipped to feature ALoP technology for better photography and smaller camera moduleAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateMust Watch

According to a recent report from the supply chain, the standard iPhone 17 could finally come with a high refresh rate display, a much-needed upgrade over the current 60Hz screens on non-Pro models. This means smoother animations, better responsiveness, and a display experience that feels more in line with modern flagship phones. That said, whether these are your regular 120Hz high refresh rate screens or 120Hz ProMotion displays, remains to be seen.  120Hz ProMotion displays, as Apple calls them, have been exclusive to the Pro and Pro Max models for several years. These premium models feature an adaptive refresh rate ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz, thanks to their advanced LTPO display panels. This not only improves the visual experience but also helps conserve battery life by lowering the refresh rate when it isn’t needed. Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t offered this feature on non-Pro iPhones, and the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus continued the trend, much to the disappointment of fans. Thankfully, things could change with the iPhone 17. While the new report doesn’t explicitly mention ProMotion, rumours from reputable sources like display analyst Ross Young and ETNews have previously hinted that non-Pro models could get this display tech. If true, it could also mean the addition of an Always-On Display. Currently available only on Pro models, this feature uses the 1Hz refresh rate to keep important information on the screen without draining the battery. The iPhone 17 isn’t just about the display, though. It’s expected to bring several other exciting upgrades. A new A19 chip is almost certain, with reports suggesting it will be built using an improved version of TSMC’s 3nm process. This should result in better performance and energy efficiency, even though 2nm chips are still a few years away. Another big change could be in the selfie department. The iPhone 17 might debut Apple’s first 24-megapixel front-facing camera, replacing the 12-megapixel lens that has been standard for years.  Interestingly, Apple might also be reshuffling its lineup. As mentioned in a lot of leaks, the iPhone 17 Plus could be replaced by a super-slim iPhone 17 Air. This new model might make a few compromises, like featuring only a single rear camera, to prioritise a lightweight and ultra-thin design.  As for the iPhone 17 Pro models, they’re expected to continue with titanium frames, a narrower Dynamic Island, and upgraded 12GB RAM for improved AI capabilities. A new type of display, called Low-Dialectric TEE, could also enhance performance and durability while improving power efficiency.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Following the success of the Reno 12 series, the new flagship lineup is expected to feature two models: the Reno 13 5G and the Reno 13 Pro 5G. While the exact date of launch is still under wraps, the company has shared a bunch of teasers that provide a glimpse of what users can expect from the smartphones.  The Reno 13 series is designed with durability in mind, claims Oppo. The company says the phones use a premium aluminium frame, a sculpted rear panel, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for protection. Oppo’s teasers also highlight the use of “aerospace-grade aluminium” on the device.  From the teaser images, it is also evident that the Oppo Reno 13 series 5G will feature a flat display and a triple-camera setup. Unlike its predecessor, the Reno 12, the camera module on the Reno 13 series appears slightly revamped. Additionally, the rear camera setup includes two vertically aligned lenses, with a third lens placed on the side to form a triangular layout. An LED flash, likely designed as a ring light, is housed within the camera module, aligning with current design trends. While details about the Indian variant remain limited, the Reno 13 series has already been launched in China, offering insights into its potential specifications. The Chinese version features a 6.59-inch flat AMOLED display with a resolution of 2760x1256 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering crisp visuals and smooth performance. Powering the device is the MediaTek Dimensity 8350 chipset, equipped with an upgraded GPU for better gaming and faster app loading. A 5,600mAh battery with 80W fast charging support ensures prolonged usage and quick recharges.   The Reno 13 series shines in the camera department, a hallmark of the Reno lineup. It includes a 50-megapixel primary camera with optical image stabilization (OIS), an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 50-megapixel front-facing camera for exceptional selfies and video calls.   Running on ColorOS 15, based on Android 15, the Reno 13 series offers a polished software experience with advanced features and optimizations. Additionally, its durability credentials are bolstered by IP66, IP68, and IP69 certifications, making it resistant to dust and water in various conditions.   In China, the Reno 13 series starts at CNY 2,699 (approximately Rs 31,400). While pricing for India hasn’t been confirmed, the Reno 12 was launched at Rs 32,999, suggesting the Reno 13 could follow a similar pricing structure. With its sleek design, enhanced performance, and premium features, the Reno 13 series is poised to be a strong contender in the flagship smartphone market.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

The lineup will make its debut on January 9, 2025, at 5:30 PM IST, as confirmed through a post on X (Twitter) by the company. Poco has also revealed that both smartphones in the series will be available for purchase via Flipkart.  Apart from the Poco X7 and X7 Pro, contrary to some earlier rumours, Poco India's Head, Himanshu Tandon, has confirmed there won’t be a third Neo variant in the lineup, putting those speculations to rest. Over the past few weeks, leaks and teasers have provided a good idea of what to expect from these new smartphones, and fans have plenty of reasons to look forward to them. Starting with the Poco X7, the base model is rumoured to feature the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra chipset under the hood. The phone might come with up to 12GB RAM and 512GB of internal storage. It is expected to sport a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Additionally, expected features like HDR10+ support, TUV Rheinland eye care certification, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection make it an appealing choice for those who value display quality and durability. The Poco X7 Pro, on the other hand, is set to feature a more powerful MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset. It is also expected to come with a 6.67-inch AMOLED display, but this screen could take things up a notch with a CrystalRez 1.5K resolution, 2,560Hz touch sampling rate, and an impressive 3,200 nits peak brightness. When it comes to cameras, the Poco X7 is rumoured to feature a 50-megapixel main rear camera with OIS, while the Pro model could include a 50-megapixel Sony IMX882 sensor with f/1.5 aperture and 4K video recording support. Both phones may come with a 20-megapixel front-facing camera. Battery life is another area where the Poco X7 series looks promising. The vanilla model could house a 5,110mAh battery with 45W fast charging support, while the Pro variant might step up with a massive 6,000mAh battery and 90W fast charging support. Both devices are also said to come with IP68 dust and water resistance. It will be interesting to see how Poco approaches the pricing strategy for the Poco X7 series, especially given the highly competitive nature of the mid-range smartphone market in India. With so many brands vying for attention in this segment, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Poco can position the X7 series as a strong contender for the title of bestseller in the sub-Rs 30,000 price range. For context, the predecessor models — the Poco X6 and X6 Pro — made their debut in India at attractive price points, with the standard variant starting at Rs 21,999 and the Pro version at Rs 26,999.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Ahead of the launch, 2024’s flagships, the OnePlus 12 and the OnePlus 12R, have been listed at a massive discount. While a Rs 10,000 discount on the OnePlus 12 is available on Flipkart, there is up to Rs 7,000 off you can get on the OnePlus 12R, and the best deal is on the top variant of the phone. But there is a catch –– there is always a catch. At the time of writing the story, the deal had a timer on it with a validity for the next 12 hours and 40 minutes. Which means the discount will only be available till midnight today.  You can read our detailed review of the OnePlus 12R.OnePlus 12R discount On the OnePlus India website, the OnePlus 12R is currently available with a flat discount of up to Rs 7,000. Here is a breakdown of the deal: The base variant of the OnePlus 12R, with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage has no deal, and is in fact, the most expensive one right now because of the discounts. It is selling at its original price of Rs 39,999. The middle variant, which offers 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, is available with Rs 4,000 discount. That means, instead of its usual price of Rs 42,000, the OnePlus 12R’s base variant is currently selling at Rs 38,999.  The top variant with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage, however, is selling with a flat discount of Rs 7,000 and has the best offer available right now.

Additionally, on top of the flat discount, the OnePlus India website is also offering a bank discount of Rs 3,000 on payments made via ICICI Bank, OneCard, and RBL Bank credit and debit cards.

2a130872-ea86-4fd2-8974-f5cbb82a47a7,Apple TV+ will be free to stream for all users in India for 3 daysApple TV+ content will be free to stream for all users in India and worldwide for the first weekend of New Year 2025.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-tv-will-be-free-to-stream-for-all-users-in-india-for-3-days-2657784-2024-12-31,"Apple TV+ content is great, but it doesn’t have as many subscribers as, say, Netflix or Amazon Prime. It’s more popular among Apple users, comparatively –– also because you can club it as part of Apple One, which gives Apple users access to Apple Music, iCloud+ and other apps as well. Apple TV+’s relatively smaller user base (the company does not disclose its subscriber base publicly) is interesting considering it is also not very expensive –– its subscription starts at Rs 99 for a month, in India. However, it seems like Apple is trying to fix exactly that now. Apple has announced that Apple TV+ will be free to stream for all users in India and worldwide for the first weekend of 2025. 
 


 This basically means that starting Friday, January 3, Apple TV+ will be free to access by all, regardless of if you have the subscription of the platform or not. The platform will be free to stream till Sunday, January 5. This offer will be available everywhere in the world. The only condition: the streaming service is available where you stay –– that is, you are not using the service via VPN.  All you need to access this offer is an Apple ID and password. If you don’t have one, you can create it for free. But why is Apple letting people access Apple TV+ for free? Let’s go back to what we said at the beginning of the piece. Apple is trying to fix its relatively small user base. With open access to all for three days, Apple is trying to drive people to sign up to Apple TV+ and hopefully get them hooked to a show or some Apple TV+ exclusive content that forces them to sign up to the streaming service when the free weekend is over.  Apple has an interesting lineup on Apple TV+ including series like Severance, Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, along with critically acclaimed titles like Silo, Shrinking, and Slow Horses. For sci-fi fans, there is also Dark Matter, For All Mankind, and Foundation. The platform also has films like Fly Me to the Moon, Wolf, The Instigators and The Family Plan.

It slots in comfortably between the regular Galaxy S24 and the flagship Galaxy S24 Ultra, offering many of the premium features that users want, without the hefty price tag that comes with the Ultra model. If you're someone who wants a big-screen phone and top-tier performance but doesn't necessarily need the S24 Ultra and its S Pen prowess, the Galaxy S24+ is an ideal option. And right now, it's available at a price that makes it even more tempting.advertisementGalaxy S24+ available at Rs 35,000 massive discountAt present, the Galaxy S24+ is available on Flipkart for just Rs 64,999, a solid Rs 35,000 off its original list price of Rs 99,999.

With the price reduction, the S24+ is positioned as one of the best value-for-money phones in the market today.There’s also an exchange offer that makes the deal even sweeter. Depending on the device you're willing to trade in, you could get up to Rs 46,299 as an exchange value. For example, if you want to exchange an old iPhone 14 Plus, you could get up to Rs 31,500 as part of the exchange offer, while a Galaxy S22+ can fetch up to Rs 20,300.

Now, you might be wondering if it's the right time to buy, especially with the Galaxy S25 series expected to launch soon. While the new S25 phones will no doubt come with a slew of upgrades, they are also likely to come with a much higher price tag. This means that for anyone who’s on a budget but still wants a big phone with high-end specs, the Galaxy S24+ is a superb deal right now. Should you buy Galaxy S24+? In terms of design and performance, the Galaxy S24+ does not disappoint. It comes with a sleek look that’s typical of Samsung’s flagship devices, with a large, beautiful display that makes watching videos or gaming as immersive as it gets. The phone comes with top-tier performance, with the Exynos 2400 processor under the hood paired with 12GB RAM and up to 512GB storage. The phone also supports up to 7 years of software updates. While the Galaxy S24 Ultra might have some additional features, such as the S Pen, the S24 Plus offers everything that most users need in a high-end phone at a much more affordable price point. If you're in the market for a big phone with top-tier features but don’t want to spend a fortune, the Galaxy S24+ is a phone worth considering. With its current discount and exchange offers, it’s the best time to grab it before prices go back up. In fact, most people who buy Galaxy S devices don’t really talk much about the plus model. Even if you try to buy the Galaxy S24+ right now — apart from Flipkart — the phone is really hard to find on online channels. As for purchasing it offline, you won’t be able to score such a good deal.  In short, if you need a premium phone but don't have the budget for the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Galaxy S24+ could be exactly what you're looking for — and right now, it's at a price that’s hard to beat.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

6ad6ef78-0604-498f-add0-6918a3756f91,"iOS devices are easier target for hackers compared to AndroidiOS devices face more phishing attacks than Android, with 19 per cent of enterprise iOS devices targeted in 2024.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ios-devices-are-easier-target-for-hackers-compared-to-android-2657830-2024-12-31,"A new report from security analysts at Lookout suggests iOS devices are more vulnerable to phishing attacks than Android devices. According to the latest Mobile Threat Landscape Report for Q3 2024, 18.4 per cent of iOS devices were targeted by phishing attempts compared to 11.4 per cent of Android devices. Lookout, a data-centric cloud security company, based its findings on data from an AI-powered mobile dataset that analysed 220 million devices, 360 million apps, and billions of web items. Their security cloud has identified over 473 million malicious websites, including phishing sites, since 2019. These phishing attacks aim to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and other personal data. What makes iOS devices more attractive to attackers? One reason could be their popularity in the workplace. The report highlights that iOS devices are more common than Android devices in enterprise settings. In fact, Lookout’s user base had more than twice as many iOS devices as Android devices. This higher number of devices means more opportunities for attackers to strike. The statistics back this up. In 2024, 19 per cent of enterprise iOS devices faced at least one mobile phishing attack during each of the first three quarters. On the other hand, only 10.9 per cent of enterprise Android devices were exposed to phishing attacks in the same period. This data suggests that the threat might be more about sheer numbers rather than any inherent weakness in iOS. In addition, Lookout’s researchers noted a 17 per cent increase in enterprise-focused credential theft and phishing attempts since the previous quarter and a 32 per cent rise in malicious app detections. These findings emphasise how cyber criminal groups are shifting their tactics to target mobile devices more aggressively in the early stages of their attacks.  While the report focused on enterprise devices, regular users shouldn’t let their guard down. Phishing attacks have become increasingly advanced, often targeting everyday consumers through emails, messages, and even fake websites. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android phone, phishing can put your personal information at risk. Experts warn that phishing is only going to become more sophisticated as we head into 2025. The rise of AI has enabled cybercriminals to craft convincing fake messages that look almost identical to legitimate communications. The goal is always the same — to get you to click on a link or download a file that compromises your data. The takeaway? Stay vigilant. Be cautious of emails or messages that seem too urgent or unusual, even if they appear to come from trusted sources. Always double-check links before clicking and never share personal information unless you’re absolutely sure it’s safe.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

This feature is rumoured to utilise a composite sensor that combines data from various dedicated sensors, such as the accelerometer and GPS, to identify car crashes.Currently, this functionality is inactive, even in the latest One UI version. The report notes that similar references to the feature were present in Samsung’s software as far back as One UI 5.1.1 and have been spotted on devices like the Galaxy S24 series and Samsung's newest foldable smartphones.

Samsung Galaxy S25 to offer free advanced Gemini features Another report also indicated that Google may collaborate with Samsung to bundle its premium AI features with the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. This potential partnership was uncovered during a teardown of the beta version of the Google app (v15.52.37), where several lines of code hinted at the offer. The discovered code references both Google One and Samsung, along with the term “upsell,” suggesting that this initiative might be part of a broader strategy. By offering free access to its advanced AI capabilities, specifically the Gemini Advanced features, Google could aim to familiarise users with its premium services, hoping they’ll subscribe after the trial period ends. Interestingly, additional strings of code explicitly mention “Samsung_S25,” further connecting the offer to the Galaxy S25 series. Speculation suggests that the free subscription durations might vary by model. For instance, the standard Galaxy S25 might include three to six months of Gemini Advanced access, while the higher-end Plus and Ultra variants could offer extended trials of nine months to a year. If true, this move could enhance the appeal of the Galaxy S25 lineup by bundling cutting-edge AI tools, creating added value for buyers while positioning Google’s AI offerings to reach a broader audience.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 may arrive with a budget-friendly variant in 2025Also read |  iPhone 17 may get 120Hz display but there's a catchAlso read |  OnePlus 13R leaks show off two colour variants, ahead of January 7 launchMust Watch

afcc7b4d-95c3-4328-86c7-327ab59f5d75,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai has a message for his employees for 2025, says move fasterGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai addressed his employees ahead of the new year 2025. He stressed over the urgency to develop and improve the company's AI products.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-has-a-message-for-his-employees-for-2025-says-we-need-to-move-faster-2657820-2024-12-31,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai has outlined ambitious goals for 2025, calling it an important year for the company amidst rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Addressing employees during a strategy meeting at Google’s Mountain View headquarters, Pichai emphasised the urgency of adapting to a rapidly evolving tech landscape, citing the importance of delivering innovative solutions and maintaining focus. “The stakes are high,” Pichai remarked, as reported by CNBC. “These are disruptive moments. In 2025, we need to be relentlessly focused on unlocking the benefits of this technology and solving real user problems.”   At the heart of Google’s strategy for 2025 is its AI initiative, Gemini. The app, designed to offer versatile tools, including chatbots and other consumer-facing applications, is seen as central to Google’s efforts to remain competitive in the generative AI market. Pichai stressed the importance of selling Gemini to a target of 500 million users, placing it among Google’s flagship products.  “Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year,” he stated. “We’ve seen strong momentum recently, but there’s work to do to close the gap and establish a leadership position.”   DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis further elaborated on the vision for Gemini, describing plans to enhance its capabilities into a universal assistant adaptable to any device, domain, or modality. He also hinted at updates to Project Astra, Google’s experimental AI assistant, expected in the first half of 2025.   While Google remains a leader in search, it faces increasing competition from rivals like OpenAI, supported by Microsoft, and other AI-powered search tools. Addressing this competitive pressure, Pichai reassured employees that being “first” isn’t always necessary for success.   “In history, you don’t always need to be first, but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,” he explained. “That’s what 2025 is all about.”   Google also showcased emerging AI-driven products during the meeting. Josh Woodward, head of Google Labs, demonstrated tools like Jules, a coding assistant; NotebookLM, an AI-powered note-taking tool integrated with podcasts; and Project Mariner, a Chrome extension designed to streamline multitasking. These innovations highlight Google’s commitment to developing practical and impactful solutions for users.  Despite the company’s focus on AI, Google faces mounting regulatory challenges. In 2024, it was accused of monopolistic practices in search and advertising. Pichai acknowledged the scrutiny but urged employees not to lose focus. “It’s not lost on me that we are facing scrutiny across the world,” he said. “It comes with our size and success. But through this moment, we have to ensure we don’t get distracted.”   Pichai also encouraged employees to adopt a resourceful mindset, reflecting on the ingenuity of Google’s founders during the company’s early days. “Constraints often lead to creativity. Not all problems are solved by headcount,” he noted, referencing recent cost-cutting measures.   As Google navigates this transformative period, Pichai’s message is clear: accelerate innovation, execute effectively, and remain focused on delivering world-class products.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  MAGA darling a month ago, Vivek Ramaswamy now an American-Indian Trump supporters love to hateAlso read |  Sriram in White House, Trump supporters demand ban on H1-B Visa and fewer Indians in Silicon ValleyAlso read |  What is the Qualcomm vs Arm battle that could have huge implications on future laptops, phones

The government, on Tuesday, has removed restrictions on the app’s payments service, WhatsApp Payment, which is a major win for parent company Meta. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which oversees the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system, announced that WhatsApp can now expand its payments feature to all users in the country, lifting the previous cap of 100 million users. This was first reported by TechCrunch.   This decision represents a significant shift in regulatory policy, which had previously limited WhatsApp Payment’s rollout. Initially capped at 40 million users in 2020 and later extended to 100 million in 2022, the cautious approach by NPCI reflected concerns over market concentration in India’s booming digital payments sector.   India’s UPI platform processes over 13 billion transactions monthly, with Google Pay and PhonePe controlling more than 85 per cent of the market. WhatsApp’s expansion poses a direct challenge to these incumbents, bolstered by its massive user base and seamless integration with the messaging app.   The timing is particularly favourable for Meta, as the company recently introduced its generative AI product, Meta AI, which has also gained significant traction in India, further solidifying the country’s importance to Meta’s global strategy.   In addition to lifting restrictions on WhatsApp Payment, NPCI deferred a proposed rule to cap any single app’s UPI transaction share at 30 per cent until December 31, 2026. This extension gives WhatsApp more time to establish its foothold in the competitive fintech landscape.   The decision not only amplifies Meta’s financial services ambitions but also underscores India’s role as a critical growth market for the tech giant.

However, some users of the Galaxy S22 Ultra are struggling with a frustrating problem that’s making their phones almost unusable.  These users have reported their devices randomly rebooting over and over again in what is known as a boot loop. The issue has become a hot topic on social media platforms like Reddit, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and even Samsung’s official forums.  While some users mention occasional crashes, freezing, or lagging, others say their Galaxy S22 Ultra has completely stopped working because of the endless rebooting. For many, the trouble started after they installed Samsung’s One UI 6.1 update, released in September of last year. A recent report from Sammobile highlighted that users who sought help at Samsung service centres were told the issue was due to a faulty motherboard. Unfortunately, since the Galaxy S22 Ultra is out of warranty for most users now, they’ve had to pay for costly repairs. Some customers are reportedly shelling out hundreds of dollars to fix a problem they feel isn’t their fault. To make matters worse, Samsung hasn’t yet provided an official solution. Many users are sharing tips and temporary fixes online. One unusual method involves putting the Galaxy S22 Ultra in a freezer for a few minutes. Some claim this helps the phone work again for a short time. However, the problem returns once the device heats up. Experts warn against trying this method, as exposing your phone to extreme cold could damage its internal components. The frustration among Galaxy S22 Ultra users is growing. One user posted on Reddit, “This was the most expensive phone I’ve ever bought, and now it’s just restarting all the time. I can’t even back up my data.” Others have expressed disappointment with the lack of acknowledgement or support from Samsung. For now, users are left with few options. They can either pay for repairs or wait and hope that Samsung provides a fix, whether through a software patch or a repair program. Many believe the company should take responsibility, especially since the problem seems linked to a recent update.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Previously, the rumour has it that the Galaxy S25+ could be powered by Exynos 2500 SoC. But now a Geekbench list, featuring the international model of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, indicates that a Snapdragon processor makes more sense.  The international version of the Samsung Galaxy S25, identified by the model number SM-S931B, recently appeared on Geekbench. It operates on Android 15 and is equipped with 12GB of RAM. In Geekbench's tests, it achieved scores of 2,986 in single-core and 9,355 in multi-core performance. While these scores are lower compared to some other Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered devices, this could be a prototype, and the final retail version is expected to deliver improved performance.Samsung Galaxy S25 series: Everything we know so far  The Samsung Galaxy S25 series has already sparked significant interest ahead of its official release, with several rumours and leaks emerging. The flagship lineup is expected to feature a significant performance boost, with the international Galaxy S25 model (SM-S931B) recently surfacing on Geekbench. This device is reported to run Android 15 and come with 12GB of RAM.  Aside from raw performance, rumours indicate that the S25 series will offer notable upgrades in its display, camera capabilities, and battery life. The Galaxy S25 is expected to come with a dynamic AMOLED display, possibly featuring a higher refresh rate for smoother visuals. The camera system may be enhanced with advanced sensors and AI-powered features to capture sharper images in varied conditions.  Additionally, Samsung is reportedly working on improving its battery efficiency, with a larger capacity and faster charging speeds to accommodate heavy usage throughout the day. The S25 series will likely maintain its signature sleek design, with a glass and metal body, and improved durability. Additionally, the company is also expected to release a fourth device in the series-- Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim. However, this phone might not be able to make it like the rest of the phones. The Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to arrive later than the rest.  With Samsung set to reveal more details soon, fans and tech enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the official announcement to confirm these speculations and see what the new generation of Galaxy devices has to offer.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

2c29d0bb-5ca8-4955-bcd9-50ba463fc044,India pushes UPI market cap deadline to 2026The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has extended the deadline for applying market share limits on UPI payment apps to December 2026.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/india-pushes-upi-market-cap-deadline-to-2026-2658433-2025-01-02,"In a big move, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has decided to delay the implementation of market share caps for Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment apps by two years, pushing the deadline to December 2026. This decision offers a reprieve to major players like PhonePe and Google Pay, which currently dominate the UPI landscape in India. The NPCI had initially proposed a cap in 2020, aiming to limit any single UPI payment app to a 30 per cent market share. This step was meant to stop any one company from dominating the market and encourage healthy competition. However, as of November 2024, PhonePe, backed by Walmart, commanded approximately 47.8 per cent of UPI transactions, while Google Pay held around 37 per cent. Implementing the cap as scheduled could have led to major disruptions for these platforms and their vast user bases. The decision to postpone the cap is seen as a strategic move to ensure the continued growth and stability of the UPI ecosystem. By extending the deadline, the NPCI aims to provide emerging players with additional time to expand their market presence. In addition to delaying the market share cap, the NPCI has lifted the user limit on WhatsApp Pay, allowing the Meta-owned platform to expand its user base beyond the previous cap of 100 million users in India.  The UPI platform has experienced exponential growth in recent years, with transaction volumes reaching unprecedented levels. In 2024 alone, UPI transactions surged by 46 per cent, totalling 172 billion, up from 118 billion in 2023. This fast adoption underscores the platform's integral role in India's digital payment landscape, making decisions particularly impactful. While the delay offers immediate relief to dominant players, it also underscores the NPCI's commitment to maintaining a fair and competitive environment. By giving more time, the NPCI is trying to stop any one company from taking over the market while managing the challenges of enforcing rules in a fast-changing digital ecosystem. As the new deadline approaches, it will be crucial for leading UPI apps to strategise on diversifying their services and possibly collaborate with emerging players to ensure compliance. For consumers, these developments may lead to a more diversified market with a broader array of choices, potentially offering improved services in the country’s ever-evolving digital payment sector.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

While the launch date will unveil the high-end phone in full glory, the company has confirmed a few specs, giving us a sneak peek into the future. As the latest addition to the company’s premium lineup, the device is expected to bring significant upgrades in terms of design, performance, and features. Here, let's take a look at things we already know. advertisementOnePlus 13 to launch soon: 5 things we already know Design: OnePlus teasers indicate that the OnePlus 13 is up for a design change, as compared to its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. The OnePlus 13 retains the familiar circular rear camera module with three sensors. However, the design now features flat sides and a flat display, replacing the previous curved style. Despite housing a larger battery, the new model is slimmer and lighter than the OnePlus 12. It is also offered in two finish options: leather and glass, catering to different style preferences. In India, it is set to launch in three colourways: Black Eclipse, Arctic Dawn, and Midnight Ocean (leather). The company has also revealed that the smartphone will feature IP68 and IP69 ratings. 
 


Display: Since the OnePlus 13 has already been launched in China, it is said that the Indian variant will mimic the same. So, in China, it comes with a 6.82-inch display, matching its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. It offers a QHD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate for exceptional visuals. The screen impresses with 1,600 nits of standard brightness and a peak of 4,500 nits. Two standout features elevate this model: glove compatibility and dynamic local high refresh rate. The glove-friendly feature ensures effortless use in colder climates, like Delhi in winter. Meanwhile, the adaptive refresh rate optimises performance, adjusting seamlessly for activities like video playback or smooth scrolling. Processor: The OnePlus 13 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, delivering a performance boost of up to 45 per cent than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It runs on OxygenOS 15, built on Android 15, with a strong focus on AI to enhance user productivity and experience. A key component of this AI innovation is Google Gemini, which, combined with OnePlus's fine-tuned algorithms, introduces features like Intelligent Search, AI Detail Boost, AI Unblur, and AI Reflection Eraser. 
 


OxygenOS 15 also brings significant system optimisations freeing up space for users. Beyond AI enhancements, these optimisations improve the phone's overall performance, making it faster and more efficient. This combination of hardware and software positions the OnePlus 13 as a high-performing, user-friendly flagship device.
 


Battery: The OnePlus 13 introduces a significant battery upgrade, featuring a larger 6,000mAh unit compared to the 5,400mAh battery in the OnePlus 12. OnePlus claims this enhancement delivers nearly two days of battery life, though this will be confirmed upon testing when the phone launches in India.
 


Camera: OnePlus has consistently focused on improving its camera technology, and the OnePlus 13 appears to be no exception. The smartphone sports a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, a name synonymous with premium photography. The primary sensor is rumoured to be a 50-megapixel LYT-808 with optical image stabilisation (OIS), accompanied by telephoto and ultrawide lenses, both of which now feature 50-megapixel sensors. This setup is expected to deliver exceptional photography and videography capabilities, including 4K video recording and advanced night mode. On the front, the device may house a 32-megapixel selfie camera with AI enhancements for sharper and more vibrant portraits.
 


OnePlus 13 price expectations in IndiaThe pricing details for the OnePlus 13 remain undisclosed, but it is widely speculated to be priced under Rs 70,000. To provide context, the OnePlus 12 launched in India at a base price of Rs 64,999. Even if OnePlus opts for a modest price increase with its latest flagship, the cost is still expected to fall comfortably within the Rs 70,000 bracket, maintaining its competitive edge in the premium smartphone market.

The smartphone sports a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, a name synonymous with premium photography. The primary sensor is rumoured to be a 50-megapixel LYT-808 with optical image stabilisation (OIS), accompanied by telephoto and ultrawide lenses, both of which now feature 50-megapixel sensors. This setup is expected to deliver exceptional photography and videography capabilities, including 4K video recording and advanced night mode. On the front, the device may house a 32-megapixel selfie camera with AI enhancements for sharper and more vibrant portraits.
 


OnePlus 13 price expectations in India The pricing details for the OnePlus 13 remain undisclosed, but it is widely speculated to be priced under Rs 70,000. To provide context, the OnePlus 12 launched in India at a base price of Rs 64,999. Even if OnePlus opts for a modest price increase with its latest flagship, the cost is still expected to fall comfortably within the Rs 70,000 bracket, maintaining its competitive edge in the premium smartphone market.

Rumours about the device, which will likely follow the Xiaomi 15 series, have surfaced online. If leaks are to be believed, Xiaomi might bring some exciting updates to its camera technology this time around. The Xiaomi 15 and Xiaomi 15 Pro were launched in China back in October 2024, powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. These models feature a Leica-tuned triple rear camera system, headlined by a 50-megapixel main sensor. However, one standout feature was exclusive to the Pro version, i.e., a periscope telephoto camera.  As per tipster Smart Pikachu on Weibo, the rumoured Xiaomi 16 might include a periscope telephoto camera in its standard variant, along with the Pro version. What’s so special about the periscope telephoto lens? It allows you to zoom in on distant objects with minimal loss in quality. In 2024, only the Xiaomi 15 Pro model had this feature. It comprises a 50-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto camera with 10x lossless zoom, along with a 50-megapixel primary sensor, and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera. On the other hand, the standard Xiaomi 15 comes with a 50-megapixel primary camera, a regular telephoto camera, and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle shooter. If the rumours hold true, Xiaomi might be aiming to make this “pro” camera feature more accessible in its next release. The Xiaomi 15 series brought a lot to the table beyond cameras. Both models are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and run on Xiaomi’s HyperOS 2 atop Android 15. They’re also built to last, with an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The standard Xiaomi 15 comes with a 6.36-inch OLED display with a 1.5K resolution and up to 3,200 nits. Meanwhile, the Pro version takes things up a notch with a 2K OLED display. Under the hood, the Xiaomi 15 packs a 5,400mAh battery with 90W wired and 50W wireless charging, while the Pro model has an even bigger 6,100mAh battery with the same charging speeds. To recall, the Xiaomi 15 was launched in China at a starting price of CNY 4,499 (roughly Rs. 53,000), while the Xiaomi 15 Pro was launched at a starting price of CNY 5,299 (roughly Rs 62,000). Both phones are expected to launch in India by March 2025.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

He ended up losing Rs 13 lakh after downloading a malware-laden file under the guise of a KYC update. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/techie-working-with-drdo-loses-rs-13-lakh-while-updating-kyc-for-bank-2658488-2025-01-02,"In yet another case of cyber fraud, scammers managed to dupe a techie of Rs 13 lakh. The victim, employed as a senior technical officer at the Defence Research and Development Organisation in Pune, was contacted by unknown individuals regarding a supposed KYC update linked to his bank account. However, as he followed the instructions, he ended up losing his money from his bank account.  As per the case reported by The Indian Express, the victim, a 57-year-old techie at DRDO, lodged a complaint at the Yerawada police station this week. In his complaint, the victim revealed that in the third week of November, he received a WhatsApp message from an unknown sender, purportedly from a public sector bank. The message falsely claimed that his KYC details were overdue for an update and warned that his bank account would be frozen if he failed to act promptly. Along with the message, the sender also attached a file that they instructed him to download. Thinking it to be a genuine message from the bank to remind users about a KYC update, the victim clicked on the attachment and downloaded the file to his smartphone. However, this file contained a malware application specifically designed by the scammers to grant them remote access to his device. Shortly after downloading the file, the officer received several One-Time Passwords (OTPs) on his phone. However, as the victim was not conducting any transactions on his end at that moment, he ignored these OTP messages. Following the messages, the scammers exploited the remote access granted by the malicious application to siphon Rs12.95 lakh from his bank account. It was only after seeing messages about unauthorised transactions that the victim promptly approached the Pune city cyber police station to report the crime. Following a preliminary investigation, an FIR was registered at the Yerawada police station. According to the police, this is not an isolated case where an individual has lost money after downloading an unknown file. In fact, this case is yet another example of frauds that typically involves cybercriminals tricking victims into downloading files or applications that allow unauthorised access to their devices. Once access is granted, the criminals can manipulate banking and payment applications to drain the victim’s accounts. Given the seriousness of the rising cases of online fraud in India, the cyber cell and police have issued a strong advisory regarding measures to stay safe from lingering cyber scams. To keep yourself safe, here are some safety precautions: – First and foremost, never respond to messages or emails from unidentified numbers or addresses claiming to be from banks or service providers. – If you receive any attachment file or link from an unknown sender, do not click on it unless you cross-check who the sender is. – Always pay attention to OTPs received on your phone, especially if you are not carrying out any transactions.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  India pushes UPI market cap deadline to 2026Also Read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso Read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and more

In China, for instance, OnePlus has already launched the OnePlus Ace 5, featuring a massive 6,415mAh battery, a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and a flat display. Therefore, we anticipate similar specifications for its global counterpart. Here is everything we know so far about the OnePlus 13R, including its rumored specifications and expected price.OnePlus 13R chipset The OnePlus 13R will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, the same chipset which was earlier featured in last generation OnePlus’ flagship device and other premium Android smartphones. This upgrade is expected to offer better performance, efficiency, and AI capabilities, including support for advanced photo editing and note-taking features compared to the OnePlus 12R.OnePlus 13R display  The new-generation OnePlus 13R is also expected to sport a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and an impressive peak brightness of 1,600 nits.OnePlus 13R new colours Notably, the OnePlus 13R is already confirmed to come in two new colour options– Astral Trail and Nebula Noir.

On the right edge, rumours suggest that users will find the volume rocker and power button, while the signature OnePlus alert slider will be on the left.OnePlus 13R camera  Rumors also suggest that the OnePlus 13R will feature a 50-megapixel Sony IMX906 primary sensor with optical image stabilisation, paired with an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens and a 2-megapixel macro sensor. On the front, the phone is likely to get a 16-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. The triple-camera system is expected to deliver better low-light performance and detailed shots.OnePlus 13R battery Under the hood, while the Chinese version of the device, the OnePlus Ace 5, packs a 6,415mAh battery, the Indian variant might slightly reduce the capacity to 6,000mAh. Nonetheless, the phone will support 80W wired fast charging for quick charging support.  Additionally, the OnePlus 13R is rumoured to include extra features like an IR sensor at the top, a USB Type-C port, a SIM card slot, a speaker grille, and a microphone at the bottom. An IP65-rated build is also expected, offering protection against dust and light water exposure.OnePlus 13R pricing in India As for pricing, the OnePlus 13R will undoubtedly be the affordable sibling of the flagship OnePlus 13. Reports suggest the OnePlus 13R will launch in India and select global markets at a starting price of Rs 40,999 for the base variant, making it a strong option for those seeking flagship-level features at a more accessible price point. Meanwhile, the flagship OnePlus 13 is expected to be priced between Rs 67,000 and Rs 70,000.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  Techie working with DRDO loses Rs 13 lakh while updating KYC for bankAlso Read |  India pushes UPI market cap deadline to 2026Also Read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

Here is what happened.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/woman-loses-rs-15-crore-after-ordering-food-for-daughter-2658524-2025-01-02,"A 78-year-old woman from South Mumbai fell victim to a cyber scam and lost Rs 1.5 crore after being tricked by fraudsters posing as the Special Investigation Team of Delhi police, according to a report by TOI. The elderly homemaker, who is related to a well-known builder in the area, was misled into believing she was under investigation for money laundering and drug-related charges. Here is what happened. The incident began a few weeks back when the woman arranged for a courier service to send food to her daughter in the US. The next day, she received a call from someone claiming to be from the courier company. The caller alleged that her package contained more than just food—it reportedly included her Aadhaar card, expired passports, credit cards, and illegal substances, along with USD 2,000 in cash. The fraudsters accused her of being involved in a conspiracy with two other individuals. As part of the elaborate scam, several people posing as officials from various government departments, including the Cyber Crime Branch and the Finance Department, contacted her in the days that followed. They even conducted video calls, appearing in police uniforms and showing her fake documents, such as arrest warrants and investigation reports, to make their claims seem credible. Under pressure, the woman was convinced to reveal her personal banking details because the scammers showed her fake warrants and investigation reports on WhatsApp. Believing she was safeguarding her assets during the ""investigation,"" she transferred Rs 1.51 crore to bank accounts provided by the fraudsters. It wasn’t until she discussed the situation with a family member that she realised she had been tricked. She immediately reported the crime to the Cybercrime Police Helpline and the case was passed on to the South Cyber Cell of the Mumbai Police. Officials noted that the fraudsters used multiple accounts to quickly move the money, making it harder to trace. Cybercrime experts have urged people, particularly the elderly, to be cautious of such scams. They recommend verifying the legitimacy of claims made by unknown callers, avoiding sharing personal information over the phone, and reporting suspicious activity promptly.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 2, 2025

Until now, the feature, accessible via the Good Lock app, has been limited to certain regions and is only available through the Galaxy Store. However, with the release of OneUI 7 in 2025, Good Lock support is set to expand. The app will soon be available to users worldwide, and for the first time, it will be accessible on the Google Play Store. Good Lock has been around for several years, offering users more control over their Samsung Galaxy devices. The app allows users to tweak various aspects of OneUI, including modifying the default Samsung launcher and adding support for running apps on the cover display of devices like the Galaxy Z Flip. The news of Good Lock’s expansion comes as Samsung prepares to roll out OneUI 7, which is in beta for the Galaxy S24 series and is expected to roll out to the Galaxy S25 series upon its launch. For the first time, Good Lock will be available in all countries, making it accessible to a much wider audience.  Until now, users in regions where Good Lock wasn’t available had to find workarounds or rely on different methods, such as sideloading the app from third-party websites. Now, with its new global availability, more users will be able to take advantage of its features, such as customising the user interface, adjusting the layout of apps, and even adding widgets that weren’t previously possible. Additionally, the feature will no longer be restricted to the Galaxy Store; users will be able to download and update Good Lock directly from the Google Play Store. Alongside the new distribution channels, Samsung is also redesigning the Good Lock app itself. The update will focus on improving the overall user interface, making it easier for users to find and manage their customisation options. A new “My Page” tab will be added, allowing users to better organise their settings and preferences. There will also be a filter feature that helps users find specific Good Lock apps more easily. Although Good Lock has been around for a while, the upcoming update will introduce new changes to the way it works with OneUI 7. Some Good Lock apps that weren’t previously compatible with the system will be updated to work with the latest version of Samsung’s software, providing even more options for customisation.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

As the tournament’s official smartphone, the company is putting its best Android devices front and centre for tennis fans worldwide.  The Australian Open is just the latest addition to Google’s growing lineup of sports partnerships. Pixel is already the official smartphone for the NBA, NWSL, and Germany’s Frauen-Bundesliga. It’s also teamed up with UEFA’s European Championships and Premier League powerhouses like Liverpool and Arsenal. Now, by partnering with one of tennis’s biggest events, Google is continuing to push the Pixel brand to a broader audience. But this isn’t just another marketing campaign with a logo slapped on some banners. Google is using the Australian Open to highlight the features that make its Pixel smartphones stand out. Key tools like Gemini, Circle to Search, Magic Eraser, and Magic Editor are all being showcased as part of this partnership. These features are designed to make life easier, whether it’s editing a photo with AI or finding information quickly. To bring these features to life, Google has created an interactive Pixel Studio at Rod Laver Arena, the heart of the Australian Open. This hub lets fans get hands-on experience with the Pixel 9 Pro’s advanced tools. At the Pixel Studio, expert coaches are available to help visitors learn how to capture the perfect action shot or use the phone’s AI-powered editing tools to enhance their photos. It’s a chance for people to see what the Pixel can do in a real-world setting. The Australian Open runs from January 12 to January 26, ending with the men’s singles final. During this time, Google is also rolling out some big deals on its Pixel phones. Starting January 12, fans can look forward to discounts and improved trade-in deals on the Pixel 9 Pro and the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL through the Google Store, depending on whether the Google Store operates in your country — you’ll need to check to confirm. While the exact details of these offers haven’t been revealed yet, more information is expected to come soon. This partnership gives Google a massive platform to show off the Pixel’s top-tier camera and AI features. With millions of folks tuning in to the Australian Open, Google is betting that the combination of on-site experiences and exclusive deals will help boost Pixel’s popularity.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

53e24afb-9b2a-48e2-b452-8e164f25d215,"Acer Swift Edge 16 review: Good performance but at the cost of battery life Laptops with a large screen are often bulky. Acer Swift Edge 16 is not. But this reduction in its heft and weight also comes at a cost as we find in this Acer Swift Edge 16. And no, by cost we do not mean its price. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/acer-swift-edge-16-review-good-performance-but-at-the-cost-of-battery-life-2658716-2025-01-02,"We are a big of light and compact laptops over here at India Today Tech. But as much as we love the 13-inchers, there is no denying that when it comes to work, a bigger screen almost always makes a difference. It’s just so much better to work on a larger laptop. This is probably the reason why the Acer Swift Edge 16 exists — it is a laptop that aims to give users a mix of large-laptop power with the low weight and slim design of a compact machine. And it is incredible how well it succeeds on this particular count.  But success — and there is always a but whenever we are reviewing something — comes at a cost. And by cost we don’t mean the price of the Swift Edge 16. Instead, its design — petite and lightweight as it is — also means a downgrade in certain other aspects of the machine. In other words, the Swift Edge 16 is a laptop where you gain some, and lose some.   To put it another way: The Acer Swift Edge 16 is a 16-inch laptop that not only promises a large OLED screen but is also fairly powerful, featuring the AMD Ryzen 7 chipset with a graphics card. To my surprise, despite its size and plenty of ports — which, by the way, seems to be a deal-breaker for many laptops nowadays that come with just 2 or 3 ports — the Swift Edge 16 is lightweight. In fact, it feels lighter compared to the 13-inch MacBook Air. And the figures reveal why. It weighs just 1.23 kilograms! However, as much as I like the display, the performance, and the portability that the Swift Edge 16 offers, there are some areas that are really off-putting. But first a quick look at its specifications. The Acer Swift Edge 16 that I am reviewing is powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 7840U, a chipset with 8 cores and 16 threads. It comes with a maximum boost speed of 5.1 GHz and the U in its model number indicates that it is an ultra-power-efficient chip.  The laptop comes with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM (5200 MHz) and includes AMD Radeon graphics. Although this graphics chip is Radeon 780M, which is basically an integrated graphics chip with 512MB dedicated video RAM. In other words, while this GPU chip is better than some other chips in slim and petite laptops, you won’t be playing demanding games like the latest Call of Duty at high graphics and FullHD on it.  For storage, the Swift Edge 16 is equipped with a 512GB NVMe SSD. And as its name suggests, the Swift Edge 16 features a 16-inch OLED display offering 3.2K resolution and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.Design and display  The Acer Swift Edge 16, despite being a full-size laptop, is surprisingly lightweight. I carried it every day to work and was easily able to carry it without any hassle in not just my backpack but also in my tote bag. In fact, I found it to be lighter than a 15-inch MacBook Air. However, while its lightweight design is its highlight, what impressed me more about the Swift Edge 16 is its inclusion of multiple ports. You see, one thing I absolutely hate about compact machines is the trend of manufacturers removing ports. For instance, even on premium laptops like MacBooks — which are undoubtedly powerful — you often get as few as two USB-C ports. That's it. This makes carrying a port extender almost essential – and for many users more hassling. However, the Swift Edge 16 has two full-size and high-speed USB-A ports, one HDMI port, two USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD card reader. The ports make the user experience better. 
 


 That said, as handy and lightweight as the Swift Edge 16 is, there's a significant drawback: the build quality. It seems that in making the laptop lightweight, some compromises were made in the build quality. The chassis — made of aluminium alloy — uses somewhat thin sheets of metal and feels a bit plasticky. There is very little heft to the laptop and if you tap on it, it makes a hollow sound. Compared to something like a MacBook, I found the metal and feel of the Swift Edge 16 noticeably inferior. It is also, I find, more prone to scratches. In other words, you do get a magically lightweight laptop in Swift Edge 16 but it comes at a cost. 
 


 I also find that the trackpad, for a laptop this big, was on the smaller side and it too feels a little plasticky to touch. On the other hand, I found the keyboard tactile, and I really enjoyed working on it. While the laptop ships with Windows 11, it does not include the dedicated Copilot key. While this isn't an issue, it does make the Swift Edge 16 feel a bit dated compared to its competitors which include this quick button to access the AI chatbot.
 


 Now the display. It is, in my opinion, the best feature of the Swift Edge 16. The 16-inch OLED screen of the Acer Swift Edge shows crisp and bright visuals while effectively minimising reflections despite its glossy finish. I spent hours working on it and even watching Netflix and YouTube, and the display consistently provided me with vibrant colours and comfortable viewing angles. Even in the bright office lights, or on my work desk when the sun was filtering in, I was able to work without straining my eyes. All in all, while the laptop impresses with its lightweight design, abundance of ports, and bright OLED display, the build quality is a letdown.Good performance, bad battery  The Swift Edge 16 runs on the AMD Ryzen 7 chipset, which is a fairly decent processor. For over two weeks I worked on the laptop for almost 9 hours daily, using various applications, including our content management system, Word processors, web browsers and apps for  image editing and AI. Not once did the laptop lag or slow me down. In fact, even after long working hours and binge watching sessions on YouTube and other OTT apps afterwards, the laptop maintained its performance without heating up — although that was not the case while charging but more on that shortly.  To get some performance numbers and put the words in a context, I ran Cinebench on the Swift Edge 16 and the laptop scored 579 points on multi-core CPU tests and 99 points on single-core. The score makes the Swift Edge 16 a decently powerful laptop, though not exceptionally powerful. However, this machine is not designed for gaming and I am not expecting it to do well in that area — for regular work, it handles everything quite smoothly.
 


 The feature I liked while using the Swift Edge 16 is the inclusion of a fingerprint scanner, integrated with the power button. While the laptop also supports facial recognition, I personally find the fingerprint lock quicker and more reliable. Now, let's talk about the speakers. They are bottom-firing, which means that while the laptop is placed on a table, you can listen to the sound clearly. However, if you're lying in bed and streaming content with the laptop on your lap, the speaker placement means the sound gets muffled. Additionally, the speakers are not  particularly loud and tend to sound slightly squeaky when played at maximum volume. This is another area where I believe the emphasis on the size, weight and slimness of the laptop was prioritised by Acer because a better set of speakers would have invariably added more weight and heft to the machine.  As a result, most of the time, I preferred using external speakers while watching any movie.  Another significant drawback of the Swift Edge 16 for me is its battery life. And again, I believe, the reason is that the Swift Edge 16 puts weight and slimness ahead of a bigger and weightier battery. Battery life, to put it bluntly, is not good at all. In the office, where I work for 8 to 9 hours, I had to charge the laptop 2 to 3 times. It's like every 3 to 4 hours I ended up looking for the charger.  And whenever the laptop was on charging, the fans made a lot of noise. Charging made the laptop’s underbelly heat noticeable. And because the laptop uses a rather thin sheet of metal in its shell this noise was fairly audible. On charging, the Swift Edge 16 whooshed and whooshed. Acer Swift Edge 16 review: Should you buy it? I believe the idea is good: The Acer Swift Edge 16 is a laptop with large — and superb by all measures — screen and fairly capable hardware. And yet it is light as a feather at a weight of just 1.23 kilograms. Usually laptops with 16-inch screen weight around 1.60 to 1.70 kilograms, and that is if they are sleek and slim. So, the idea sure is nice.  But it looks like there is no defeating the laws of physics. If you want a large laptop that is light and slim apparently you do need to compromise on certain aspects. I just don’t like how much of a compromise the Swift Edge 16 does on aspects like battery life and build quality. 
The Swift Edge 16 is not a bad machine — it excels with its display and its performance is fantastic for office and regular work. But its fair share of shortcomings hold it back, particularly in a segment where prices are premium and expectations of consumers are sky high.

Despite being a budget offering, the Moto G05 comes with features that are usually reserved for phones priced under Rs 25,000. With Flipkart confirming key specifications and design details ahead of the official launch, it shows that Motorola aims to shake up the budget segment and give tough competition to Xiaomi’s Redmi A and C series. The Moto G04 was launched at Rs 6,999 and its successor, the Moto G05, is expected to cost around Rs 10,000 because of the big upgrades that it is set to receive. This new model is packed with features like a 90Hz display boasting 1,000 nits of peak brightness, Dolby Atmos sound, a vegan leather finish, water touch technology for using the screen with wet hands, and the latest Android OS with a promise of two years of updates.

Its standout feature is water touch technology, which will allow users to interact with the screen even when wet. The phone’s IP52 rating will likely offer better durability by safeguarding it from minor water exposure. One of the more surprising elements is the inclusion of a vegan leather back panel, a rarity in this price range. This not only gives the Moto G05 a premium aesthetic but also offers a solid grip. Available in Green and Red, the phone features a side-mounted fingerprint scanner and a raised camera island for a modern look. Internally, the Moto G05 is powered by the MediaTek Helio G81 Extreme chipset, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, with support for virtual RAM technology.

A preliminary settlement was filed on Tuesday night in the Oakland, California federal court, and requires approval by US District Judge Jeffrey White. Mobile device owners complained that Apple routinely recorded their private conversations after they activated Siri unintentionally, and disclosed these conversations to third parties such as advertisers. Voice assistants typically react when people use ""hot words"" such as ""Hey, Siri."" Two plaintiffs said their mentions of Air Jordan sneakers and Olive Garden restaurants triggered ads for those products. Another said he got ads for a brand name surgical treatment after discussing it, he thought privately, with his doctor. The class period runs from September 17, 2014 to December 31, 2024. It began when Siri incorporated the ""Hey, Siri"" feature that allegedly led to the unauthorised recordings. Class members, estimated in the tens of millions, may receive up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, such as iPhones and Apple Watches. Apple denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. The Cupertino, California-based company and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to similar requests. They may seek up to $28.5 million in fees, plus $1.1 million for expenses, from the settlement fund. The $95 million is about nine hours of profit for Apple, whose net income was $93.74 billion in its latest fiscal year. A similar lawsuit on behalf of users of Google's Voice Assistant is pending in the San Jose, California federal court, in the same district as the Oakland court. The plaintiffs are represented by the same law firms as in the Apple case. The case is Lopez et al v.

After months of waiting, OnePlus’ upcoming flagship smartphone will officially launch worldwide on January 7. For those who don’t know, the OnePlus 13 made its first appearance in October, followed by the OnePlus Ace 5 aka the OnePlus 13R, which was released just before 2024 wrapped up. Both models have been getting a lot of attention, but now there’s something else for fans to look forward to — new accessories. And these aren’t your regular cases and covers. If the latest leaks are accurate, OnePlus will bring something fresh to the table. According to Sudhanshu Ambhore on X, the OnePlus 13 series cases come with new features and fresh materials. What caught everyone’s eye is that these cases are magnetic, which at first, doesn’t sound groundbreaking, but let’s break it down. Considering these cases are from the company itself, they should snap onto the phone effortlessly and work with other magnetic accessories, like chargers and mounts. Similar to how MagSafe cases work on iPhones with wireless chargers and mounts.

 Speaking of wireless charging, you’ll be happy to know that these magnetic cases are expected to be compatible with Qi2 chargers. Qi2 is the next big thing in wireless charging, offering a more reliable and efficient experience. But the benefits of magnetic cases don’t stop there. They can also work with other handy add-ons, like grips, straps, wallets, car mounts, and desk stands. 
As for the design, OnePlus seems to be sticking to materials that fans already love. Leaks suggest these cases will come in Sandstone, Aramid Fiber, and Wood Grain finishes. If you’ve been a OnePlus fan for a while, you’ll probably recognise these textures, as the brand has used them in the past. But coming back to the magnetic properties of the cases, it’s interesting to see how the Android world is catching up with Apple’s MagSafe. Apple has been offering magnetic accessories for years, with the iPhone 12 from 2020 being the first iPhone to support the new MagSafe wireless charger introduced at the time. However, it’s good to see brands like OnePlus stepping up with their own take on magnetic wireless charging all while aligning with the Qi2 standards.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

But, the recent rumour claims that 2026 might end this pattern by bringing Samsung for the role. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-might-replace-sonys-camera-sensor-on-iphones-2659022-2025-01-03,"Apple has been using Sony's camera sensor for the longest period of time. However, lately, rumours have started churning claiming this might change soon. Last year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that with the iPhone 18 (set to release in 2026), the Sony camera sensor pattern might change. And now, a new leak backs this story. The most recent report indicates that Samsung is developing a 3-layer stacked camera sensor for Apple, which is expected to enhance the performance of upcoming iPhone cameras.advertisementSamsung camera sensor for iPhone 18 The leakster, @Jukanlosreve, took to X (formerly Twitter), claiming that Samsung will replace the Sony camera sensors. He said that Samsung is currently working on a 3-layer stacked image sensor for Apple. 
 


Samsung is said to be planning a three-layer configuration for its processor, stacked against the sensor. The mention of a PD-TR-Logic setup refers to the following layers: Photodiode layer (PD), Transfer layer (TR), and the Logic layer.

 Samsung is said to be planning a three-layer configuration for its processor, stacked against the sensor. The mention of a PD-TR-Logic setup refers to the following layers: Photodiode layer (PD), Transfer layer (TR), and the Logic layer.  The Photodiode layer initially captures light, while the Transfer layer is responsible for reducing noise—this aspect is reportedly new in Samsung's sensor. Finally, the Logic layer handles the computational photography of the iPhone. Similarly, Kuo has also claimed something similar. He said that Samsung was expected to make at least one of the sensors for the iPhone 18 in 2026. He added, ""Samsung is expected to begin shipping 1/2.6-inch 48MP ultra-wide CMOS image sensors (CIS) to Apple for iPhones as early as 2026, breaking Sony’s years-long monopoly on supplying CIS to Apple. To this end, Samsung has established a dedicated team to serve Apple."" iPhone 18: What do we know so far The recent leaks claim that Apple is aiming to bring a bezel-less display for at least one model of the iPhone 18 series.  This would mean the entire front of the phone would feature a smooth, continuous display without any visible bezels or edges. Although Apple took steps towards this idea with the iPhone X in 2017, advancements since then have been slow, with smaller bezels but no full removal.  Another leak suggests that the iPhone 18 series will be the one to step into the foldable phone universe.  iPhone 18 should debut in 2026, but there is no official notification so far.

Now, fresh rumours suggest Samsung is doubling down on this feature for its next flagship, the Galaxy S25 Ultra.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/galaxy-s25-ultra-rumoured-to-feature-corning-gorilla-armor-2-with-improved-anti-reflective-coating-2659075-2025-01-03,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, launched in January 2024, introduced Corning's new Gorilla Armor glass, touted as the toughest Gorilla Glass at the time. This advanced glass not just stood out for its impressive protection against drops and scratches, but also its anti-reflective coating, making the S24 Ultra’s screen the least reflective in smartphone history. For users, this was a disruptor, improving visibility and usability, especially outdoors. Now, fresh rumours suggest Samsung is doubling down on this feature for its next flagship. According to Ice Universe, a reliable leaker on X (formerly Twitter), the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra will be the first and only phone to use Corning’s second-generation Gorilla Glass Armor. The new version is expected to retain the anti-reflective properties that made the S24 Ultra unique but may take things even further with better durability and enhanced reflection reduction. If true, this could further solidify Samsung’s reputation for leading display technology.

 For the unaware, anti-reflective coatings might not sound exciting at first. But the difference they make is easy to spot. Just put the S24 Ultra next to any other smartphone, and you'll notice how much less glare and reflection there is on Samsung’s flagship. This isn’t just about aesthetics — it’s a practical feature too. Less reflection means the screen looks brighter without needing to crank up the brightness levels. This is great for saving battery life, and it’s a big help for anyone who struggles with glare, whether due to sunlight or sensitivity to light. The same could be true for the Galaxy S25 Ultra if this rumour pans out. While specific details about the second-generation Gorilla Glass Armor haven’t been confirmed, it’s safe to assume that Corning will have refined its formula to make the new glass even tougher and more effective at reducing reflections. 
Samsung has been leaning into unique selling points like this to set its flagship phones apart. While competitors focus on megapixels and fast charging, Samsung seems determined to give users practical advantages they can see and feel. For the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the inclusion of improved Gorilla Glass Armor could be one such edge. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to launch on 22nd January 2025, though Samsung hasn’t officially announced the date yet. Rumours suggest that the S25 Ultra will drop the boxy look of the S24 Ultra in favour of slight curves around the corners. The phone is also expected to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset under the hood, and may also come with a 16GB RAM option for the first time on a flagship Samsung smartphone.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

1f027bff-20e5-4234-a724-80de4e4c2720,"Telegram introduces third-party verification to combat scams on the platformTelegram has recently announced a plethora of new features, including third-party verification that aims to curb scams on the platform. This comes after the application and CEO Pavel Durov were charged in September 2024. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/telegram-introduces-a-third-party-verification-to-curb-scams-on-the-platform-2659064-2025-01-03,"Telegram, a global messaging platform, has unveiled a third-party verification system to enhance security and transparency. This initiative is designed to combat scams and reduce misinformation, addressing longstanding concerns over the platform's misuse by bad actors. In recent years, Telegram has faced criticism for its vulnerability to fraudulent activities, including phishing schemes, fake investment channels, cyber-bullying, and more. But now, the company has a new verification system that allows public figures and organisations to obtain verified badges, enabling users to quickly identify legitimate sources of information. In order to enhance transparency, Telegram now supports official third-party services that can assign additional verification icons to user accounts and chats. This decentralised approach introduces a proactive solution to prevent scams, setting a new standard for safety on social platforms. This system operates independently of Telegram's existing verification process. Instead of the traditional blue checkmark, accounts and chats verified through third-party services will feature a distinct icon displayed to the left of their name. By clicking on the profile of a third-party verified account or chat, users can view details about the verifying service and the reasons for the verification.
 


 Verified accounts will be clearly marked, providing users with confidence in their authenticity. This feature is expected to benefit businesses, influencers, and public entities, ensuring secure and trustworthy interactions. The platform will also include enhanced reporting tools for flagging suspicious accounts, strengthening its efforts to mitigate fraudulent activity. 
 


 The update follows recent challenges for Telegram, including the arrest of CEO Pavel Durov by French authorities over allegations of enabling illegal activity on the platform. In response, Telegram has revised its privacy policy, disabled features prone to misuse, and adopted a more proactive stance on moderation. Durov also revealed that Telegram achieved profitability last year, with total revenue exceeding $1 billion.   In addition to the verification update, Telegram is introducing several new features. These include advanced search filters to simplify finding specific chats, the ability to scan QR codes using the app’s built-in camera on both iOS and Android, and a feature that allows users to convert digital gifts into NFTs. Telegram stated in its blog, ""The search bar in your chat list lets you quickly find messages from any of your chats. Results in the 'Chats' tab now have extra filters that let you refine the list to show results only from private chats, group chats or channels.""  Along with these features, the company has also announced that Telegram's profitability in 2024 was driven by its Premium subscriptions, privacy-conscious ads, and Telegram Stars.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  Government denies claims that IT dept accesses DigiYatra data to check for tax evasionAlso read |  Apple to pay $95 million to settle Siri privacy lawsuitAlso read |  Blinkit starts ambulance service, says within 10 minutes of booking it will send ambulance

While there’s been plenty of buzz around the Pro model, details about the standard Poco X7 have been harder to come by. Now, courtesy of a Geekbench listing, we’ve got a closer look at what the vanilla Poco X7 might bring to the table. According to a leaked Geekbench listing, the Poco X7 scored 1,032 points in single-core tests and 2,926 in multi-core. The phone is powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 7300 Ultra processor, which is paired with 8GB of RAM in the prototype tested. These numbers suggest decent performance, especially for a mid-range device, though the final retail version could offer other memory options as well.  The software side of things might disappoint some fans, though. The Poco X7 is expected to ship with HyperOS atop Android 14, even though Android 15 has been available for a few months now. This was also the case with the recently launched Poco M7 Pro. You can read our review here. The model spotted on Geekbench is the version heading to India, carrying the model number 24095PCADI. For those familiar with Xiaomi’s naming patterns, the “I” at the end confirms it’s intended for the Indian market. Certification listings in various regions had already hinted at the Poco X7’s arrival, and now this benchmark gives us a better idea of what to expect under the hood. The Poco X7 Pro, on the other hand, has garnered more attention in the run-up to the launch. It’s believed to be a rebranded version of the Redmi Turbo 4, which was recently unveiled in China. If that’s the case, the Pro model will likely feature a more powerful chipset and other premium features, leaving the standard Poco X7 to serve as a more budget-friendly option. Based on the official promotional materials shared by Poco on X (formerly Twitter), we have a clear idea of the design for both the Poco X7 and X7 Pro. The Poco X7 is set to feature a triple-lens setup on the back, while the X7 Pro will sport a dual-lens configuration. Additionally, both devices are expected to feature a striking two-tone design, combining yellow and black colours. With just a few days to go until the big reveal, it’ll be interesting to see how Poco positions the X7 and X7 Pro. For now, the Geekbench listing gives us a small glimpse of what’s coming, and fans of the Poco brand have reason to be excited.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Here is what Apple is likely to launch in 2025 Apple is rumoured to launch a new budget iPhone, possibly named iPhone 16e, in 2025, instead of the anticipated iPhone SE 4. The device is expected to feature design and performance upgrades including A18 series chip, first in-house modem chip and more. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se4-or-iphone-16e-here-is-what-apple-is-likely-to-launch-in-2025-2659108-2025-01-03,"Rumors about the possible iPhone SE 4 have been swirling for months, with reports from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggesting a launch by the end of March 2025 or early April. While these reports support the possibility of Apple releasing a new budget iPhone, some suggest that the Cupertino-based company might not launch the iPhone SE 4 at all but introduce a device named the iPhone 16e instead. According to a recent post by Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter), the leaker revealed that the so-called iPhone SE 4 might debut as the iPhone 16e. This aligns with Apple’s potential plan to tie the budget smartphone to its flagship iPhone 16 lineup, which includes the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max. Majin Bu is not the only source hinting at this name change. Just a few days ago, Chinese leaker Fixed Focus Digital shared similar insights on Weibo, adding weight to the claim and pointing to a strategic branding shift. However, it should be noted that Apple has not confirmed this name change, nor has the company provided any hints about the upcoming launch. So, will it be the iPhone SE 4, the successor to the iPhone SE 3, or the newly named iPhone 16e? Only the official launch will confirm. Meanwhile, regarding specifications, numerous rumors and renders suggest that the new affordable iPhone will bring significant changes compared to its predecessor.iPhone SE 4 design inspired by iPhone 14 Reports indicate that the iPhone SE 4—or iPhone 16e—will feature a design refresh. Ditching the dated iPhone 8-inspired look, the SE is expected to adopt a design similar to the iPhone XR or iPhone 14. This includes a 6.06-inch OLED display, a major upgrade from the 4.7-inch LCD screen found on the iPhone SE 3. The shift to OLED will offer users richer colours and deeper contrasts. Another major design change rumoured for the iPhone SE 4 is the elimination of the Touch ID home button. Instead, it is expected to feature Face ID, aligning it with Apple’s flagship devices and enhancing security. Apple may also slim down the bezels on the iPhone SE 4 for a more immersive user experience.Powered by the A18 series chip Under the hood, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to run on Apple’s latest A18 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM—double that of its predecessor. This hardware upgrade promises not only a powerful performance boost but also support for Apple Intelligence features, including advanced AI and machine learning applications. The phone is also likely to include 128GB of base storage to meet modern user needs. Additionally, the iPhone SE 4 is rumoured to be the first Apple device to use the company’s in-house 5G modem, reducing reliance on Qualcomm Snapdragon modems.Big camera upgrades The iPhone SE 4 is also expected to see significant camera upgrades. Rumours suggest it will feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, a substantial improvement over the 12-megapixel camera on the iPhone SE 3. This enhanced sensor, combined with a Fusion lens, is anticipated to deliver high-quality images and improved 2x zoom capabilities.Pricing and availability in India Despite the upgrades, pricing rumours suggest the iPhone SE 4 could debut at around $500 in the U.S. (approximately Rs 42,700), according to a report by a Korean outlet citing a Japanese carrier. This aligns with Apple’s strategy of keeping the device affordable while offering substantial improvements. For comparison, the iPhone SE 3 launched in India at Rs 43,900. Given the typical price gap between India and the U.S., the iPhone SE 4 could be priced between Rs 49,900 and Rs 53,900 in India.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  Blinkit starts ambulance service, says within 10 minutes of booking it will send ambulanceAlso Read |  Acer Swift Edge 16 review: Good performance but at the cost of battery lifeAlso Read |  Huawei launches Watch GT5 Pro in India, comes with ECG and up to 14 days battery life

c15a5f9e-1320-4a9c-84e1-1b77e2b22535,Brushing scam now makes buzz as it targets online shoppers: everything you need to knowA new online scam known as the 'Brushing Scam' is targeting unsuspecting online shoppers by sending unsolicited packages and posting fake reviews. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/brushing-scam-now-makes-buzz-as-it-targets-online-shoppers-everything-you-need-to-know-2659172-2025-01-03,"We all love online shopping. It’s convenient, time-saving, and often helps you get the best deals and discounts. However, as many people are busy making their purchases online, scammers are also looking for ways to trick them for personal gain. You see, most of us rely on product reviews and ratings to decide whether to buy something from an e-commerce site. And reportedly scammers are manipulating reviews and faking popularity to generate fake sales in a new scam called the ""Brushing Scam."" Brushing scam is a deceptive online practice in which scammers send fake products to people and then post reviews under their names online. The term “brushing” originates from Chinese e-commerce practices where sellers increase their product ratings by creating fake orders and reviews. The scam involves sellers sending unsolicited packages to random users of e-commerce sites. These packages often contain cheap, low-quality items such as costume jewelry, small gadgets, or even seeds. Once the package is delivered, the scammers write 5 star  reviews using the recipient’s name on the product page in order to boost the product's visibility and fake popularity on platforms like Amazon and AliExpress. According to the McAfee report, this scam is aimed at manipulating sales figures and creating an illusion of quality and demand for products on e-commerce sites. For legitimate buyers, this practice is misleading, leading them to make purchases based on fake reviews rather than genuine customer feedback. But if users are getting free products, how harmful can it really be? Well, through this scam scammers are exploiting your sensitive data and can even steal your money if you do not take precautions.  As mentioned, scammers are boosting the popularity of products by sending unsolicited parcels, using the names and addresses of unsuspecting e-commerce users. And they are able to obtain this information through data breaches or illegal purchases of personal data. Receiving such a package could indicate that your personal information has been compromised, posing significant risks such as identity theft and other privacy violations. Beyond identity theft and misleading reviews, a report by ABC Action News reveals that many unsolicited packages now include QR codes urging recipients to scan them. Scammers use enticing messages like, “Scan this QR code to leave a review and win a $500 gift card.” Scanning these QR codes can lead to malicious websites designed to steal sensitive information or install malware on your device. The stolen personal data can then be used for financial fraud or phishing attacks.How to protect yourself from brushing scams To safeguard yourself from brushing scams and avoid receiving fraudulent parcels: Do not scan random QR codes: Avoid scanning QR codes included in unsolicited packages, especially from unknown senders. Protect your e-commerce account: Update your login credentials on e-commerce platforms and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. Report the incident: If you receive such a package, report it to the e-commerce platform and local authorities.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  iPhone SE4 or iPhone 16e?

Sanders’ statement comes amid a heated debate over using the H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire skilled workers from abroad. In a statement released on Thursday, Sanders, a long-time advocate for workers’ rights, said Musk’s support for the H-1B visa program is not about filling a talent gap but rather about reducing labour costs. The influential US politician also argued that major companies like Tesla are using the program to replace well-paying American jobs with cheaper labour from countries like India. He added that this undermines local workers and benefits billionaires. ""Elon Musk is wrong,"" Sanders posted on X. ""The H-1B visa program’s primary purpose is not to bring in the best and the brightest, but to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage labour from abroad,"" he added. Sanders called for reforms to the program so that American workers are not displaced.
 


 Musk, who has long defended the use of H-1B visas, recently stated that there is a shortage of highly skilled tech workers in the US, making foreign talent essential for companies like Tesla and SpaceX. He highlights that many of the engineers who have helped build these companies came to the US through the H-1B program. However, Sanders countered this argument, pointing out that Tesla laid off over 7,500 American workers earlier this year, despite continuing to employ H-1B visa holders. Sanders further questioned Tesla's hiring practices, noting that some H-1B visa holders were employed in roles like associate accountants and mechanical engineers with salaries that do not reflect the highly specialised positions Musk claims the program is meant for. Sanders claimed that such positions should be filled by qualified American workers first. The debate over the H-1B program has intensified in recent weeks, with political figures like Laura Loomer and Steve Bannon criticising the program for not prioritising American workers. Meanwhile, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a close ally of Musk, has defended the need for foreign workers, arguing that the US must improve its education system to produce a highly skilled workforce capable of filling these roles. Musk has also made it clear that he supports the H-1B visa program because the US is facing a shortage of top-tier engineering talent. Former President Donald Trump also weighed in, expressing support for H-1B visas, saying that the US needs to attract smarter individuals to strengthen its economy.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 3, 2025

But is it truly a disruptive force in the market, or is there more to the story?",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/snapdragon-8-elite-for-just-rs-55000-is-iqoo-13-too-good-to-be-true-2659291-2025-01-03,"Among all the latest flagship phones that have arrived or are yet to arrive, the iQOO 13 stands tall, especially when you factor in — price to performance ratio. For starters, this phone retails in the sub-Rs 60,000 price segment in India. But, don’t let the price fool you, because this phone has every ingredient to make it go toe-to-toe with premium offerings from the house of Apple and Samsung. The base variant of this phone with ample 12GB RAM and 256GB storage is priced at Rs 54,999. It packs the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset — the very same processor expected to power the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 series. At first glance, the iQOO 13 seems almost too good to be true, a flagship device at a price that undercuts its competitors by tens of thousands. But is it truly a disruptive force in the market, or is there more to the story? Let’s start with the elephant in the room — performance. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s top-tier offering, promising blazing-fast performance, good energy efficiency, and superior AI processing capabilities compared to the 8 Gen 3 chip. On the iQOO 13, this processor is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. So, whether you’re gaming, multitasking, or pushing the phone to its limits with resource-heavy apps, the iQOO 13 handles it all effortlessly. And this is where the comparison with the Galaxy S25 series becomes interesting. Samsung’s next-gen flagship is rumoured to feature the same Snapdragon 8 Elite, but the base model might start at around Rs 80,000, with the Ultra variant expected to stretch past Rs 1.5 lakh. The question naturally arises — why pay almost double for essentially the same core performance?  Of course, raw power isn’t the only metric for a great smartphone. Features like display quality, cameras, battery life, and design matter just as much. Here, the iQOO 13 doesn’t disappoint. Its 6.82-inch AMOLED display, with a stunning 144Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 4,500 nits, is a visual treat. Watching videos, scrolling through social media, or gaming feels buttery smooth. While devices like the Galaxy S25 Ultra are expected to offer similarly impressive displays, they don’t have a significant edge — at least not enough to justify such a stark price difference. Then there’s the camera setup. The iQOO 13 comes with a triple-camera system featuring three 50-megapixel sensors. In an age where many phone manufacturers have moved to Sony’s LYTIA sensors, the iQOO 13 sticks to the Sony IMX921 sensor for the main camera. For what it’s worth, this phone can also shoot up to 8K videos. Even the 32-megapixel front-facing camera, which supports 4K video recording, punches above its weight. For instance, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and its camera setup headlined by a 200-megapixel primary snapper, might win on sheer numbers, or to be honest, even in most scenarios when it comes to photography. But how much of a difference will this make for the average user? Most of us post photos on social media, and the iQOO 13’s camera is more than capable of delivering eye-catching shots.  Battery life and charging are other areas where the iQOO 13 shines. There’s a massive 6,150mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of heavy use. Even better, the 120W fast charging — and yes, you get the 120W charging brick in the box — means you can go from zero to full charge in about 30 minutes. For someone like me who’s always on the go, this kind of fast charging is a lifesaver. This kind of fast charging is also one of the prime reasons why OnePlus 12 was my daily driver in 2024, as opposed to the likes of Galaxies or iPhones. But, coming back to the iQOO 13, and what truly sets it apart, though, is how it packs in premium features without cutting corners. You get stereo speakers, an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner, connectivity options like Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4, and IP68 water and dust resistance — you name the features, and it is probably there on the iQOO 13. All this while managing to include a sleek, durable design, with glass on the back and a shiny aluminium frame. These are features that many high-end flagships talk about, yet iQOO offers them at a relatively lower price point. Now, all of this raises an important question — why does the iQOO 13 cost so much less for a flagship phone? Of course, one might suspect that something is missing, but after using the device for a while, I have honestly struggled to find any major compromises. Perhaps the answer lies in iQOO’s aggressive pricing strategy, which was the case with the iQOO 12 as well. By offering top-tier specs at an accessible price, iQOO is clearly aiming to disrupt the dominance of Samsung, Apple, or even the likes of OnePlus. Of course, no phone is perfect. The iQOO 13 lacks the extensive ecosystem integration that brands like Samsung and Apple excel at. If you’re someone who’s deeply embedded in the Galaxy ecosystem with devices like the Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Buds, a high-end Samsung Galaxy might still make more sense for you. Similarly, Apple’s ecosystem is a whole different ballgame, and the iPhone’s seamless connectivity with Macs, iPads, and AirPods is something that has been hard for brands like even Samsung to replicate, let alone iQOO.  So, is the iQOO 13 too good to be true? Well, for those who prioritise value for money, the iQOO 13 is worth consideration. It challenges the notion that a flagship smartphone must cost upwards of Rs 80,000. This device is a clear example that you can still buy a flagship smartphone with top-notch features without burning a hole in your pocket.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  iQOO 13 review: Flagship phone at not-so-flagship priceAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and moreAlso read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

f25f8c83-26a6-41b7-a4a3-d994cb2fb4be,"Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0 review: Good looks, average sound The Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0 evokes nostalgia. Its vintage design feels like it has traveled straight from the past. But as a speaker it must deliver more than just good looks — and on the sound it struggles to the right note.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/swiss-military-retro-classic-10-review-good-looks-average-sound-2659372-2025-01-03,"Swiss Military speaker? Yes, they do make them along with the outdoor gear like rugged bags. This is a brand that is well recognised, albeit not for its gadgets. This made me particularly excited about reviewing the Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0. This excitement only grew when I took it out of the box and its looks instantly transported me back to my childhood when I used to sit beside my grandpa for hours as he tuned into the radio and connected to All India Radio to listen to Ramyun, Geet Mala, and other programs. The wooden design, vintage aesthetics, and most notably the antenna — yes, this vintage speaker comes with an antenna — were enough to start a journey into nostalgia. So, full marks to Retro Classic 1.0 as far as first impressions go.  But then as they say. Don’t go by the looks, let them also speak a few words before you make an impression of someone. Apparently, the same is true for speakers. At the end of the day what matters is how well they sing. And on that count, the Retro Classic 1.0 doesn’t score all that well. While I have reviewed many speakers with a vintage theme, like the Marshall Middleton and another speaker from Boult recently, the Military Retro Classic 1.0 clearly has gotten the vibes right. But you cannot just spend Rs 1,799 bucks solely on the vibes? A speaker has to be a speaker. So, I spent a week trying to figure it out and played hundreds of songs on the Retro Classic 1.0. But before we dive deeper into what it offers, here’s a quick look at the specs. The Retro Classic Wireless Bluetooth speaker features a 10-watt Class D amplifier with versatile connectivity options, including Bluetooth, a 3.5mm jack, USB 2.0, and FM stereo. It also promises up to 6 hours of continuous playback on battery, something that goes in its favour. It's a looker As I said earlier, the Swiss Military Retro Classic stands out because of its design. It features a wooden-box finish with a plasticky mesh on the front of the speaker and an antenna, reminiscent of the old-time radios we used to have at home. The speaker also comes with a wide faux leather strap that makes it easier to carry and, of course, adds an extra vintage touch to the design. For me, though, it’s the antenna that truly stands out. With the new tech and gadgets that don't need a physical antenna to connect with the network, I honestly can’t remember the last time I bought a gadget with an antenna. So, the antenna at the back is definitely what gives the Swiss Military Retro Classic its distinct look and more vintage look.
 


 On the back, this Bluetooth speaker also includes several connectivity options: a USB-C port that can be used for both connecting and charging, a USB port, an SD card slot, and an AUX port. While I really like the design and the availability of so many connectivity ports, the speaker doesn’t look premium. It lacks proper finishing. I understand that with the wooden box finish, the speaker aims for a vintage aesthetic, but the quality of the plastic and wooden frame feels cheap. Additionally, the faux leather strap is not of great quality and I could see the edges of the strap already fraying. 
 


To put it another way, it looks vintage and feels vintage — like something you just pulled out of the attic. But probably too vintage once you take into account the materials, build, and finish. Sounds okay. But just okayThe Swiss Military Retro Classic sounds okay. The audio is clear but lacks depth, and if you like bass-heavy music, or treble, this speaker will disappoint you. Although the volume is decent, making it a good portable speaker to turn on for casual listening. In other words, if you’re looking for a rich music experience, this speaker won’t deliver that.
 


advertisementI tried the other connectivity options, and the most impressive — and worth mentioning — is the FM. Given that even smartphones are phasing out the FM feature, tuning into FM channels like the good old days makes this retro speaker truly fulfils its purpose.However, while the sound didn’t impress me here, the battery life really stood out. With normal use —say 1 to 2 hours a day — the device lasts for about a week. Additionally, it has an auto power-off feature, meaning that if you disconnect your phone but forget to turn off the speaker, it powers itself off to save battery.
 


Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0: should you buy it?If you’re in the market for a budget speaker with a vintage design, the Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0 is worth checking out. Primarily because of how affordable it is. I mean it costs just Rs 1,799. For the price it offers a good design, okay build quality and okay sound. It not only features a retro look but also includes functional features like FM and design elements such as the antenna that make it feel like a classic FM radio from the past.Additionally, the speaker offers impressive battery life and a range of connectivity options, making it convenient to use with various devices. But do keep in mind its sound quality. That is unlikely to delight anyone, which makes it difficult for me to fully recommend Retro Classic 1.0. There are other speakers in the market in a similar price range which might be boring looking but they deliver a somewhat meatier sound.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  Brushing scam now makes buzz as it targets online shoppers: everything you need to knowAlso Read |  iPhone SE4 or iPhone 16e?

For Indian customers, the big question is whether the iPhone SE 4 can remain under the Rs 50,000 mark.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-may-cost-more-than-its-predecessor-2659777-2025-01-04,"The iPhone SE 4 is expected to arrive early next year as a follow-up to the iPhone SE (2022), also known as the iPhone SE 3. While Apple hasn’t officially confirmed its plans to launch the next iPhone SE, recent leaks have provided details on what to expect from Apple’s upcoming smartphone. Additionally, a leak from South Korea also suggests that there might be a price hike for the iPhone SE 4.  According to a South Korean blog post, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to cost slightly more than KRW 8,00,000 (roughly Rs 46,000). Globally, the phone is tipped to be priced under $500 (roughly 43,000). An earlier rumour placed its price between $499 (roughly Rs 43,000) and $549 (roughly Rs 47,000. This is a noticeable jump from the launch price of the iPhone SE 3, which debuted at $429 or Rs 43,900 in India. However, after just a few months, the Indian price of the SE 3 rose to Rs 49,900. The iPhone SE 4 is rumoured to borrow its design from the iPhone 14, moving away from the dated look of its predecessor. This means a 6.1-inch OLED display, a notch and the addition of Face ID for unlocking the device. If true, it would be a big step up from the 4.7-inch LCD screen and Touch ID found in the iPhone SE 3. Under the hood, the phone is expected to be powered by Apple’s A18 chip, the same processor that also powers the iPhone 16 models. Additionally, the iPhone SE 4 could also feature 8GB RAM, another big improvement over its predecessor. One of the standout features of the iPhone SE 4 is its rumoured 5G connectivity, powered by Apple’s first in-house 5G modem. Until now, Apple has relied on Qualcomm for its modems, but this move would make the iPhone SE 4 the first phone to use Apple’s own 5G chip. However, this innovation could come with a price increase. For Indian customers, the big question is whether the iPhone SE 4 can remain under the Rs 50,000 mark. With its upgraded features, including a 48-megapixel camera, 6.1-inch OLED display, and a USB-C port for charging, it might be tough for Apple to keep the cost low. If the price starts at Rs 49,900, similar to the revised price of the SE 3, the phone could still appeal to those looking for an affordable iPhone with modern features.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

The latest buzz gives us a closer look at the possible colour options for both the standard Galaxy S25 and the high-end Galaxy S25 Ultra. A new report suggests the Galaxy S25 series will be available in up to seven colours, including a couple of eye-catching blue shades. Images shared by Gizmochina show the Galaxy S25 and S25 Ultra sporting Spigen's Crystal Flex cases. The renders highlight the blue colour variants of the phones, each having slightly different tones. Also, leaks have pointed out that the standard Galaxy S25 could come in a shade called Icy Blue, which sports a deeper shade of blue. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, on the other hand, might sport a more subtle Titanium Blue finish, which is sleek and understated. These colour leaks tie in with earlier details shared by tipster, Ishan Agarwal. He mentioned that the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus might launch in shades like Silver Shadow, Mint, Icy Blue, and Navy. Meanwhile, the Ultra model could feature a more premium palette, including Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium White Silver, and Titanium Silver Blue. While Samsung’s website will likely offer additional colours, it’s worth noting that availability could vary depending on your region.
Beyond colours, the leaks reveal a bit more about the design of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The phone is expected to feature rounded corners and incredibly slim bezels, giving it a sleek appearance. However, it’s important to remember that these are just renders, so the final product might look slightly different. One of the more interesting parts of this leak involves the inclusion of a MagSafe-style ring on the back of the Galaxy S25 series. This addition, visible through the transparent Spigen cases, looks very similar to what we’ve seen on iPhones since the iPhone 12 series. Interestingly, it’s rumoured that the Galaxy S25 series might not support Qi2 wireless charging straight out of the box. Instead, users may need to rely on accessories like the Spigen case to enable this functionality. Again, this mirrors the trends we’ve seen from other Android manufacturers, who are adopting similar approaches. While it’s always wise to take leaks with a pinch of salt, these details give us a good idea of what to expect when the phones officially launch. The Galaxy S25 series is rumoured to launch on January 22. All the phones are expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Oppo claims the phones feature a premium aluminum frame, a sculpted rear panel, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for added protection. Teaser images also emphasize the use of “aerospace-grade aluminum” in the device's construction. The teaser visuals reveal that the Reno 13 series 5G will include a flat display and a triple-camera setup. Compared to its predecessor, the Reno 12, the camera module appears to have undergone a redesign. The rear camera layout features two vertically aligned lenses, accompanied by a third lens placed to the side, forming a triangular arrangement. Additionally, the camera module incorporates an LED flash designed as a ring light, aligning with modern design trends. While details about the Indian variant remain scarce, the Reno 13 series has already debuted in China, offering a glimpse of its possible specifications.

With only a day left before the big event, the company has revealed a few details about the features and upgrades these new devices will bring. Here’s everything we know so far about the OnePlus 13 series, from the design changes to the expected prices. The OnePlus 13 is expected to cost under Rs 70,000 for its base variant, while the OnePlus 13R is likely to launch at under Rs 50,000 altogether. The increase in price for the OnePlus 13 is reportedly due to the higher cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, but we’ll have to wait for the official announcement to confirm the exact figures.  When it comes to design, both the OnePlus 13 and 13R are moving away from the curved displays of their predecessors and adopting flat sides, giving them a fresh look. The familiar circular camera module remains, but the design element that connected the camera bump to the phone’s frame is no longer there. This gives the phones a cleaner and more minimalistic appearance. Another interesting change is that the OnePlus 13 will now come in two finishes — vegan leather and glass. Both versions will offer impressive IP68 and IP69 ratings, ensuring dust and water resistance. However, the more affordable OnePlus 13R will not include the vegan leather finish or the same level of water resistance. In terms of specifications, both phones will pack a massive 6,000mAh battery, promising long-lasting performance, and they will support fast charging. The key difference between the two models lies in the chipset. The OnePlus 13 will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest and greatest — Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13R will feature the last-generation Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is also a strong contender in its own right. Both devices will run on OxygenOS 15, based on Android 15, right out of the box. Software support is another area where both phones may differ. The OnePlus 13 is expected to receive 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security patches, while the OnePlus 13R may get 3 years of Android updates and 4 years of security patches. The camera department also promises a few upgrades. The OnePlus 13 is said to feature a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-808 primary sensor, alongside a 50-megapixel telephoto lens and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. For the OnePlus 13R, rumours suggest a triple-camera setup with a 50-megapixel primary lens, a 50-megapixel telephoto lens, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. If true, this will mark the first time an R-series device includes a telephoto lens.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

This smartphone is said to be the thinnest iPhone ever made, and if the reports are accurate, it has the potential to have a big impact on those who have long wanted a flagship phone with a super-slim profile. According to South Korea’s Sisa Journal, Apple is targeting a thickness of just 6.25mm for the iPhone 17 Air. For context, the iPhone 6, which currently holds the title of Apple’s thinnest phone, measures 6.9mm. The iPhone 17 Air would therefore be around 20 per cent thinner than the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, and about 25 per cent thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. Some rumours have even speculated that the device could end up being as thin as 5mm, though this remains unconfirmed. If the reports hold true, Apple’s new device will replace the iPhone 17 Plus in the lineup, with a similar price point to the iPhone 16 Plus, which starts at $899 (roughly Rs 77,000) in the USA. For fans in the UK, this could mean a starting price of around £899 (roughly Rs 92,000), although official pricing, as well as the India pricing of the phone, won’t be announced until closer to the launch. The design is expected to come with some compromises to achieve such an ultra-thin profile. Most sources agree the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, a single rear camera, and Apple’s own 5G modem. It will reportedly feature the new A19 chip and Dynamic Island, similar to its predecessors, but will have only one rear camera, unlike the dual or triple-camera setups seen on Pro models. The device is also expected to include 8GB of RAM to support Apple’s intelligence features. However, it’s not just Apple making headlines for going thinner. Samsung is also rumoured to be working on its own ultra-thin device, the Galaxy S25 Slim, which could have a thickness in the mid-6mm range. This could set the stage for a head-to-head battle between the two tech titans for the best slim high-end phone of 2025. While the ultra-thin profile of the iPhone 17 Air sounds exciting, some Apple fans might be wondering what features will be sacrificed. A thinner phone often means a smaller battery, and with a single rear camera, photography enthusiasts might find themselves drawn to the Pro models instead. Still, the idea of a phone that’s sleek, light, and easy to slip into a pocket is sure to appeal to many.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

However, with the imminent launch of the OnePlus 13 series, is it a good time to buy a previous generation device? Here are 4 reasons to buy and 1 reason to skip.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oneplus-12r-available-under-rs-40000-4-reasons-to-buy-1-to-skip-2660270-2025-01-06,"OnePlus is currently gearing up for the launch of its new OnePlus 13 series, scheduled for January 7, 2025. Ahead of the new generation of OnePlus flagship phones, the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12R, launched in 2024, are available at discounted prices. For the OnePlus 12R specifically, Amazon is offering the 8GB RAM + 256GB storage variant for as low as Rs 39,999 to select bank card holders. However, with the imminent launch of the OnePlus 13R, is it a good time to invest in the OnePlus 12R now? Here are four reasons to consider getting the discounted OnePlus 12R and one reason to skip the deal altogether.Reason 1: Premium design and vibrant display When we reviewed the OnePlus 12R in 2024—including both the standard and the new Sunset Dune color variant—we were impressed with its design. With its curved design, the OnePlus 12R stood out as sleek and sturdy. In fact, the affordable 12R resembled its flagship siblings. With Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection on the front and an IP64 rating, the device also promises durability. On the front, the phone’s 6.78-inch AMOLED display offers vibrant colors, deep contrasts, and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate.Reason 2: Smooth performance  The OnePlus 12R is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, delivering fast and smooth performance for multitasking and gaming. It can handle graphic-intensive games and demanding apps effortlessly. OnePlus has also included effective heat management to keep the device cool during extended use. Additionally, AI RAM acceleration ensures efficient memory usage, making app-switching seamless. The OxygenOS 14 interface further enhances the user experience with its clean design and minimal bloatware.Reason 3: Long-lasting battery with superfast charging The OnePlus 12R comes with a 5,500mAh battery, providing all-day usage even with heavy tasks. When it’s time to recharge, the 100W SUPERVOOC charging can power the device from 0 to 100 per cent in just 25–30 minutes.Reason 4: Impressive camera performance In our review, we also appreciated the camera performance of the OnePlus 12R. Its 50 megapixel main camera managed to capture detailed and vibrant shots in good lighting conditions. Even in low light, the results are among the best in this price range, capturing well-lit images with minimal noise. While the 8 megapixel ultrawide camera also performs decently in optimal lighting, the 2 megapixel macro lens is more of a secondary addition. With the introduction of the OnePlus 12 Sunset Dune edition, OnePlus also addressed earlier issues with sluggish camera software, making it more reliable for everyday photography.1 Reason to Skip While the OnePlus 12R is undoubtedly a great Android phone and a strong contender in its price range, there is one reason– and a big one — to skip this deal. OnePlus is set to launch the next generation of the OnePlus 13R tomorrow as part of the OnePlus 13 series. The upcoming model is expected to bring significant upgrades in performance, design, and features. Rumors suggest the OnePlus 13R will feature the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor (previously seen in the OnePlus 12 flagship), enhanced cameras, and a more refined design—all priced under Rs 50,000. For users seeking the latest tech and willing to spend a bit more, the OnePlus 13R might be worth waiting for. And with the OnePlus 13R launch, we are expecting more price cut on the OnePlus 12R which will make it more budget friendly.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says AI Agents will join workforce in 2025OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed that AI agents could become part of the workforce by 2025. Here is everything you need to know.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/job-crisis-and-layoffs-openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-ai-agents-will-join-workforce-in-2025-2660314-2025-01-06,"OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) agents could soon join the workforce, potentially in 2025. In a blog post, Altman also discussed the rapid advancements in AI and how the technology is likely to reshape entire industries in the near future. Speaking just over two years after the launch of ChatGPT, Altman noted how quickly AI capabilities have evolved.  ""We’re finally seeing some of the massive potential of AI come to life,"" he said, adding that OpenAI's progress will profoundly impact the global workforce. According to Altman, OpenAI is now confident in its ability to build AGI — artificial general intelligence, which is a more advanced form of AI designed to perform complex tasks traditionally carried out by humans. He suggested that by 2025, AI agents could start becoming integral parts of workplaces to improve productivity and efficiency. This bold prediction comes at a time when many industries face economic uncertainty, with mass layoffs and job insecurities affecting workers worldwide. The idea of AI stepping in to play a more prominent role in the workplace is likely to fuel debates about the future of work and whether AI will create new opportunities or displace human jobs. Altman, however, remains optimistic. He highlighted that AI agents would work alongside human teams rather than replace them, potentially leading to ""material changes"" in how companies operate. The CEO pointed out that as these technologies are introduced, they will gradually be integrated into existing workflows, giving people time to adapt. Despite his optimism, Altman acknowledged that OpenAI's journey hasn't been without its challenges. The company, which started as a quiet research lab in 2015, has grown exponentially, particularly after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. The launch sparked a surge of interest in AI, transforming OpenAI from a relatively unknown entity into one of the biggest names in tech. In the two years since, OpenAI has experienced rapid scaling, a process Altman described as “messy and stressful.” He also alluded to internal tensions, including his sudden firing and reinstatement in 2023, which made headlines around the world. Talking about the incident, Altman said it was a “failure of governance” but believes the company emerged stronger from the ordeal. Looking ahead, Altman envisions AI tools accelerating scientific research and innovation, helping to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems. ""We’re beginning to turn our aim towards superintelligence,"" he said, hinting at even more advanced AI capabilities beyond AGI. As AI agents prepare to enter the workforce, questions about job displacement and the ethical implications of AI will undoubtedly follow. But Altman is confident that OpenAI’s mission to ensure AI benefits all of humanity will guide the company’s future work. It will be interesting to see how the world will react to AI agents taking up positions or jobs in big tech companies.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

aea327d0-2e2c-4c87-9a97-92ea3a3ffb78,"Digital arrest to illegal parcels, here is how Indians are being scammed by cyber criminals On almost daily basis we hear of one scam or other. Indians are increasingly losing money to cyber scams such as ""digital arrest"" and ""illegal parcel delivery"". Here is way to understand these scams, and consequently stay safe. 
",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/digital-arrest-to-illegal-parcels-here-is-how-indians-are-being-scammed-by-cyber-criminals-2660394-2025-01-06,"India is witnessing an alarming rise in online fraud, with cyber scammers employing new and sophisticated tactics to exploit unsuspecting individuals. Every day we hear of one scam or other. Thousands of people have lost lakhs and crores to cyber scammers, who lure their victims under the pretext of work-from-home jobs, updating KYC through links, and in some cases by threatening people with with the so-called ""digital arrest.” To stay safe from these scams, it is more essential than ever to remain vigilant online and not fall for the words of anyone who connects with you online offering easy money or promise of financial assistance. From threatening calls, messages offering easy money-making tactics or investment opportunities through groups, here are some of the most prevalent cyber tactics scammers are using in India to trick people. Digital arrest scam In recent months, you might have come across the term ""Digital Arrest."" This scam uses fear and intimidation to snare people. Victims receive calls from individuals impersonating law enforcement agencies, accusing them of serious crimes such as money laundering or tax evasion. To make their claims appear more credible and threatening, these fraudsters often send forged legal documents and demand immediate payment to ""settle"" the issue and avoid arrest. Through persistent calls or messages, they create panic and leave victims with little time to verify the claims. However there is no such term as ""digital arrest"" in the Indian Penal Code. But people might not know that. To stay safe, never share personal or financial details over unsolicited calls. If you receive such calls, hang up and possibly — if you have time — report the incident to the Cyber Crime Cell.Illegal parcel scam In the illegal parcel scam, scammers take advantage of the current surge in e-commerce deliveries. With online shopping becoming commonplace, scammers pose as courier services or law enforcement officials and call unsuspecting individuals. During their call they threaten them claiming that a package addressed to the victim contains illegal or prohibited items such as drugs or weapons. To add credibility, they may conduct video calls, posing as fake police officers. Further when the individuals fall for the words of the scammers, fraudsters demand payment to ""clear"" the parcel or avoid legal action. Often, scammers send phishing links to collect payments or use urgency to extract sensitive information. To protect yourself, never click on suspicious links. If you receive such calls, contact the courier company’s official customer service.KYC scam Know Your Customer — KYC — scams exploit the routine updates required by banks and mobile service providers. Fraudsters pose as representatives from banks or telecom providers, call unsuspecting individuals and urge them to update their KYC details to avoid service suspension. Victims often receive fake SMS alerts with malicious links or are contacted by phone, where scammers ""assist"" them in the process through an app that actually takes over the phone of the victim and give full access to the scammer. This access is then used by the scammers to open sensitive apps, like a bank or payment app, or to read OTPs.  Once scammers gain access to OTPs or account credentials, they can drain bank accounts or misuse personal information. To stay safe, remember that banks will not call to request OTPs or send links to update KYC. Only update your information through official channels, and never share OTPs or passwords with unknown individuals.Work-from-home scam Work-from-home scams have also surged in recent months, especially with the rise of remote work and the number of people seeking such work. Scammers promise high earnings for simple tasks like liking videos or completing easy assignments. They connect with victims on platforms like Telegram or WhatsApp, offering lucrative opportunities. As victims fall into the trap and begin working, they are asked to pay a registration fee. Initially, small payouts are made, but scammers later demand higher deposits, promising bigger returns. Eventually, when victims try to withdraw their money, the scammers disappear with the deposits. To stay safe, thoroughly research work-from-home platforms, avoid upfront payments, and verify the credibility of companies through official websites or reviews.Emergency call scam Emergency call scams involve fraudsters posing as relatives or acquaintances, claiming to need urgent financial help due to medical emergencies, accidents, or legal troubles. Victims have reported receiving calls from unknown individuals posing as family friends or even fake police officers, claiming a family member is in distress or in hospital and money is immediately required.  Fraudsters often impersonate family members using details gathered from social media and emotionally manipulate victims into transferring money quickly. They typically request payment via digital wallets or gift cards, making the transactions untraceable. To stay safe, always verify the caller's identity by directly contacting the alleged family member or acquaintance.Stock market investment scam The cases of the stock market investment scams are also rising. In this scam, fraudsters target individuals eager to make quick profits. Scammers pose as financial advisors or brokers and connect with victims on platforms like WhatsApp, offering guaranteed high returns on investments. Victims are often lured into joining fake groups where other participants appear to be earning profits, creating a false sense of legitimacy. To trick victims and gain their trust, scammers also create fraudulent apps or websites mimicking legitimate trading platforms. Once victims invest, the scammers cut all contacts with the victims  or manipulate the system to show false losses, urging the victims to invest more to get their money back. To protect yourself, research investment opportunities thoroughly before investment and always verify the credentials of financial advisors.

e32ff672-29d2-4b16-a47e-18dda169ff50,"Redmi 14C quick review: A promising phone under Rs 10,000At a time when there are few under Rs 10,000 phones from big brands, Redmi is bringing the Redmi 14C to India. At a starting price of Rs 9,999, the phone packs a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chip and a 5160mAh battery. And in this quick review of the Redmi 14C we find that it is quite promising.  ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/redmi-14c-quick-review-a-promising-phone-under-rs-10000-2660391-2025-01-06,"After days of teasing, the Redmi 14C has been finally launched in India at a starting price of Rs 9,999. Compared to its predecessor — the Redmi 13C — the new phone brings a lot of upgrades. It comes with a 120Hz bright display, a 5160mAh battery, splash-resistant design, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, a 50-megapixel primary camera and more.  In other words, it is fairly packed with hardware that makes it seem like a Rs 15,000 phone instead of something that you can buy under Rs 10,000. This is also where its appeal is: you see the price of the Redmi 14C starts at Rs 9,999 in India. So, is this a phone to buy under the Rs 10,000 segment? We will have a detailed and definitive answer in the full review of the Redmi 14C. But at a first glance, it sure looks promising. advertisementRedmi 14C: Design and display For a few years now, Redmi has been giving some careful attention to the design patterns, especially for its entry-level segments. We saw it on the Redmi 13C and now the Redmi 14C continues the legacy of a beautiful design language. The smartphone is available in three colours: Starlight Blue, Stardust Purple, and Stargaze Black. I am reviewing the Starlight Blue variant and I love it. The rear panel has a striking ombre effect with silver on the top and blue on the bottom. The back panel features a circular island that houses a dual-camera setup. Although, the island is made to give viewers an illusion that the phone carries a triple-camera setup. Additionally, the camera island doesn’t bulge much, which minimises the wobbliness when the phone is kept on a table.

 



Redmi 14C, the Starlight Blue
The Redmi 14C features a boxy look with a fairly slim body — for the price — of 8.22mm. One of the most striking features of the phone is its screen. It is a large screen, measuring 6.88 inches. But more significantly, it is a screen that comes with 120Hz refresh rate, something that is a rarity in this price segment. So full marks to Redmi on this count. Redmi 14C: Processor and powerThe Redmi 14C is powered by a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset, coupled with 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage. This hardware too, for the price, seems to be a really good deal.  The phone runs on Xiaomi’s HyperOS 14, which is based on Android 14. While the chipset is a little dated, in my limited use so far it performed well enough. It’s been lag-free so far, even while quickly scrolling through Instagram timeline. Regular apps, such as social media apps, and the bundled Chrome browser have been smooth on the Redmi 14C so far. Significantly, even the gaming performance seems to be good enough. I played a few games on the Redmi 14C like Block Blast and they worked smoothly.
 


Inside the phone there is a 5160mAh battery with 18W charging support. Redmi is one of the few brands that still bundle a charger with their phone. The Redmi 14C comes with a 33W in-box charger.

 For a few years now, Redmi has been giving some careful attention to the design patterns, especially for its entry-level segments. We saw it on the Redmi 13C and now the Redmi 14C continues the legacy of a beautiful design language. The smartphone is available in three colours: Starlight Blue, Stardust Purple, and Stargaze Black. I am reviewing the Starlight Blue variant and I love it. The rear panel has a striking ombre effect with silver on the top and blue on the bottom. The back panel features a circular island that houses a dual-camera setup. Although, the island is made to give viewers an illusion that the phone carries a triple-camera setup. Additionally, the camera island doesn’t bulge much, which minimises the wobbliness when the phone is kept on a table.

 



Redmi 14C, the Starlight Blue
 The Redmi 14C features a boxy look with a fairly slim body — for the price — of 8.22mm. One of the most striking features of the phone is its screen. It is a large screen, measuring 6.88 inches. But more significantly, it is a screen that comes with 120Hz refresh rate, something that is a rarity in this price segment. So full marks to Redmi on this count. Redmi 14C: Processor and power The Redmi 14C is powered by a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset, coupled with 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage. This hardware too, for the price, seems to be a really good deal.  The phone runs on Xiaomi’s HyperOS 14, which is based on Android 14. While the chipset is a little dated, in my limited use so far it performed well enough. It’s been lag-free so far, even while quickly scrolling through Instagram timeline. Regular apps, such as social media apps, and the bundled Chrome browser have been smooth on the Redmi 14C so far. Significantly, even the gaming performance seems to be good enough. I played a few games on the Redmi 14C like Block Blast and they worked smoothly.
 


Inside the phone there is a 5160mAh battery with 18W charging support. Redmi is one of the few brands that still bundle a charger with their phone. The Redmi 14C comes with a 33W in-box charger. For now, I observed that in 45 minutes, the phone charges up to 58 per cent, from 34 per cent to 92 per cent.  Inside the phone there is a 5160mAh battery with 18W charging support.

It mentions Gemini as a ""wearable"" assistant, suggesting a tailored experience for smartwatches.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/googles-gemini-ai-may-come-soon-to-wear-os-smartwatches-2660756-2025-01-07,"Last year, Gemini made its way to iOS devices through a dedicated app, and now Google is eyeing even bigger opportunities. One of the big announcements at CES 2025 was that Google TV devices will soon get a boost from Gemini. The highlight? You’ll be able to talk to your TV’s virtual assistant without needing to speak into the remote. This is all thanks to an upgraded voice assistant powered by Gemini AI, set to roll out later this year. But TVs aren’t the only focus. Wear OS, Google’s smartwatch platform, is also likely to get Gemini support very soon. There’s been speculation that this could happen alongside Google’s March 2025 Pixel Feature Drop. A recent report from 9to5Google pointed out some strong hints about this in the beta version of the Google App (v16.0.5). Buried in the code are references to Gemini as a wearable assistant. One line reads, “Easily talk back and forth to get more done with an assistant on your watch, reimagined with Google AI.” That wording suggests that the assistant on Wear OS will be more natural and conversational than before, allowing for more dynamic back-and-forth chats.  When Gemini arrives on Wear OS, it’ll likely be through an update to the existing Google Assistant app. The basic way to call up the assistant probably won’t change much — you’ll still use the Hey Google wake word or long-press your watch’s side button. However, there’s also been talk about a new Hey Gemini hot word, which could replace or sit alongside Hey Google. This was spotted in demo videos for Android XR and could make its way to Wear OS as well. Google is clearly betting big on Gemini to redefine how we interact with its devices. From TVs to smartwatches, it’s all about making tech feel more human. While we’ll have to wait for exact dates, 2025 looks like it’s going to be another exciting year for Google’s AI-powered ecosystem. For the unaware, Google made significant strides with its Gemini AI in 2024, and it seems the momentum will continue going forward. Originally introduced as Bard, Google’s chatbot has since evolved into Gemini, which is gradually being integrated into a variety of the company’s products and services. From smartphones and tablets to Gmail, Google Docs, and Maps, Gemini is becoming a more common presence across Google’s ecosystem.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

2133e408-2c0f-46b6-a064-a87eb82d6ea3,Sam Altman says OpenAI is losing money because of ChatGPT Pro subscriptionOpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ChatGPT Pro is so popular that the company is actually losing money because of it. The company didn't expect so many people to subscribe to it.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sam-altman-says-openai-is-losing-money-because-of-chatgpt-pro-subscription-2660749-2025-01-07,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently made a surprising revelation on X (formerly Twitter) about the company’s financial challenges with its ChatGPT Pro subscriptions. In his tweet, Altman stated, “Insane thing: we are currently losing money on OpenAI Pro subscriptions! People use it much more than we expected.” The Pro subscription for ChatGPT, which offers access to the advanced GPT-4 model, has gained significant traction globally, including in India. In India, the subscription is priced at $200 per month, which is about Rs 17,000. It is an attractive option for professionals, businesses, and students seeking enhanced productivity and creativity. The Pro subscribers of ChatGPT receive benefits such as faster response times, priority access during peak usage hours, and advanced capabilities powered by GPT-4. Despite the steady influx of subscribers, Altman’s comments underline a major issue — usage levels that far exceed expectations. While the Pro subscription was designed to offset the high operational costs of running large-scale AI models, the current usage rates are proving to be unsustainable for OpenAI’s financial model. Large language models like GPT-4 require substantial computational resources, which lead to escalating cloud computing and server costs. The announcement sheds light on the delicate balance tech companies must maintain between offering powerful, accessible tools and ensuring financial viability. OpenAI’s pricing model for Pro subscriptions, aimed at democratising AI access, now faces scrutiny as the company grapples with these unexpected challenges. India has emerged as a significant market for ChatGPT, with professionals across sectors such as education, IT, and content creation adopting the Pro subscription to streamline tasks and unlock AI-driven efficiencies. The relatively affordable pricing in India compared to global rates has also contributed to its popularity. Altman’s disclosure has sparked a wave of curiosity about OpenAI’s next steps. The curiosity has especially been growing ever since Altman’s recent post about his prediction of AI replacing humans at work in 2025.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Samsung S25 series: What to expect In the teaser, Samsung has shared a glimpse of 4 phones. The rumours have also indicated that this year, the company will release a fourth model other than usual. This year, along with the Samsung S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra, S25 Slim could also make the cut. The Slim variant is expected to compete with the rumoured iPhone 17 Air (may launch in September 2025).  The Samsung Galaxy S25 series has already generated significant buzz ahead of its official debut, fueled by numerous leaks and rumours. The flagship lineup is anticipated to deliver a major performance upgrade, with the international variant (SM-S931B) recently appearing on Geekbench.

The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) has confirmed that Qi2 wireless charging is coming to Android, with Samsung and Google leading the way. The announcement was made at CES 2025, bringing an exciting update for fans who have long wanted the Qi2 wireless charging standard for Android smartphones.  For the unaware, Qi2 is the next big step in wireless charging, replacing the older Qi standard. It promises faster and more efficient charging, with speeds of up to 15W. The technology uses magnetic rings to align your device perfectly with the charger. This clever design reduces energy loss caused by misalignment, making it a more reliable option than before. While Apple’s MagSafe has been using similar technology since 2023, Android phones have mostly lagged behind — until now. Both Samsung and Google have officially committed to the Qi2 standard. Samsung announced that Galaxy phones will start supporting Qi2 later this year. However, it’s still unclear if the upcoming Galaxy S25 series, set to launch this month, will include native Qi2 support. Rumours suggest the S25 might offer Qi2 functionality through special cases, but full integration may have to wait until the Galaxy S26. Google’s plans are a bit more mysterious. The company has said it’s playing a major role in advancing the technology, especially with the development of Qi 2.2. Google aims to improve cross-brand compatibility, which has been a pain point for Android users. If successful, this could allow chargers and phones from different manufacturers to take full advantage of Qi2’s faster speeds. Google’s involvement hints at big improvements for devices like its Pixel series and other Android smartphones. For years, Apple users have had a better wireless charging experience with MagSafe. Android phones have supported wireless charging, but it’s been less reliable and often slower. The arrival of Qi2 could finally change that. By adopting the magnetic alignment system, Android devices will deliver more consistent performance and faster charging, putting them on par with Apple’s offering. 2025 could mark the start of a new era for wireless charging on Android. With Samsung and Google backing Qi2, the technology might become a standard feature across Android devices in the coming years.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Announced during CEO Jensen Huang's keynote at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Cosmos, he says, is specifically designed to teach robots and machines how to interact with the physical world. Cosmos was trained on 20 million hours of real footage of “humans walking, hands moving, manipulating things,” Jensen said. From industrial robots to humanoids and self-driving cars, the applications of this technology are vast — and fascinating.advertisementWhat sets Cosmos apart? While language models like ChatGPT or Bard learn to generate text by digesting mountains of written content, Cosmos is focused on the visual and physical realm. Huang explained that the AI models were trained on 20 million hours of real footage of humans performing everyday actions — walking, moving their hands, manipulating objects. ""It’s not about creating art,"" Huang noted. ""It’s about teaching AI to understand the physical world.""  During the presentation, Huang apparently showcased Cosmos in action, simulating warehouse environments where boxes fell off shelves. This type of realistic video generation is critical for training robots to recognise and respond to real-world scenarios, such as accidents at the workplace. Companies can also fine tune Cosmos using their proprietary data, tailoring it to specific needs.

Humanoid robot startups like Agility Robotics and Figure AI, alongside self-driving car companies such as Uber, Waabi, and Wayve, are leveraging the technology. These businesses hope to push the boundaries of what robots can achieve, whether it’s navigating complex environments or performing intricate tasks.  Isaac to complement Cosmos To complement Cosmos, Nvidia also unveiled an upgrade to its Isaac robot simulation platform. The new feature allows robots to learn new tasks with unprecedented efficiency. For instance, builders can use a few examples of a desired action, like grabbing an object, and Isaac will generate a horde of synthetic training data to perfect the skill. Huang’s CES keynote featured life-sized digital images of 14 humanoid robots from industry leaders like Tesla, Boston Dynamics, and Agility Robotics, emphasising Nvidia’s ambition to shape the future of robotics. “With Cosmos and Isaac, we’re giving developers the tools to create robots that can truly understand and operate in our world,” Huang said.   Nvidia’s bold vision underscores its leadership in the AI space, blending innovation with practicality. The integration of AI into robotics could redefine industries, from logistics and manufacturing to autonomous driving. With Cosmos, Nvidia is paving the way for machines to become more human-like—not in thought, but in motion.

As of January 5, the third beta update of OneUI 7 has been released in several regions, following the initial launch in the US late last year. This new beta build is now available in Germany and has also reached users in India and Poland. However, it’s worth noting that Indian and Polish users are essentially receiving the second beta update, while Germany and other regions are getting their third. Despite the slight variation in release stages, the latest firmware comes with the same build number ending in ""ZXLJ"" across all regions. It brings a host of improvements and bug fixes for the Galaxy S24, S24+, and S24 Ultra. The changelog reveals a bunch of enhancements and fixes aimed at improving the overall user experience. Game Booster mode has received some useful updates, including the option to change the default screen playback setting, rename FPS settings, and adjust the maximum FPS value. Users can now also set the default scanning rate to 120Hz, making gaming smoother and more customisable. Samsung Messages has gained a new ""Modify Exception"" feature when saving MMS images. Additionally, OneUI 7 introduces a vertical app drawer, and the scrolling interface has seen refinements in this latest beta. Improvements have also been made to the quick panel, which now offers smoother closing operations. On the visual side, the lock screen, always-on display, and status bar battery icon have been revamped, aligning with OneUI 7’s design updates. A long-standing issue with the volume key operation in Routine+ mode has been addressed, and tools in the Edge panel, which weren’t displaying properly before, are now fixed. This third beta is a hefty download, weighing in at over 1.2GB. It includes the January security patch, adding an extra layer of protection for users. If you’re already enrolled in the OneUI 7 beta programme, you can download the update now by heading to your device’s settings. For those who haven’t joined the beta programme, it might be worth waiting for the stable version. The final release is expected shortly after Samsung unveils its next flagship, the Galaxy S25 series, which is rumoured to launch later this month. This update is a clear sign that Samsung is fine-tuning its software before the final release. Users have reported smoother performance, fewer bugs, and enhanced features with each new beta.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Here are the best 5G phones you can buy in India this January for under Rs 15,000. The list includes the Poco M7 Pro 5G and three other devices.advertisementPoco M7 Pro 5GWe start the list with the Poco M7 Pro 5G, a solid phone that gets the basics right. Over its predecessor, the Poco M6 Pro, the latest model features a 6.67-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, providing a smooth and vibrant viewing experience for everyday use. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra processor and up to 8GB of RAM, the M7 Pro handles multitasking and casual gaming with ease.

Its 120Hz LCD display is a major improvement, offering smoother scrolling and gaming experiences compared to its predecessor. The new 108MP primary camera performs well in good lighting, delivering sharp and detailed photos that stand out in its price segment. While the 5,000mAh battery remains unchanged, charging speeds have been increased to 33W, and a fast charger is included in the box. The phone ships with HyperOS based on Android 14, which is faster and more intuitive than the older MIUI interface, providing a better overall user experience. With a strong balance of features, the Redmi 13 5G maintains its position as one of the best budget phones, offering reliable performance and useful upgrades without pushing the price too high.Motorola G64 5G The Motorola G64 5G is a solid choice for those who want a clean, bloatware-free smartphone experience. It is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 processor, which handles daily tasks and light gaming effectively. A standout feature is its massive 6,000mAh battery, which can easily last more than a day on a single charge, making it perfect for heavy users. The 50MP main camera with OIS, captures sharp and stable images, especially in good lighting. Design-wise, the phone resembles its predecessor but now comes in more colour options for added variety. Running on stock Android 14, the software is free of unnecessary apps, ensuring a smooth and simple experience. The Moto G64 5G is available in two variants — 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 12GB RAM with 256GB storage.

Here is when they will receive the salary hikes.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/infosys-delays-salary-hikes-here-is-when-employees-will-get-it-2660883-2025-01-07,"Infosys has delayed its annual salary hikes, with employees now getting increments in the fourth quarter of the current financial year (Q4 FY25). This shift marks a departure from the company's usual practice of earlier hikes, driven largely by the global uncertainty surrounding IT services demand. This could be disappointing for Infosys employees because the last salary hike was implemented in November 2023. Here is everything to know. The company plans to roll out the increments in phases, starting in January for some employees, with the rest receiving theirs in April. Infosys' Chief Financial Officer, Jayesh Sanghrajka, confirmed the phased approach during the company's Q2 results briefing. While the exact reason for the delay is unknown right now, but the move suggests that the IT sector could be facing some challenges. These include weak discretionary spending, delayed client budgets, and ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Other IT firms like HCLTech, LTIMindtree, and L&T Tech Services have also skipped salary hikes recently in efforts to manage costs and maintain profitability. Despite reporting a 2.2 percent rise in net profit to Rs 6,506 crore in the second quarter, Infosys reportedly fell short of market expectations. MoneyControl reported that the company’s margins improved slightly by 10 basis points thanks to cost-saving initiatives such as reduced onsite costs and better utilisation rates. It is being reported that Infosys could face further pressure on margins in the December quarter, due to factors like furloughs and fewer working days. However, the company’s margin improvement plan, known as Project Maximus, along with pricing gains and subcontractor cost optimisation, could help balance the impact. It is worth noting that this isn’t the first time Infosys has adjusted its salary hike timelines. In November 2023, the company had already shifted from its usual practice of salary revisions in April, primarily focusing on experienced employees, while excluding entry-level staff.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 7, 2025

The devices, which are aimed at hardcore gamers, would be available in the coming weeks and months.  As far as the desktop is concerned, the new Area 51 desktops would be the company’s most powerful gaming computers. The new desktops, says Dell, have been designed for users seeking a powerful machine capable of handling extreme performance demands. The desktop would be housed in an 80-litre full-size tower, which will help Dell put the absolute top performing hardware inside it, as well as provide users with room for upgrades.

Alienware has also introduced a unique AlienFX motherboard harness that ensures compatibility with aftermarket components, enabling users to create a truly personalised setup. With the reimagined Area 51 Desktop, Alienware has also upgraded the thermal architecture. The desktop features a positive-pressure airflow system with dual 140mm fans, larger dual 180mm fans, and optional liquid cooling configurations. This system expels heat through passive exhaust, reducing temperatures by up to 13 per cent and noise levels by 45 per cent compared to previous models. This advanced airflow design, according to Dell, results in 50 per cent more processing power, making the desktop ready for today’s intensive gaming and future applications.Alienware Area 51 laptops Joining the revamped desktops are the Area-51 laptops, which will be available in 16-inch and 18-inch models. These laptops feature a new design, complete with a liquid teal anodised aluminium finish and translucent thermal shelves illuminated by AlienFX lighting.

They support Gen 5 SSDs offering up to 12TB of storage and DDR5 memory sticks with speed of up to 7200 MT/s.Area 51 pricing and availability The Area 51 desktop and laptops will be available for purchase in the coming months. The desktop’s default configuration, equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, will start at approximately $4,499. The laptops will start at $1,999 for the entry-level configuration while the premium model, mobile variant of RTX 5080, will be priced at $3,199.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also Read |  Dell simplifies PC names with Pro and Pro Max variants, says bye-bye to Latitude, XPS and InspironAlso Read |  Digital arrest to illegal parcels, here is how Indians are being scammed by cyber criminalsAlso Read |  OnePlus 12R available under Rs 40,000: 4 reasons to buy 1 to skip

47b6d085-b417-4494-9c7b-30170221bbc9,"Forbes Air Purifier 500 review: Affordable and effective Air purifiers come in different sizes and different price points. The Forbes Air Purifier 500 is in sort of middle, price-wise as well as size-wise. But when it comes to performance, we find in the Forbes Air Purifier 500 review, this machine punches above its weight and its price-point. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/forbes-air-purifier-500-review-affordable-and-effective-2660976-2025-01-07,"Delhi-NCR is a gas chamber nowadays. With air pollution in winter soaring to 1,000 AQI, the city leaves its residents gasping for fresh air. I am one of those residents. Like everyone, every year, I prepare myself to face the grimy winter air in Delhi. Being an asthmatic, this preparation for me also includes some extra help from devices like air purifiers. So, when Eureka Forbes reached out recently about their latest air purifier – the Forbes Air Purifier 500 — I was keen to see if this purifier, despite its relatively lower price, would help me breathe easy. You see I am rather used to Dyson, which is very effective but also one of the most costliest options. The Forbes Air Purifier 500 looked like a product that could be an equally effective job but at a lower price point, something that could benefit a lot of consumers in a place like Delhi-NCR. So, I took the plunge. And emerged impressed.  The Forbes Air Purifier 500 is priced at Rs 28,000 in India. However, you can get it for as low as Rs 19,999 when in discount. At this price this air purifier highlights its 360-degree air intake technology and it comes with a 4-stage purification system, which includes a pre-filter, activated carbon filter, true HEPA H13 filter, and plasma filtration to clean indoor air. It is also WiFi enabled which means users can connect to and operate it with its dedicated smartphone app called Smart Life.   The air purifier also offers features like a PM2.5 digital display, VOC color indicator, and AI mode for automatic adjustments based on air quality. These are the features that you usually get on more expensive air purifiers. Then there are functionalities like child lock, sleep mode, adjustable fan speeds, and a timer setting. According to Forbes the Air Purifier 500 is ideal for a house with up to 670 sq ft. This the air purifier does with help of 500 m3/hr airflow and with a low sound of 66 dB or below.  Looking at the features, the Air Purifier 500 certainly looks smart and fancy. But the question remains: does it really help you breathe easily while cleaning indoors from pollutants such as dust, allergens, bacteria, and odours? But before I answer this question a bit about its design.Boring design, cool display  The Forbes Air Purifier 500 comes dismantled in two big cubes, which you need to assemble by placing one on top of the other. It's easy, lightweight, and quick to set up. Once assembled, it looks like a small tower. To me, though, it’s boring. I understand that aesthetics are matters of personal choice, but at least to my eyes the Air Purifier 500 looks not at all fancy. It’s all utility and no joy. Although, the looks should not define the performance of a machine and in the case of the Air Purifier 500 they don’t.  On top of the Air Purifier 500 is a black grill with a circular digital display in the middle. The display shows the AQI, features touch control buttons to operate the device, and includes a light indicator to signify PM2.5 levels. This display comes handy to get a quick glance at the pollution levels in the room. Also, the top panel adds some flair to otherwise boring design.
 


Using the Forbes Air Purifier 500 I have been using the Forbes Air Purifier 500 since mid-December when Delhi’s pollution levels peak and winters are in full swing. This is certainly the perfect time to test what an air purifier is really capable of. To my surprise, the Air Purifier 500 manages to hold its own in the cold. Often as soon as I turned on the device, the Air Purifier 500 quickly reduced AQI in the room. For reference, within 10 minutes, it brought the pollution down from 537 to 35. Pretty fast! To verify this, I cross-checked the readings with the Dyson Cool Gen 1 — which, by the way, is a bit costlier — and the readings were similar. The Air Purifier 500 even managed to clean smoke from the kitchen – it’s winter, and parathas are never off the stove – and filtered out pollen effectively. But – yes there is a but — as someone who deals with asthma, there are a few things I noticed the Air Purifier 500 struggles to detect. For example, my landlord had walls painted recently in my condo. During that time I was really struggling to breathe due to the paint fumes, so I turned on the Air Purifier 500. It displayed room AQI between 45-55. However, the Dyson showed an AQI of around 200. And what I could figure out with these distinct readings is that while the Air Purifier 500 is capable of handling common pollutants, its filters and sensors weren’t as effective for all types of pollutants, such as paint fumes. The Air Purifier 500 uses a silent motor, although at higher fan speed, say level 6 to 12, it isn’t entirely quiet. You can clearly hear the fan running. When set on auto or sleep mode, the fan manages noise levels well enough, at least well enough to not keep you awake in the dark when you are trying to sleep and want a quiet room. But the cold air is another matter. Unlike some other air purifiers that nowadays can also throw out hot air, the Air Purifier 500 only blows out cooler air. In a few hours, in winters, this can actually cool down the room, which is not desirable. 
 


 In short, the performance of the Air Purifier 500 is decent. If I take into account its price, I would say the performance is really good. If you’re someone looking for an affordable air purifier to clean your indoor air of gases, pollutants, and pollen, the Air Purifier 500 is very capable.advertisementEasy controls with the app Quick access to your gadgets through your phone is always a good idea. In fact, throughout my review period, I controlled the Forbes Air Purifier 500 using the Smart Life app, which I downloaded from the App Store on my iPhone.The app is easy to access and, once set up with details like your location, it displays the outdoor AQI alongside the indoor AQI along with the weather. The app also allows you to connect your device and control all its settings with just a few taps. You can even control the timer through the app, adding to its convenience.Beyond app control, the purifier can also be connected to smart assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant, making it even easier and smarter to manage the device. Should you buy Forbes Air Purifier 500? So, is the Forbes Air Purifier 500 worth Rs 20,000, the price at which it often sells? Definitely. The machine is capable of filtering pollutants and pollen, helping to keep your indoor air clean. It is lightweight, easy to clean, portable, and simple to set up.The app controls and smart display make it convenient to track the AQI and control the machine. While it does throw cool air, it’s not directed straight at your face. Additionally, once the AQI in the room improves, the fan – if set on AI mode – can slow down, making it quieter for night. Overall, it effectively cleans the indoor air to make it breathable. In terms of performance, it sort of matches the performance offered by more expensive air purifiers. Although, when it comes to feature set — such as warm air — or jazzier design, the more expensive air purifiers still have an edge over them. But for the price I believe you can’t go wrong with the Forbes Air Purifier 500. At its selling it is totally worth it.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ces-2025-nvidias-new-personal-ai-supercomputer-costs-over-rs-250000-and-anyone-can-use-it-at-home-or-office-2660961-2025-01-07,"Nvidia, a giant in the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware game, is shaking things up by bringing AI capabilities straight to your desk. The company announced its newest product at CES 2025: Digits, a personal AI supercomputer, which will be available starting May this year. Priced at $3,000 (which is a little over Rs 2,50,000), Digits aims to make advanced AI accessible to developers, researchers, and enthusiasts without the need for massive cloud infrastructure.  
“The age of AI is here. Project Digits, with the new GB10 Superchip designed with MediaTek, makes our most powerful Grace Blackwell platform more accessible — placing it in the hands of developers, researchers, and students to solve the most pressing issues of our time,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the time of launch.   advertisementA supercomputer in a book-sized box  Digits is small enough to fit on your desk but packs a serious punch. At its core is the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, co-developed with MediaTek. With 128GB of unified memory and up to 4TB of NVMe storage, Digits is tailor-made for handling large AI workloads. What can Digits do? Digits isn’t just powerful — it’s versatile. It can run a large language model (LLM) with up to 200 billion parameters, a metric that measures model complexity. That’s a game-changer for hobbyists and researchers who previously needed expensive cloud services or custom setups to run advanced AI models.  
Want to push it further? Connect two Digits machines with Nvidia’s high-speed interconnect, and you can run models as large as Meta’s Llama with 405 billion parameters. This feature puts Digits in a league of its own for experimentation with near-state-of-the-art AI models.  Who is Digits for? Digits is small enough to fit on your desk but packs a serious punch.

ec822d2c-35ff-4d6d-a557-58bdfc7466b3,"Many Indians among 185 employees fired by Apple for salary fraud, says report185 employees have been fired by Apple for misusing a grants clause to gain higher salary from the company. Of these, many are said to be Indians. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/many-indians-among-185-employees-fired-by-apple-for-salary-fraud-by-misusing-charity-clause-says-report-2661013-2025-01-07,"Frauds can often be very ingenious. And this one over at Apple sounds particularly clever and insidious. Apple has reportedly fired 185 employees at its headquarters in Cupertino after finding that these employees indulged in a monetary fraud to boost their compensation. Of the fired employees, six have been named by authorities in the Bay Area and warrants have been issued against them. While none of these six is Indian, another report highlights that among the fired employees many are Indians who were reportedly misusing some Telugu charity organisations in the US to carry out fraud.  NBC, citing the district attorney’s office in Los Angeles, notes that Apple has terminated several employees from its Bay Area offices over the misuse of its Matching Grants program. Apple has not issued an official statement on the matter and we were also unable to independently verify the information. The reported scheme revolves around Apple’s Matching Grants program, a corporate social responsibility initiative designed to amplify employees’ charitable contributions by matching their donations to nonprofit organisations. The allegations suggest that some employees, in collaboration with specific nonprofit organisations — including associations reportedly linked to the Indian community — falsified donations to exploit the program. According to these claims, employees donated funds to nonprofits, which were then matched by Apple. However, the nonprofits allegedly funnelled the original donations back to the employees, allowing them to retain Apple’s matching contributions. If accurate, this would not only breach corporate policies but also violate US tax laws, as the employees’ false claims could amount to tax fraud. According to the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office, six individuals defrauded Apple of approximately $152,000 over three years by falsely claiming to donate to two nonprofits — the American Chinese International Cultural Exchange (ACICE) and Hop4Kids. The individuals charged include: -Siu Kei (Alex) Kwan, 37, of Castro Valley
-Yathei (Hayson) Yuen, 34, of San Jose
-Yat C (Sunny) Ng, 35, of Milpitas
-Wentao (Victor) Li, 38, of Hayward
-Lichao Ni, 39, of Sunnyvale
-Zheng Chang, 31, of Union City According to the DA’s Office, Kwan, identified as the ringleader, served as both the CEO of Hop4Kids and the accountant for ACICE. The scheme reportedly involved employees pretending to make donations, which were later returned to them. Kwan retained Apple’s matching contributions and also wrote off these fictitious donations on the defendants’ tax returns, defrauding the state of California in the process. A separate report by Great Andhra notes that a total of 185 Apple employees have been fired, even though current authorities have released details of only 6 whom they have charged with certain crimes. This report notes that there are many Indians amongst the fired employees. These Indians, claims the report, misused Apple’s Matching Grants program, a corporate social responsibility initiative designed to amplify employees’ charitable contributions by matching their donations to nonprofit organisations. The allegations suggest that some employees, in collaboration with specific non-profit organisations –– including associations reportedly linked to the Telugu employees –– falsified donations to exploit the program.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announces $3 billion investment in India for AI, cloud infrastructure and skillingAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia's new personal AI supercomputer costs over Rs 2,50,000 and anyone can use it at home or officeAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's new AI models were trained on 20 million hours of human moves

f130b009-8404-4c31-8fb3-abe9e991ed8e,"Apple Intelligence will soon be available in Indian English: Everything we know so farFor now, Apple's AI features are only limited to certain languages, including US English. But India will soon get the upgrade. In 2025, Apple Intelligence will finally expand to other languages. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-intelligence-will-soon-be-available-in-indian-english-everything-we-know-so-far-2661001-2025-01-07,"Apple released the first wave of Apple Intelligence in October 2024 with the iOS 18.1. Since then, the company has been constantly working on its AI-powered features. While the initial phase brought just a handful of Apple Intelligence features, iOS 18.2 showed off some grand ones. iOS 18.1 introduced new features designed to make everyday tasks easier and more efficient, like writing tools, Photos app enhancements with Clean up tool and Memories features. On the other hand, iOS 18.2 surfaced with ChatGPT integration, Image Playground, GenMoji, Visual Intelligence and more. Read all the features in detail here.  While Apple is steadily climbing up the ladder, it is yet to expand its branches across the globe, especially when it comes to AI. We earlier reported how Apple is running late in the AI race, but limiting features to certain areas is still a major drawback. For now, Apple Intelligence is available in Australian English, Canadian English, English (Ireland), New Zealand, South Africa, UK and US in most regions around the world. However, Indian English is yet to come.  But the good news is that 2025 is the year when Indian English will be able to support Apple Intelligence. While there is still a way to use it, for that users have to change their default regional settings. How to use Apple Intelligence in India?  Apple Intelligence is only eligible for the iPhone 16 series and iPhone 15 Pro models right now. To access the AI features on your eligible iPhones, you need to change your default regional setting to one of the languages that support Apple Intelligence. To change you settings, go to Settings > General > Language & Region and select English (US) or any language that supports Apple Intelligence as your device’s primary language. (Something that is yet to feature with Indian English). This setting configures your device to recognise the language required for Apple Intelligence. After changing the language, go to Settings > Apple Intelligence and Siri > Language and again choose for instance, English (US) as the language for Siri and Apple Intelligence. After setup, Apple will invite you to join a waitlist for access to Apple Intelligence. Once you’ve joined, you’ll be notified within a few hours or days when the local language model for Apple Intelligence has been downloaded to your device. At that point, you can start exploring Apple’s new suite of AI features.What do you need for Apple Intelligence?  This year Apple will not just expand its Apple Intelligence reach, but also release new features. Once Indian English starts supporting Apple Intelligence, it will be much easier for the Indian audience. But you must remember that Apple's AI features require more storage. Hence, if you are planning to go for high-end iPhones (eligible for Apple Intelligence), we advise you to go for a higher storage variant.  According to an official document, Apple Intelligence is supported on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, all iPhone 16 models, and iPads and Macs equipped with the M1 chip or newer. For iPhone devices, 4GB of storage is required to install and use Apple Intelligence features.  Apple may have separate criteria for iPads and Macs, or there could be undisclosed reasons for not sharing additional details. The storage requirement is expected to grow as new features are introduced. The document states, “Storage requirements for on-device Apple Intelligence models will increase as more features roll out.” However, it remains unclear how much additional storage will be needed for upcoming updates. A potential doubling of the minimum requirement to 8GB within the next year wouldn’t be surprising.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  iPhone 17 Air price details leaked, will cost less than Pro modelsAlso read |  iPhone SE 4 may cost more than its predecessorAlso read |  Apple to pay $95 million to settle Siri privacy lawsuit

cd00b358-481b-4066-9810-2a2886d8306d,"OnePlus 13 review: Solid flagship phone for smart buyersAfter many teasers, the OnePlus 13 has arrived in India today. And with it, the phone brings a fairly compelling package of top hardware and a good price. As we find in this OnePlus 13 review, this is another solid offering from the house of OnePlus. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/oneplus-13-review-solid-flagship-phone-for-smart-buyers-2661180-2025-01-07,"  OnePlus has been a household name in India for some time now, largely due to its ability to strike a balance between premium performance and accessible pricing. With the OnePlus 13, the brand aims to uphold its legacy of delivering a smooth user experience and well-polished software along with raw performance. But with a price of Rs 69,999, a slight increase over its predecessor, the OnePlus 12, does the OnePlus 13 justify the premium? Let’s dive into the details and find out in this detailed OnePlus 13 review.advertisementDesign: Subtle yet premium refreshThe OnePlus 13 may seem familiar at first, but it brings a refreshing update to its design with subtle yet impactful aesthetic changes. While the circular rear camera module with four sensors remains, the device now features flat sides and a flat screen, giving it a more modern appearance. However, since the new version has a boxy design, it gives the impression of a wider form factor compared to the OnePlus 12. In reality, the OnePlus 13 is slimmer and lighter. This shift in design, combined with leather and glass finish options, makes the OnePlus 13 feel noticeably more premium than its predecessor.The white model I am reviewing features a frosted glass back panel with a subtle shimmer effect, which reminds me of the sandstone texture seen on older devices like the OnePlus 5T. However, this new version has a smooth finish, which makes it slightly slippery. For those who prefer a better grip, OnePlus also offers a vegan leather option. That said, I personally prefer the white model for its elegant and classy appearance. The silver accents around the camera module and side frames contrast beautifully with the white finish, giving the device a stunning look.
 


OnePlus has also managed to reduce the weight (and thickness) of the device by 10 grams, despite housing a larger 6000mAh battery compared to the 5400mAh unit in the OnePlus 12. This is quite impressive. Durability too has seen an upgrade with IP68 and IP69 water and dust resistance ratings, meaning the OnePlus 13 can survive water splashes and even submersion to a certain extent, making it more reliable for everyday use.Another welcome upgrade is the use of an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which offers a much faster and more reliable unlocking, even with wet fingers. The placement of this sensor is well within reach, though the volume and power buttons are positioned a bit higher, which may take some getting used to. OnePlus has retained the popular alert slider on the left to let you easily switch sound profiles, which is one of the most useful features that the brand has offered for years.Display: Bright, sharp and richOn paper, the OnePlus 13 has a display that is similar to the one we saw on the OnePlus 12. The size remains the same, so you still get the 6.82-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and QHD+ resolution. The brightness is impressive, with 1600 nits of usual brightness and 4500 nits of peak brightness when watching HDR content on apps like Netflix and YouTube. The screen remains quite visible even in direct sunlight, and the high peak brightness makes shadows in darker scenes on Netflix more visible.
 


Additionally, OnePlus has also added 2nits of minimum brightness support, allowing the screen to get sufficiently dim in dark environments, making it easier on the eyes. I have to say, with a pixel density of 510ppi, the OnePlus 13 offers some of the sharpest visuals in its class. The quality of colours too is excellent. The phone has a bright screen with rich colours and a slightly warmer tone, making photos and videos appear lifelike.One of the best additions is the ability to use the device while wearing woollen or sheepskin gloves, which is particularly useful during cold Delhi winters. I believe other smartphone brands should also offer this feature for the added convenience it provides. The OnePlus 13 features a micro quad-curved display this time, giving the panel a subtle curve that makes the bezels appear thinner, which in turn makes the display look even larger.advertisementThe OnePlus 13 also supports LTPO technology, allowing the display’s refresh rate to adjust between 1Hz and 120Hz. However, it rarely drops to 1Hz or even below 60Hz. To save battery, the refresh rate should ideally dip to 1Hz or 10Hz when Always-On Display (AoD) is enabled, but the screen generally stays between 60Hz and 120Hz. This, though, is a minor issue that is easily solvable with a software update.The display is protected by Ceramic Guard, which OnePlus claims is 20 percent tougher than Gorilla Glass Victus. OnePlus, as it has been doing since the very beginning, puts a scratch guard on the phone. This is always a welcome sight because it saves consumers from buying their own glass or plastic shield for the phone. Performance: A workhorseJust like the OnePlus 12, the OnePlus 13 is set to earn the ""flagship killer of the year"" title, and I say this purely based on its impressive performance. Let’s dive into the benchmark scores first. The multi-core performance on Geekbench is strong, easily surpassing the 9,000 mark. On Antutu, while the score of 2,585,262 falls slightly short of OnePlus claims for the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the 1.1 million GPU score alone highlights the phone's exceptional potential for GPU-intensive tasks. In the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme test, the OnePlus 13 offers a 15 per cent performance boost over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from last year.
 


advertisementWhile these scores are impressive, the device can get slightly hot while running benchmarks, particularly in PCMark and 3DMark. But then we don’t go around running benchmarks on our phone. In regular use, it rarely gets warm and while playing games it can be warm to touch but not in an alarming way. For example, even after 35 minutes of gaming the phone was only slightly warm. Gaming performance is top-notch, with titles like Genshin Impact running at 60fps (medium graphics) and Call of Duty consistently hitting 120fps. That said, in our thermal management tests, the OnePlus 13R ran slightly cooler, indicating that while the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset delivers outstanding performance, there’s room for improvement in thermal efficiency.advertisementOverall, the OnePlus 13 feels smooth, fast, and responsive. The haptics are mostly solid, and the app launches as well as animations are quick, thanks to the new OxygenOS 15 software, LPDDR5X RAM, and UFS 4.0 storage. The OnePlus 13 supports a USB 3.2 port with display port capabilities, making it an excellent choice for gamers who want to stream their content to a larger screen.How is the software?You get the usual clean and fast user interface in the OnePlus 13. With OxygenOS 15, OnePlus has added a new ""Share with iPhone"" feature, which is impressively fast and allows you to transfer large video or photo files in under 30 seconds. The update also includes the BeaconLink feature, enabling you to call someone nearby when there's no network on your phone. It operates within a 200-meter range. However, this doesn't work with every phone. Also, both Bluetooth and the feature itself must be turned on in the settings. While it’s a useful addition, the feature is only available on select OnePlus and Oppo devices.
 


Additionally, OnePlus has included eSIM support, which is a great feature, though it requires you to disable the second SIM when using eSIM. OxygenOS 15 also brings a split notification mode, allowing you to access notifications and shortcuts separately for a better experience. You will also find some useful privacy features such as app lock and the option to hide apps. The overall experience is great and you won't see bloatware on this device.Larger 6000mAh battery makes a big differenceThe OnePlus 13 features a massive 6000mAh battery, which is a big upgrade compared to the previous version's 5400mAh unit. As I used the phone, often it lasted for 1.5 days with moderate usage, providing around 10 hours of screen-on time. This included a mix of calling, texting, social media usage, lots of photography sessions, and watching a few videos. For those who want to know the PCMark battery result, it recorded an impressive number —18 hours and 32 minutes. Although, this is around 2 hours less than what phones with MediaTek 9400, such as Oppo Find X8 Pro, are managing in the same benchmark.
 


Charging the device is a breeze, thanks to the 100W wired charging support, which takes the phone from 5 per cent to 100 per cent in just about 30 minutes. A lot of companies, nowadays, such as Samsung, Apple and Google are no longer bundling a charger in the box. Thankfully, OnePlus hasn’t joined the gang yet.The OnePlus 13 also supports 50W magnetic wireless charging, which takes about one hour to fully charge the device. Furthermore, OnePlus has introduced a slim and compact 5000mAh magnetic wireless power bank that easily attaches to the back of the phone, providing quick top-ups when you are on the go. It is possible that OnePlus may launch this power bank in India soon. Camera performance: Expect good, cinematic shotsIn flagship phones, cameras are now so close to each other in performance that the differences are minute and often require that you pick a magnifying glass and go hunt for pixel-level flaws. The camera in the OnePlus 13 is flagship grade, but if you have seen photos clicked with other flagships — say the iPhone 16 series, or the latest Oppo and Realme and iQoo phones or Samsung phones — you will be hard pressed to objectively call one superior to the other. They all excel in some areas and they all falter at this thing or that. The exceptions, in my opinion, would be the latest Vivo and the latest Pixels. With this large context, let me take a look at the OnePlus 13 camera performance. Particularly for its price, it delivers a good experience. In daylight, the OnePlus 13 can capture shots with natural colours, decent sharpness, and ample details. The dynamic range is generally well-balanced, though performance can be inconsistent at times. Occasionally, skies may appear blown out or highlights and shadows get clipped in scenes that have a crazy amount of variation between highlights and shadows. In good light,  meanwhile, the device can produce cinematic shots, especially during post-processing, where it adds drama to scenes, making the skies and foreground look stunning — something that’s particularly noticeable in beach photos. The 3x optical zoom — and even 120x digital zoom — performs well, allowing you to capture distant subjects with surprising clarity. For instance, I was able to capture a surfer in the sea and the photo was clicked at over 800mm effective focal length. Yes, the photo was a little messy but it was still incredible that I could click such a photo.  Click on any photo below to access all the camera samplesPortrait shots in daylight also turn out well, especially when clicked in good lighting. Close-up portrait photos offer good detail, texture, sharpness, and natural colours, with balanced exposure. However, when capturing portraits from a distance, the photos look good but the details get a bit soft. The edge detection and background blur are mostly on-point, creating pleasing depth effects.Macro photography isn’t the OnePlus 13’s strongest suit, but the shots are decent enough for sharing on social media. That being said, OnePlus has made noticeable improvements in low-light photography with this version. The photos come out brighter, with better clarity, good detail, and lifelike colours, all while minimising noise, which is nice. The dynamic range is just fine. Additionally, there's no lens flare issue, which is a definite plus. Overall, the OnePlus 13 offers reliable and cinematic shots for your Instagram, especially in well-lit conditions.OnePlus 13: Is it worth buying?The OnePlus 13 is a well-rounded phone that offers top performance and flagship experience at relatively good prices. It brings meaningful upgrades, including a bigger battery, faster charging, improved fingerprint tech, a more powerful chipset, and better waterproofing. While the display remains largely unchanged, faster performance and design refinements make it a solid option in the flagship market. It even offers a good camera experience in its price range.Priced at Rs 69,999, the OnePlus 13 offers a premium experience and a smooth software experience, making it a worthy investment for those seeking a high-performance device with long-lasting battery life and good aesthetics. If you are looking for a solid yet relatively affordable flagship device, the OnePlus 13 is the phone for you.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Must Watch 
 The OnePlus 13 may seem familiar at first, but it brings a refreshing update to its design with subtle yet impactful aesthetic changes. While the circular rear camera module with four sensors remains, the device now features flat sides and a flat screen, giving it a more modern appearance. However, since the new version has a boxy design, it gives the impression of a wider form factor compared to the OnePlus 12. In reality, the OnePlus 13 is slimmer and lighter. This shift in design, combined with leather and glass finish options, makes the OnePlus 13 feel noticeably more premium than its predecessor. The white model I am reviewing features a frosted glass back panel with a subtle shimmer effect, which reminds me of the sandstone texture seen on older devices like the OnePlus 5T. However, this new version has a smooth finish, which makes it slightly slippery. For those who prefer a better grip, OnePlus also offers a vegan leather option. That said, I personally prefer the white model for its elegant and classy appearance. The silver accents around the camera module and side frames contrast beautifully with the white finish, giving the device a stunning look.
 


 OnePlus has also managed to reduce the weight (and thickness) of the device by 10 grams, despite housing a larger 6000mAh battery compared to the 5400mAh unit in the OnePlus 12. This is quite impressive. Durability too has seen an upgrade with IP68 and IP69 water and dust resistance ratings, meaning the OnePlus 13 can survive water splashes and even submersion to a certain extent, making it more reliable for everyday use. Another welcome upgrade is the use of an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which offers a much faster and more reliable unlocking, even with wet fingers. The placement of this sensor is well within reach, though the volume and power buttons are positioned a bit higher, which may take some getting used to. OnePlus has retained the popular alert slider on the left to let you easily switch sound profiles, which is one of the most useful features that the brand has offered for years.Display: Bright, sharp and rich On paper, the OnePlus 13 has a display that is similar to the one we saw on the OnePlus 12. The size remains the same, so you still get the 6.82-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and QHD+ resolution. The brightness is impressive, with 1600 nits of usual brightness and 4500 nits of peak brightness when watching HDR content on apps like Netflix and YouTube. The screen remains quite visible even in direct sunlight, and the high peak brightness makes shadows in darker scenes on Netflix more visible.
 


Additionally, OnePlus has also added 2nits of minimum brightness support, allowing the screen to get sufficiently dim in dark environments, making it easier on the eyes. I have to say, with a pixel density of 510ppi, the OnePlus 13 offers some of the sharpest visuals in its class. The quality of colours too is excellent. The phone has a bright screen with rich colours and a slightly warmer tone, making photos and videos appear lifelike.One of the best additions is the ability to use the device while wearing woollen or sheepskin gloves, which is particularly useful during cold Delhi winters. I believe other smartphone brands should also offer this feature for the added convenience it provides.

f46eae0a-bc26-4b8b-ab88-039b17b7b627,"Apple iPhone SE 4 may launch in April with iOS 18.3The iPhone SE 4 aka 16e is rumoured to launch in April 2025 with iPad 11. According to Mark Gurman, Apple may unveil the devices at the same time as iOS 18.3 release. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-iphone-se-4-may-launch-in-april-with-ios-183-2661294-2025-01-08,"Apple is rumoured to bring back the SE series after 2 years in 2025. The company last launched the device, the iPhone SE 3, in 2022 and now the iPhone SE 4 is next in line. Previously, rumours indicated that the phone would hit the shelves in March. However, Mark Gurman, a trusted Apple source, claims April might be the launch month for the iPhone SE 4.  Gurman took to X (formerly Twitter), rubbishing a report that stated the iPhone SE 4 will be launched this month. He added that if everything stays on track and Apple is able to meet the decided timeline, the iPhone SE 4 might be released by April. Moreover, he claimed that we can expect the affordable iPhone launch before iOS 18.4. Moreover, it is highly likely that the launch time will overlap with iOS 18.3. 
 


iPhone SE 4: Expected specs and features  According to the rumours and leaks, Apple might be planning to rebrand its upcoming SE 4 to the iPhone 16e. It looks like the company will be associating the toned-down iPhone SE with its flagship series from now on. The upcoming phone is also expected to bring several upgrades over its predecessors.  For starters, the shift from the iPhone 8-inspired design to one more in line with the iPhone 16 will provide a more modern and immersive user experience. The rumoured 6.06-inch OLED display is relatively large over the 4.7-inch LCD, and will enhance the overall viewing quality, making it more comparable to high-end iPhones. With the rumoured A18 chipset, the SE 4 aka 16e will have a substantial performance boost, bringing it closer to the iPhone 16 series in terms of processing power. The increase to 8GB of RAM (up from 4GB) is especially notable, offering better multitasking capabilities and support for more demanding apps, including Apple's latest AI and machine learning features. Moreover, the phone could also feature the same rear camera as the iPhone 16. The fourth-generation iPhone SE is expected to come with a 48-megapixel rear camera, along with a 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera, bringing significant upgrades to Apple's more budget-friendly device. This new camera setup aligns closely with the iPhone 16’s rear camera, which uses a 48-megapixel wide-angle lens that Apple refers to as a ""Fusion"" lens, capable of handling both standard and 2x zoom photos without losing detail.iPhone SE 4: India price leaked  We have previously reported, citing a South Korean blog, that the iPhone SE 4 is expected to be priced at $500 (approximately Rs 42,700) or lower. Notably, this aligns with previous rumours about the iPhone SE 4’s $499 price point. For context, the iPhone SE 3 was launched in India in 2022 at a starting price of Rs 43,900, and it was priced at $429 (approx Rs 36,700) in the US. And with the upcoming iPhone SE 4, we must expect this price gap as well. If the iPhone SE 4 or 16e is to follow the traditions, the price in India could go up to Rs 49,900.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

ed3fb728-cc31-452f-908a-9c7114252148,"Google widely rolls out QR code-based sharing via Quick Share on AndroidGoogle's Quick Share now supports QR codes, making file transfers simpler and faster. You no longer need to save a contact or verify a device before sharing files between Android devices.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-widely-rolls-out-qr-code-based-sharing-via-quick-share-on-android-2661316-2025-01-08,"Google is widely rolling out a new feature for Android users that makes sharing files even easier. Now, you can use QR codes to share files through Quick Share, a tool already built into your Android phone. This update is part of the latest version (24.49.33) of Google Play Services and is available to users worldwide. The new feature works in a way that feels simple and familiar. Once you tap the Quick Share option in your phone’s share menu, a fullscreen interface will appear. You’ll now see a new option called “Use QR code” in the “Send to nearby devices” section. Selecting this will bring up a unique QR code branded with the Quick Share logo. When the QR code appears, your screen automatically brightens to make it easier for other devices to scan. What makes this feature so handy is its simplicity. The person you’re sharing with just needs to open the camera app on their Android phone and point it at your QR code. This will instantly generate a ""quickshare.google"" link on their device, and the file transfer will begin without any additional steps. Google says you don’t need to add anyone as a contact, verify devices, or fiddle with sharing settings — it just works. Another useful feature is that the QR code can be scanned by more than one device. This is great if you need to send the same files to multiple people, such as sharing event photos with friends or documents with colleagues. For anyone who’s ever struggled with Quick Share not detecting nearby devices or simply not working, this QR code option could be a game-changer. This update is part of Google’s December 2024 Feature Bundle, which focuses on making Android more versatile. While Quick Share itself isn’t new, the addition of QR code support is a welcome improvement. It makes the process more reliable, especially in situations where devices don’t appear on the nearby list — a common frustration for many Android users. Interestingly, Samsung users might find this feature familiar. Galaxy devices have had their own version of QR code-based sharing in Samsung Quick Share for a while now. However, Samsung’s version includes some extra features, like the ability to share files through Samsung Cloud. These extras are still exclusive to Galaxy devices, but Google’s new update means that QR code sharing is now available on all Android phones, not just Samsung’s.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's new AI models were trained on 20 million hours of human moves

But with high costs and low production, the Samsung tri-fold might materialise as much as it seems. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsungs-triple-fold-phone-could-debut-in-2025-2661324-2025-01-08,"Samsung has been working on a triple-fold smartphone for quite some time. And now finally, the company might release the tri-foldable phone this year. Samsung's involvement in developing a tri-fold smartphone isn't a new topic. Back in March 2023, rumours suggested the company might delay the Galaxy S23 FE launch—eventually released in October 2023—in favour of focusing on a groundbreaking smartphone with a triple-folding display. Samsung even showcased the concept of this tri-fold design during the Samsung Developer Conference (SDC) in October 2023. Although the tri-fold smartphone didn't debut then, it appears Samsung remains committed to this innovation, with a potential launch now anticipated in 2025. advertisementSamsung triple-fold phone: Big prices, low productionThis comes after a Chinese company, Huawei, released the world's first triple-fold smartphone in September 2024 -- Huawei Mate XT. While the concept is similar, the price gap may be huge. The Huawei Mate XT is priced at 20,000 Yuan in China (approximately Rs 2,31,800). However, a report by the Korean publication Sisa Journal indicates that Samsung’s version will come with a higher price tag. Citing insights from a display industry insider, the report highlights that the tri-fold device will feature three display panels, two internal and two external hinges, along with enhanced hardware technology—making it significantly more expensive than current foldable smartphones.Since the display is a problematic area in the tri-fold phone, Samsung learnt its lesson from the Huawei Mate XT. As reported by the Sisa Journal, Samsung’s triple-folding smartphone will feature a G-shaped design, where the outer screens fold inward. This differs from the Huawei Mate XT’s S- or Z-shaped folding mechanism, which folds both inward and outward. The report suggests that Samsung’s innovative design will result in a more durable device overall.

This differs from the Huawei Mate XT’s S- or Z-shaped folding mechanism, which folds both inward and outward. The report suggests that Samsung’s innovative design will result in a more durable device overall. But Samsung appears cautious about its new sub-category of devices, with plans to produce fewer than 3,00,000 units of the G-type triple-folding smartphone, as per the report. The device is expected to debut in the second half of 2025. Similar to the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition, the initial launch will likely be restricted to South Korea and select Asian markets. A broader global rollout might depend on the device's performance and reception during the initial launch phase. Samsung's 2025 plan for foldables  It looks like Samsung has major plans for foldable phones this year. After Galaxy Unpacked event (scheduled for January 22), which will unveil the Galaxy S25 series, the company will turn its focus on Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. This year, the company has two more foldables: Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and a triple-fold phone. While there is a lot of variety in 2025, production is still expected to be low. Samsung triple-fold: Expected Specs Currently, there’s limited information available about Samsung’s tri-fold device, but one intriguing theory suggests it could feature a stunning 12.4-inch display when fully unfolded. This would position the device as a potential replacement for both a traditional smartphone and a tablet, surpassing the 10.2-inch screen of Huawei’s groundbreaking Mate XT. Interestingly, the device might also offer a partially unfolded mode with a screen size of around 10.5 inches, delivering an impressive viewing experience. Another noteworthy rumour is the possible exclusion of under-display camera technology. While this could enhance the quality of the front-facing camera, it would necessitate a hole-punch cutout on the main screen, slightly compromising the device’s overall elegance. However, this trade-off might be worth it for improved camera performance.

Announced earlier this year at Google I/O 2024, the “Ask about this PDF” feature is now available in the Files by Google app. It allows users to ask questions about a PDF document directly, making it faster and simpler to get the information you need. The new feature is part of Google’s Gemini overlay, which is designed to bring AI-powered tools to various parts of Android. If you’re viewing a PDF in Files by Google’s updated viewer, you’ll now see a new button called “Ask about this PDF”. Tapping it lets you upload the document and then ask questions about its contents. For example, you could ask for a summary of the document, clarification on specific sections, or even detailed information about tables or charts inside the PDF. Once you tap the “Ask about this PDF” button, the app will begin uploading the document. You can then type your question into an “Ask Gemini” text box. While the file uploads, the send button will remain greyed out until the process is complete. After that, you’re good to go. Gemini will display its answers as an overlay, so you can still see the PDF in the background while reading the response. You can also ask follow-up questions without needing to restart the process. This functionality is similar to what you can already do in the Gemini app itself. There, you can upload files and have a conversation about their content. However, the new integration in Files by Google makes the process smoother by keeping everything in one app. There’s no need to switch between apps, which can save you time and effort. For now, this feature is only available in the Files by Google app. It doesn’t work with Google Drive’s PDF viewer, which continues to offer the standard “Ask about this screen” feature seen in other apps. This may be a bit of a disappointment for those who use Google Drive to manage their files, but future updates may expand the feature to more apps. It’s worth noting that the “Ask about this PDF” feature is only available to customers using Gemini Advanced. This version of the AI takes advantage of a long context window, meaning it can process and understand larger documents more effectively. If you’re not on Gemini Advanced, you won’t see this option. The feature is rolling out as part of version 16.0.5 of the Google app. This version is currently in beta but should become widely available in the near future.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's new AI models were trained on 20 million hours of human moves

He posted on X, saying the claims are utterly untrue. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sam-altmans-sister-accuses-him-of-sexual-abuse-openai-ceo-denies-claims-2661391-2025-01-08,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is once again making the headlines, and for the wrong reasons. Ann Altman, his sister, has filed a lawsuit alleging that her brother sexually abused her repeatedly over a nine-year period, beginning in 1997. The lawsuit, filed Monday in US District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri, claims the abuse occurred at the family’s home in Clayton, Missouri, starting when Ann was three years old and Sam was 12. The lawsuit alleges that the abuse happened “several times per week"". It also states that Ann has suffered “severe emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression” as a result of the alleged abuse, with these effects expected to persist. This is not the first time Ann has spoken out against her brother; she previously made similar accusations publicly on social media. For instance, in November 2021, she posted on X that she had suffered ""sexual, physical, emotional, verbal, financial, and technological abuse"" at the hands of her brothers, Sam Altman and Jack Altman. However, this marks the first time she has taken legal action. Represented by Illinois-based attorney Ryan Mahoney, who specialises in sexual assault and harassment cases, Ann is seeking a jury trial and damages exceeding $75,000, according to the CNBC report.  In a joint statement released on X (formerly Twitter), Sam Altman, his mother Connie, and his brothers Jack and Max denied the allegations. “Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam,” the statement reads. It describes the lawsuit as false and asserts that Annie faces “mental health challenges” while rejecting “conventional treatment.”
 


 “This situation causes immense pain to our entire family,” the statement adds. This is not the only legal challenge the OpenAI CEO has faced. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk filed a separate lawsuit in March, accusing Altman and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman of breach of contract and fiduciary duty. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, left the organisation’s board in 2018 and has since criticised its transition to a for-profit model. After initially filing in a San Francisco court, Musk refiled his lawsuit in federal court in June. OpenAI has pushed back against Musk, stating that in 2017, Musk himself proposed transitioning the company to a for-profit structure.

The company has confirmed that this move will primarily target underperforming employees.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/microsoft-says-it-will-fire-more-employees-who-are-underperforming-2661445-2025-01-08,"Microsoft is preparing to fire more employees. People who are familiar with the matter told Business Insider that this move will primarily target underperforming employees. While the company has confirmed the news, it has not disclosed the exact number of workers affected. Here are the key details. A Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged the upcoming layoffs and reiterated the company's focus on high-performance talent. The spokesperson stressed that when employees fail to meet performance expectations, appropriate actions are taken. As part of its strategy, Microsoft evaluates staff performance across multiple levels, even reaching some senior employees at level 80. Several departments, including the company’s critical Security division, are expected to feel the impact of these job cuts, according to the sources. The spokesperson also mentioned that roles left vacant due to these performance-based exits are often filled with new hires, suggesting that Microsoft’s overall headcount may not change drastically. As of mid-2024, the company employed roughly 228,000 people worldwide. This move aligns with Microsoft’s long-standing history of workforce restructuring, a practice it has followed under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella. Since taking charge in 2014, Nadella has overseen multiple rounds of layoffs, including a major cut that same year which affected 18,000 employees—nearly 14% of Microsoft’s total workforce at the time. In recent years, Microsoft has continued to make strategic job reductions across various sectors. In 2023, the company let go around 10,000 employees, cutting across different divisions, including Xbox. Following its high-profile acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft laid off nearly 2,000 employees from its gaming division in early 2024. More cuts followed during the summer, with about 1,000 people from its Azure cloud services division affected.  In September 2024, Microsoft reduced its workforce further, with 650 layoffs hitting its Xbox division, pushing the number of job cuts from its gaming segment to nearly 3,000 for the year.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 8, 2025

In short, the new OnePlus 13R promises four years of software upgrades and six years of security updates, giving it a longer software lifecycle.Refreshed design and improved build quality OnePlus has also refreshed the design of its affordable OnePlus 13R. Compared to the curved display of the OnePlus 12R, the OnePlus 13R features a flat display and an aluminum frame with Crystal Shield Glass protection on the front and back. Adding durability to the design, the OnePlus 13R also boasts an IP65 rating, offering better protection against dust and water compared to the IP64 rating of its predecessor. Additionally, the OnePlus 13R is the first OnePlus phone to feature Corning Gorilla Glass 7i on the front.

For those interested, pre-reservations for the Galaxy S25 series have started in India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-is-now-up-for-pre-reserve-in-india-check-out-offers-2661428-2025-01-08,"It’s official. Samsung is gearing up to launch its Galaxy S25 series on January 22, 2025, at the Galaxy Unpacked event. This upcoming flagship smartphone lineup promises to deliver a next-level AI experience, thanks to the new OneUI7 software and top-tier hardware. 
For those interested, pre-reservations for the Galaxy S25 series have started in India. For a small, refundable payment of Rs 1,999, customers in India can pre-reserve their Galaxy S25 ahead of the official launch. This token payment not only guarantees early access to the devices but also lets you avail additional benefits worth Rs 5,000. This offer is available in both online and offline stores. It’s a win-win situation — if you decide not to go through with the purchase, you’ll get your money back. Samsung is sweetening the deal further for customers who pre-order through the company’s official website. Users will have the exclusive chance to choose special-edition colour options and pick from different RAM and storage configurations. On top of that, Samsung is offering the best possible trade-in value for your current smartphone, making it easier to upgrade to the Galaxy S25 series. The Galaxy S25 series is expected to include at least three models — the standard Galaxy S25, the larger Galaxy S25 Plus, and the feature-packed Galaxy S25 Ultra. Rumours suggest there could be a fourth model as well, the Galaxy S25 Slim, which could be Samsung’s thinnest flagship ever. However, reports suggest this sleek device won’t hit the market until later in 2025. While Samsung hasn’t officially revealed all the details about the Galaxy S25 series, expectations are high. The new OneUI 7 is expected to bring a smoother, more intuitive user experience, along with a bunch of new features. On the hardware side, the Galaxy S25 series is likely to pack the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, top-notch camera systems, and Dynamic AMOLED displays. By pre-reserving a Galaxy S25 now, customers can ensure they’re among the first to get their hands on Samsung’s next big thing. Those who take advantage of the pre-reservation scheme will also gain early access to sales, giving them a head start before the general public. It’s worth noting that Samsung’s refundable token amount makes the pre-reservation process risk-free. If you change your mind or don’t find the new Galaxy S25 to your liking after its launch, you can easily get your money back — no strings attached.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's new AI models were trained on 20 million hours of human moves

From eye-catching designs to long battery life and good cameras, these phones offer fantastic value. Here are four top picks for January, including the new Redmi Note 14 Pro+ 5G.advertisementRedmi Note 14 Pro+ 5GThe Redmi Note 14 Pro+ 5G is a standout in the sub-Rs 35,000 segment.

Under the hood, the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor ensures smooth performance, whether you’re multitasking or gaming. Its 6,200mAh battery easily lasts all day, and the 90W fast charging means you’ll be back up and running in no time. The 6.67-inch AMOLED screen is bright and vivid, reaching up to 3,000 nits — perfect for watching videos or playing games. On the camera side, there’s a versatile triple-lens setup: a 50MP main camera with stabilisation, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 50MP telephoto lens. Plus, with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 rating, the phone is tough enough to handle everyday bumps and splashes.Vivo T3 Ultra 5GNext up is the Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, another great choice at this price. This phone is slim and light, weighing just 192g and measuring 7.6mm thick. Despite its sleek design, it packs a 5,500mAh battery which easily lasts more than a day.

This change comes at a crucial time, as Meta tries to balance free speech, content moderation, and political pressures, probably with the incoming US President, Donald Trump. The impact of this decision is wide-ranging, from how misinformation will be managed on platforms like Facebook and Instagram to the future of third-party fact-checking organisations that rely on Meta’s support. Here is the full story in 5 points.advertisementMeta ends fact-checking programMeta’s decision to end its fact-checking program is a big shift in how the social media giant approaches content moderation. The program, once a key part of the company’s efforts to combat misinformation, had been in place for years. It partnered with third-party fact-checkers to verify content on Facebook and Instagram, flagging false information and reducing its spread. However, Zuckerberg has recently pointed to errors in the system and acknowledged that the company had perhaps gone too far in moderating content. In a video statement, Zuckerberg asserted the need to return to Meta’s roots, which he described as prioritising free speech and less interference with user content. He noted that the platform would refocus on ensuring that user expression was not overly restricted, acknowledging that the fact-checking system had faced big criticism, especially from conservative circles, for being too aggressive in its censorship efforts.Is Zuckerberg trying to appease Donald Trump? Meta’s decision to end its fact-checking program is a big shift in how the social media giant approaches content moderation. The program, once a key part of the company’s efforts to combat misinformation, had been in place for years. It partnered with third-party fact-checkers to verify content on Facebook and Instagram, flagging false information and reducing its spread. However, Zuckerberg has recently pointed to errors in the system and acknowledged that the company had perhaps gone too far in moderating content.

He noted that the platform would refocus on ensuring that user expression was not overly restricted, acknowledging that the fact-checking system had faced big criticism, especially from conservative circles, for being too aggressive in its censorship efforts.Is Zuckerberg trying to appease Donald Trump? The timing of Meta’s decision has led many to question whether it is politically motivated. It is being reported that the move coincides with efforts to mend relations with Trump, who has long been a critic of social media platforms for what he views as the suppression of conservative voices. Trump’s criticisms of Facebook and other platforms have centered on claims of censorship, and now that he is back in the political spotlight with another run for the White House, Meta’s decision could possibly be a strategic alignment with Trump’s views, likely to be in his good books. Adding to this perception is Meta’s recent appointment of individuals with ties to Trump, such as Dana White, to its board. These moves suggest that the company is trying to avoid future conflicts with the Trump administration and align itself more closely with conservative ideologies, especially around free speech. Nearly two months ago, Zuckerberg had dinner with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club, during which they discussed Meta's plan to donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee. This gesture could also be Meta's efforts to repair ties with Trump, who was suspended from Meta platforms in 2021 and reinstated in 2023.Meta takes a new approach: Community Notes In place of its traditional fact-checking system, Meta will introduce a new system inspired by Elon Musk’s approach for X (formerly Twitter), called community notes. This system allows users to add context or debunk claims by attaching notes to posts. It is designed to provide a more decentralised approach to fact-checking, giving users more control over what is flagged and how it is explained. While some have praised community notes for promoting different perspectives, others are skeptical about its effectiveness in addressing misinformation. Critics argue that without a central fact-checking authority, false information may still increase, and the system could be manipulated by bad actors to spread misinformation under the guise of context.  Meta’s new Chief Global Affairs Officer, Joel Kaplan, has stated that the new system will be phased in over several months in 2025, with input from various political perspectives to reduce bias. However, the big question remains whether this approach will be enough to satisfy concerns about the spread of false information, particularly in an era where misinformation can easily go viral.A blow to fact-checking organisations Meta’s decision has blindsided many fact-checking organisations that were a key part of its Third-Party Fact-Checking Program. Groups like Lead Stories, which worked closely with Meta to verify content, expressed disappointment and uncertainty about the future. Alan Duke, Editor-in-Chief of Lead Stories, revealed that they had no prior notice of Meta’s plans to end the program, leaving them in a precarious position. The move is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the global fact-checking community, many of whom relied heavily on Meta’s funding and platform partnerships to continue their work. A survey by the International Fact-Checking Network found that 64 per cent of global fact-checkers were part of Meta’s program, and its sudden end raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of these groups.Political and regulatory challenges ahead for Meta? Fact-checking has been a long-standing issue for Republicans, who view Meta's moderation policies as a form of censorship. With Trump re-entering the political scene, Republicans might reignite their criticism of platforms like Facebook for allegedly suppressing conservative views. Trump, in his next term, has indicated plans to challenge companies that endorse moderation, with his FTC pick, Andrew Ferguson, set to target firms accused of ""facilitating censorship."" Zuckerberg says Meta’s latest decision will bring balance to public discourse. But, critics are suggesting that ending fact-checking could lead to a surge in viral misinformation. Alan Duke of Lead Stories believes fact-checking is vital for free speech, as it supports informed debate by verifying facts.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 8, 2025

The company is calling it the Microsoft AI Tour. Nadella addressed an event in Bengaluru on January 7, and today a similar event was hosted by the company in New Delhi. We were in attendance at the event, where the company chief announced its AI efforts in India, partnerships with Indian companies, and its big investments in AI in the country. Among the many announcements was a key partnership that Microsoft announced in collaboration with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) wherein the company aims to skill 5,00,000 students and teachers in AI in India by 2026.  Key initiatives under the partnership not only include skilling 500,000 individuals — students, educators, developers, government officials, and women entrepreneurs — by 2026, it also entails establishing an AI Center of Excellence called AI Catalysts to promote rural AI innovation, support 100,000 AI developers, and foster community-driven solutions. Additionally, 20 AI productivity labs will be set up in National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) and NIELIT centers across 10 states to train 20,000 educators in AI fundamentals.  

 



Microsoft held an AI Tour event in New Delhi on Wednesday
 The collaboration will further focus on creating AI solutions for critical sectors like healthcare, education, accessibility, and agriculture, tailored to India’s unique challenges. It also includes developing foundational AI models with Indic language support and enabling research through Microsoft Research (MSR) India. Eligible AI startups will gain access to Microsoft’s Founders Hub program, which provides technology, mentorship, and business resources.   At the event, Nadella also reiterated that Microsoft will be investing $3 billion in India over the next 2 years. He made this announcement at the Microsoft AI Tour event in Bengaluru on Tuesday.  Additionally, the company has also shared its plans to invest in new data centers to enhance its AI infrastructure. Through its ADVANTA(I)GE India initiative, the company aims to equip 10 million Indians with AI skills by 2030.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also announced that the new data centres that open in India will feature waterless cooling systems and rely on renewable energy, which will contribute to the company’s goal of being carbon negative by 2030.

 



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
 AI is clearly a major focus for Microsoft moving forward. During the event, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and company president Puneet Chandok repeatedly referred to AI as the ""guardian angel"" of the future for consumers. Microsoft envisions a future where consumers fully embrace AI while developers and companies rely on Microsoft’s technology to create AI-driven solutions for users.   Nadella sees significant potential for this vision in India. In a separate fireside chat at the event, he highlighted how AI is not just being discussed in India—it is actively being applied. This, he believes, leads to a rapid rate of diffusion and impact. According to Nadella, India serves as the ideal ground for AI use case studies and implementation. He also emphasized the need for India to focus on frontier AI work and use it to develop tools that support local languages. ""India should do frontier work in AI and use it to develop more local language tools,"" Nadella stated.

Let's find out in this India Today Tech review.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/amazon-eco-spot-review-cute-smart-enough-and-pricey-2661716-2025-01-08,"Let's be honest: we all have a love-hate relationship with alarm clocks. I mean, we like the idea of something helping us wake up on time, but at the same time, we hate it when it actually rings early in the morning. But what if you could personalise your alarm and make your alarm clock do more than just ring? Imagine setting your favourite song as your alarm or assigning different songs to different alarms based on your mood and the time of day. Or maybe you are in the mood to have a bedside conversation with someone. Imagine you could simply say, ""Alexa, what's going on in India right now."" Sounds fancy and fun right?  Well, Amazon has introduced its next-gen Echo Spot in India, a smart alarm clock that does more than just wake you up. The device features a small touch screen, a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker, and Alexa smart assistant. It also comes with a ton of customisable options, that let users set custom displays with various clock faces and colour options. What else? You can also set custom music alarms, play music, podcasts, audiobooks, and display media information on the screen. Another feature is that the Echo Spot integrates with smart home devices, supports voice calls and announcements, and includes privacy features such as a microphone off button. In India, the new Amazon Echo Spot is priced at Rs 8,999. However, as part of a limited-time introductory offer, it is available for Rs 6,449. It's a fancy smart clock, but at the same time, it is quite pricey. So, the question remains: is it worth it, and what difference does it make sitting next to your bedside? Let's find out.Cute and compact  The Amazon Echo Spot has a small and compact design resembling a half-egg. But with an oval cutout at its base so that you can keep it on the table. The device I am reviewing is in black colour, and overall, the design is pretty neat. The Echo Spot has a rubber rim underneath that keeps it stable and rooted on the table. At the back, there is a socket for connecting the power cord. On the spherical top, you'll find three buttons: volume up, volume down, and a microphone button that either turns off the microphone. The same button is also needed to pair the device with the accompanying app on the phone and to connect the device to WiFi while setting it up. On the front, the Echo Spot features a touch screen on top half, and a front-firing speaker below it. 
 


 While the idea of a touch screen is smart and it offers several functions – which I'll get to shortly — the display size could have been larger. Although the display area takes up more than half of the circle, the actual screen is much smaller and doesn't utilise the available space fully. A bit bigger display would have been better.  As for the speaker, the front-firing speaker is covered with a fibre mesh. All in all, the design of the Echo Spot is compact, sturdy, and undeniably cute as a bedside companion.
 


Using the Echo Dot The Amazon Echo Spot needs to be plugged in when you are using it. This is standard with smart speakers, but I feel having a small battery option would have been better. As it stands, the device shuts off as soon as you turn off the switch or experience a power outage, making it unusable in such situations. This is not an issue in countries like the US where power cuts are unusual but in India imagine you have set up an alarm but just when it is about to ring there is a power cut! Unusual use case, but can happen. I mean, a battery inside the Spot would have been nice. 
 


 Once powered on, the device allows you to set custom wallpapers, check the time, date, and more, which is quite useful. I particularly liked the feature of setting custom alarms with my favourite songs, which are pulled from the internet. The touch screen also comes handy and makes it easier to control the device and manage various settings. While the display is bright and easy to navigate, it sometimes lags, which I believe is a UI issue. This problem was more noticeable initially, but after receiving a few updates, the lag became considerably less frequent. The speaker inside the Spot is quite loud and delivers clear, crisp audio with decent bass. It's suitable for casual listening and efficiently responds to Alexa commands, including initiating calls. Speaking of Alexa, the virtual assistant works similar to other assistants by helping with tasks such as controlling the device with voice commands, managing smart appliances, or providing information like the weather and news from the internet. It's fun and useful for casual interactions. Kids in particular would love it. My 5-year-old niece loved it and used Alexa to listen to poems or learn new words. In both Hindi and English language Alexa, with the help of the screen, assisted her in dictation and displayed words on the screen, which helped her learn better and in a fun way.
 


 That said, while Alexa is smart, it's not the smartest or the best virtual assistant available today. I mean Alexa used to be the queen of the hill a few years ago. Now we are in the age of LLMs and ChatGPTs. With the arrival of AI in assistants, virtual assistants have become smarter. For example, Google's Gemini in Live Voice mode not only takes user commands but can also continue a conversation, which makes Alexa feel a bit less smart and dated. This doesn't make Alexa bad. In fact, it's quite good, and for me, it's the only feature of the Spot that makes its price worth it. Not always but occasionally. For example, when I saw my niece having total fun with it I thought, sure the price is 100 per cent worth it. If you are getting it for children, I believe it is a useful gadget. For kids it can be a good assistance to learn and listen to songs or rhymes all while keeping away from smartphones or tablets.advertisementAmazon Eco Spot review verdict The Amazon Echo Spot is a cool gadget to add to your bedside. It looks cute, has a sturdy build, and does more than just show you the date and time or set alarms. Not only does it allow you to set calls hands-free, but you can also personalise the tunes or music you want your alarm to wake you up with. Making the smart clock even smarter is Alexa, which not only helps you seamlessly control your eligible smart devices but is also fun to command for quick music-listening sessions. Just say, ""Alexa, play this,"" and the voice assistant will follow your command.That said, as I mentioned, it's not the smartest virtual assistant right now and has its limitations. Whether it justifies the price tag really depends on whether you truly need a smart alarm clock that doubles as a virtual assistant. As a smart clock, I believe it is overpriced. But if you have kids who can also use it as a fun tool, it is totally worth it. And more so because it can also sing lullabies or tell bed-time stories when these kids are trying to sleep.

But Mark Zuckerberg, by getting rid of fact-checking on Facebook, is doing something more: He is trying to curry favours with Trump as well as getting rid of something that he always found irritating. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/talking-points/story/trump-back-in-power-mark-zuckerberg-uses-it-to-throw-facts-under-the-bus-2661700-2025-01-08,"Facts are never convenient. Just take a look around you, at your friends and family members, at people who you see, or just have a closer look at your thoughts, and you will realise that facts are almost always inconvenient. Because facts are inconvenient, everyone tries to avoid them. Silicon Valley, full of vaunted and utopian-sounding tech companies, never cared much for facts. That is until 2015-16 when the misinformation and this apathy for facts became such a big problem that it erupted in a number of scandals. The biggest of these was the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and CEO, moved to contain the damage around the same time Donald Trump entered the White House. He declared that facts were important because lies, which spread through Facebook, might have helped some politicians. This was the beginning of institutional ""fact-checking"" at Facebook. On January 8, as Trump is on the verge of starting his second term as the US president, Facebook is now officially ending its ""fact-checking.""  What a turnaround in just 8 short years! Mark Zuckerberg announced the change in a quick video. To ensure that people get the message, Meta chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan then went on Fox & friends to reiterate everything that Zuckerberg said.  The times are changing, said Zuckerberg as he highlighted that facts are no longer as important as speech. ""The recent elections feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritising speech,"" he said. ""So, we're restoring free expression on our platforms (and) going to get rid of fact-checkers.""  It is quite clear why Zuckerberg is doing so. There are two aspects to it — both fairly evident.  The move to downgrade facts comes just two weeks before Trump re-enters the White House. When Trump lost elections in 2020, the tech industry which had spent the previous four years fighting him, heaved a sigh of relief and moved quickly to de-platform him. Both Twitter and Facebook banned Trump in the subsequent months. Twitter aka X lifted the ban after Elon Musk bought it. Facebook restored his account in January 2023, but with added surveillance. Then, in the middle of the last year, when it became apparent that Trump might win, the account was restored fully.

Now, with Trump set to take oath as the next US president, big tech is trying to get back into his good books for a variety of reasons. Everyone is sweating and working hard. Some tech CEOs have pledged to donate money for Trump's inauguration ceremony. Some are making all the ""right"" noises. Zuckerberg, in the manner of extending an olive branch, is simply getting rid of ""fact checking"" across his platform, the kind of fact checking that would often target outlandish claims made by Trump supporters. Now, with Trump set to take oath as the next US president, big tech is trying to get back into his good books for a variety of reasons. Everyone is sweating and working hard. Some tech CEOs have pledged to donate money for Trump's inauguration ceremony. Some are making all the ""right"" noises. Zuckerberg, in the manner of extending an olive branch, is simply getting rid of ""fact checking"" across his platform, the kind of fact checking that would often target outlandish claims made by Trump supporters. ""After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy,"" Zuckerberg said on January 8. ""We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US."" Read between the lines and you will realise that Zuckerberg, by getting rid of ""fact checking,"" is simply moving to give the sort of blank check to Trump supporters as far as sharing information — or misinformation — is concerned on Meta platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Well, to Trump supporters as well as to everyone else. But it is also self-serving in another way However, getting into the good books of Trump is only half the story here. Mark Zuckerberg by any measure is a smart person. He is near genius if you look at what he has accomplished and achieved. He is also extremely savvy. Zuckerberg, like most other founders and CEOs in Silicon Valley, is not a fan of regulations. Whether necessary or unnecessary, regulations always irk tech big-wigs like Zuckerberg, Musk and Bezos. They want to create and do things with minimal restrictions and regulations. They believe that many rules, or tasks like fact-checking every bit of information that flows on their platforms, do nothing more than slow them down.  Regulating something costs time, people and money. At the same time, people and money can be better used, or so the tech founders argue, in creating and building something.  When Facebook started its fact-checking program, and created Facebook Content Oversight Board with people like Alan Rusbridger in it, Zuckerberg did so under tremendous pressure. He was facing serious heat from the media and from regulators across the world in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The fact-checking program was not really meant to ""fact check"" but was instead an attempt to ride the tough times. That moment of difficulty has passed. Facts no longer matter anymore and we truly are, as Zuckerberg says, at a ""cultural tipping point."" In other words, this is an opportune moment for Zuckerberg to get out of doing something he was never comfortable with. By getting rid of the fact-checking program, and forcing this checking business back on users by means of Community Notes, just like Elon Musk over at Twitter does, Meta is not just going to save money but also going to avoid the headache that comes by taking responsibility for something.  You see, facts are facts. The problem Zuckerberg cites — ""the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created"" — can be solved differently. It doesn't require getting rid of facts or fact-checking units. Instead, the solution could be to double down on facts and have teams and mechanisms robust enough to overcome political bias fact-checkers might have, whether that bias is left-leaning or right.  But that is not what Zuckerberg is deciding. He is going back to the classic Silicon Valley adage that is we are not the ""arbiters of truth."" In 2020, even while Facebook had an institutionalised fact-checking programme, Zuckerberg was not in favour of it. In an interview with CNBC, he said, ""I don't think that Facebook or internet platforms in general should be arbiters of truth... Political speech is one of the most sensitive parts of a democracy, and people should be able to see what politicians say.""  Unfortunately for him and Facebook until now it was nearly impossible to get out of the fact-checking that the website was forced to start 8 years ago. Such a move would have angered government regulators and would have given the media a chance to again go after Meta. But now with Trump back in power, there is an opportunity. Zuckerberg is seizing it gleefully.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Tune In

Chief Judge Richard Seeborg of the federal court in San Francisco rejected arguments that the search engine company adequately disclosed how its Web & App Activity settings worked, and that users consented to the tracking. Google had also argued that its basic record-keeping ""doesn't hurt anyone."" Users of Android and non-Android mobile devices accused Google of invading their privacy and violating a California law against unauthorised fraudulent computer access by intercepting and saving their personal browsing histories without consent. In a 20-page decision on Tuesday, Seeborg said reasonable users could view Google's conduct as ""highly offensive,"" because the company collected data despite fielding concerns from several employees and knowing its disclosures were ambiguous. He cited internal communications suggesting that Google, a unit of Alphabet, opens new tab, was intentionally vague in distinguishing between data collected inside and outside Google accounts because users might find the truth ""alarming."" On the other hand, Seeborg said the Google employees might simply have been suggesting ways to improve the Mountain View, California-based company's products and services. ""Whether Google or plaintiffs' interpretation prevails is a triable issue of fact,"" he wrote. Google said in a statement on Wednesday: ""Privacy controls have long been built into our service and the allegations here are a deliberate attempt to mischaracterise the way our products work. We will continue to make our case in court against these patently false claims."" Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A jury trial is scheduled for August 18. The lawsuit began in July 2020. Last August, the federal appeals court in San Francisco revived a lawsuit accusing Google of tracking Chrome browser users after they chose not to synchronise their browsers with their Google accounts. Four months earlier, Google agreed to destroy billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it tracked people who thought they were browsing privately, including on Chrome browsers set to ""Incognito"" mode. Law firms representing the plaintiffs in that case valued that settlement at more than $5 billion. The same firms represent the plaintiffs in the current case.

However, there was no mention of these recordings being used for marketing purposes.
Following The Guardian's 2019 report, Apple issued an apology and revised its policy. The recent lawsuit surfaced last week complaining that Apple routinely recorded their private conversations after they activated Siri, and disclosed these conversations to third parties such as advertisers. Here, two plaintiffs said their mentions of ""Air Jordan sneakers"" and ""Olive Garden"" restaurants triggered ads for those products. A report published by The Guardian pointed to a similar issue in 2019. The report revealed that human contractors, responsible for reviewing anonymised recordings and assessing whether the trigger was activated intentionally, occasionally encountered recordings of individuals discussing sensitive topics. However, there was no mention of these recordings being used for marketing purposes.
Following The Guardian's 2019 report, Apple issued an apology and revised its policy. The company made retaining audio recordings from Siri interactions optional by default and assured that for users who consent to share recordings, these would no longer be accessible to third-party contractors. And now Apple has shared the updated policies again. Apple's Siri privacy policy After all the commotion over Siri's user privacy policy, Apple has shared a bunch of details around how Siri works. It also points at how loyal the voice assistant is. The statement stated, ""To protect user privacy, Siri is designed to do as much processing as possible right on a user’s device, allowing for personalised experiences without having to transfer and analyse personal information on Apple servers.""  It explained that when a user interacts with Siri, the request is processed on the device. Based on the requests, Siri decides whether it needs to be sent to Apple servers or not. For a daily task, such as reading unread messages or providing widget suggestions, the processing takes place on the device. While Siri tries to minimise the amount of data consumption, Apple claims that it ""does not retain audio recordings of Siri interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve Siri, and even then, the recordings are used solely for that purpose. Users can easily opt out at any time.""  But it is not untrue that the moment you start speaking about any product, the ads pop up almost immediately. But it is not necessarily Siri. One of the most plausible explanations to this is that some apps secretly record on-screen user activity that was shipped to third-parties, an 2018 investigation suggested.  However, there has also been proof that smartphones come with software to listen to users. Last year, in September, we reported that a marketing firm, whose clients are Google and Facebook, admitted that it uses a phone's microphone to collect information. It stated that it is not just what you search for but also what you speak on the phone that gets you the ads.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also read |  Apple to pay $95 million to settle Siri privacy lawsuitAlso read |  Many Indians among employees fired by Apple for salary fraud by misusing charity clause, says reportAlso read |  After years of gaslighting users, marketing firm finally acknowledges that phones listen in on conversations

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/mangaluru-man-tries-to-sell-his-old-coins-online-ends-up-losing-rs-58-lakh-in-online-scam-2662054-2025-01-09,"In yet another case of online scam, a man from Mangaluru ended up losing Rs 58.26 lakh while attempting to sell old coins through an online platform. The victim came across the platform on Facebook, and as he connected with an individual from the platform, he ended up trapped in the foul play of cybercriminals. The ordeal of the Mangaluru man began on November 25, when the victim, while scrolling through Facebook, came across an advertisement claiming to buy old coins at really high rates, reports Deccan Herald. Enticed by the lucrative offer and to make a quick profit from his old coins, the man contacted the WhatsApp number given in the ad. He even shared that he is interested to sell 15 of his old coins. The recipient then asked him to pay an initial payment of Rs 750 to start the process.  The victim thought this payment was a nominal fee to connect on the platform and sell old coins, so he ended up completing the transaction through UPI.  Shortly after the payment, the victim then received WhatsApp messages from unknown individuals who then demanded the victim make additional payments under various pretexts such as GST processing, insurance, TDS, GPS fees, ITR fees, and even an RBI notice fee to move forward with the selling. The victim believed the words of these individuals, thinking that these payments were necessary for completing the transaction, and transferred the requested amounts via RTGS, NEFT, and UPI. Over time, these payments added up to lakhs. However, the process of selling old coins took a darker turn when, on December 15, the victim received a call from someone introducing himself as Gaurav Shivaji Rao Shinde, purportedly the Mumbai Cyber Police Commissioner. The caller claimed that an RBI notice had been issued against the victim due to his previous transactions and threatened him with arrest unless he paid an additional Rs 12.55 lakh. Fearing legal consequences, the man then went ahead and transferred Rs 9 lakh to a DCB Bank account on December 17. However, as the demands for money continued unabated, the victim began to grow suspicious about the matter. He then questioned the legitimacy of the claims, to which the scammers became aggressive and started threatening him to make him pay more money. However, the victim realised that the process, in fact, was a scam, and he had lost a total of Rs 58.26 lakh to the cyber fraudsters. Following his realization, the victim then filed his complaint at the police station. The case yet again highlights the sophisticated methods employed by cybercriminals to exploit unsuspecting individuals. It is advised to individuals to stay vigilant online. If they come across ads that promise good investment opportunities or other financial gains, they should verify the authenticity of advertisements. Remember that if someone is offering quick way to make money or the offer is too good to be true it is a scam.

According to a tipster, Majin Bu, Apple will either release the iPhone 17 Air or the iPhone SE 4. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-is-rumoured-to-release-either-iphone-se-4-or-iphone-17-air-in-2025-2662140-2025-01-09,"Apple's 2025 line-up has been among the most talked about in the recent past. Earlier, it was thought that Apple would release 5 iPhones this year. These iPhones include the iPhone 17 series (with iPhone 17 Air) and the iPhone SE 4. However, a recent tip by a Majin Bu on X, states that Apple might only launch 4 iPhones this year. According to his sources, the fourth model could either be the iPhone 17 Air or the iPhone SE 4. 
 


 In the post, he stated that Apple's 2025 line-up will definitely include the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max. But, the confusion is around the fourth Apple phone. The tipster states that in 2025, Apple might only reveal either the iPhone 17 Air or the iPhone SE 4 (aka iPhone 16e). He added, ""The code name for this last device should be ""Roma"". If this information turns out to be correct, this would mean that the SE series would turn out to be the Air series."" He has also posted an image of the rumoured iPhone SE 4.  This means, if this is true, then the entire iPhone 17 Air rumour will be trashed. However, the other angle could be that Apple might not release the iPhone 17 Air in 2025. It might unveil the phone in 2026 and still associate it to the 17 series. iPhone SE 4: What do we know Before this tip, we were of the opinion that Apple might release iPhone SE 4 in April. Recently, a trusted Apple source, Mark Gurman, posted that if everything stays on track and Apple is able to meet the decided timeline, the iPhone SE 4 might be released by April. Rumours and leaks suggest that Apple may rebrand its upcoming SE 4 as the iPhone 16e. It appears the company plans to align the budget-friendly iPhone SE with its flagship series moving forward. The new model is also anticipated to feature significant upgrades compared to its predecessors. Read all about the iPhone SE 4 here. iPhone 17 Air: What to expect The iPhone 17 Air was expected to be the thinnest iPhone in the Apple-verse. However, the launch was anticipated to take place with the 17 series. Based on tradition, the iPhone 17 is speculated to arrive in September 2024.  The iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to be the most exciting one this year. The design is expected to be thinner than the iPhone 6. Apple is reportedly planning to use its own custom-designed 5G modem chip to achieve this, which is said to be smaller than Qualcomm's version, allowing for more efficient use of internal space. The company has also optimised the device's internal layout to maintain battery life, camera quality, and display performance. Read more about the iPhone 17 Air here.

There are two phones — the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R. These are also the first phones that are part of OnePlus Project Starlight, the company’s programme specifically for Indian users. As part of the programme OnePlus is aiming to give Indian users something unique, the kind of features that take into account India conditions and use cases. So, even as the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R pack in powerful hardware, capable cameras and new battery tech alongside premium design, they also have unique features such as support for 5.5G network. The OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R are the first smartphones in India with such a support.  While the technology is network agnostic, currently the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R will support 5.5G network on Jio. This is because OnePlus and Jio have worked together to test the feature before the launch of the two phones.  During its winter launch event, OnePlus announced that it has collaborated with Jio to offer users the next phase of 5G technology — dubbed 5.5G. This upgraded 5G network is based on Component Carrier Aggregation (3CC) technology, which allows devices to connect to multiple network cells simultaneously, ensuring faster download speeds and reduced latency. “The OnePlus 13 series are the first devices to feature 5.5G in India, thanks to our partnership with Jio,” says James Paterson, OnePlus senior global PR manager. “Cutting-edge 5.5G technology allows your OnePlus 13 series device to connect to three different network cells, possibly even on different towers at the same time, for faster connectivity and better overall performance. We’ve worked hard to ensure our phone provides the most stable network connection anywhere in India.”
 


During the launch event, OnePlus conducted a live demo to show the practical benefits of the faster 5.5G network. It compared download speeds on a standard 5G network versus the 5.5G network. During this test with the OnePlus 13, the device achieved a peak download speed of 1,014.86 Mbps on Jio’s 5.5G network, outperforming the 277.78 Mbps recorded on a traditional non-3CC 5G network. OnePlus highlighted how the upgraded 5.5G network offers up to 380 per cent  improved speed, providing users with fast and stable internet connections.To help users identify connectivity to the 5.5G network, OnePlus revealed that on the OnePlus 13 or OnePlus 13R, devices connected to the 5.5G network will display a “5GA” icon. However, connecting to the upgraded network does not require any additional tweak in settings. It is automatic, depending on the availability of the network.How will this benefit Indian users?

Jio is operating its 5.5G network exclusively on standalone (SA) 5G networks, utilising advanced carrier aggregation to connect devices to multiple network cells. This new connectivity allows the telecom provider to offer users faster data speeds and a seamless, stable mobile experience on 5.5G-supported devices. Once connected to the network, users will enjoy faster downloads for movies, apps, and updates, significantly reducing wait times. With improved speeds and reduced latency, the network will also offer users lag free streaming of high-definition content, including 4K videos, or gaming streams will be smoother than on traditional networks. Mobile gamers, in particular, will benefit from lower latency and quicker response times, maintaining a smooth and lag free gaming experience across multiple titles. Additionally, the 5.5G network also provides clearer voice and video calls, even in challenging and hard-to-reach network areas like basements, crowded public spaces, while traveling, or in remote locations.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also Read |  Mangaluru man tries to old coins online, ends up losing Rs 58 lakh in scam Also Read |  Amazon Echo Spot review: Cute, smart enough and priceyAlso Read |  OnePlus 13R vs OnePlus 12R: 5 Big upgrades

As per the report shared by Telegram, it fulfilled 900 requests in 2024, impacting 2,253 users, a sharp rise from just 14 requests affecting 108 users during the first nine months of the year. The spike occurred primarily between October and December, following the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov in France in August 2024. Durov was detained in August at Le Bourget Airport under allegations related to Telegram’s handling of criminal activities on its platform. French authorities accused him of failing to implement adequate measures to prevent abuse, including cases of fraud, organised crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, and cyberbullying. Investigators described the arrest as a move to end what they called “Telegram’s impunity.” Shortly after Durov’s arrest, Telegram updated its privacy policy to allow sharing user data, such as IP addresses and phone numbers, with law enforcement in response to valid legal requests. Previously, its policy restricted data sharing to cases related to terrorism, and the company stated it had never disclosed user data under that framework. The policy revision marks a significant shift, coinciding with the rise in fulfilled data requests in the last quarter of the year.
The Transparency Report highlighted that the requests primarily sought IP addresses and phone numbers.  That said, why should you care about it? Isn’t the data being shared to the US government? True. However, the sharp rise in data requests fulfilled by Telegram has significant implications for all its users. It highlights the growing tension between privacy and legal compliance, raising questions about the security of personal information shared on the platform.  Telegram’s revised privacy policy, allowing the disclosure of IP addresses and phone numbers to law enforcement, marks a departure from its earlier, stricter privacy stance. This shift is particularly concerning given the dramatic increase in requests fulfilled in just three months, suggesting a potential precedent for broader data access in the future.  For users, this underscores the need for vigilance about how their data might be used or accessed, even on platforms reputed for prioritising privacy. The developments also point to a larger issue: the extent to which tech companies can protect user data while adhering to government demands, a challenge that affects digital privacy across all platforms.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also read |  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman faces allegations of sexual assault by sister: Story in 5 pointsAlso read |  Siri spying on you for ads?

The service, called the AI Subscription Club, will be available starting next month, offering users access to Samsung's AI technology through a monthly fee. As reported by South Korean publication ETNews, Samsung Electronics Vice Chair Han Jong-hee has announced that the subscription plan will apply to both Galaxy smartphones and the company’s newly launched Ballie AI robot. Samsung launched the AI Subscription Club in December 2024 for select home appliances in South Korea. Now, this paid service will be available for more Samsung devices, including Samsung Galaxy smartphones and the Ballie robot. The subscription model will allow users to access AI-powered products such as smartphones, TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines for a recurring fee. The subscription will also offer users options for repair and maintenance services. Although the subscription service offers access to additional features, Samsung has clarified that it is not required to use the core AI features of Galaxy smartphones and other devices. Users will still have access to these AI features for free until at least the end of 2025, with no confirmation of plans beyond that date. Notably, Samsung has recently launched the Ballie robot, which will also be available through the subscription service. Ballie is designed to act as a personal assistant and home companion. Initially, it will be available for customers in South Korea and the United States. This development is part of Samsung's plan to integrate AI into a variety of products, offering an interconnected ecosystem of devices. Although it is still not clear whether the AI Subscription Club will expand beyond South Korea, Samsung is expected to provide more details about the service during its Galaxy Unpacked event, scheduled for January 22, 2025, in San Jose, California. At this event, the company is expected to reveal its Galaxy S25 series and may share additional information about the availability of the subscription plan in other regions. Meanwhile, the highlight of the event will be the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series. The new flagship series is said to launch Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 Ultra. The new series is highly anticipated to bring significant upgrades including upgrades to Samsung’s Galaxy AI. Announcing the launch event, Samsung said,  “The next evolution of Galaxy AI is coming and it’s going to change the way you interact with the world every day.

d78a88cf-8ffd-4e37-9504-2cb2ad414f6c,"Xiaomi Pad 7 quick review: An iPad Air competitor?Xiaomi is launching the Pad 7 in India on January 10. Ahead of the launch, we at India Today Tech, got our hands on the upcoming tablet. Here is a quick look at what it looks like and what it has to offer. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/xiaomi-pad-7-quick-review-an-ipad-air-competitor-2662320-2025-01-09,"Xiaomi is gearing up to launch its new Xiaomi Pad 7 in India on January 10. The device already made its debut in the Chinese market last year, in 2024, and now it is all set for its entry in India. Ahead of the launch, I got my hands on the new Pad 7, and this device has left me impressed. The new Xiaomi Pad 7 is sleek and incredibly lightweight. The new keyboard with a built-in touchpad, paired with Xiaomi Pen, is a cherry on top. However, before I share my initial impressions of the Xiaomi Pad 7, let’s take a quick look at what’s inside. The Xiaomi Pad 7 features the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset and runs on Xiaomi’s HyperOS. It boasts an 11.2-inch IPS LCD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, HDR10, Dolby Vision support, and up to 800 nits brightness. Under the hood, it packs an 8,850mAh battery with support for 45W turbocharging. Paired with the OS are also AI-driven features like AI writing and Xiaomi Creations. The Xiaomi Pad 7 will also come with a variant that has a Nano Texture Display, but that will be reserved for the top-end variant –– that’s not the one we are testing. We are hoping to get our hands on it soon. For now, I have been spending my days testing the one with LCD display. I will share my detailed experience of using the Xiaomi Pad 7 in the full review soon, but for now, here’s my first impression.Oh so light! As soon as I unboxed the Xiaomi Pad 7, I was instantly impressed by how lightweight and sleek it is. The device I am reviewing comes in an iridescent purple shade, which adds to its premium and stylish look. The aluminum build of the Pad feels solid yet easy to grip. In fact, with my small palms, I can easily hold and use it with one hand.
 


 At the back, there’s a 10-megapixel camera housed in a square island design similar to the ones seen in Xiaomi’s flagship smartphones. On the sides, you’ll find a total of four speaker grilles, a power button, a USB-C port for charging, volume buttons, and a magnetic cutout for attaching the Xiaomi Pen. As far as design is concerned, the Xiaomi Pad 7 is pretty much a 10/10.
 


Smooth display and crisp audio The display looks smooth and bright. I have been watching YouTube videos and Netflix shows, and I am totally loving the display quality so far. The speakers are loud, crisp, and clear, making the multimedia experience quite enjoyable. I even tried playing some games like Candy Crush and Minecraft. The tablet runs them all smoothly. I also tried the built-in Mi Canvas for doodling, and I am impressed by the improved Xiaomi Pen with its low latency. The new keyboard with a built-in trackpad –– which doubles as a cover for the tablet –– is also quite well-made, and the trackpad makes work much easier. In fact, I am using the tablet right now to write this first impression and I even file my stories in the CMS. The smooth and tactile keys are letting me type quicker and the trackpad is definitely helping me get work done more easily, even making me ditch the laptop for a while.
 


Final thoughts – for now! I am yet to put the device through its paces still, but for now I can say that this tablet has the potential to be one of the best Android tablets you can find in the market. I am using it for both work and entertainment and really enjoying the performance it has to offer. Stay tuned for the full review of the Xiaomi Pad 7. It's coming sooner than you think.

In our quick review, we found that it has the potential to deliver impressively on both fronts. Here's India Today Tech's quick review of the smartphone.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/oppo-reno-13-pro-quick-review-promises-big-photography-and-ai-upgrades-2662228-2025-01-09,"Oppo’s Reno flagships for 2025 are here, bringing some big promises. The company has launched two smartphones in the Reno 13 series: the Reno 13 and the Reno 13 Pro. Oppo has sent us the Pro variant for review, which we have been using for a couple of days. While we are still testing the device for our final verdict, even in this short time, there’s already plenty to talk about regarding the Oppo Reno 13 Pro. In this brief time, we have largely enjoyed almost every aspect of the phone –– it has a large and bright display, it has a design that stands out from most of its competitors', it has a battery that can really last, amongst other things. However, what truly has our attention here is its cameras and AI features.  It may be a little premature to say this, because we are still in the process of putting the device through its paces, but our first impressions of the device is that with the Reno 13 Pro, Oppo is trying to bring you the smarts of the Find X series on a budget.  For a smartphone priced under Rs 50,000, the Oppo Reno 13 Pro’s camera impresses with not just a strong set of lenses but also excellent AI integration that makes it remarkably easy to capture great photos. We took a trip to Thailand with Oppo, where we tested the phone’s cameras, and tried out a bunch of its AI features. In the short time we used it, we captured several daylight, macro, and night shots — and rarely ended up with a bad photo.

 



Oppo Reno 13 Pro 5G's purple and white colour variants sport a beautiful butterfly design pattern.
 What stands out is the ease of taking quality pictures. While all cameras can produce both good and bad shots depending on factors like lighting, camera setup, and the photographer’s skill, Oppo has significantly minimised the margin for error with its solid AI software. The AI in the Reno 13 Pro’s cameras is able to analyse your surroundings, adjust to lighting conditions, and optimise your subject, ensuring consistently good results. For scenarios where automatic AI adjustments fall short, there are a variety of AI tools on the phone.  We tested many of these tools with the Oppo Reno 12 Pro as well. While we didn’t notice a dramatic improvement in the majority of the tools themselves, features like the AI Shadow Remover and AI Clean Up were nonetheless quite useful. We plan to test these AI tools further for our detailed review.  Apart from its camera and AI capabilities, the battery performance of the Reno 13 Pro is equally impressive. While we still plan to run benchmarks for comprehensive testing, our initial experience suggests that the phone’s battery performs quite well. During our trip to Thailand that we mentioned, we were out for an entire day, starting around 9 am and returning to our hotel only by 8 pm. Throughout the day, we extensively used the phone’s camera, kept it running as a hotspot, and actively used WhatsApp and social media apps. Despite this heavy usage, the phone didn’t require charging until the next day, which is a promising sign of its battery endurance. That said, a smartphone isn’t just about its individual features—it’s difficult to recommend a device unless it delivers a well-rounded experience. This is precisely what we aim to evaluate in our review of the Oppo Reno 13 Pro, which we will share next week. There are still several aspects of the phone to test, including its overall performance, gaming capabilities, battery endurance, and camera quality in challenging lighting conditions. Most importantly, we’ll assess how seamlessly these features work together and whether the phone justifies its price tag. Stay tuned for our in-depth review of the Oppo Reno 13 Pro 5G.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also read |  Redmi 14C 5G quick review: A promising phone under Rs 10,000Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?

The prices start at Rs 21,999 for the Poco X7, while the X7 Pro starts at Rs 27,999 — inclusive of offers. In my initial testing, the X7 Pro already feels like the better deal. And no, not just because it’s the pricier option, but because those extra Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 seem to pack a lot of bang for your buck. Still, both phones bring their own quirks and trade-offs. Here’s a quick breakdown.advertisementPoco X7 series: Design and displayDesign is where these phones — the X7 and X7 Pro, grab attention. My teammate jokingly called the phones “the taxi finish,” thanks to their bright two-tone colourways, dubbed Poco Yellow. Both phones have plastic builds, faux leather finishes, and little extras like an IR blaster. But the real twist? The Poco X7, the affordable model of the two, has a curved display, while the X7 Pro comes with a flat panel. Design is where these phones — the X7 and X7 Pro, grab attention. My teammate jokingly called the phones “the taxi finish,” thanks to their bright two-tone colourways, dubbed Poco Yellow. Both phones have plastic builds, faux leather finishes, and little extras like an IR blaster. But the real twist? The Poco X7, the affordable model of the two, has a curved display, while the X7 Pro comes with a flat panel.  Curved screens are usually reserved for pricier devices, so it’s an interesting choice here. While I personally prefer flat displays, the X7’s curve adds a premium touch. Plus, it’s protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2, which Poco claims offers better drop resistance—a necessity for curved panels. The X7 Pro, meanwhile, has Gorilla Glass 7i, which is slightly less rugged but fine for the flat design, likely saving some production costs. Both phones feature gorgeous 1.5K AMOLED displays with 120Hz refresh rates and plenty of brightness for indoor and outdoor use. Design-wise, I lean toward the X7 Pro’s boxier profile—it feels more refined in hand. That said, the X7’s curved display will undoubtedly catch eyes, especially in the Indian market.

 Overall, the devices are sure to entice their target audiences. In the meantime, I’m looking forward to spending more time with both the X7 and X7 Pro to see how they perform in other areas like battery life, camera quality, and overall speed.Poco X7 series: Performance, battery and camera Performance is where the Poco X7 series shows a clear distinction. The Poco X7 is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra chipset, which delivers good numbers for its segment. But the X7 Pro steps it up with a flagship-grade MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset, setting a new benchmark in the sub-Rs 30,000 price range. This was evident during benchmark testing.  While the scores of the Poco X7 are pretty much in line with other phones such as the Nothing Phone 2a or the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, the Poco X7 Pro punched above its weight, scoring numbers typically seen on pricier phones. Adding to its edge are LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage, carried over from the X6 Pro. I personally loved the X6 Pro for gaming, and from early impressions, the X7 Pro looks like a worthy successor, possibly even better in this department.  Battery life is another area where the X7 Pro shines. Its massive 6,550mAh battery, paired with 90W fast charging, puts the X7’s 5,500mAh battery with 45W charging to shame. Don’t get me wrong — the X7’s endurance is respectable and should last a full day with moderate use. But the X7 Pro’s larger battery and quicker charging setup feel way ahead, making it a strong contender for heavy users. The X7 Pro also gets a leg up in the software department. It runs HyperOS 2.0 on top of Android 15, which feels faster and smoother than its predecessor, offering better animations, transitions, and more customisation options. Sadly, the X7 misses out on HyperOS 2.0 and launches with the older HyperOS atop Android 14. While this may not be a dealbreaker for many, it feels like a missed opportunity, especially for a new phone — which was also the case with the recently launched Poco M7 Pro.

 As for the camera, the setup is where things get interesting. The Poco X7 comes with a triple-lens system — a 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. It also has a 20-megapixel front camera for selfies. The X7 Pro, meanwhile, opts for a dual-camera setup — a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-600 main sensor with OIS and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, paired with a 20-megapixel front camera. While the X7’s extra lens may appeal to spec-sheet enthusiasts, the Pro’s superior hardware and ISP lead to better photos, especially in tricky lighting conditions. Initial results suggest the Pro is the better choice for photography, but I’ll spend some more time testing these cameras to give a final verdict.Poco X7 series is promising  The Poco X7 and X7 Pro bring some exciting features to the mid-range segment, with the Pro standing out as a more complete package for those willing to spend a bit more. Especially when you consider that the X7 Pro is available in the sub-Rs 30,000 range and offers standout features like a massive 6,550mAh battery, UFS 4.0 storage, the latest software, and a flagship-grade Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset — it’s easy to see why the X7 Pro could be yet another winner for Poco. That said, the X7 still holds its own, and it’ll be interesting to see how it performs for what it’s worth. I’ll dive deeper into camera quality, battery performance, and everything else in the detailed review, so stay tuned for that.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also read |  OnePlus 13 review: Solid flagship phone for smart buyersAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in January 2024: Redmi Note 14 Pro+ and moreAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 15,000 in January 2024: Poco M7 Pro 5G, CMF Phone 1 and more

According to a TechCrunch report, Google Trends highlights increased interest in deleting Facebook and Instagram. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/many-users-now-searching-how-to-delete-facebook-instagram-as-meta-scraps-fact-checking-report-2662651-2025-01-10,"In a move that has sparked considerable backlash, Meta has announced it will no longer be implementing its fact-checking measures on certain posts across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, on January 7, 2025. This decision has led to a noticeable increase in the number of users contemplating or actively pursuing account deletions, as many feel the removal of these safeguards compromises the integrity of the information shared on Meta’s networks. Fact-checking on social media platforms has been a vital tool in curbing the spread of false or misleading information, especially during critical events such as elections and public health crises. Meta’s initiative to integrate fact-checking was initially seen as a step toward restoring credibility in an environment often rife with viral hoaxes, fake news, and propaganda. However, with the discontinuation of these measures, the concern is that users may be exposed to an even greater volume of unreliable content. The impact of Meta’s decision has already been felt in the form of increased discussions surrounding the safety and reliability of its platforms. Many users, especially those advocating for more transparency and accountability from social media giants, have voiced their discontent and begun exploring alternatives. Some have begun deleting their accounts or reducing their time spent on the platforms, citing concerns that Meta’s shift may allow harmful content to flourish unchecked. A report, published by TechCrunch, highlights how users are increasingly looking for social networks or platforms with stronger content moderation policies as a means to ensure a safer and more trustworthy online experience. The report states, “Google searches for terms like “how to permanently delete Facebook” hit a maximum score of 100 — the highest level of interest possible on Google Trends.”  The report adds that Google Trends data shows a sharp spike in searches like “how to delete all photos on Facebook,” “alternatives to Facebook,” “how to quit Facebook,” “how to delete a Threads account,” and “how to delete an Instagram account without logging in.” These terms have experienced an explosive increase in popularity, rising over 5,000 per cent compared to earlier periods.

Furthermore, the timing of Meta’s move has raised concerns, particularly as misinformation remains a persistent issue, especially with political seasons and global events on the horizon. The loss of fact-checking is seen by critics as a major setback in the fight against the spread of false information online. Meta's decision to reduce fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram has led to heightened dissatisfaction among users who view the move as a step backward in ensuring the platforms remain a reliable source of information. As a defence, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg states that this decision is an attempt to restore free speech. Interestingly, when Elon Musk took over X (formerly Twitter), he stated something similar. The CEO of Meta mentioned that his platforms would replace third-party fact-checkers with a community notes system similar to X's, allowing users to flag posts they believe require additional context. As alternative social media options gain traction, it remains to be seen whether Meta’s strategy will ultimately alienate its user base or simply redefine the role of fact-checking in the future of digital communication.

4bf2b8c6-4492-4175-8b98-1ffbfcb02a26,"As Meta scraps fact-checking, its new content policy seen as offensive and dehumanisingMeta is facing flak for its new content moderation policies which now reportedly allow highly offensive slurs and dehumanising language. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-content-moderation-policy-for-facebook-and-instagram-revealed-users-call-it-dehumanising-2662663-2025-01-10,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is under fire for recent changes to its content moderation policies, which now permit a wider range of derogatory speech targeting various racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identities. Internal training material obtained by The Intercept reveal examples of the now-allowable speech, including highly offensive slurs and dehumanising language.  The policy overhaul coincides with Meta's suspension of its fact-checking program, a move aimed at ""lifting restrictions to allow more speech,"" according to a company statement issued on Tuesday. Joel Kaplan, Meta's new global policy chief, defended the shift as an effort to address the growing complexity of content management across the platform. CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed similar sentiments, positioning the changes as a means to foster freer ideological and political expression.   However, critics argue that these changes open the floodgates to harmful rhetoric and misinformation on social media. The said training documents that have surfaced outline how moderators are now instructed to handle posts under the revised hate speech policy. The materials include examples of posts deemed acceptable under the new guidelines, such as derogatory comments about immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and minorities, which were previously prohibited.  Meta on January 7, 2025, announced that it would cease implementing fact-checking measures across its platforms. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that the fact-checking team were making too many mistakes. The team, of course, fought back and said that Zuckerberg’s claims are untrue. This decision has already been quite unpopular among Meta critics around the world, who believe that Zuckerberg only made this change in content policy to appease the new US President, Donald Trump.  Besides, the move has also raised alarms because fact-checking is viewed as a crucial tool for combating misinformation, particularly during elections and public health crises. The removal of these safeguards, critics say, could exacerbate the spread of false narratives and harmful propaganda. 
Consequently, reports suggest that Google Searches on how to delete Facebook and Instagram are surging. There has reportedly also been reduced engagement on Facebook and Instagram ever since the change in policy. Users, particularly those advocating for greater accountability from social media companies, fear that Meta’s policy changes will compromise the safety and reliability of its platforms.   Meta’s fact-checking initiative, which was launched in December 2016, was introduced during a period of heightened scrutiny over the proliferation of fake news. The program was initially lauded as a step toward restoring trust. By flagging and limiting the reach of misleading content, the company aimed to curb the influence of viral hoaxes and disinformation campaigns. The discontinuation of these measures, however, signals a stark reversal, leaving many to question Meta’s commitment to transparency and public responsibility.   The changes have broader implications for the online ecosystem. As harmful content and misinformation potentially flourish unchecked, social media’s role as a source of credible information comes into question. Advocates for responsible digital governance argue that platforms like Meta must prioritise user safety and the integrity of shared information over unregulated free expression.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/you-can-now-buy-laptops-monitors-and-printers-on-blinkit-2662697-2025-01-10,"Blinkit, the quick-commerce platform known for delivering groceries and daily essentials in minutes, is now venturing further into the electronics segment. Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa announced the expansion on X, revealing that users can now order laptops, monitors, printers, and more directly through the platform, with delivery promised in as little as 10 minutes.   “You can now get laptops, monitors, printers and more delivered in 10 minutes! We're expanding our electronics range to cover more use cases and have partnered up with leading brands in this category. We've got: 
â€â Laptops from HP
â€â Monitors from Lenovo, Zebronics and MSI
â€â Printers from Canon and HP
Currently live in - Delhi NCR, Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Lucknow. Most of these will be delivered by our large order fleet,” Albinder Dhindsa announced in a post on X.
 


 The initiative marks Blinkit’s partnership with leading electronics brands, allowing customers to access a wider range of tech products conveniently. Currently, Blinkit is offering laptops from HP, monitors from Lenovo, Zebronics, and MSI, and printers from Canon and HP. Printer cartridges from HP and Canon are also available, with plans to add Epson cartridges in the near future.   Dhindsa stated that this service is currently live in major cities, including Delhi NCR, Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Lucknow. The deliveries, especially for larger items, will be handled by Blinkit's specialised large-order fleet. The company also hinted at plans to expand its portfolio further, bringing more brands and products to its customers soon.   Blinkit’s move to deliver electronics like laptops, monitors, and printers in just 10 minutes could be a game-changer for consumers, but it could spell trouble for small stores and authorised dealers. With this model, Blinkit eliminates middlemen, allowing customers to access products at competitive prices without the hassle of visiting physical stores. For businesses paying high rents and bearing hefty staff costs, this could mark a significant challenge as they struggle to compete with the convenience and speed of Blinkit’s service. Blinkit Ambulance The announcement of tech deliveries comes on the heels of another significant move by Blinkit. Last week, the platform launched a 10-minute ambulance service, starting in Gurugram. Users in the area can now book ambulances for emergencies via the Blinkit app. The company promises rapid response, with ambulances dispatched to reach users within 10 minutes.   While currently in its testing phase, the Blinkit ambulance service represents a significant leap for the platform. Dhindsa has indicated that this initiative is expected to expand across cities in the coming months, aiming to provide a critical service for emergencies.

While authorities in the US have named and issued warrants against six individuals in connection with the fraud, reports suggest that a significant number of those who have been fired are Indian employees allegedly exploiting Telugu charity organisations in the US as part of the scheme. Here is a quick lowdown on the whole story in 5 points.advertisement–Fraudulent misuse of Apple’s Matching Grants programInternal sources confirmed to India Today Tech that around 50 employees were fired by Apple from its Cupertino headquarters following allegations of fraudulent misuse of the company’s Matching Grants program. This corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative is designed to amplify employee donations by matching them for nonprofit organisations. However, some employees allegedly falsified donations in collaboration with nonprofits to exploit the program, ultimately pocketing Apple’s matching contributions. Authorities in the US identified 6 individuals in defrauding Apple of approximately $152,000 over 3 years.–How the scheme workedThe fraud at Apple involved employees donating money to nonprofits, which Apple then matched through the program. The nonprofits reportedly returned the original donations to the employees, enabling them to retain Apple’s matching funds. Additionally, the executive at the nonprofits reportedly wrote off these fictitious donations on tax returns, leading to potential violations of US tax laws.

Kwan, described as the ringleader, reportedly played a dual role as CEO of Hop4Kids and accountant for the American Chinese International Cultural Exchange (ACICE), the nonprofits involved in the fraud. These nonprofits allegedly facilitated false donation claims, retaining Apple’s matching funds and defrauding state authorities.  –Involvement of Indian employees and Telugu charities A separate report highlights that among the fired employees, many were Indian nationals who reportedly misused Telugu charity organisations in the US to carry out the fraud. These nonprofits, allegedly linked to the Telugu community, were purportedly part of the scheme to create false donation records and funnel the money back to employees. Notably, none of the 6 individuals charged are Indian.–Apple remains silent; broader implications  Apple has not issued an official statement regarding the termination or allegations. The revelations have sparked discussions about the potential for misuse in CSR programs and the need for stricter oversight. Fraud of this nature undermines the integrity of charitable initiatives and raises serious legal and ethical concerns. While the case primarily focuses on 50 terminated employees now, there were reports earlier that claimed that around 185 employees were fired.

For years, the Air models of MacBook and iPad have been much loved for offering top-end specifications while keeping the design and price relatively light for users. Now, if rumors are to be believed, Apple could bring an Air variant to its iPhone lineup this year – likely called the iPhone 17 Air.

This model is rumoured to be thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro and is also expected to use Apple’s in-house custom-designed 5G modem chip. Additionally, the iPhone Air model is said to replace the Plus variants, positioning itself among the four flagship models Apple launches every year. The iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to launch in September 2025 during Apple’s annual fall event. However, since September is months away, reports suggest that the iPhone 17 Air is still in its early production stages. There is also a possibility that unforeseen technical challenges or strategic decisions could push the launch to 2026. In fact, a recent report by leaker Majun Bin hinted that this year, Apple might either launch the iPhone SE4 or the iPhone 17 Air, in the 4 flagship lineup.  While Apple has not revealed anything officially, leaks and rumors buzzing on the internet give us hints about what to expect from this ultra-thin iPhone. Let’s take a detailed look at everything we know so far about the upcoming iPhone 17 Air.iPhone 17 Air pricing in India Reports suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will replace the Plus model in the iPhone lineup. If this is the case, the pricing could start at around USD 899 – similar to the iPhone 16 Plus, which starts at Rs 89,900 in India. However, there are also speculations that the iPhone 17 Air could be positioned as a premium model, potentially surpassing the USD 1,199 starting price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, depending on its design and features.Thinnest iPhone The defining feature of the iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to be its ultra-thin design. Reports suggest the device will measure just 6mm in thickness, significantly slimmer than the 7.8mm iPhone 16. If true, the iPhone 17 Air could become Apple’s thinnest device, surpassing even the sleek iPad Pro models. To achieve this slim profile, Apple is reportedly working on advanced display technology known as Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI). This hardware innovation combines the touch and display layers, reducing the overall thickness of the OLED panel. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 6.6-inch OLED display with support for 120Hz ProMotion technology, ensuring smooth visuals and responsiveness. However, the thin design may come at a cost. Reports indicate that Apple might reduce the battery capacity due to technical limitations and high production costs.Simplified camera While it remains unclear whether the iPhone 17 Air will be a standard or premium iPhone, rumors suggest it may feature a simplified camera system. The device might house a single 48-megapixel rear camera, eliminating the ultrawide lens found in the iPhone 16 Plus. This design choice could save space and contribute to the slim profile. The high-resolution main camera is expected to support digital zoom by cropping into the image – a method Apple has refined in previous models. On the front, the iPhone 17 Air is rumored to include a 24-megapixel TrueDepth camera, an upgrade from the 12-megapixel sensors seen in earlier iPhones.Performance  The iPhone 17 Air is likely to be powered by Apple’s new A19 chipset, a successor to the A18 found in the iPhone 16 series. While the A19 may still use a 3nm process rather than a next-gen 2nm architecture, it is expected to deliver improved performance and energy efficiency. Additionally, the device is rumored to feature 8GB of RAM, supporting Apple’s advanced on-device AI features. Apple may also introduce an in-house Wi-Fi chip, signaling its shift toward greater hardware self-reliance.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Also Read |  Xiaomi Pad 7 quick review: An iPad Air competitor?Also Read |  Samsung will launch paid subscription plan for Galaxy smartphones starting next monthAlso Read |  OnePlus 13, 13R support Jio 5.5G network: What does that mean for the user

b06be793-8add-4afd-a170-80826b3fac5f,"OnePlus 13R review: Great hardware, loaded with features, and a killer priceOnePlus is back with two top-end phones — the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R. Of the two, we find in this review that the OnePlus 13R may prove to be a fan-favourite due to its combination of great hardware, ample top-end features and a killer price of just Rs 42,999. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/oneplus-13r-review-great-hardware-loaded-with-features-and-a-killer-price-2662965-2025-01-10,"Just a few days ago, here at India Today Tech, we reviewed the latest and, in fact, the greatest flagship from OnePlus — the OnePlus 13. The device absolutely impressed us with its new more-modern yet lighter design, impressive battery, the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and a capable camera system. And yet I think that OnePlus 13 might not be the best OnePlus phone that the company has launched this month. If I take into account the value proposition, and the prices, I feel absolutely no hesitation in saying that the OnePlus 13R is the real star this time. It gives almost everything you may want from a phone, complete with top-end hardware, and yet costs significantly less. It is as good as the OnePlus 12, and fairly close to OnePlus 13, and yet its price is around 30 to 40 per cent less than these two “true” flagships.  You see, last year when I reviewed the OnePlus 12R, I totally loved what the affordable flagship offered. However, there were a few things — like the overall camera performance — which I wished was better. But regardless of that, overall, the OnePlus 12R was almost perfect and indeed a flagship killer in 2024. Cut to 2025, I got my hands on the OnePlus 13R, and let me tell you, this phone not only fills in those gaps that showed up on its predecessor but it performs better — way better — in almost all areas. But wait, before you think I am completely smitten with the new OnePlus 13R, I will tell you I am not. There are a few areas which I find irksome, although they may not impact the user experience for most people. For example, I am not a fan of its boxy — and more modern, I suppose — design or the reduced charging support of 80W, which is down from 100W. But in the big picture these are niggles and nitpicks. Overall, I do feel at Rs 42,999 — and with some launch discounts the price is even lower — the OnePlus 13R is an absolute gem of a phone.   You see the potency of the OnePlus 13R, and just how close it is to last year’s flagship, the OnePlus 12, as soon as you look at its specs. It is loaded. The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset — the flagship-level chipset we earlier saw in Rs 60,000 to Rs 1 lakh phones last year. The device runs on the latest OxygenOS 15, which offers a smooth and clean UI, and this time OnePlus has included the biggest battery ever in the R series — it measures 6000 mAh. On the front, the device has a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with up to a 120Hz refresh rate and 4500 nits peak brightness. This too is an LTPO display, complete with ProXDR monicker and 10-bit colour support, and hence it comes with variable refresh rate of 1Hz-120Hz.  For the very first time, the OnePlus 13R has also included a new type of glass called Gorilla Glass 7i on the front and back, adding to the durability of the device. For photography, the new OnePlus 13R includes the similar triple-camera setup we saw in the OnePlus 12 but with upgraded sensors. The camera system now uses the 50-megapixel Sony LYT-700 along with a 50-megapixel telephoto camera and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera. On the front, there is a 16-megapixel camera for selfies and videos.OnePlus 13R design review: New flat look  One of the biggest changes OnePlus has made to the OnePlus 13R is the flat design compared to the curves of the 12R. The design, though boxy, is surprisingly lightweight at 206 grams. The device I am reviewing is in the Astral Trail colour option. Now, as much as I love the flat display on the OnePlus 13R, I do find the overall looks a little average. I know the flat is in, and more modern, but given that everyone is doing it — from a Rs 20,000 phone to Rs 80,000 phone — it looks average. The more expensive phones can rely on exotic materials to add some oomph. But the OnePlus 13R, relatively speaking, is not an ultra-premium phone. So the materials here are more regular, such as aluminium frame in matte finish. And that doesn’t help its case in the looks department.  But then talking of the case, looks are also not a key factor nowadays. We all use our phones in a case, and chances are that you will also use the OnePlus 13R, if you get it, in a case. OnePlus does bundle a case with the phone. It is a rubber case and while it will do, personally, if I am going to use the OnePlus 13R I would spend some money and get a better case. 

 



The OnePlus 13R is the first OnePlus phone with Gorilla Glass 7i protection on front and the back
 Looks aside, the phone is built extremely well and there are even some design flourishes that will please users. For example, I like the finish on the rear cover on the phone I am reviewing. It has a subtle pattern of circular lines, which reminds one of the light trails on a clear and starry night. On the back, the phone has a circular camera island similar to the flagship OnePlus 13. The island houses three cameras. The rim has a beautiful glass finish, accompanied by a metallic matte finish at the bottom. On the sides, you’ll find the alert slider and volume buttons. In fact, from the side profile, it looks more premium, with design aesthetics similar to the high-end phones like the iPhone, Pixel, or Oppo Find X8.  The OnePlus 13R is a durable phone, even if it doesn’t carry the same IP rating as the flagship. The phone is rated with IP65 rating.  This is a large phone and it shows when you use it. Given that the sides are now flat, holding it and using it is slightly more tiring for the palm and fingers. This is an issue we see with all big phones that have a flat frame, from the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. So, the OnePlus 13R is not an outlier, but you need to be aware of it. OnePlus 13R display review: Bigger and better While I am skeptical of the boxy design, one thing I truly love is the large display on the phone. At the same time, finally Android phones have gotten rid of chin and it is nice to see that the OnePlus 13R has symmetrical and thin bezels around its screen. I watched a lot of YouTube videos, streamed Netflix, and did some casual gaming on the OnePlus 13R, and I absolutely loved the display experience.  For example in a 4K clip, which showcased the visual delight of Avatar 2, I saw extremely rich colours and the blue of Avatar was bright and punchy. I saw similarly gorgeous colours while playing some games. In games, I also found the display smooth, thanks to its 120Hz refresh rate. 

 



The flat display features 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with up to a 120Hz refresh rate
 The overall brightness of the phone is rated at 1600 nits in general use. This was more than enough for me to use the phone even in outdoor settings. The phone handled the glare and reflections well enough.  One important feature to note here is the Aqua Touch 2.0. It is a neat feature that allows the OnePlus 13R to be used with wet fingers or even when the display is wet, such as in case of light rain or splash. It’s convenient. OnePlus 13R performance review: Goodness of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3  Last year’s flagship performance is more affordable this year. That is how I look at the OnePlus 13R and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. The chipset is a proven workhorse. I casually browsed the web, scrolled through Instagram reels for hours, played games, and jumped through open apps. The OnePlus 13R handled it well and smoothly day after day.  There are a couple of performance-oriented additions to the OnePlus 13R. This includes the upgraded Dual Cryo-Velocity Vapor Chamber system, which keeps the device cool. In my case it did keep the device cool while running BGMI. The smooth and lag-free performance is also due to more RAM. The OnePlus 13R comes with a minimum of 12GB of RAM, compared to the 8GB RAM in the base variant of the 12R. 

 



The OnePlus 13R offers up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage
 Finally, there is the OxygenOS 15, based on the latest Android 15. It's neat. The 13R comes with minimal bloatware — there are 2-3 apps like Netflix and LinkedIn, which are useful. The new design of the OxygenOS is clean, and the software looks slick and clutter-free. There are tons of customisation options. One of them is the side-bar that you can bring with a quick swipe. It is fun and useful. The phone has stereo speakers. This is one area where the OnePlus 12R falls somewhat short of what more expensive phones deliver. Although the speakers are loud and not screechy, even at the full volume. But they also lack the heft that more expensive phones — such as the iPhone 16 Plus — deliver. OnePlus 13R battery review: Big battery  At 6000mAh the OnePlus 13R features the largest battery ever in a OnePlus phone. OnePlus is doing this, while keeping both the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R slim and sleek, by using new battery tech. The big battery also means excellent battery backup. In my usage, where I tend to keep my screen on for hours, switching between apps for both work and entertainment, the battery lasted me about a day and a half — sometimes even a bit longer if I skipped Netflix on my busier days. Now as much as I appreciated the battery capacity, it is worth noting that the charging speed is marginally slower compared to what was offered by the OnePlus 12R. The OnePlus 13R supports 80W charging, compared to 100W on the previous phone. A compatible fast charger that can deliver 80W is included in the box.

 



The OnePlus 13R has the 6000 mAh battery-- a big upgarde to the 5500 mAh battery of Oneplus 12R
OnePlus 13R camera review: Big improvements Last year the OnePlus 12R disappointed me a bit with its camera performance, but the OnePlus 13R comes through. And how! In other words, the cameras in the OnePlus 13R are superb. The portrait photos I clicked with the phone were incredible, filled with vibrant colors and intricate details. They were also well-detailed, with the bokeh effect beautifully rendered and edges detected well. In good lighting, the portraits almost feel like photos captured with a professional DSLR camera. For example, look at the picture below. The portrait shot successfully captures the skin texture, edge-to-edge blur, and facial details remarkably well.

 



In this portrait photo clicked with the OnePlus 13R, you can see the edge-to-edge blur effect and the details on the skin
 Another big surprise is the macro camera. This time, OnePlus has definitely improved it significantly, and the details it can manage are stunning. You can see the details in the picture of the flower I’ve shared below.

 Even regular photos taken with the main camera in good lighting are stunning. But wait — not just in good lighting! The low-light performance is also fairly good, particularly when it comes to managing the colours. At night, the camera manages to capture good details while filtering out noise and filling the photos with clarity. Although the portrait mode does struggle a bit in low light, overall, the camera this time is remarkable for a phone that costs around Rs 40,000. For me, the camera – portrait camera in particular is the biggest highlight of the OnePlus 13R.OnePlus 13R review: Should you buy it? If you are looking for a phone under Rs 50,000, I can say that without a doubt go for it. And one more reason why I say this is not just because of how good the OnePlus 13R is. The company is also making certain aftersales commitments that give the OnePlus 13R an edge over its competitors. OnePlus says that the 13R will be covered under its lifetime display warranty against “green-line issue.” It’s a very specific and niche commitment but it is better than nothing. Then there is the 180-days — 6 months — full replacement warranty on the phone. Essentially if something goes wrong with it within 180-days, OnePlus will replace and give you a new OnePlus 13R. This is on top of the admirable experience that the phone offers. It has good hardware, a versatile feature set, and a great price. Even as OnePlus has now started making and selling a proper, blue-blooded flagship phone, the company also keeps a “flagship-killer” in its lineup. This year the flagship-killer is the OnePlus 13R, and, more or less, it is so good that not only it takes an aim at its competitors but might even hit the OnePlus 13 in a friendly-fire.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Also Read |  OnePlus 13 review: Solid flagship phone for smart buyers

Originally priced at Rs 59,999, the phone is now available for Rs 56,999, offering a flat discount of Rs 3,000 with no additional conditions. However, this offer is limited to the black colour variant. While the reduced price adds to its appeal, is the Realme GT 7 Pro worth purchasing? Here's a breakdown.advertisementRealme GT 7 Pro gets big discount on Flipkart, but is it worth buying?The Realme GT 7 Pro offers a premium design, solid performance, and impressive battery life. Powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, it delivers strong gaming performance and smooth multitasking. However, the device struggles with heat management under heavy loads, such as running benchmarks like 3DMark or playing intensive games like Genshin Impact for extended periods. A software update could potentially address this, improving heat dissipation and reducing performance throttling.One of the phone's major strengths is its battery life. It features a 5,800mAh battery that lasted for over 20 hours in our PCMark benchmark test.

The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with 1.5K resolution is another highlight, offering a 120Hz refresh rate, 6,500nits peak brightness and Corning Glass 7i protection. The display provides vibrant visuals and smooth scrolling. It is bright enough, whether you are indoors or outdoors. The Realme GT 7 Pro is also IP69-rated, making it more durable against water and dust compared to other premium smartphones, including iPhones. On the camera front, the Realme GT 7 Pro delivers decent shots in well-lit conditions but struggles in low light. Its ultrawide camera is serviceable, though not exceptional. Overall, the camera performance is fine in good light but does not stand out in its price point. The design of the Realme GT 7 Pro has also seen noticeable improvements over the previous GT 6 series. The new matte finish rear panel offers a classy and subtle look, especially in the black colour variant. The large rectangular camera module at the back adds a stylish touch but protrudes slightly, causing the phone to wobble when placed flat. With flat frames and slightly curved edges, the device is comfortable to hold. In conclusion, the Realme GT 7 Pro, with its recent price reduction, offers a compelling combination of design, performance, and durability, making it a strong contender in its price bracket. However, if thermal performance is a key concern, it may be worth waiting for a software update. Additionally, users should note that the camera performance is decent but not top-tier, and the phone lacks wireless charging support. For those whose needs align with its strengths, the Realme GT 7 Pro remains a good option.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 10, 2025

Let's find out in this review by India Today Tech. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/redmi-14c-5g-review-an-entertainment-box-under-rs-10000-2662907-2025-01-11,"Xiaomi’s sub-brand, Redmi’s C series, is its budget-friendly smartphone range. The company has recently refreshed the lineup with the launch of the Redmi 14C 5G. And like the previous Redmi C-series phone, you see the company squeezing a lot of premium features in its budget phone. The Redmi 14C houses a big display of 6.88-inch, a 5,160mAh battery, and a 50-megapixel primary camera. Over the Redmi 13C, you will notice some significant improvements in this year’s Redmi 14C. It offers a solid set of features that make it feel more like a sub-20K phone, and not one that you can buy for under Rs 10,000. But that’s all on paper. All its specs and features sound great while going through the spec sheet. But is it just as good in real life? Let’s find out in this detailed review of the Redmi 14C 5G. advertisementDesign and display: I’m lovin’ itThe Redmi 14C 5G is quite the looker. Over the Redmi 13C, the 14C has received a complete design overhaul. And most of the design changes only add more premiumness to the phone’s look. In fact, at first glance I thought this was a more expensive phone. I have been using the Starlight Blue variant. Its rear panel has a beautiful ombre effect, which gradients into silver towards the top. It features a circular camera module housing a dual-camera setup (designed in a way that gives the illusion of a quad-camera arrangement). My favourite part: the Redmi 14C 5G does not come with those big and bulgy camera islands. It is subtly raised, minimising wobble when the phone is placed on its back.
 


Besides the rear panel, the Redmi 14C’s form factor is sleek and boxy. It is slim at 8.22mm thickness –– although thicker than the Redmi 13C 5G which measured at 8.09mm. But the 14C also has a larger battery, so the phone’s thickness is understandable. The phone’s large 6.88-inch display is one of its standout features. It offers ample screen space, and supports a 120Hz refresh rate — a rare feature in this budget range. 
 


During the testing period, I watched a lot of content on Netflix and YouTube on the phone, and quite enjoyed it. The screen is adequately bright and offers vivid colours. Even on a bright sunny day, the Redmi 14C is able to maintain its display legibility.The only aspect of the phone's display and design language that I can complain about is its thick bezels. While this is common in sub-Rs 10,000 smartphones, I really wish to see it phased out.Shining performance  The Redmi 14C 5G is quite the looker.

While this is common in sub-Rs 10,000 smartphones, I really wish to see it phased out.Shining performance  When it comes to performance, the Redmi 14C 5G ticks all the boxes.  My usual day of using a smartphone includes placing and answering calls, opening and closing WhatsApp and Instagram a 100 times a day, watching YouTube videos, and watching shows and movies on OTT platforms. Now, most phones can claim to do all of that well, if not perfectly. And I expected the same. But here’s where I was surprised.
 


 Using social media apps seamlessly, and being able to switch between apps without a stutter was all fun, but what I really enjoyed was watching video content on the phone. Trust me and watch a movie on the Redmi 14C. And no, don’t connect your earphones. Now watch the 14C turn into an entertainment box. The phone comes with a speaker with 150 per cent Super Volume feature, which gives a louder audio experience compared to standard settings. I had to decrease the volume, so that people in other rooms do not get disturbed. Of course, if you are out in public, do not consume content on Super Volume. It’s just rude. But if you end up watching stuff on your phone when you are home, the Redmi 14C deserves to be considered.  Beyond its entertainment capability, I also put the device through its paces with a benchmark test. The device clocked 897 for single-core score and 2169 for multi-core score on Geekbench. While these are not great results, numbers aren’t everything anyway. To compare, the Moto G45 at a similar price range has much better results for its performance. But in real-life scenarios, barring the camera performance, the Redmi 14C can definitely beat the Moto G45 in overall experience.
 


 The Redmi 14C is equipped with a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset, making it a solid offering for the price. It runs on Xiaomi's HyperOS 14, based on Android 14. Although the chipset is somewhat dated, it has performed well with no noticeable lag. Notably, gaming performance is also decent; I played a few rounds of Block Blast, and the phone worked smoothly. The phone comes in three variants: 4GB RAM with 64GB storage, 4GB RAM with 128GB storage and 6GB RAM with 128GB storage.  Overall performance of the Redmi 14C 5G is quite satisfactory for its price. I rarely encountered any heating issues, even during charging.Battery boost Battery is one of the strongest suites of the Redmi 14C 5G. It packs a 5,600mAh battery, which is massive for a sub-Rs 10,000 smartphone. For perspective, Oppo Reno 13, which is priced starting Rs 37,999 also sports a 5,600mAh battery.  In the sub-10K category, whether it’s the Moto G45 5G, Infinix Hot 50 5G and or last year’s Redmi 13C 5G, a 5,000mAh battery is usually the norm.  The battery isn’t just great on paper, it does last you quite a bit –– easily throughout the day. I noticed, after watching an hour and a half-long YouTube video, the battery percentage dropped just 63 per cent to 57 per cent. With 18W of charging support, the Redmi 14C 5G charging speed is a little slow. It took me nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge the device, from 0 per cent to 100 per cent. 

 



The Redmi 14C 5G supports a Type-C charger.
 But, for me, as long as I am getting a good battery backup, I am okay to deal with slow charging speed. It is good for the battery health as well. Camera I would not say that the Redmi 14C 5G has an extraordinary camera, but I think it gets the job done. The phone has a 50-megapixel primary camera and a two-megapixel secondary sensor at the back. 
 


 The primary camera clicks clear images but lacks sharpness. You would notice some lack of detail in images clicked on the standard photo mode as well. 
 


 The phone has several camera modes, including Night Mode, Portrait Mode, Cinematic camera and more. I tested almost all the modes and regardless of which lens you click from you generally get a slightly soft focus. The colours and saturation, however, is good. 
 


 The camera struggles slightly when capturing images in low light, resulting in hazy photos. However, it still manages to add enough light to keep the subject clear and legible.
 


 For the front, the device has an 8-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. By default, the beauty mode is switched on, but I prefer it with off. The selfies are fine. It has a decent amount of detail, but the focus is still not as sharp. For social media, though, I think the images are pretty decent. 
 


 Overall, I think while the primary camera delivers decent-ish performance, the other modes could have been better as well. Here are a few photos clicked by the Redmi 14C 5G. Redmi 14C 5G: Should you buy it?  The Redmi 14C 5G is available at a starting price of Rs 9,999. In this price range, the smartphone offers great value. It boasts a premium design, an impressive display, smooth performance, and a battery life that lasts well beyond a day. Barring the camera performance, the Redmi 14C largely offers a solid experience. I would certainly recommend it for anyone looking for a phone in this budget –– who doesn’t care too much about photography. However, if you do care about photography, then your next best option to consider would be the Moto G45 5G.

According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple Watch SE 3 is scheduled to get a new look with a plastic body. Apple Watch SE 3 to get a new look While Gurman provides few details about the new Apple Watch SE, he does mention that it will feature a ""new look."" The original SE, launched in 2020, was based on the 2018 Apple Watch Series 4 design. This time, the SE could resemble the more modern 2021 Apple Watch Series 7, or perhaps introduce a completely new design. In previous reports, Gurman has suggested that Apple may opt for a plastic body for the SE, which could bring a variety of colours to the model. In September 2023, he stated that this time Apple Watch SE 3 could feature a rear panel with a colourful twist. It could be similar to the iPhone 5C’s coloured plastic case. Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3: What to expect For the higher-end models, Gurman predicts minimal design changes. The Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 are expected to retain a similar appearance but will bring some exciting new features.  Notably, the Ultra 3 is anticipated to support satellite connectivity and 5G RedCap, offering expanded connectivity options for users. Additionally, both the Series 11 and Ultra 3 will likely include blood pressure detection, though it won’t provide specific readings, he stated.  He added, instead, it will notify users if they may be at risk for hypertension, much like Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature. Blood pressure monitoring was originally expected to debut with the Apple Watch Series 10 but was delayed due to the thinner design. This year, however, Apple seems ready to launch it. Gurman also mentions that Apple is working on a new AI-powered coaching service and a revamped health app, although their release timeline is uncertain. These developments could coincide with the upcoming launch of AirPods that feature heart rate monitoring.  Overall, 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the Apple Watch, with both new features and design updates on the horizon.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

It targets macOS devices and can steal sensitive information including browser credentials, e-wallet information, system passwords, etc. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-users-beware-of-banshee-stealer-malware-targeting-macos-devices-2663831-2025-01-13,"Apple users should beware of new malware targeting macOS devices. Security researchers at Check Point Research (CPR) have uncovered an updated version of the Banshee Stealer malware, which has been quietly targeting macOS users. This malware is designed to extract sensitive information, including browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and system passwords, all while remaining virtually undetectable.   Banshee Stealer first came into the spotlight in mid-2024 when it was advertised as a “stealer-as-a-service” on underground forums, available to cybercriminals for $3,000. The malware’s latest iteration, discovered in September 2024, uses advanced techniques to evade antivirus systems, including a string encryption method inspired by Apple’s own XProtect antivirus engine. This innovation allowed Banshee to operate undetected for over two months, posing a significant risk to macOS users.   During its undetected run, the malware was distributed through phishing websites and fake GitHub repositories, often disguised as legitimate software like Google Chrome, Telegram, and TradingView. Once installed, Banshee integrates itself into system processes, making detection and removal extremely challenging.   According to Check Point Research, the malware doesn’t just infiltrate a system—it blends seamlessly, stealing data while evading security measures. ""This stealthy malware doesn’t just infiltrate; it operates undetected, blending seamlessly with normal system processes while stealing browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, user passwords, and sensitive file data,"" CPR noted in a blog post. ""Even seasoned IT professionals struggle to identify its presence. Banshee Stealer isn’t just another piece of malware—it’s a critical warning for users to reassess their security assumptions and take proactive measures to safeguard their data.""   The revelation of Banshee’s capabilities comes as a stark reminder of the growing risks macOS users face. Its advanced evasion techniques allowed it to bypass even sophisticated antivirus systems, exploiting macOS users’ trust in their devices’ inherent security. The stolen data was exfiltrated to command-and-control servers using encrypted files, ensuring minimal traces of the malware’s presence.   Interestingly, a significant development occurred in November 2024 when Banshee’s source code was leaked on an underground forum. While this leak exposed the malware’s inner workings to potential new developers, it also gave antivirus software makers the opportunity to study and counteract its tactics. As a result, detection rates improved, and awareness of Banshee’s threat spread across the cybersecurity community.   To safeguard against threats like Banshee Stealer, experts recommend several precautionary measures. Users should avoid downloading software from unverified sources and remain cautious about system prompts requesting passwords. Regularly updating macOS and antivirus tools is also crucial for staying protected.   Banshee Stealer serves as a wake-up call for the macOS community, proving that no system is entirely immune to cyber threats. As cybersecurity evolves, so do the tactics of cybercriminals, making vigilance and proactive measures essential for digital safety.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Apple Watch SE 3 rumoured to debut this year with a new colourful lookAlso read |  Apple iPad 11 tipped to use A17 Pro chip

It is expected to launch in spring alongside refreshed iPad Air models.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-ipad-11-tipped-to-use-a17-pro-chip-2663814-2025-01-13,"Apple’s next-generation entry-level iPad will reportedly be powered by the powerful A17 Pro chip, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This comes as no surprise, as many had anticipated that the iPad 11 would feature Apple’s new AI features dubbed Apple Intelligence. However, there had been uncertainty about which chip Apple would choose for its most affordable tablet. The A17 Pro chip is based on the first-generation N3B 3nm process, a technology that has had its share of challenges. Reports have long suggested that Apple struggled with this manufacturing process due to its high costs, lower production yields, and limited performance improvements compared to earlier generations. Given these issues, many believed Apple would phase out this process as quickly as possible. In fact, the company’s recent product launches seemed to align with this theory. For example, Apple introduced the M4 chip in the iPad Pro just six months after launching the M3 series in its Mac lineup. This move hinted at Apple’s desire to move beyond the first-generation 3nm chips. Apple has a history of using older chips in its lower-end devices, as seen with the iPhone 14 series. The base model used the A15 Bionic chip from the previous iPhone 13 lineup, while the Pro models received the newer A16 Bionic. However, Apple broke this pattern with the iPhone 16 series, where all models featured the latest A18 chip. This left many assuming that the A17 chip’s lifecycle had effectively ended. But then came the iPad Mini 7th generation. This tablet launched with Apple Intelligence support and surprised many by including the A17 Pro chip from the iPhone 15 Pro instead of the newer A18 chip. The decision made sense given the iPad Mini’s lower production volume and target audience. Now, Apple seems ready to double down on this strategy. According to Gurman, the upcoming entry-level iPads, known internally as J481 and J482, will also feature the A17 Pro chip. The current entry-level iPad models run on the A14 chip with 4GB of memory. The new models are expected to upgrade to 8GB of memory, which is necessary to support Apple’s AI features. Apple is likely to use a binned version of the A17 Pro chip, similar to what was done with the iPad Mini, where a 5-core GPU variant was employed. This approach could help Apple manage costs while ensuring sufficient performance for the entry-level market.

There is supposed to be a fourth smartphone, which the company has not confirmed yet, but the teasers hint towards it –– the Galaxy S25 Slim. Expected to be the company’s slimmest smartphone yet, the S25 Slim is rumoured to only be unveiled at the event with its launch scheduled for a later date. Coming to the pricing of the Galaxy S25 series, the actual cost of the phone will only be revealed at the time of launch. However, last week leaked European prices give us a rough estimate of what the Galaxy S25 series might cost in India.  Expected pricing for the Galaxy S25 series in India   According to a leaked European retail listing, the base model of the Samsung Galaxy S25 with 128GB storage is priced at 964 euros, approximately Rs 85,000. The higher storage variants are expected to cost 1,026 euros (around Rs 91,000) for the 256GB model and 1,151 euros (about Rs 1,01,000) for the 512GB option.   For the Galaxy S25+, the pricing starts at 1,235 euros (roughly Rs 1,09,000) for the 256GB variant and rises to 1,359 euros (approximately Rs 1,20,000) for the 512GB version.   The Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung’s premium offering, comes with a steep price tag. The base model is rumoured to start at 1,557 euros, translating to approximately Rs 1,38,000. The top-end variant with 1TB storage could go as high as 1,930 euros, around Rs 1,70,000.   For context, the Galaxy S24 series, launched last year, came with slightly lower starting prices compared to the rumoured Galaxy S25 lineup. The Galaxy S24 was priced at Rs 79,999 for the 8GB + 256GB variant, with the 8GB + 512GB model costing Rs 89,999.  The Galaxy S24+ started at Rs 99,999 for the 12GB + 256GB option, going up to Rs 1,09,999 for the 12GB + 512GB version. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S24 Ultra began at Rs 1,29,999 for the 12GB+ 256GB model, Rs 1,39,999 for the 12GB + 512GB variant, and Rs 1,59,999 for the 12GB + 1TB option. This comparison highlights a potential price hike in the upcoming Galaxy S25 series.Details of Galaxy S25 series storage options leaked In addition to pricing, Galaxy S25 series’ storage option details have also leaked. The standard Galaxy S25 is expected to come in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options. The Galaxy S25+ may skip the 128GB variant and offer only 256GB and 512GB models. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to feature storage options up to 1TB, catering to users seeking maximum capacity.  Pre-reservation for Galaxy S25 series is open in India   Indian customers eager to get their hands on the Galaxy S25 series can already pre-reserve their devices for a refundable fee of Rs 1,999. This token payment ensures early access to the smartphones and provides additional benefits worth Rs 5,000.   Samsung is offering further incentives for those pre-ordering through its official website. These customers can choose exclusive colour options, customise RAM and storage configurations, and avail the best trade-in value for their current devices, making the upgrade to the Galaxy S25 series even more appealing.

The phone also features a premium build with Ceramic Shield glass, making it more resistant to scratches and drops, while maintaining a lightweight design. At this price, the iPhone 15 offers excellent value for money.

The scam involved remote access to the victim's phone, leading to multiple unauthorized transactions from his bank account.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/delhi-man-loses-rs-9-lakh-after-getting-call-from-fake-electricity-department-officials-2663889-2025-01-13,"Cyber scams are rampant in India. In the past few years, many individuals across the country have lost lakhs and crores to online scammers. The latest victim of such a scam is a man from West Delhi, who reportedly fell victim to a sophisticated scam, losing Rs 9 lakh to fraudsters posing as electricity department officials. The victim's ordeal began on December 26 when he visited the electricity department in his area to submit a name-change application for his power connection, reports PTI. Shortly after leaving the office, the victim received a call from an unknown number. The caller introduced himself as an official from the power distribution company (discom) and informed him about a pending electricity bill payment of Rs 13. To settle the supposed dues and proceed with the application, the victim complied and transferred the amount online, as instructed by the caller. However, after this initial payment, the caller contacted the victim again and instructed him to download an application via a link provided in a message. The victim, believing the app would resolve his name-change issue, complied, further trusting the scammers. However, as he opened the app and shared his details, the scammers managed to gain remote access to the victim's smartphone. Over the next few days, between December 29 and December 31, the fraudsters reportedly exploited this remote access to conduct multiple unauthorized transactions from the victim’s bank account. In total, they managed to siphon off Rs 9 lakh. It was only when the victim noticed the unauthorized transactions that he reported the incident to the police, registered a First Information Report (FIR), and initiated an investigation. A senior police officer confirmed the case and urged residents to exercise caution when dealing with unsolicited calls or payment requests.What is this new scam? At first glance, this case appears to involve a new trick by scammers to deceive people. However, the modus operandi employed by the cybercriminals is similar to what has been observed in other reported online scams. At the start of the scam, the fraudsters contact unsuspecting individuals while posing as legitimate officials, leveraging the victim's recent interaction with the electricity department to gain credibility. They ask the victim to pay a small amount of money, attempting to build trust by sharing details that only the victim would know. In this case, the scammers requested a minimal payment of Rs 13 to move forward with the application the victim had submitted at the actual office. Once the victim trusted them, they sent a malicious file to the victim's phone. As soon as the victim clicked on the link, the scammers gained full access to the victim’s phone, allowing them to steal money from the bank account.How to stay safe With scammers constantly developing new tricks to siphon money from people’s accounts, it is crucial to stay vigilant and avoid trusting unknown calls, especially those asking for payments via online methods. Note that government officials rarely resolve payment issues over the phone. If you believe a call might be legitimate, always cross-check the caller’s identity by contacting the official helpline or visiting the office in person. Do not rely solely on the information provided by the caller. Additionally, never click on unknown links. Fraudsters often send malicious links to gain access to your device. Avoid clicking on such links, particularly from unverified sources. Only use trusted platforms, like the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, to download apps. Lastly, keep your phone and banking apps secure by enabling two-factor authentication, setting up strong passwords, and updating your software regularly to patch vulnerabilities.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also Read |  OnePlus 13R review: Great hardware, loaded with features, and a killer priceAlso Read |  Apple users, beware of Banshee Stealer: Malware targeting macOS devicesAlso Read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series details leak ahead of launch next week

For anyone fed up with YouTube’s relentless ads, this is a golden opportunity to enjoy a smooth, ad-free experience on one of the world’s most popular video platforms. The Reliance Jio offer is available to users who subscribe to postpaid broadband plans priced at Rs 888 or above. This includes some of Jio’s most popular plans, aimed at enhancing the overall experience for its customers. With YouTube Premium, users can watch videos uninterrupted by ads, download content for offline viewing, and even play videos in the background while multitasking. The subscription also comes with access to YouTube Music. You can avail of 24 months of free YouTube Premium with JioFiber and Jio AirFiber postpaid plans priced at Rs 888, Rs 1,199, Rs 1,499, Rs 2,499, and Rs 3,499.  This new initiative from Jio comes as a response to the increasing popularity of YouTube Premium, which has seen a price hike in India over the past year. Currently, a standalone subscription to YouTube Premium costs Rs 149 per month for individual users and Rs 299 per month for families, making Jio’s offer an incredible value for its broadband subscribers. By bundling YouTube Premium with its postpaid broadband services, Jio is targeting households and individuals who consume large amounts of content on YouTube, whether on their smartphones, tablets, or smart TVs. It’s also a strategic move to attract more users to its broadband ecosystem, where Jio has been rapidly expanding its reach. YouTube has become the go-to video platform for most folks these days, whether it’s for catching up on news, watching tutorials, or streaming entertainment. However, the platform’s frequent ads, many of which are unskippable and can last between 15 and 20 seconds, can often disrupt the viewing experience. With YouTube Premium, users can enjoy their videos without interruptions and have a seamless viewing experience.  Another handy feature of YouTube Premium is the ability to play videos in the background. This is especially useful for smartphone users who like to listen to podcasts, music playlists, or even educational videos while using other apps or with their screens turned off. Additionally, users can download videos for offline viewing, making it convenient for those who travel frequently or have limited internet access. The inclusion of YouTube Music in the package is another highlight. With this, users gain access to a dedicated music streaming app that offers millions of tracks, curated playlists, and personalised recommendations — all without ads.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 15,000 in January 2024: Poco M7 Pro 5G, CMF Phone 1 and more

As we found in our review, the OnePlus 13R offers capable hardware and at a superb price point. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/oneplus-13r-review-in-5-points-flagship-killer-for-2025-2663963-2025-01-13,"The OnePlus 13 phones are now available in India. There are two phones: the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R. The OnePlus 13 is a powerful flagship from OnePlus, offering the best Android experience with premium hardware. However, this year, the OnePlus 13 might not be the smartest option for consumers. For most users, the smarter choice could be its sibling the OnePlus 13R.  Here at India Today Tech, we reviewed both phones and absolutely loved them. However, the OnePlus 13R gets some special love from us because it's not only a capable Android smartphone, but the hardware and performance it offers at its price point make it an almost perfect smartphone you can buy under Rs 50,000. This love reflects in the way we rated the two phones. The OnePlus 13 gets 8 points, whereas the OnePlus 13R got 8.5 out of 10.  In our review of the OnePlus 13R, we found that at a starting price of Rs 42,999, this premium smartphone is capable — truly in every sense — of offering users a flagship-level experience. This is all thanks to its powerful hardware, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset (which we earlier saw in the flagship OnePlus 12 of 2024), a stunning flat AMOLED display, upgraded cameras, and a massive 6000mAh battery. You can read our full review here: OnePlus 13R review: Great hardware, loaded with features, and a killer price. The review provides an in-depth analysis of everything from the display to the design and performance of the OnePlus 13R, covering everything you need to know. However, if you're short on time, here’s a quick, bite-sized summary of the OnePlus 13R review.Point 1: Flat design with strong build quality One of the biggest upgrades this year in the OnePlus 13R compared to its predecessor, the OnePlus 12R, is the design. The OnePlus 13R has adopted a boxy design with flat edges to give it a modern look. However, this change — although making the phone look more modern — comes at the cost of comfort, as the flat edges feel less ergonomic during extended use. While the looks didn’t excite us much, the OnePlus 13R is a better built phone compared to its predecessor. It is the first OnePlus phone to feature the new Gorilla Glass 7i on both sides and a hardy aluminium frame. It is a sturdy yet lightweight phone at 206 grams. The device we reviewed was in the Astral Trail colour option. This variant has a unique circular pattern on the back cover almost looking like a starry sky at night.Point 2: Bright display with uniform bezels The OnePlus 13R features a 6.78-inch AMOLED LTPO panel. The display truly stands out with its 120Hz refresh rate, 4500 nits peak brightness, and support for vibrant 10-bit colours. Be it watching content in 4K or gaming, or streaming HDR content, the display provides excellent clarity and brightness. Additionally, the Aqua Touch 2.0 feature ensures smooth operation even with wet hands. Another thing we really appreciated is the symmetrical bezels, that along with the flat display, offer a more immersive and bigger display experience.
 


Point 3: Flagship performance Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset — the same as we had seen in the 2024 flagship OnePlus 12 — and paired with a minimum of 12GB RAM, the OnePlus 13R manages to offer lag-free performance. It offers flagship performance despite its relatively more affordable chipset. Even now most phones with Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 sell for above Rs 50,000, whereas this one is coming around Rs 40,000. From running demanding apps to intensive gaming, OnePlus 13R handles it all efficiently. Multitasking is seamless, and the upgraded thermal management ensures consistent performance under load. The performance is also boosted with the clean and feature-loaded Oxygen OS 15 that, I believe, not only offers the latest Android experience but makes the phone fun to use with personalisation options and AI features.Point 4: Much-needed camera upgrade Last year in the OnePlus 12R, the camera really disappointed me. However, OnePlus has taken care of it, and this time with the OnePlus 13R offers much improved performance. The triple-camera setup is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, with better low-light photography and natural colour reproduction. The 50-megapixel primary sensor captures sharp and detailed images, while the ultra-wide lens delivers good results for landscapes. The telephoto camera also adds more power to the camera system, although its performance is just fine in extreme low-light conditions.  CHECK FULL REVIEW TO SEE IMAGE SAMPLES IN BIGGER SIZEPoint 5: Bigger battery The OnePlus 13R also comes with the biggest battery upgrade with a massive 6000mAh battery. The battery manages to offer over a day’s use with heavy usage, be it social media, calls, games, and whatnot. The charging speed, although slightly reduced to 80W —and the charger comes in the box — still tops up the battery in about 1 hour. This makes it a reliable companion for users on the go, though faster charging would have been a welcome addition.

6f060891-0f47-4871-8042-9464334e6c00,"Apple iPhone 17 Air launch in September seems more likely than everApple is rumored to launch its thinnest iPhone ever this year, the iPhone 17 Air. While several reports have suggested the phone's launch, the latest report further reinforces these rumors.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-iphone-17-air-launch-in-september-seems-more-likely-than-ever-2663945-2025-01-13,"Apple is reportedly preparing to unveil its thinnest iPhone to date, the iPhone 17 Air, alongside the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at its fall event this September. There have been many reports suggesting this already, but the latest one somewhat confirms that Apple may have settled on the iPhone 17 Air moniker for the rumoured phone. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has suggested this in his latest Power On newsletter. As per the newsletter, the iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to be approximately 2 millimeters thinner than existing iPhones. Gurman notes that this slim profile isn’t merely for aesthetics but is a crucial step toward creating foldable iPads and iPhones in the future. This device could act as a ""testing ground for future technologies,"" wrote Gurman. Additionally, the iPhone 17 Air could serve as a platform for Apple’s proprietary cell modem, reportedly codenamed Sinope, which is expected to debut in the iPhone SE in (possibly) March this year. While this year’s iPhones may also introduce Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, Gurman has not confirmed whether the 17 Air will include these components.   Meanwhile, another report by TF Securities International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has provided new details, claiming that the iPhone 17 Air will measure just 5.5mm in thickness, making it the slimmest iPhone ever. Look at the both reports, and the previous ones, here is everything new and old we know about the Apple iPhone 17 Air so far.iPhone 17 Air According to Kuo, the iPhone 17 Air is set to replace the ‘Plus’ variant in Apple’s iPhone lineup. If the 5.5mm thickness is accurate, the device will surpass the 6.9mm iPhone 6 from 2014 as Apple’s thinnest iPhone yet. It would also outshine Samsung’s rumored Galaxy S25 Slim, expected to be around 6mm thick, and dramatically undercut the 7.8mm iPhone 16.   However, the ultra-thin design comes with compromises. Kuo reports that the iPhone 17 Air will lack a physical SIM card slot, supporting only eSIM functionality. This reported decision is in line with Apple’s push toward a wireless future but may present challenges in markets like China, where eSIM adoption is relatively low. iPhone 17 Air may set new standards for mid-range phones To achieve this unprecedented slim profile, Apple is said to be employing advanced display technologies like Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI), which combines touch and display layers into a single unit. The iPhone 17 Air is also rumored to feature a 6.6-inch OLED display with ProMotion technology, enabling a 120Hz refresh rate. If implemented, it will mark the first time Apple extends this feature to non-Pro models, potentially setting a new standard for mid-range devices.  How will Apple squeeze a big camera into a slim body?   The iPhone 17 Air’s simplified design reportedly includes a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a departure from the dual-lens systems of current models. This streamlined camera setup could save space and contribute to the slim build. On the front, the device may feature a 24-megapixel TrueDepth camera, doubling the resolution of previous iterations.   Performance-wise, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to run on Apple’s A19 chipset, offering improved efficiency and processing power. Additional features like 8GB of RAM and Apple’s new in-house modem, codenamed “Sinope,” are also expected.  
iPhone 17 Air pricing in India   Rumours suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will replace the iPhone Plus series, with pricing starting at $899 (approximately Rs 89,900 in India). However, its innovative design and premium features could push its price beyond the $1,199 starting point of the iPhone 16 Pro Max.  iPhone 17 Air to iPhone Fold? Industry experts, including Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, believe the iPhone 17 Air will serve as a precursor to Apple’s future foldable devices. Its ultra-thin design could pave the way for breakthroughs in flexibility and durability, vital for foldable technology.   As Apple gears up for its September event, the iPhone 17 Air has emerged as one of the most intriguing announcements of 2025.

The law, which was the subject of arguments before the nine justices on Friday, sets a Jan. 19 deadline for ByteDance to sell the popular social media platform or face a ban on national security grounds. The companies have sought, at the very least, a delay in implementation of the law, which they say violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. Noel Francisco, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that Supreme Court endorsement of this law could enable statutes targeting other companies on similar grounds. ""AMC movie theaters used to be owned by a Chinese company. Under this theory, Congress could order AMC movie theaters to censor any movies that Congress doesn't like or promote any movies that Congress wanted,"" Francisco told the justices. The justices signaled through their questions during the arguments that they were inclined to uphold the law, although some expressed serious concerns about its First Amendment implications. TikTok is a platform used by about 170 million people in the United States, roughly half the country's population. Congress passed the measure last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, as lawmakers cited the risk of the Chinese government exploiting TikTok to spy on Americans and carry out covert influence operations. Jeffrey Fisher, the lawyer representing TikTok content creators who also have challenged the law, noted during the Supreme Court arguments that Congress with this measure was focusing on TikTok and not major Chinese online retailers including Temu. ""Would a Congress (that is) really worried about these very dramatic risks leave out an e-commerce site like Temu that has 70 million Americans using it?"" Fisher asked. ""It's very curious why you just single out TikTok alone and not other companies with tens of millions of people having their own data taken, you know, in the process of engaging with those websites and equally, if not more, available to Chinese control."" Democratic President Joe Biden signed the measure into law and his administration is defending it in this case. The deadline for divestiture is just one day before Republican Donald Trump, who opposes the ban, takes office as Biden's successor. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, arguing for the Biden administration in defending the law, said it was crucial that it take effect on Jan. 19 as scheduled in order to force ByteDance to act on divestiture. ""Foreign adversaries do not willingly give up their control over this mass communications channel in the United States,"" Prelogar said. ""When push comes to shove, and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider. And it might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process,"" Prelogar said. If the ban takes affect on Jan 19, Apple, opens new tab and Alphabet's Google, opens new tab would no longer be able to offer TikTok for downloads for new users but existing users could still access the app. The US government and TikTok agree that app would degrade and eventually become unusable over time because companies would not be able to offer supporting services. The Supreme Court also debated whether the possibility of TikTok being used for covert influence campaigns or propaganda purposes by China justified the banning it.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

During a podcast with YouTuber Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg mocked Apple for what he described as a lack of innovation in recent years, claiming the company has been ""milking"" the iPhone for nearly two decades. Although from his comments it also seems that Zuckerberg is more miffed at Apple’s policies around App Store and the company’s stance on privacy that hits Meta ad revenue.  “(Apple has) used the (iPhone) to impose a lot of arbitrary rules. It feels like they haven’t really invented anything groundbreaking in a while. Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, and now they’re just sitting on it 20 years later,"" Zuckerberg said. He pointed out that Apple has consistently made incremental improvements to the iPhone but has failed to introduce groundbreaking innovations in the way other companies, like Meta, are exploring technologies such as the metaverse and virtual reality. He also accused Apple of using privacy and security concerns as a shield against criticism from other companies. According to Zuckerberg, Apple could improve user privacy by improving security protocols and adopting better encryption practices. ""It’s insecure because you didn’t build proper security into it. Now you're using that as an excuse for why only your products can connect easily,"" Zuckerberg stated. He further claimed that Apple’s ""random rules"" are limiting Meta’s profitability, suggesting that if Apple relaxed its policies, Meta’s profits could increase by 50 per cent.  His latest comments on Apple are not surprising because there is an ongoing tiff between Meta and Apple, most notably on the point of privacy. While Facebook has traditionally sought access to more consumer data, Apple on Mac and iPhone has made it more and more difficult for tech companies to record and use private data for targeted advertisements. Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s ongoing rivalry This isn't the first time Zuckerberg has targeted Apple’s approach, as Meta has previously criticised the company for its strict App Store policies and privacy features, which have impacted Facebook’s advertising model. Zuckerberg's latest comments suggest that the rivalry between the two tech giants is far from over. Mark Zuckerberg’s rivalry with Apple is rooted in their differing business models, which have often led to public clashes. The tensions heightened in 2021 when Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency feature, which limited Facebook’s ability to track user data across apps. Zuckerberg criticised the move, stating that it would harm small businesses dependent on personalised ads. In the latest interview, Zuckerberg also took a swipe at Apple’s 30 per cent transaction fee on App Store purchases, calling it arbitrary and harmful to competition. He argued that this practice hampers Meta’s profitability and forces consumers to spend more on Apple’s peripherals. ""So how do they make more money as a company? By squeezing people with this 30 per cent developer tax and pushing consumers to buy more add-ons like AirPods,"" Zuckerberg said. ""They’ve made cool products like AirPods, but they’ve restricted anyone else from making something that integrates with the iPhone in the same way."" Zuckerberg also criticised Apple’s Vision Pro headset, which reportedly saw underwhelming sales in the US market. Meta, on the other hand, continues to develop its line of virtual headsets, like the Meta Quest. ""The Vision Pro is probably one of Apple’s bigger swings at trying something new in a while,"" Zuckerberg acknowledged. ""I don’t want to criticise too harshly since we’ve had early versions of products that weren’t great. But the first version of the Vision Pro definitely didn’t hit it out of the park.""Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

The Oppo Find N3 was launched in 2023 in China and was later rebranded as the OnePlus Open globally, a little later.  We expect the company will follow the same timeline this year as well. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oppo-find-n5-aka-oneplus-open-2-to-debut-next-month-as-thinnest-foldable-in-the-world-2664027-2025-01-13,"Oppo has officially announced that its flagship foldable, Oppo Find N5 will be launched in China in February this year. Oppo's Chief Product Officer, Pete Lau (known as Liu Zuohu), has confirmed the imminent launch of the Oppo Find N5 through a teaser image shared on Weibo. Lau, who is also the co-founder and CEO of OnePlus, revealed that the upcoming device will be the world’s thinnest foldable flagship smartphone.
 


 Last time, when Oppo released Find N3 in China in 2023, a few days later, it was then rebranded as OnePlus Open globally. Looking at the trends, we think the company will follow the same timeline. For context, Oppo is the parent company of OnePlus.  The teaser poster reveals that the Oppo Find N5 aka OnePlus Open 2 is slimmer than a standard pencil, which is typically 7-8mm thick. Based on this, the phone appears to be around 4mm thick when unfolded, suggesting it could measure less than 10mm when folded. Renowned tipster Digital Chat Station has also supported this claim, confirming that the Find N5 will be the world’s thinnest foldable phone, surpassing the current record-holder, the Honor Magic V3. Oppo Find N3 aka OnePlus Open 2: Expected specs According to earlier rumours and leaks, the Oppo Find N5 will feature a titanium build, offering enhanced durability compared to its predecessor. The device is expected to come with an IPX8 waterproof rating, addressing the lack of an IP rating in its predecessor.
 


 The Find N5 is rumoured to be powered by Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, supported by a robust 6,000mAh battery. It is anticipated to feature 80W or 100W fast charging, alongside wireless charging capabilities of up to 50W. On the back, the phone may boast a versatile camera setup, including a 50MP main sensor, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses.OnePlus Open 2 launch timeline From a Finnish perspective, the Oppo Find N5 holds particular interest as it is expected to serve as the foundation for the OnePlus Open 2, slated for release a bit later.
 


 Early renders of the OnePlus Open 2 have already surfaced, revealing a foldable inner screen measuring approximately 8 inches and a 6.4-inch cover screen—both slightly larger than the 7.82-inch inner screen and 6.31-inch cover screen of the original OnePlus Open. While earlier rumours suggested the OnePlus Open 2 might launch in the second half of 2025, the Oppo Find N5's scheduled February debut in China has raised hopes for an earlier release, potentially in spring or early summer.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Apple iPhone 17 Air launch in September seems more likely than everAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series details leak ahead of launch next weekAlso read |  Amazon Republic Day Sale announced: Big discounts on OnePlus Nord 4, iPhone 15 and more

Meta recently also eased content moderation policies and fact-checking.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/mark-zuckerberg-wants-more-masculine-energy-and-less-diversity-in-corporate-culture-2664036-2025-01-13,"Dressed in his signature ""Zuck 2.0"" look — baggy black T-shirt, gold chain, and curly blonde hair — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed a new version of himself in a bold interview with podcaster Joe Rogan. The world is calling it ""Zuck 3.0."" This version appears bolder and more controversial, as Zuckerberg shares his vision for corporate culture — one that emphasises what he calls ""masculine energy"" while scaling back on diversity initiatives. Appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Zuckerberg’s remarks were striking. “Masculine energy, I think, is good,” he said, claiming corporate environments have moved away from traditional masculine traits like aggression. According to Zuckerberg, successful workplaces need a balance of masculine and feminine energies, though he believes the pendulum has swung too far toward neutrality.   Zuckerberg’s own connection to this philosophy is personal. He spoke about how practicing mixed martial arts influenced his outlook, describing it as “a much more masculine culture.” His comments come alongside major policy shifts at Meta that further amplify the company’s ideological shift.  Meta scales back diversity policies Zuckerberg’s interview coincided with Meta’s announcement that it was significantly scaling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. An internal memo cited the term “DEI” as controversial, explaining that some perceive it as favouring certain groups over others.  This policy shift eliminates Meta’s diversity training programs and reduces targeted hiring initiatives. But why is this move making so much news? That's because it could result in less inclusive workplaces and widen existing gaps in representation.   In addition, Meta announced relaxed content moderation rules. The platform will now allow more leniency for posts criticising immigrants, transgender individuals, and non-binary people. Fact-checking measures in the United States were scrapped, raising concerns over the potential spread of misinformation.  A tilt toward Trump? Zuckerberg’s remarks and policy shifts have reignited debates about Meta’s political leanings. While the CEO criticised the Biden administration for allegedly pressuring the company to censor content during the pandemic, he praised US President-elect Donald Trump’s focus on “making America win.” Recent actions by Meta seem to align with conservative values, leading to speculation about the company’s relationship with Trump. A shift in priorities Zuckerberg insists that his vision is about balance rather than exclusion. While advocating for masculine traits like aggression in workplaces, he also emphasised the importance of opportunities for women and individuals from diverse backgrounds. “You want women to succeed and companies to unlock the value of great people no matter their background,” he said. However, the practical implications of Meta’s policy changes suggest a departure from these ideals. By scaling back DEI initiatives, loosening content moderation, and ending fact-checking, Meta’s new direction seems a little distant from its aim to maintain balance.

During a podcast with YouTuber Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg shared his vision for the role of AI in coding and the potential disruption it poses to the job market. He stated that by 2025, AI at Meta and other tech companies could effectively replace mid-level engineers who currently write code. This would represent a big shift in how tech companies approach software development.  ""We will get to a point where all the code in our apps and the AI it generates will also be written by AI engineers instead of people engineers,"" he said. For context, Business Insider reported that mid-level software engineers at Meta currently earn salaries in the mid-six figures — a cost AI could significantly reduce. Zuckerberg’s comments come at a time when other tech giants, such as Google and IBM, are also integrating AI into their operations, raising similar alarms. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, recently announced that over 25 per cent of all new code at Google is now generated by AI, with human engineers stepping in for final reviews. Meanwhile, IBM’s CEO, Arvind Krishna, revealed in 2023 that AI could replace up to 30 per cent of the company’s back-office roles. The trend, seen across different sectors, is sparking a debate about the future of traditional coding jobs.Jobs of human engineers are at risk? Zuckerberg’s latest announcement and Google's recent remark on AI completing coding tasks suggest that the role of human engineers is changing, potentially leading to fewer coding jobs in the traditional sense. Rather than spending time on routine tasks, engineers may need to focus on higher-level problem-solving and oversight of AI-generated code. As AI is more integrated into tech workflows, junior and entry-level coding positions might diminish, forcing aspiring developers to rethink their career paths. However, it’s not all doom and gloom for engineers. AI’s growing role in code generation could actually empower coders to concentrate on more strategic and creative aspects of development. It is important to note that human engineers can't be replaced in the longer run because they can solve complex issues that AI alone cannot handle. As routine tasks are increasingly automated, the importance of these core competencies will grow, placing greater value on skills that complement AI.This tech company has stopped hiring humans Meta isn’t alone in its AI journey. Klarna, a leading fintech company, has also supported AI-driven automation, reducing its workforce by 20 per cent over the past year without hiring replacements. Klarna’s CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, has openly stated that AI now performs nearly all tasks traditionally handled by human employees, signaling yet another shift toward an AI-dominated future. The company, which previously had 4,500 employees, now has 3,500. This reduction happened naturally, according to the CEO, due to the 20 per cent annual attrition rate common in tech firms.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

While the OnePlus 13 is priced starting at Rs 69,999, the 13R comes in at a much more affordable Rs 42,999 asking price — a striking Rs 27,000 difference. Although the OnePlus 13 justifies its premium price, the 13R is an excellent option for those who don’t necessarily need a flagship device or the hefty price tag that comes with it. In this article, we highlight the top 4 reasons why the OnePlus 13R could be your next smartphone, along with one reason why you might want to explore other options.advertisementOnePlus 13R: 4 reasons to buyAll we need is a flat panel with nifty featuresOn paper, the OnePlus 13R appears to use the same display tech as the 12R, i.e., a 6.78-inch screen with 1.5K resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 4,500 nits peak brightness. However, the 13R now features a completely flat display. Unlike the quad-curved panels recently seen on the OnePlus 13 and Vivo X200 series, the 13R’s flat design is more in line with devices like the iPhone 16, Galaxy S24, and iQOO 13. Compared to the 12R’s curved display, the flat panel of the 13R not only matches its brightness but also resolves issues with corner glare and mistouches.

 The Aqua Touch technology from last year is still included, but this time, the 13R introduces a new Glove Mode. Initially, it might sound gimmicky, but in practice, it’s a game-changer, especially in winter. Glove Mode lets you use the touchscreen even while wearing gloves — be it woollen or sheepskin gloves up to 0.5 cm thick. Throughout the review period, during my morning commutes, I never needed to remove my gloves to use the phone. It’s that effective, making it a truly practical addition. Solid performance, good thermal management The OnePlus 13R sees a solid performance upgrade thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Based on benchmark results alone, the 13R demonstrates a noticeable leap over the 12R in raw performance, easily justifying the upgrade. However, the improvements go beyond just numbers — especially when it comes to gaming. The OnePlus 13R delivers two key advantages over its predecessor.

 First, the flat display ensures you don’t experience mistouches during gaming, a common issue with curved displays. Second, while the overall performance of the 12R is excellent, the 13R takes things a step further with superior thermal management. Even under heavy workloads, the device maintained stable temperatures and never became alarmingly hot during my testing — even when used while charging. These improvements make the 13R a more reliable option for extended gaming sessions and heavy multitasking. This one’s a marathoner The OnePlus 12R comes with a 5,500mAh battery and 100W fast charging, while the OnePlus 13R upgrades to a larger 6,000mAh battery with 80W fast charging. At first glance, the slower 80W charging may seem like a downgrade compared to the 100W speed of the 12R, but in reality, it’s a better choice for preserving long-term battery health. The charging times remain impressive, with the phone taking roughly 50 minutes for a full charge.

 When it comes to endurance, the OnePlus 13R easily lasts 1.5 days on a single charge, even with heavy usage — something the 12R struggles to achieve. This improvement is largely due to the 13R's silicon carbon battery, which boasts a higher density than the lithium-ion battery in the 12R. As a result, it holds a longer charge and, on a technical level, offers greater longevity compared to its lithium-ion counterpart.  OxygenOS 15 with all the AI goodness The OnePlus 13R runs OxygenOS 15 atop Android 15 and comes with a solid promise of 4 years of OS updates and 6 years of security patch support. It packs all the latest features and AI tools, including AI Notes, Circle to Search, and AI-powered features in the gallery app like AI Unblur and AI Reflection Eraser, among many others. While it’s true that Android 15 with OxygenOS 15 is also available on the OnePlus 12R, if you want the full-fledged experience of what OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15 has to offer, the OnePlus 13R — and of course, the flagship OnePlus 13 are undoubtedly your best choices.advertisementOnePlus 13R: 1 reason to skipiQOO 12 is currently selling at the same priceThe iQOO 12 is currently selling for Rs 45,999. Moreover, a Rs 3,000 flat coupon discount on Amazon brings it down to the same price as the OnePlus 13R. With roughly the same package, which one offers better value for your money?
 


While the OnePlus 13R impresses with its smooth and feature-rich OxygenOS 15 software, the iQOO 12 takes the upper hand when it comes to hardware, except for the battery. Both devices come with 1.5K resolution displays, but the iQOO 12 offers a 144Hz refresh rate, which is a big plus for gamers. On the other hand, the OnePlus 13R sticks with a 120Hz panel. In terms of memory and storage, both phones start with 12GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage, so there’s no difference there.advertisementWhen it comes to cameras, the iQOO 12 outshines the OnePlus 13R with its flagship-grade setup. It packs three 50 MP sensors — a primary camera, an ultra-wide-angle camera, and a periscope lens with a 3x optical zoom. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13R offers a simpler camera configuration, and its video recording is capped at 4K at 60fps. The iQOO 12, in comparison, can also shoot videos in 8K resolution at 30fps, if the need be.Battery performance is another area to consider. The OnePlus 13R comes with a larger 6,000mAh battery and supports 80W fast charging. In contrast, the iQOO 12 has a smaller 5,000mAh battery but compensates with 120W fast charging, which gets the phone charged much faster. Plus, for gamers, the iQOO 12 offers bypass charging, a feature that keeps the phone cool during long gaming sessions.In the end, choosing between the OnePlus 13R and the iQOO 12 comes down to your priorities. If you value a longer-lasting battery and a smoother software experience, the OnePlus 13R might be the better pick. However, if you’re after better hardware, especially for gaming and photography, the iQOO 12 is hard to beat — especially with the Amazon discount bringing it to the same price.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 15,000 in January 2024: Poco M7 Pro 5G, CMF Phone 1 and more

According to the tipster, Evan Blass, Pei wrote to him, saying this phone is the company's first step toward its AI-powered platform.   ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/nothing-phone-3-may-launch-by-march-2025-confirms-ceo-carl-pei-2664103-2025-01-13,"After launching Nothing Phone (2) in 2023, CEO Carl Pei has finally confirmed that the company will launch its flagship, Nothing Phone (3), in 2025. According to a tipster, Evan Blass, the Pei confirmed the news via mail. He shared that this year would be the company's biggest year so far. This is mostly because of the launch of the Nothing Phone (3), which will mark the company's first step towards its AI-powered platform, he added.  

In the email, shared by Blass (@evleaks) on X, Pei stated that With the Nothing Phone (3), the company is aiming to redefine the user experience of personal computing devices. In other words, it aims to make the user's life easier. 
 


 Lastly, the email also added that the Nothing Phone (3) will debut in the first quarter of 2025. This means that the launch could be witnessed by March-end. Previously, the company was seen in the headlines for delaying the phone. 
 


 The 2025 launch of the Nothing Phone 3 marks a significant departure from the typical annual refresh cycle of high-end smartphones. The Nothing Phone 1 debuted in India in 2022, followed by the flagship Nothing Phone 2 in July 2023. However, the two-year gap before the release of the next iteration suggests substantial upgrades. According to Carl Pei, the Nothing Phone 3 will focus heavily on AI-driven features.Nothing Phone (3): What do we know so far The upcoming Nothing Phone 3 is rumoured to introduce several new features, including an iPhone-inspired Action Button and a 6.5-inch display, according to leaks. Additionally, a Pro variant, the Nothing Phone 3 Pro, is expected to launch alongside it, featuring a larger 6.7-inch screen.   The Action Button, reminiscent of the feature found on iPhones, is anticipated to provide customisable controls, allowing users to launch apps, toggle settings, or create personalised shortcuts. This addition highlights Nothing's commitment to blending user-centric innovation with modern design aesthetics.   According to the video previously shared on X, Pei and his team explained the initial AI features they had discovered. They explained how Nothing Phone 3 will be a hub for a highly personalised experience.  AI will be deeply integrated with the operating system on the upcoming Nothing Phone 3 to deliver a personalised user experience. The re-imaging of the home screen might be the first upgrade to Nothing Phone 3, as per the video. Along with this, the upcoming Nothing Phone (3) is expected to feature a mid-range chipset, such as the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 or MediaTek Dimensity 9200+. For context, the Nothing Phone 2, equipped with the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, entered the premium price segment. This choice hints at a potentially more affordable price point for the Phone 3.   The Nothing Phone 1 launched in India at a starting price of Rs 32,999, while the Phone 2, with its higher specifications, debuted at Rs 44,999 for the base variant. By shifting back to a mid-range focus, the Phone 3 could appeal to a wider audience, while the Pro version is likely to target users seeking top-tier performance and features.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Nothing Phone 3 to launch next year: Price, specs, features and all we know so farAlso read |  Mark Zuckerberg says AI as good as mid-level software engineers at Meta, rings alarm on developer jobsAlso read |  Apple iPhone 17 Air launch in September seems more likely than everMust Watch

Powered by the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 processor, the Pad 7 is an all-rounder, offering almost everything one needs from a tablet, and that too at a really good price point.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/xiaomi-pad-7-review-lightweight-and-powerful-on-a-budget-2664191-2025-01-13,"The tablet market continues to be a largely one-sided affair. That is it is a market ruled by the iPad. And it is with this context that I say this: The Xiaomi Pad 7 is a welcome sight for sore eyes. The picking in the world of Android tablets are few and far between. But going forward I believe that the Xiaomi Pad 7 should be a standard choice for anyone looking to get an Android tablet, or even a tablet without spending Rs 50,000. Yes, it is that good.  I have been using the Xiaomi Pad 7 for the last 10 days and I must say that I am impressed. The Pad 7 is not only loaded with good hardware but it is available for users at a really competitive price. In fact more than the hardware its the price which is the real deal with the Xiaomi Pad 7.  Xiaomi Pad 7 runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset – the same chipset we have seen in mainstream smartphones. The chipset has proven to be capable so it is a good choice for the tablet. The Pad 7 comes with up to 12GB RAM plus 256GB storage variant. On the software side you have HyperOS 2, which brings a lot more new productivity tools for the larger display and a clean software experience. Inside there is a large 8,850mAh battery, which supports 45W fast charging. On the front, the Pad 7 features an 11.2-inch display with a 3.2K resolution and a pixel density of 345 PPI. The tablet offers a 144Hz AdaptiveSync refresh rate. On the sides, there’s a quad-speaker system with support for Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res Audio. The tablet is also really lightweight. The Pad 7 has a 6.18mm metal shell and weighs approximately 500 grams. To complement the productivity of the Xiaomi Pad 7, Xiaomi has also introduced its improved Focus Keyboard, which now includes a trackpad and backlit option, and the Focus Pen with better 8,132 pressure sensitivity levels for precision in drawing and writing. Of course, they cost extra. Talking of cost, the Pad 7 comes in three flavours. The Pad 7 costs Rs 26,999 for the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant and Rs 29,999 for the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage variant. Then there is the variant that costs Rs 31,999. It offers the Xiaomi Pad 7 with a nano-texture glass on the display, similar to what Apple puts on its iPad Pro M4. The Pad 7 screen with nano-texture reflects less light and consequently displays colours with more contrast, particularly in outdoor settings.  Coming back to the Xiaomi Pad 7, on paper it looks capable with loaded features and a rather superb price. But as I used it I also noticed a few niggles here and there. So, let’s take a closer look in this India Today Tech review.Looks so good, great in hands The Xiaomi Pad 7 is an incredibly lightweight tablet, weighing just 500 grams. It is also extremely slim at 6.18mm. The unit I am reviewing is in Mirage Purple. While the shade isn’t exactly purple, it features an iridescent purple hue that shifts beautifully under light. I really liked the design and colour. It’s stylish, easy to carry around, and fits perfectly in a handbag. The tablet has a metal finish at the back, which not only looks premium but is also fingerprint-resistant. However, the LCD display tends to catch fingerprints easily, so you’ll find yourself needing to clean it frequently. All-in-all it’s comfortable to hold and doesn’t strain your hand, even when carried in one hand.
 


 On the back, similar to the Xiaomi Pad 6, the Pad 7 features a square camera module – that houses a 13-megapixel camera, along with a flashlight and faux-lens shaped pattern. When you look at it, you might believe it has two rear cameras. But no, there is only one camera. On the sides, you’ll find the volume buttons, while the top houses the power button. At the bottom, there’s a Type-C charging port. The Pad 7 also includes quad speakers — two on the top and two on the bottom when the tablet is placed in portrait orientation.  On the front, the selfie camera is placed in a small punch hole cutout in landscape orientation. The bezels aren’t the thinnest but are uniform, giving the tablet a balanced and clean look. Clear LCD display On paper, the Pad 7 — as I noted in the specs above — has a display that checks all the right boxes. In practice, though, there are a few observations I wish to share. The Pad 7, keeping in line with its price, is using an LCD display. It is a good display but it is also not going to dazzle you or wow you like an OLED display in a premium phone, or top class LCD or OLED display in a more expensive tablet.  It’s not that the Pad 7 display is not capable enough. I used the Xiaomi Pad 7 to watch plenty of videos on YouTube and OTT platforms like Netflix, and I absolutely loved the picture quality. The display also comes with Dolby Vision support which makes it easy to watch high-resolution content on platforms like Netflix. With peak brightness of 800nits, it is also bright enough for indoor use.  Having said that, keep two things in mind. One, the Pad 7 screen lacks the ability to show the deepest deep blacks. And that means the colours on the Pad 7 do not have that super vibrant, liquid paint kind of look to them. And two, the brightness, while plenty, is not blindingly bright like the way you would get on a more — rather much more — expensive tablet.  
 


 Gaming on the Pad 7 screen was equally enjoyable. I spent a lot of time playing Netflix games — yes, I tested Netflix games —Minecraft, candy crush, Ludo and others. The large, smooth, and bright display made the experience immersive, lag free and fun especially for simulation games like Minecraft, which are much better on a big screen. I even tried the demanding games like Asphalt 9 and the experience was equally enjoyable with high graphic settings.  I tried some photo editing on the built-in MI Canvas app and worked on a few images. While I’ll cover performance in detail later, I really enjoyed the display's colour fidelity for these tasks. It is not brilliant but it is up to the task.   Of course, if you want a better display you can always step up to the nano-texture variant. Although I didn’t get a chance to use it in details — it will be arriving in India next month — I did get a chance to briefly try it at a media briefing by Xiaomi. In the brief time I used it, the matte display really impressed me as it effectively cut down reflections completely. If you prefer a matte display for a more glare-free experience, this option is worth considering.  However, for most users the standard LCD display also works well and delivers a satisfactory viewing experience.Powerful enough  We have seen Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset in action before in similarly priced smartphones like the OnePlus Nord 4 and Realme GT 6T. It’s a fast and capable chipset that performs well and effectively handles everyday tasks. In the Xiaomi Pad 7 too the  chipset works reliably and delivers smooth and competent performance. While using the Pad 7, not once did I face any lag or stutter. Whether multitasking, switching between apps, playing games, editing, or working on CMS, the device remained cool and quick. Although it gets slightly warm during heavy gaming sessions, it’s manageable and doesn’t affect performance. To figure out the performance of the Pad 7, I ran some benchmarks— you can see the results below — on it and the numbers were impressive.

 



I ran some benchmarks on the newly launched Xiaomi Pad 7
 The performance is further enhanced by HyperOS 2. Let me say, Xiaomi has done a really good job here. Unlike the cluttered OS experience we used to see on Xiaomi devices, HyperOS is clean, and the updated HyperOS 2 is lightweight, user-friendly, and packed with personalisation options. The inclusion of AI features makes it fun and functional. As I primarily used the tablet for entertainment, another standout feature was the speakers. The quad-speaker setup delivers clear and crisp audio with good volume. Although they aren’t bass-heavy, they’re sufficient for streaming or gaming. In fact, during my usage, I never felt the need to pair my earbuds with the Pad 7 — the built-in speakers were more than adequate.
 


 When it comes to performance, the Xiaomi Pad 7 delivers impressively in its segment. However, one area where it could have been better is battery life. With heavy use, such as hours of binge-watching, the battery lasted around 7 hours. While this is decent, a larger battery could have made it even better. The in-box 45W charger managed to fully recharge the battery in about 2 hours, but using any other charger significantly reduced the charging speed. A bit about the cameras Unlike smartphones, tablets aren’t designed for photography, and I didn’t expect much from the Pad 7 in this regard. However, for video calls and scanning documents, the cameras are sufficient. The front camera, in particular, features an ultra-wide angle, providing a great view during video calls.
 


Focus Keyboard and Pen  Along with the Xiaomi Pad 7, the company has also introduced a new and improved Focus Keyboard and Pen. Now, the keyboard this time comes with a trackpad and backlighting, which significantly improves its usability. After setting up the tablet with the keyboard, I even used the Pad 7 as my work device to write stories and file them using our CMS. The trackpad made it easier to control the cursor. While the keyboard is tactile and responsive, the trackpad is relatively small and not always smooth. It often failed to register gestures properly, which could be frustrating at times. Another aspect to note is the tilt. The Focus Keyboard allows you to tilt the tablet to a fixed angle of 124 degrees. While the magnets are sturdy and the tablet attaches securely, the tilt feels a bit restrictive. Especially during work sessions, the limited tilt angle felt slightly inconvenient, and a wider range of adjustment would have made using the tablet more comfortable. Coming to the Focus Pen, it can be magnetically attached to the Pad 7, where it also charges. The pen is easy to use and performs well for casual tasks. While it doesn’t provide a paper-like writing experience, it’s good enough for casual doodling, taking notes, or light writing. For everyday use, it gets the job done without any major issues.
 


Xiaomi Pad 7 review: Should you buy it?  Absolutely. If you’re looking for a good Android tablet under Rs 30,000, or a tablet with a matte display — similar to the iPad Pro —under Rs 35,000, the new Xiaomi Pad 7 is a compelling option. The Pad 7 is powerful and can easily handle your entertainment needs, including hours of binge-watching, casual gaming, and more. It’s lightweight, easy to carry around, and even convenient for casual video or office calls.  And if you opt for the keyboard accessory, you can use it like a laptop for writing reports, mails or just your thoughts.  And if you are someone who likes to doodle or are into digital art you can get the tablet with the pen. The Pen will keep you covered for sketching or note-taking. However, even without the accessories, the Pad 7 holds its own. It’s a capable tablet and arguably the best at its price point.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also Read |  OnePlus 13R review in 5 points: Flagship-killer for 2025Also Read |  Delhi man loses Rs 9 lakh after getting call from fake electricity department officialsAlso Read |  OnePlus 13R review: Great hardware, loaded with features, and a killer price

TikTok says reports of sale are pure fictionAs TikTok is facing the risk of a ban in the US with the deadline set for January 19, rumours have reached a fever pitch suggest that Elon Musk is in the mix to buy TikTok US operations. TikTok, however, has dismissed the rumours.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-to-buy-tiktok-us-tiktok-says-reports-of-sale-are-pure-fiction-2664394-2025-01-14,"Speculation over the future of TikTok’s US operations has reached a fever pitch, with reports suggesting Elon Musk is being considered as a potential buyer. However, TikTok has vehemently dismissed these claims, calling them “pure fiction.”   A Bloomberg report on Monday revealed that Chinese officials are in preliminary discussions about selling TikTok’s US arm to Musk, should the app face an imminent ban. The proposed move could see Musk’s social media platform X take control of TikTok’s operations in the country, integrating its 170 million US users with X’s extensive advertising infrastructure. The report valued such a deal at between $40 billion and $50 billion.  This development follows growing national security concerns in the United States over TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, and its ties to the Chinese government. ByteDance’s structure includes a ""golden share"" held by China, which grants Beijing significant influence. Several US lawmakers argue that this connection poses a risk to data privacy and security, fueling calls for divestment or a nationwide ban.   TikTok’s future in the US now hinges on a January 19 deadline, by which ByteDance must either sell the app’s US operations or cease its services in the country. Failure to comply would mean users losing access to updates and security patches, even as the app remains functional on existing devices.   Despite the urgency, TikTok has categorically denied any talks involving Musk, ByteDance, or the Chinese government regarding a potential sale. “We can’t be expected to comment on pure fiction,” a TikTok spokesperson said. ByteDance has also reiterated that China’s stake in the company has “no bearing on its global operations outside of China, including TikTok.”   The prospect of Musk’s involvement stems from his existing connections in China through Tesla’s operations and a proven track record in high-profile acquisitions. In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, later rebranding it as X. However, analysts note that a TikTok acquisition would pose unique challenges, including the complex separation of its US business and securing financing, even for the world’s richest man.   The Bloomberg report also indicated that if Musk does not proceed with a deal, other potential bidders could include Microsoft, Oracle, and investor-led consortiums.   Meanwhile, China is reportedly keen on keeping TikTok under ByteDance’s control. Selling to a foreign entity would not only diminish China’s strategic leverage but could also set a precedent for other companies facing scrutiny abroad.   For TikTok creators and users, the stakes are high. A ban would likely force creators to migrate to platforms like YouTube or Instagram Reels, potentially benefiting companies like Meta and Google.   As TikTok faces mounting pressure from both the US government and its looming deadline, all eyes remain on ByteDance, Elon Musk, and the decisions that could shape the future of one of the world’s most popular apps.

d12f05a3-ae8c-4bec-b220-6f1a12a3c419,"US AI chip export restrictions: Impact on India, global tech industry The US government has announced restrictions on AI chip exports to curb China's technological advancement, which could have a significant impact on the global AI chip market, including India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/us-announces-restrictions-on-exporting-ai-chips-how-the-move-can-impact-india-and-global-tech-industry-2664446-2025-01-14,"The United States has introduced sweeping new regulations limiting the export of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, tightening rules for companies like Nvidia, as it aims to curb China's technological advancements. These new restrictions could have a significant impact on the global AI chip market, including in India. The new rules, set to take effect within a year, impose strict limits on the computational power of AI chips sold to most countries. Exceptions are made for allied nations adhering to the US-approved security and human rights standards. These new rules are designed to prevent adversaries, particularly China and Russia, from taking advantage of advanced AI technology for military or surveillance purposes.  “Managing national security risks requires trade-offs. This rule ensures our allies can access cutting-edge technology while safeguarding our interests,” wrote US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo in a blogpost by the White House. The regulations build on previous chip export controls, with the goal of ensuring that AI development aligns with US standards. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in an official statement: “This rule ensures that the infrastructure for frontier AI systems remains in America or allied jurisdictions, preventing offshoring similar to what occurred with chips and batteries.”Nvidia reacts Nvidia voiced strong opposition to the new regulations. Nvidia, a leader in AI chip production, warned that the policy risks undermining America’s global technological dominance. “The rule threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” said Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs. The company highlighted the potential unintended consequences of these restrictions, including driving customers to Chinese competitors like Huawei, which has made significant advancements in AI chips. Nvidia’s concerns align with broader industry fears that regulatory overreach could stifle competition.Global reactions and EU concerns China condemned the US measures, accusing the US government of disrupting international trade and innovation. The European Union also expressed apprehension, noting that the restrictions could strain transatlantic tech collaboration. “It is in the US economic and security interest that the EU buys advanced AI chips without limitations,” EU officials said.The Indian angle India, which has been pushing for AI and semiconductor manufacturing lately, could find itself at an advantage due to its strategic partnerships with the US. The restrictions exclude supply chain activities and gaming chips, but they bar exporting AI chips to nations like China and Russia. This policy could potentially redirect investments and resources toward countries like India, strengthening its position in the global AI and tech ecosystem.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also read |  Elon Musk to buy TikTok US?

However, as more and more people are increasing their footprint in the digital world, scammers have also started employing new tactics, including using the names of government schemes to trick people and steal their money. One such case of this scam comes from Hyderabad, where a 53-year-old man lost â‚¹1.9 lakh to a fake message claiming to offer benefits under the PM Kisan scheme. The victim, who resides in Old Safilguda and works in a private firm, received a WhatsApp message containing a link that appeared genuine but turned out to be fraudulent, as reported by Deccan Chronicle. According to the report, the victim clicked on the link shared in his WhatsApp chat by an unknown individual. Upon clicking, he was directed to a fake website. Believing it to be an official portal, the victim attempted to get more details about the government scheme. Following the instructions, he ended up sharing a one-time password (OTP) provided by the scammers. This lapse allowed the fraudsters to access his bank account and siphon off a significant amount of money. Realizing the scam, the victim promptly reported the incident to the Rachakonda Cybercrime Police, who have since registered a case and initiated an investigation.How to stay safe from such scams  If you are interested in learning more about government schemes, note that the government has established official platforms where citizens can verify information and access legitimate services. For instance, the official PM Kisan website – pmkisan.gov.in–  and the National Portal of India– india.gov.in–  are reliable sources for information on government schemes. If you receive advertisements or messages on platforms like WhatsApp, always cross-check unsolicited messages against these platforms and avoid interacting with unverified links. Additionally, always verify the authenticity of messages, especially those offering financial benefits. Check official government websites or contact helplines for confirmation. If you are unsure or the link appears suspicious, do not click on links sent via unsolicited messages, emails, or social media platforms, as they can be malicious and designed to hack into your devices. Never share OTPs with anyone. Treat OTPs as confidential information and never disclose them, even if someone claims to be from a trusted organization. If you suspect fraud, report it immediately to the local police or cybercrime cell. In India, complaints can also be filed through the Cyber Crime Reporting Portal – cybercrime.gov.in.

Replying to unknown messages enables links and confirms active numbers, making users targets for future scams.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/your-iphone-data-is-at-risk-cybercriminals-have-found-a-way-to-easily-access-your-messages-2664415-2025-01-14,"Cybercriminals have found a new way to exploit iPhone users by bypassing iMessage’s built-in phishing protection, leaving users vulnerable to malicious links and scams. This worrying trend was reported by BleepingComputer, highlighting a tactic that could put many people at risk of fraud. iMessage has a security feature that automatically disables clickable links in messages from unknown senders. It’s a smart tool meant to protect users from phishing attacks. However, scammers have figured out how to turn this feature against the users it’s designed to protect. According to Apple, when you reply to a message or add the sender to your contacts, those disabled links suddenly become clickable. Scammers are taking full advantage of this behaviour, fooling users into engaging with their messages. The fraudulent messages often pretend to be from trusted organisations. They use language that looks official and familiar, such as “reply STOP” or “reply NO,” to make the message seem legitimate. This is similar to the wording used by many real businesses or services, which is why people can be easily tricked. What makes this scam particularly effective is that replying to these messages does more than enable the links. It also gives scammers valuable information — confirmation that the phone number is active, and the recipient is likely to respond to future scams. This puts those users at greater risk of being targeted again. While folks who have a keen interest in technology may spot the signs of a phishing scam, the bigger concern is for older people or those less familiar with these tactics. They are the ones most likely to fall for these tricks, often because they assume the messages are genuine. So how can you protect yourself? The best advice is simple — don’t reply to messages from unknown senders, no matter how convincing they appear. If something feels off, trust your instincts and leave the message alone. Another layer of protection is available on iPhones and iPads through message filtering. This feature moves messages from people who aren’t in your contacts into a separate list. To enable it, go to Settings > Messages > toggle on Filter Unknown Senders. This way, it’s easier to spot unfamiliar messages and decide whether to engage with them. It’s worth noting that this feature might also filter legitimate messages, like delivery updates or notifications from your bank. However, links in messages from unknown senders remain disabled unless you reply or add the sender to your contacts. That’s how the system is designed to work.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

Here are the details.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/alert-hackers-use-apps-like-candy-crush-and-tinder-to-spy-on-you-access-personal-information-2664502-2025-01-14,"Some of the most widely used mobile apps, including Candy Crush and Tinder, are reportedly gathering sensitive user location data without their knowledge, according to a fresh report by 404 Media. The apps, available on both Android and iOS, may be involved in data collection through the advertising ecosystem, raising serious privacy concerns. This data is believed to have ended up with a location data broker, Gravy Analytics, whose subsidiary, Venntel, has previously sold such information to US law enforcement agencies. The report reveals that this data collection likely happens through real-time bidding (RTB) systems, where companies bid to display ads within apps. While these ads run, data brokers like Gravy Analytics are allegedly able to intercept and gather user location data, even without the direct involvement of app developers. This process is not controlled by the app creators themselves, meaning users remain unaware that their location is being monitored. Security experts, including Zach Edwards from cybersecurity firm Silent Push, are alarmed by the scale of this data harvesting. According to the report, Edwards stated that this marks one of the first times the public has concrete evidence showing that some data brokers are acquiring user information from advertising bid streams, rather than from code embedded in the apps themselves. The leaked data reportedly includes over 30 million location points, including sensitive areas like the White House, Kremlin, Vatican City, and several military bases. The list of apps involved in this breach includes popular games like Candy Crush, Subway Surfers, Temple Run, and even dating platforms like Tinder and Grindr. Also mentioned are health-related apps, such as MyFitnessPal and various pregnancy trackers, along with religious and VPN apps, which ironically are often downloaded to enhance privacy. This privacy breach has raised concerns worldwide, particularly after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently imposed a ban on Gravy Analytics and Venntel for selling location data without user consent. While many apps seem safe on the surface, this incident hints at the growing risks associated with the misuse of user data through indirect means like ad ecosystems. How to secure your data on Android phones and iPhones? Experts suggest that smartphone users be cautious when granting location permissions to apps and consider reviewing app privacy policies more carefully. Android users are advised to avoid granting unnecessary permissions, such as location and camera access, to apps that do not require them for basic functionality. iPhone users can enable the ""Ask Apps Not to Track"" feature after installing an app to limit tracking and data collection.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 14, 2025

Meanwhile, for buyers who are in a hurry and want to make a quick decision, here are four reasons to buy the Pixel 9 and one reason you may need to think twice or skip the deal altogether. Reason 1 to buy: Outstanding camera performance Year on year, Google’s Pixel phones are known for their cameras, and the Pixel 9 is no different. The phone is equipped with a 50-megapixel main sensor and a 48-megapixel ultra-wide camera. The camera manages to deliver sharp and vibrant photos in various lighting conditions. The improved HDR pipeline also ensures well-balanced exposure, making it a perfect camera set for capturing sunsets, portraits, and low-light scenes. While it lacks the telephoto lens of its Pro sibling, the Pixel 9’s cameras still outperform many competitors in its class. The cameras are further complemented by features like Magic Editor and Pixel Studio, allowing users to edit and tweak photos using generative AI tools within the phone.  If mobile photography is your top priority in premium phones, then the Pixel 9 is your option and even better with the available discount.Reason 2 to buy: AI integration The Pixel 9 also comes loaded with Google’s latest AI features powered by the Tensor G4 chipset. The Pixel 9 comes integrated with Gemini Live, which is right on one of the smartest AI assistance, bringing human-like voice interactions. It also has features like Call Notes transcribes in real, Screenshots app, Magic Editor, and more features to get your work done quick and in fun way.  Along with AI integration, the new Pixel 9 also offers seven years of Android updates, which means that these AI features will be updated and will only improve over time. This level of software support is rare in the Android ecosystem and adds long-term value to the Pixel 9.advertisementReason 3: Premium build and displayIn our review of Pixel 9, we also highlighted the new refreshed design elements, making the Pixel 9’s minimalist design stand out. Its aluminium frame with a matte finish feels sturdy, and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on both sides adds durability. The 6.3-inch Actua Display offers vibrant colours and excellent brightness. Even under harsh sunlight, the screen remains legible, making it suitable for outdoor use. The compact size and manageable weight – 198 grams – make the Pixel 9 a great option for users who find big smartphones cumbersome.Reason 4: Exceptional battery lifeBattery performance is one of the Pixel 9’s standout features. In our tests, it lasted over 17 hours with 20 per cent battery remaining, making it one of the most enduring phones in its class. For everyday use, you can expect it to easily last a day and a half, or even two days with moderate usage.One reason to skip: dated chipsetNow, although the Tensor G4 inside the Pixel 9 is capable of handling daily use smoothly and powers Google’s AI features, it feels a bit dated compared to newer processors like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. This even made the Pixel 9 fall short in benchmark tests when compared to newer processors during our review, and this might affect performance longevity.Additionally, its charging speed leaves much to be desired. Limited to 34W wired charging, it lags behind competitors like the OnePlus 13, which offers super-fast charging. With no charger included in the box, users will need to purchase a compatible one separately.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also Read |  Hyderabad man gets WhatsApp message about PM Kisan scheme, loses Rs 1.9 lakh after clicking on the fake linkAlso Read |  Xiaomi Pad 7 review: Lightweight and powerfulAlso Read |  OnePlus 13R review in 5 points: Flagship-killer for 2025

This phone packs a serious punch and has all the ingredients to compete as the best performance-focused device in the sub-Rs 30,000 price segment. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chip, the X7 Pro also features a massive 6,550mAh battery with support for 90W fast charging. It is the first phone in India to ship with HyperOS 2.0 software out of the box. With the Poco X7 Pro now on sale in India, the main question is — is it worth your hard-earned cash? In this article, we outline the top 4 reasons to consider the Poco X7 Pro and 1 reason to think twice.Poco X7 Pro 5G: 4 Reasons to Buy Good design and a vibrant display The Poco X7 Pro takes a practical approach to design, and that’s not a bad thing. As noted in our quick review, while the standard X7 features a curvier profile with a curved display — a design trait typically reserved for pricier devices — the X7 Pro opts for a boxier profile that feels more refined in hand. The Poco Yellow colour variant with its two-tone yellow finish is a standout. Polarising as it may be, it’s sure to grab attention. Despite packing a large battery, the X7 Pro is relatively slim and lightweight compared to other devices in its segment.  The 6.67-inch flat AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate is equally impressive. With slim bezels, support for HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, and vibrant colours, the viewing experience is top-notch. The peak brightness of 3,200 nits ensures excellent legibility, even outdoors. MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra is a powerhouse At its core, the Poco X7 Pro runs on the MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset, delivering exceptional performance for its price. Like its predecessor, the Poco X6 Pro, the X7 Pro includes LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage, components typically found in flagship devices. The Poco X6 Pro set a benchmark as the best gaming phone in its price bracket last year. The X7 Pro looks ready to take that title, and we hope this chipset becomes more common in mid-range devices. If your budget is around Rs 24,000, it’s worth stretching a bit further for the X7 Pro, as its performance justifies the extra spending. Massive Battery and Fast Charging The Poco X7 Pro features a massive 6,550mAh battery with 90W fast charging support, the largest battery seen on any current-generation smartphone post-2024. Impressively, it maintains a slim 8.3mm thickness, matching the standard X7 despite its larger battery.  The X7 Pro uses a silicon carbon battery with higher density than conventional lithium-ion batteries, offering greater endurance and longevity. For heavy users, this battery setup makes the X7 Pro a standout choice. HyperOS 2.0 atop Android 15 The Poco X7 Pro is the first phone in India to feature HyperOS 2.0 out of the box, running on Android 15. This software upgrade brings smoother animations, enhanced transitions, and better customisation options compared to its predecessor. In contrast, the standard X7 ships with the older HyperOS atop Android 14, which feels like a missed opportunity. By choosing the X7 Pro, you get the latest software experience.Poco X7 Pro 5G: 1 Reason to Skip Cameras Could Be Better The Poco X7 Pro features a dual-camera setup — a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-600 main sensor with OIS and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, alongside a 20-megapixel front camera. While this setup performs well in most conditions, there are occasional inconsistencies in colour reproduction. The selfie camera, in particular, could use some fine-tuning for low-light performance. While the standard Poco X7 includes an additional 2-megapixel macro lens, the Pro's superior hardware and ISP deliver better overall photos. That said, the camera system is not without flaws, and we’ll reserve our final judgment until we’ve conducted more in-depth testing. Overall, the Poco X7 Pro 5G has a lot going for it — a sleek design, vibrant display, powerful chipset, long-lasting battery, and up-to-date software. However, if cameras are your priority, you may want to explore other options in this price range. To find out more, stay tuned for our detailed review.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, Poco X7 Pro quick review: Potential to reshape the mid-range segmentAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?

Here is the full story in 5 pointsChina is reportedly considering selling TikTok's US operations to Elon Musk if the app fails to avoid a potential ban, raising questions about its future in the American market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/is-elon-musk-buying-tiktok-amid-threat-of-us-ban-here-is-the-full-story-in-5-points-2664580-2025-01-14,"As TikTok faces increasing scrutiny from US lawmakers over national security concerns, Chinese officials are reportedly exploring the possibility of selling the app’s US operations to billionaire Elon Musk. Beijing, while preferring the app to remain under ByteDance’s control, is considering backup plans to ensure the platform's future in the US. Here are five key points on the situation: 1. Chinese officials consider Musk as a potential buyer   With TikTok at risk of being banned in the US, Chinese officials are reportedly considering selling its US operations to Elon Musk. According to Bloomberg, discussions have taken place as a contingency plan if TikTok cannot address US lawmakers' concerns about national security. The Chinese government would rather keep the app under ByteDance, but a sale to Musk is seen as a fallback option. 2. Supreme Court to rule on TikTok ban by January 2025

The matter has now reached the US Supreme Court, which is expected to deliver a ruling by January 19, 2025. Justices have hinted they are likely to uphold the legislation, prioritising national security over TikTok’s argument that the ban would violate First Amendment rights related to free speech. If the ruling favours a ban, TikTok could be forced to sell or shut down its US operations. 3. Elon Musk’s X could manage TikTok US operations  One scenario being considered involves Musk’s social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), taking over the management of TikTok’s US operations. Such a move could lead to an integration between the two platforms, helping X attract more advertisers. Moreover, Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, could leverage TikTok’s vast user data to enhance its AI capabilities. However, no formal talks between Musk, ByteDance, or TikTok have been confirmed, and Musk has not publicly commented on the potential sale. 4. Chinese government’s involvement in TikTok sale ByteDance has long denied any influence from the Chinese government in TikTok’s global operations, asserting that the company operates independently. However, Beijing holds a “golden share” in a ByteDance affiliate, which gives it some control over the company's strategy. Additionally, Chinese export regulations prevent the sale of certain technologies, including TikTok’s prized recommendation algorithm. This means any potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, further complicating the process. 5. TikTok US operations valued at up to $50 billion  Analysts estimate that TikTok’s US operations are worth between $40 billion and $50 billion. Any sale would be highly complex, involving stakeholders in both the US and China. ByteDance has raised concerns about the difficulty of spinning off its US business, describing the process as “extraordinarily difficult” during its Supreme Court arguments. Some reports have also floated the possibility of migrating TikTok’s US users to a similar app under a different brand, although the effectiveness of this approach remains uncertain. As TikTok’s fate in the US remains uncertain, rival platforms like Meta’s Instagram and Google’s YouTube are ramping up their short-video offerings in a bid to capture TikTok’s user base should the platform face a ban.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

caf8e2d2-0eb1-476f-916e-f8306e72025c,"Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh review: Compact and multi-device charging  DailyObject recently launched the new Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh. We have tested it with our iPhone 16 Plus for 10 days. Here is India Today Tech's detailed review of the power bank. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/loop-qi2-certified-magsafe-compatible-power-bank-10000-mah-review-compact-and-multi-device-charging-2664649-2025-01-14,"I travel a lot, and my job requires me to carry multiple gadgets and electronic devices. That's why I never leave the house without a power bank — it's an absolute essential. I am also knee deep into the Apple ecosystem, so I am never charging just one device –– I have to track the charge on my iPhone, AirPods and my Apple Watch.  Of course, when given the choice, I would always pick a wired wall charger to fuel up my gadgets, because it’s definitely quicker. But the hassle of carrying all the wires when you are travelling is a bit much sometimes. So, when DailyObjects reached out about their Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible Power Bank, I jumped on the opportunity to review it. I have replaced my wired charger with the power back since the past 10 days to test it, and I must say I am impressed. â€è â€è There are a lot of things that I like about the device, but let me start with talking about the basic specifications of the power bank. The Loop power bank comes in three options –– 5,000mAh, 10,000mAh and 20,000mAh capacity. I reviewed the one with a 10,000 mAh battery. It is priced at Rs 5,999. The charger is Qi2-certified, which means it can allow your MagSafe iPhones to charge at up to 15W charging speeds, which is faster than the regular wireless chargers. â€è â€è In terms of design, it has a tiny LED display at the back, which shows the leftover charge in the powerbank. It also sports a USB-C port with 20W charging support. It also supports two-way charging for devices like iPads or other phones that do not support wireless charging. The 10,000 mAh version also includes a retractable kickstand that lets you keep your iPhone upright while it's magnetically attached to the charger, so that your power bank also doubles as an iPhone stand. â€è â€èThe design is cool and compact, but it’s not perfect â€è â€è The MagSafe power bank is made of an aerospace-grade aluminum body. The unit I received sports titanium colour. There is also a black variant. â€è â€èIt is interesting to see that the power bank follows a bunch of design cues from Apple’s own aesthetics to create a bit of design familiarity, I suppose. Not only does it come in the desert titanium-like colour option, it also features the loop pattern that you see on the retail boxes of iPads.â€è â€è
 


 Talking about portability and in-hand feel, the power bank is compact and fits easily in one palm. It has some weight for sure, which is understandable given the 10,000mAh battery squeezed in that tiny body. The metallic finish gives it a premium touch.â€è â€è Dropping a power bank is never ideal, but if you're as clumsy as I am, it happens sometimes. If you do drop it, the edges will likely get dented. Thankfully, the included pouch offers some extra protection to keep it safer.â€è â€è Besides being compact, the design is also functional. It’s multipurpose and can charge multiple devices at once — more on that in a bit. The 10,000 mAh version comes with a stand, allowing you to use it as a phone stand. So, you can either use it while watching something on your iPhone or enjoy the StandBy mode on your iPhone while the device firmly sticks to the power bank. Additionally, along with the MagSafe ring, the charger on the front also includes a slot to charge your Apple Watch.â€è â€è Here’s the thing: on paper, the device looks fantastic. However, it has minor issues that can be quite irritating in practice. For instance, if you’re using a standard iPhone or an iPhone Pro, you can place it on the charger while also using the watch charging space simultaneously. But if you have the iPhone Plus variant — like my iPhone 16 Plus — there isn’t enough space to charge your Apple Watch wirelessly at the same time.â€è â€è
 


 Also, while the Apple Watch is wirelessly charging on the power bank, if you happen to use the Loop band, placing it on the charging slot is a bit tricky. You might need to figure out how to position it properly or even remove one side of the strap to properly place it on the charger.â€è advertisementCan become your travel essential â€è â€èAs far as performance is concerned, the Loop charger does what it promises well. The power bank charges my iPhone 16 Plus –– which has a bigger battery compared to the vanilla iPhone 16 — from 0 to 100 per cent within an hour, which is impressive. Even the AirPods and Apple Watch charged fairly quickly.â€è â€è
 


Since the charger is MagSafe, it works best with iPhones, AirPods, Apple Watches, and, of course, iPads. However, it also supports wireless charging for other devices like the Pixel 9 and other supported devices, which is quite convenient. Although the box does not include a Type-C cable, I ended up carrying one whenever I needed to use the power bank with a cable.â€è â€èadvertisementThe LED screen also comes in handy to show the remaining power available in the power bank.â€è â€èAll in all, as far as the charging capabilities are concerned, the Loop power bank does its job pretty well and quickly, keeping everything sorted for travel.â€è â€è
 


Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10000 mAh review: Should you buy it? â€è â€èIf you're looking for a wireless power bank with MagSafe, the Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh is definitely worth considering. It can charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods –– though not your MacBook. It also supports other wireless charging-compatible devices, and for those that don’t, simply keep a cord handy, and it will charge them too.â€è â€èAt Rs 6,000, the pricing isn’t exactly cheap, but after using the power bank, I can say it justifies the price tag. The power bank supports multiple charging options, a compact design, wired charging support, and a convenient in-built stand. It has some design limitations, but they are manageable issues. Overall, the charger performs efficiently and it is worth the money.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/moto-razr-60-ultra-may-soon-launch-in-india-could-feature-upcoming-snapdragon-8s-elite-chip-2664630-2025-01-14,"Motorola is highly likely to launch its next-generation foldable smartphone, the Moto Razr 60 Ultra, soon in India. According to a report by 91Mobiles, the upcoming Moto Razr 60 Ultra has been spotted on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) website, hinting at its imminent debut. The new foldable flagship from Motorola has reportedly been listed with the model number XT2551 and the codename ""Orion,"".  The name in the listing has been noted to be consistent with Motorola's naming scheme for its devices. For example, the Razr 50 Ultra, which launched in July 2024, was listed under the model number XT2451. While the listing suggests that the device might arrive in India soon, if Motorola follows the same timeline as its predecessor, the Razr 60 Ultra could be available in the Indian market by mid-2025. As for the new upgrades, an earlier report by 91Mobiles suggested that the new flagship is likely to arrive with the Snapdragon 8s Elite chipset, a processor yet to make its global debut. It is reported that the Razr 60 Ultra could be the first smartphone on the market to feature Qualcomm's latest chipset. The next-gen chipset is also expected to offer performance capabilities similar to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, with upgrades in efficiency and power. If this chipset is indeed confirmed, the Razr 60 Ultra could be among the first devices to include it, promising robust performance for multitasking, gaming, and camera functionality. Paired with the chipset, the Razr 60 Ultra is said to include LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage. These would represent significant upgrades for the upcoming flagship compared to its predecessor, the Razr 50 Ultra. As for other specifications, reports indicate that we can expect significant updates. The Razr 50 Ultra featured a 6.9-inch FHD+ LTPO pOLED inner display with a 165Hz refresh rate. The Razr 60 Ultra is expected to retain a similarly high-quality panel for detailed visuals and smooth scrolling. Additionally, the foldable design of the flagship could see some refinements, potentially resulting in a thinner and more ergonomic device. In the camera department, the Razr 50 Ultra came with a dual-camera setup comprising a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x zoom. While specific details about the Razr 60 Ultra’s camera system remain unknown, Motorola is likely to include enhanced sensors for improved photography and videography. Battery life is another area where the Razr 60 Ultra could improve. The Razr 50 Ultra features a 4,000mAh battery with 45W fast charging. Speculations suggest that the new model might include a larger battery and faster charging capabilities to meet user needs.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also Read |  Pixel 9 gets Rs 12,000 discount: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso Read |  Hyderabad man gets WhatsApp message about PM Kisan scheme, loses Rs 1.9 lakh after clicking on the fake linkAlso Read |  Xiaomi Pad 7 review: Lightweight and powerful

Although the OnePlus 13R -- priced much lower -- brings impressive performance to the table, the OnePlus 13 offers a lot more which justifies its higher price tag. If you find it difficult to choose between the two, this article will break down the key differences and help you decide which OnePlus device best fits your needs. -OnePlus 13R price starts at Rs 42,999  
-OnePlus 13 price is set at Rs 69,999OnePlus 13 vs OnePlus 13R: Which one should you buy? If budget constraints are a primary factor for you, then the OnePlus 13R is an excellent choice. However, if you are willing to stretch your budget for the best possible experience, the flagship OnePlus 13 is the smarter option. Why? It’s not just about the price; performance, build quality, and additional features make a big difference in the overall experience.OnePlus 13 vs OnePlus 13R: A big gap in performance Let’s start with performance. While the OnePlus 13R comes equipped with an earlier-generation flagship chipset, the OnePlus 13 is powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. The new chip offers faster, smoother performance, especially for power users who demand top-tier efficiency from their smartphones. 
 


The benchmark numbers clearly show the big performance gap between the two phones. In our Antutu tests, the OnePlus 13 achieved a staggering 1.1 million in GPU score, whereas the 13R recorded a 7.9 lakh score -- commendable but clearly outpaced. Similarly, in CPU performance, the OnePlus 13 hit 2.5 million, while the 13R scored 1.7 million. On Geekbench, the OnePlus 13 scored over 9,000 in the multi-core test compared to the OnePlus 13R's 6,572. In real-world usage, both phones perform well, but the OnePlus 13 is the go-to choice for users who demand peak performance, especially for gaming and intensive multitasking. Having said that, for its price segment, the OnePlus 13R still competes very strongly with rivals like the iQOO 12 and Oppo Reno 13 Pro.Also, the OnePlus 13 offers 100W fast charging, as opposed to the 80W support on the 13R. Though this difference in charging speed may not be a deal breaker for many, those who prioritise the fastest performance in every aspect will appreciate it.OnePlus 13 vs OnePlus 13R: Other key differences The benchmark numbers clearly show the big performance gap between the two phones.

Though this difference in charging speed may not be a deal breaker for many, those who prioritise the fastest performance in every aspect will appreciate it.OnePlus 13 vs OnePlus 13R: Other key differences Beyond performance, there are several features that differentiate the OnePlus 13 from its more affordable sibling. First, the OnePlus 13 carries a higher IP rating (IP68/IP69), offering better dust and water resistance than the OnePlus 13R (IP65). In addition, the flagship model comes with wireless charging support, a premium feature that the 13R lacks.

The company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that roughly 5 per cent of the company’s workforce will be affected, as Meta aims to accelerate its performance management process. In a memo to employees, Zuckerberg explained that the company would be moving more swiftly to remove low-performing staff, Bloomberg reports. This follows Meta’s earlier decision in 2023 to cut 10,000 jobs in its ""year of efficiency"" drive. ""I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster,"" he said in a note shared with an internal message board.  Zuckerberg mentioned that the company usually addresses underperformance over a year but will now implement more extensive cuts. Despite the layoffs, Meta plans to replace the roles in 2025, positioning itself for future growth and innovation. The focus in the coming year will be on areas like artificial intelligence (AI), smart glasses, and evolving social media platforms, as Zuckerberg described the upcoming year as ""intense."" ""We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,"" he said, ""but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle."" Meta, which had around 72,000 employees as of September, is expected to notify impacted US-based staff on February 10. Employees outside the US market working for Meta will be informed later. The company reportedly aims to achieve 10 per cent ""non-regrettable"" attrition by the end of this performance cycle, continuing a similar trend from the previous year.Microsoft is also firing low-performing employees In a similar move, Microsoft is also reportedly preparing to fire employees, targeting those who underperformed. While the company hasn’t revealed the number of employees to be impacted, a recent report from Business Insider claimed that several departments, including critical divisions, will be affected. Microsoft is following its long-standing practice of restructuring under CEO Satya Nadella, with the latest layoffs being done to focus on maintaining a high-performing workforce.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 14, 2025

While this is the right time to buy the iPhone 16, Apple will unveil the iPhone 17 in September this year. Based on the leaks and rumours, the iPhone 17 series is expected to bring a host of upgrades over its predecessor, the iPhone 16, enhancing both performance and user experience.  One of the most notable changes could be the new A17 Bionic chip, offering superior performance and energy efficiency compared to the A16 chip. This would result in smoother multitasking and better overall speed. Design-wise, the iPhone 17 may feature slimmer bezels and a more refined form factor, possibly along with an improved ProMotion display, offering higher refresh rates or better brightness for an enhanced viewing experience.

 Camera improvements are also anticipated, with enhanced sensors, better low-light performance, and new computational photography features. The iPhone 17 might also introduce improvements to zoom capabilities and a more advanced telephoto lens.  Battery life could see improvements as well, thanks to better power optimisation from the A17 chip and potentially a larger battery. Another major upgrade could be the transition to a USB-C port for faster charging and data transfer, aligning with industry trends. Furthermore, the iPhone 17 could introduce new features such as under-display Face ID or enhanced augmented reality capabilities, setting the stage for a more immersive and futuristic experience. Overall, the iPhone 17 is likely to offer incremental but significant improvements over the iPhone 16. Rumours suggest it will feature full integration with Apple Intelligence updates, an enhanced camera system, a redesigned look, and an entirely new model. However, purchasing the iPhone 16 now still comes with its perks, as Apple’s trade-in program next year is likely to offer great deals for upgrading. For those seeking an immediate upgrade, the iPhone 16 series already delivers a cutting-edge experience with iOS 18 and access to the forthcoming Apple Intelligence features.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also read |  Moto Razr 60 Ultra may soon launch in India, could feature upcoming Snapdragon 8s Elite chipAlso read |  Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max available at a discount and this is the right time to buy the phone: Here is whyAlso read |  Pixel 9 gets Rs 12,000 discount: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

These changes include new features designed to make messaging more customisable and efficient, along with updates to its design. One of the standout features is the addition of camera effects for photos and videos shared in chats. Users can now choose from 30 different filters, backgrounds, and visual effects to enhance their images before sending them. This expands on the tools WhatsApp rolled out for video calls last year, offering more creative options directly within messaging. Another new feature that’s bound to get users talking is selfie stickers. As the name suggests, you can now turn your selfies into stickers to share in your chats. All you need to do is tap the create sticker icon > use the camera to snap a selfie, and you have a personalised sticker. Currently, this feature is available on Android, with iOS users expected to get it soon. WhatsApp is also making it easier to share sticker packs. If you come across a sticker pack that you think a friend would enjoy, you can now share it directly in your chats. It’s a small but handy addition that will definitely appeal to sticker lovers who enjoy swapping and sharing their collections. The update also brings a small but useful improvement to message reactions. Users can now double-tap on a message to react, a faster alternative to the previous method of holding down on the message to select a reaction. A scrolling pop-out menu featuring the user’s most-used emojis has also been introduced, allowing for quicker access to frequently used reactions. While the full emoji library is still accessible via the reaction bar’s “+” symbol, the new layout is aimed at streamlining the process. This feature is similar to what platforms like Discord offer, where frequently used reactions are easy to access. It’s worth noting that while Meta’s Messenger app still offers a fixed set of emojis for reactions, this update on WhatsApp adds an extra layer of personalisation that many users will appreciate.  WhatsApp says these changes are just the start of what’s to come in 2025. The company remains focused on improving the messaging experience while continuing to prioritise privacy and security for its users worldwide.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

It's like having a personal assistant to handle daily updates, simple tasks, and even recurring reminders — all managed right in the app.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-gets-a-big-update-can-now-set-reminders-and-perform-some-actions-2664949-2025-01-15,"OpenAI is adding something new to ChatGPT that could make it feel more like a personal assistant. The new feature, called Tasks — currently in beta — lets users set up reminders and schedule actions for the future. Starting today, it’s available for those subscribed to the Plus, Team, or Pro plans. The idea is pretty simple — instead of just answering your questions or helping you in the moment, ChatGPT can now take care of things you want to be done later. For example, you can ask it to send you a daily weather update at 7 AM, remind you about an important deadline, or even share a silly joke before bedtime to lighten the mood. You can set up one-time tasks or make them recur if it’s something you need regularly. To use it, you’ll need to select the 4o with scheduled tasks option in the ChatGPT menu. From there, just type what you want and when you need it done. ChatGPT can even suggest tasks based on what you’ve been chatting about, though you’ll have to confirm them first. While handy, some people might find these suggestions a bit unnecessary or even annoying if they don’t like too much AI interference. You can keep track of everything in two ways — directly in your chat threads or through a new Tasks section, which you’ll find in the profile menu if you’re using ChatGPT on the web. It’s easy to tweak or cancel tasks if your plans change. When a task is done, you’ll get notified on the web, desktop, or mobile. There’s a limit of 10 active tasks at a time, so it doesn’t get too messy. This update feels like a bit of a shift for ChatGPT. Until now, it’s only been used for conversations and answering questions on the spot. But with Tasks, it’s stepping into the role of a helper you can count on for things down the line. Of course, there are still some questions about how reliable it’ll be. Will it always deliver reminders or updates on time? And what happens if it messes up something time-sensitive? Since the feature is still in beta, OpenAI is likely to use this period to work out any issues before a wider release. Looking ahead, OpenAI seems to have even bigger plans. Reports suggest they’re working on something called Operator, which could let ChatGPT control your computer on its own. Another tool, codenamed Caterpillar, might allow ChatGPT to look up specific information, solve problems, or manage documents for you. For now, though, Tasks is here for paying users to try out. It’s a handy new feature, but since it’s still being tested, it’s probably best not to rely on it for anything too critical just yet. At the moment, OpenAI hasn’t said whether this feature will be available to free users. For now, it’s part of the paid plans, which cost $20 (roughly Rs 1,730) to $200 (roughly Rs 17,300) a month.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

If TikTok shuts off for all US users, the outcome would be different from that mandated by the law. The law would mandate a ban only on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores while existing users could still continue using the app for some time. Under TikTok's plan, people attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. TikTok also plans to give users the option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information with them, the report said. TikTok and its Chinese parent ByteDance didn't immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments. President Joe Biden had in April last year signed a law requiring Bytedance to sell its US assets by January 19, 2025 or face a nationwide ban. The companies have sought, at the very least, a delay in implementation of the law, which they say violates the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgement of free speech. TikTok said in a court filing last month that it estimates one-third of the 170 million Americans using its app would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasts a month.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also read |  Is Elon Musk buying TikTok amid threat of US ban?

Here is the full story in 5 points.

According to the SEC, Musk did not report surpassing a 5 percent ownership of Twitter’s stock in March 2022 within the mandated 10-day period.  The SEC stated that because Musk failed to timely disclose his beneficial ownership, ""he was able to make these purchases from the unsuspecting public at artificially low prices, which did not yet reflect the undisclosed material information of Musk’s beneficial ownership of more than five percent of Twitter common stock and investment purpose.” However, Musk's lawyer has a different story to tell. Here is the full story in 5 points. advertisementElon Musk sued for late disclosure of Twitter ownership: Story in 5 points- The billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022. But before he could fully acquire the social media platform, he started accumulating Twitter shares in early 2022. Doing so, Musk had exceeded 5 per cent ownership by March of that year. At this point, he was required by law to disclose his ownership, but he failed to do so.  - The billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022. But before he could fully acquire the social media platform, he started accumulating Twitter shares in early 2022. Doing so, Musk had exceeded 5 per cent ownership by March of that year. At this point, he was required by law to disclose his ownership, but he failed to do so.  - As he did not disclose his stakes, Musk was able to underpay “by at least $150 million” for shares he bought. Musk’s failure to disclose his beneficial ownership in a timely manner allowed him to purchase shares from the public at artificially low prices. These prices did not account for the material information about Musk’s ownership of more than five percent of Twitter’s common stock or his investment intentions, which had not yet been revealed, the securities regulator said. Musk eventually purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X. - Musk delayed disclosing his acquisition until April 4, 11 days past the required reporting deadline. In a complaint filed in federal court in Washington, DC, the SEC accused Musk of violating federal securities laws by failing to disclose his initial purchase of 5 per cent of Twitter's common shares within the mandated timeframe. - Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, in an email called the SEC lawsuit the culmination of the regulator's ""multi-year campaign of harassment"" against his client. ""Today's action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot bring an actual case,"" he said. ""Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone sees this sham for what it is."" He added that the lawsuit addresses a mere ""alleged administrative failure to file a single form--an offense that, even if proven, carries a nominal penalty."" - The SEC has been investigating the Tesla and SpaceX CEO regarding his acquisition of the social media platform. In December, Musk revealed on social media that the agency had requested he pay an unspecified fine to resolve charges related to his purchase of Twitter shares, as noted in a letter from his attorney, Spiro. Additionally, last year, Musk faced issues with the commission for not appearing to testify during the investigation.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Tune InAlso read |  Meta to fire around 3,600 employees, Mark Zuckerberg says he will sack low performersAlso read |  Is Elon Musk buying TikTok amid threat of US ban?

They are telling phone users that their numbers would be discontinued unless they take an immediate action and using the ruse to extort money. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/scammers-now-calling-as-trai-officials-threatening-users-with-account-and-number-suspension-to-extort-money-2665008-2025-01-15,"“Dear user, this call is from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to inform you that your mobile number is being suspended as illegal activity has been registered from your mobile number. To know more details, press 9...”  These were the words from a call I received earlier from the number +977-422478388. The number is obviously not from India. It is from Nepal. The tone of the caller was similar to government alert messages, like those during COVID-19 or the recent awareness calls about digital arrest scams. However, this call was not from the official TRAI. In fact, it was a scam call, one that many users have been receiving recently. In fact, over the past few months, such scam calls have caused significant financial losses to victims. For instance, in a TOI reported case from August 2024, a man in Hyderabad lost approximately Rs 11 lakh after receiving a call from someone posing as a TRAI official. In another case, a 25-year-old IIT-Bombay graduate lost Rs 7 lakh to a similar scam. But how are individuals losing money? Just receiving a call shouldn’t put anyone at risk, right? Yes, that’s true. However, the tone and content of these calls are designed to mimic official government communications, causing the receiver to believe their authenticity and follow the instructions. For example, the call I received asked me to press 9 for more details and follow instructions if I wanted to avoid my number getting deactivated. According to reports, when individuals respond to these calls, they are connected to scammers posing as CBI officers or other officials. Once you have pressed “9” and have connected to another “official” the entire scam starts unfolding. The receiver is then put into a ""digital arrest."" In this so-called digital arrest, scammers instruct targeted individuals to stay on video calls and refrain from sharing anything with family or friends. Victims are then coerced into sharing sensitive information such as ID proofs and bank details, and in some cases, they are harassed into transferring money under the pretext of being involved in money laundering.  In order to threaten the victim, the scammers are even involving fake police, judges, and even ""Supreme Court inspectors"". However, as victims send money or share sensitive information like bank details, to clear their name from all the said charges against them, the fraudsters empty bank accounts and block victims from any further communications. How to stay safe  To protect yourself, it is highly advisable not to fall for such calls. Remember, organisations like TRAI or the police don’t ask for personal or financial information over the phone. Additionally, be aware of the term Digital Arrest as there is no such lawful term and if anyone threatens you with this, disconnect the call — it’s a scam. If you suspect the call might be legitimate, double-check the authenticity of the caller, especially if they are asking for sensitive information or urgent financial transactions. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into taking quick decisions.  Above all, never share your personal, banking, or other sensitive information with unknown callers. If you suspect you are being scammed, contact your local police or cybercrime unit immediately. Reporting such incidents can help protect you and others from falling victim to similar schemes.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also Read |  Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh review: Compact and multi-device chargingAlso Read |  Moto Razr 60 Ultra may soon launch in India, could feature upcoming Snapdragon 8s Elite chipAlso Read |  Pixel 9 gets Rs 12,000 discount: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

Their presence at the ceremony places them among prominent political and business figures, indicating the importance of their connections to the incoming administration. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has expressed excitement over his prominent spot at the event, stating on social media platform X that he felt “honoured” to be part of the proceedings. Musk has been an open supporter of Trump, contributing over a quarter-billion dollars to help with his campaign and aligning closely with the president-elect's policies. He is also co-leading a new advisory body, the Department of Government Efficiency, which will likely see Musk play a major role in shaping the new administration's approach to business and governance. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, is also actively engaging with the Trump administration after years of a strained relationship. Meta contributed $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, and Zuckerberg is co-hosting a reception with Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson. This change in stance is big, as Zuckerberg had previously banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 Capitol riots in 2021. However, he has since revamped Meta’s lobbying and content moderation policies to better align with the incoming Republican government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will also attend the inauguration, despite past tensions between Trump and his Washington Post, which refrained from endorsing a candidate during the 2024 election. Amazon contributed $1 million to the inaugural fund as well, highlighting Bezos' desire to build rapport with the new administration, given his company's major federal contracts through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. These three tech moguls—Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos—have reportedly amassed vast fortunes and global influence through their respective companies, with a combined net worth of $885 billion. Their attendance at Trump’s inauguration hints at a strategic alignment with the incoming administration, as each of their businesses stands to benefit or face challenges depending on how US policies around tech, trade, and regulation evolve during Trump’s second term. With Meta facing an antitrust case, Amazon relying on federal contracts, and SpaceX’s space ambitions closely tied to government projects, the involvement of these business leaders in Trump’s inauguration shows the importance of their relationships with political leaders in keeping up with their companies’ growth.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

An internal memo has outlined how the layoffs would work.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-layoffs-employees-with-these-ratings-will-be-fired-internal-memo-reveals-2665125-2025-01-15,"Meta is preparing to cut jobs in the coming weeks, focusing on employees with lower performance ratings. An internal memo from Hillary Champion, Meta’s Director of People Development Growth Programs, outlined how the layoffs would work, reconfirming the company's intent to push out underperformers more swiftly. The memo, obtained by Business Insider, details the company's goal to reach 10 per cent non-regrettable attrition by the end of this performance cycle. Non-regrettable attrition refers to employees Meta believes the company can afford to lose. The memo reveals that Meta is targeting an additional 5 per cent reduction in staff this year, adding to the 5 percent cuts made last year. Employees whose performance ratings fall under ""Met Some"" or ""Did Not Meet"" expectations will be automatically placed on the list for termination.  ""Anyone who receives a rating of 'Met Some' or 'Did Not Meet' will be automatically added to the performance termination list,"" the memo stated. Those in the ""Met Most"" category may also be at risk, depending on whether Meta reaches its overall attrition target. Champion asserted that Meta's focus is on ensuring the strongest talent remains as the company continues its ambitious plans in areas like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and social media.  ""In the calibration process, your Director and VP will review those with a ""Met Most"" rating to determine who will be terminated to meet the required 10 per cent target. The number of people in the ""Met Most"" category to be terminated will vary, depending on your org's 2024 non-regrettable attrition rate and how many people are rated ""Met Some"" or ""Did Not Meet,"" the memo stated. The layoffs are part of a broader strategy aimed at restructuring Meta’s workforce and driving operational efficiency. Recent moves also include scaling back on diversity and inclusion initiatives, and halting its third-party fact-checking program. Meta plans to refill these roles in 2025, once its performance-driven workforce realignment is complete. ""We have really ambitious goals, so we need to manage our workforce in a way that ensures we have the strongest talent working here and can move faster in managing out low performers so that we can bring new people in. As a result, we are exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers. Those who are terminated for performance will receive generous severance packages, in line with previous cuts,"" Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-rumoured-to-launch-in-may-everything-else-we-know-about-the-upcoming-phone-2665120-2025-01-15,"Samsung is ready to unveil the next-gen Galaxy S25 series this month. The company has confirmed that the Galaxy Unpacked event will take place on January 22, 2025. According to the trends, the event is scheduled to reveal the Galaxy S25 series, and this time, the teaser revealed it will introduce 4 models: Galaxy S25, S25+, S25 Ultra, and a new entry, S25 Slim. While the traditional 3 models are expected to launch in January, the Slim model is rumoured to take its sweet time to enter the market. In a latest leak, the Galaxy S25 Slim is anticipated to be released later in May.  According to tipster Setsuna Digital, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to launch in May this year, suggesting that next week’s Galaxy Unpacked event will likely focus on the debut of the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. However, there remains a chance that Samsung might tease the S25 Slim during the event.
 


 This wouldn’t be unprecedented, as the brand previewed the Galaxy Ring alongside the S24 series last year, even though the smart ring wasn’t available for purchase until June. Adding weight to this speculation, the Galaxy Unpacked launch invite features the outline of four phones. It’s worth noting, however, that it’s unclear if the tipster’s timeline applies exclusively to China or includes the global market.Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim: What to expect As the name suggests, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is sleek and is likely to be the slimmest smartphone in the Samsung-verse. To put that into perspective, it’s significantly thinner than the 7.6mm Galaxy S24. Besides its design, one of the standout features of the S25 Slim is its 4,700 to 5,000mAh battery, an impressive feat for a device this thin. Reports suggest Samsung might be leveraging advanced silicon-carbon anode battery technology, similar to what we've seen in the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro. This would ensure long-lasting performance without compromising the phone’s slim design. Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to pack the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. The Galaxy S25 Slim is tipped to feature a 6.66-inch display, placing it in the same league as the Galaxy S24+ in terms of screen size. On the photography front, the device could sport a 200-megapixel HP5 primary camera, accompanied by a 50-megapixel ultrawide lens, and a 50-megapixel 3.5x telephoto snapper. It is noteworthy that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim will be in direct competition with the upcoming iPhone 17. Both smartphones are to pay special importance to the design. It will be interesting to see how both these phones will play against each other and which will win the battle.

There are a number of devices coming from the company, including the iPhone 17, the iPad Air with M4, the iPhone SE4, and most notably the MacBook Air M4. And if we are lucky, we might even get the new Apple TV. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/apple-may-launch-20-new-devices-this-year-iphone-17-macbook-air-m4-ipad-11-and-more-in-pipeline-2665205-2025-01-15,"New Year, new Apple devices. The rumour mill is churning, Mark Gurman over at Bloomberg is doing his prediction, and the list of devices that Apple is likely to launch in 2025 is growing bigger. While the regular iPhone, Mac, and iPad refreshes are anticipated, several reports by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Jeff Pu, suggest that the Cupertino giant could launch over 20 new devices.  These include three new home products, six highly anticipated next-generation devices, and a series of fresh launches, including five iPhone models. Let’s take a detailed look at everything Apple is expected to bring in 2025.Apple launches expected in March-April 2025 MacBook Air M4: The upcoming M4 MacBook Air is rumoured to be Apple's first product launch of 2025, bringing several significant upgrades. The new-gen MacBook Air is likely to bring better battery life thanks to the M4 chip's efficiency, a substantial RAM boost with 16GB as standard, expanded external display support allowing two displays simultaneously, and an improved 12 megapixel Center Stage camera with features like Desk View for enhanced video conferencing. It is expected that the design will remain the same. But that shouldn’t bother users because the Air design is already quite good. Instead, the Apple fans should look forward to the goodness of the M4 chipset, which we tested a few months ago in the new MacBook Pro 14 and found that is a blazing fast — almost magically fast — processor.  iPhone SE 4: The next iPhone SE is also expected to launch in early 2025, likely in March. This budget-friendly device is rumoured to feature significant upgrades over its predecessor, including an edge-to-edge OLED display with Face ID, the powerful A18 chip, 8GB of RAM so that it can support Apple Intelligence, a 48MP camera, USB-C connectivity, and Apple's first in-house 5G modem. While pricing details are not yet confirmed, it's expected to be more affordable than the flagship iPhone 16 models. iPad 11: This year Apple is also expected to finally refresh its entry-level iPad this spring, that is around March or April. The iPad 11 will likely feature Apple Intelligence, potentially with the A18 chip, improved connectivity with Wi-Fi 6E/7 and Bluetooth 5.3, and possibly 5G support. A new, more traditional Magic Keyboard is also rumoured to be in plans. New iPad Air: The next-gen iPad Air is also expected to arrive in early 2025. According to Gurman, Apple may launch a new iPad Air with ""internal improvements"" as early as spring 2025. The new iPad Air is likely to arrive with a new Magic Keyboard that has a function row. The tablet may potentially sport a 90Hz display, and almost certainly an M3 chip upgrade. Additionally, the new iPad Air could include Wi-Fi 7 support, a better mic array, and potentially Apple's own 5G modems.  HomePad: According to Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to launch a new smart home display or HomePad. He revealed that Apple is developing a new smart home device codenamed J490, which is expected to launch in March. This wall-mounted display, roughly the size of two iPhones, will work as a central hub for home control, integrating Apple apps, Apple Intelligence, and HomeKit. It will feature a camera, speakers, and a rechargeable battery. Apple launches expected between May-June 2025 AirTag 2: Following the early launches, Apple is expected to bring its next-gen AirTag 2, featuring an upgraded Ultra Wideband chip. This upgrade would significantly improve the range of Precision Finding, which might make locating misplaced items much easier and more accurate.  M4 Mac Studio: Apple is also expected to launch a new Mac Studio in the first half of 2025, likely featuring M4 Max and M4 Ultra chips for offering increased performance. The new model will almost certainly include faster Thunderbolt 5 ports for improved connectivity and may also support Wi-Fi 7 for significantly faster wireless speeds. This updated Mac Studio is anticipated to become the most powerful desktop Mac in Apple's lineup.advertisementApple launches expected between September-October 2025iPhone 17: The new Apple flagship phone is likely to arrive in September 2025. The flagship is expected to maintain the current Dynamic Island design while featuring a refined aluminium chassis and higher refresh rate display like the Pro variants. It is also likely to be powered by Apple’s new A19 chip, offering improved performance and efficiency. It is rumoured that Apple would be putting upgrades into the camera system, including a 24 megapixel front camera, and that the phone would use in-house modem for 5G connectivity.iPhone 17 Air: There are rumours that Apple would be ditching the Plus variant of the iPhone for a more slimmer variant, likely the iPhone 17 Air. The new variant is said to be in line with Apple naming system for iPads and MacBooks which include an Air model. This model is expected to be significantly thinner than current iPhones, likely featuring an aluminium or titanium chassis with a 6.55 display. The iPhone 17 Air is also expected to feature only a single rear camera, possibly the same 48 megapixel camera that we have in current iPhones.advertisementiPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max: The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max likely to get several big upgrades in 2025. These include a 24 megapixel front-facing camera, the powerful A19 Pro chip, and an increase in RAM to 12GB. Apple is also expected to improve the connectivity with Apple's in-house Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip. The devices may come with redesigned frame and build materials and a larger rectangular camera bump. The iPhone 17 Pro Max may feature a narrower Dynamic Island. Apple Watch Ultra 3: Year 2025 is when we may see the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra 3. The new Ultra 3 is expected to bring new features, including High blood pressure detection feature, independent satellite messaging, 5G cellular connectivity offering faster speeds and improved connectivity.Apple Watch Series 11: The next-gen Watch 11 is also expected to feature high blood pressure detection. Although on design front, there are unlikely to be any changes. Additionally, there are rumours and hints that Apple is developing a new AI coaching service and a revamped health app, although their release timing is not yet confirmed. And some more gadgetsThe Watch Ultra and regular Apple Watch are also likely to be joined by the Apple Watch SE 3 in 2025. This would be a cheaper and more affordable smartwatch, although it is likely to have revamped internals, including better chipset. advertisementTwo more products that are set to arrive in 2025 are the AirPods Pro 3 and the HomePod mini 2. The new AirPods Pro 3 is expected to arrive with a new H3 chip, redesigned form factor, and improved active noise cancellation. The HomePod mini 2 is likely to have Apple’s own in-house Wi-Fi chip along with internal improvements, but the design may look similar to what we see with the HomePod mini currently. What about the regular full-size HomePod? Well, it seems that the original HomePod was just a one-time deal. It is unlikely that we will see anything new on that front in 2025.Then there is the Apple TV. It is possible that Apple TV, which is sort of due for an update, may get a new-gen device this year. If it happens, expect it to have similar design but there could be a more powerful chipset in it, and Apple may even equip it for Apple Intelligence.Finally, two more ProM5 iPad Pro: In 2024 Apple raised the bars with the M4 iPad with fastest processor, OLED screen and thinnest design. For the next-gen iPads, Apple is expected to launch the device by the end of this year with the M5 chip. According to Ming Chi-Kuo, “The iPad Pro equipped with the M5 processor is expected to enter mass production in 2H25.” That is second half of the year, friends. M5 MacBook Pro: According to Mark Gurman, Apple will also launch a new and totally redesigned MacBook Pro in 2026, featuring OLED displays, a thinner design, and the powerful M6 chip built on the 2nm process. However for the 2025, the M5 MacBooks are expected to have some minor improvements with just a powerful processor.

Here are the details.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-might-roll-back-some-whatsapp-features-in-india-after-antitrust-data-sharing-ban-2665178-2025-01-15,"Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, may have to roll back some features in India due to a recent antitrust ruling, according to inputs from Reuters. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has banned WhatsApp from sharing user data with Meta for advertising purposes. This decision is said to impact Meta’s ability to offer personalised ads across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. The CCI’s November ruling reportedly found that Meta had abused its market dominance by forcing WhatsApp users to accept a new privacy policy. This policy expanded the scope of user data sharing, giving Meta an unfair advantage over its competitors. As part of its order, the CCI imposed a $24.5 million fine and instituted a five-year ban on Meta's data-sharing practices in India, the company's largest market with over 500 million WhatsApp users. Meta, however, is actively challenging the directive. In a recent court filing, the company expressed concerns that the ban on data sharing between WhatsApp and Meta would hurt its ability to deliver personalised advertisements. Meta explained that Indian businesses would face difficulties in targeting users effectively on Facebook and Instagram, especially businesses that interact with customers on WhatsApp. The company’s appeal stresses that the data-sharing policy does not expand Meta’s data collection but only allows for more efficient integration of business features. However, the CCI disagreed, stating that WhatsApp’s policy coerced users into accepting terms they did not fully understand, with no option to opt out. The commission now insists that WhatsApp allow users to choose whether they want their data shared with Meta. In its challenge to the ruling, Meta criticised the CCI for lacking the technical understanding needed to assess the impact of the decision. The company argues that the regulator should have consulted with WhatsApp and Meta before making such an impactful ruling. While Meta continues to contest the order, the outcome of its appeal could take several months. In the meantime, the Indian appeals tribunal is expected to hear the company's plea this Thursday.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

b4e5b0c4-e487-4dd8-97ac-cdafa6030aaf,TikTok prepares to shut down app in US unless Supreme Court overturns ban: ReportTikTok plans to shut down its US operations on January 19 unless the Supreme Court overturns a federal ban tied to ByteDance's failure to divest. President-elect Trump may issue an executive order delaying enforcement. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/tiktok-prepares-to-shut-down-app-in-us-unless-supreme-court-overturns-ban-2665484-2025-01-16,"TikTok plans to shut US operations of its social media app used by 170 million Americans on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported President-elect Donald Trump, whose term begins a day after a ban would start, is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of a shutdown for 60 to 90 days. The newspaper did not say how Trump could legally do so. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if Chinese parent ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, except that the law also bars US companies starting Sunday from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it. The Trump transition team did not have an immediate comment. Trump has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a ""political resolution"" of the issue. ""TikTok itself is a fantastic platform,"" Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News on Wednesday. ""We're going to find a way to preserve it but protect people's data."" A White House official told Reuters Wednesday President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the Supreme Court fails to act and added Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. US Senator Ed Markey on Wednesday sought unanimous consent to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok by 270 days but Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked the proposal. If it is banned, TikTok plans that users attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public. ""We go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,"" TikTok lawyer Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court last week. The company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, the sources said. The US Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Shutting down TikTok in the US could make it unavailable for users in many other countries, the company said in a court filing last month, because hundreds of service providers in the US help make the platform available to TikTok users around the world - and could no longer do so starting Sunday. TikTok said in the court filing an order was needed to ""avoid interruption of services for tens of millions of TikTok users outside the United States."" TikTok had said that the prohibitions would eventually make the app unusable, noting in the filing that ""data centers would almost certainly conclude that they can no longer store"" TikTok code, content, or data. The sources said the shutdown aims to protect TikTok service providers from legal liability and make it easier to resume operations if President-elect Donald Trump opted to roll back any ban. Shutting down such services does not require longer planning, one of the sources said, noting that most operations have been continuing as usual as of this week. If the ban gets reversed later, TikTok would be able to restore service for US users in a relatively short time, sources said. TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. US tech publication The Information first reported the news late on Tuesday. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States. President Joe Biden last April signed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its US assets by January 19, or face a nationwide ban. Last week, the Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline. TikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. TikTok said in the court filing last month it estimated one-third of its 170 million American users would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasted a month.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 16, 2025",technology,2025-01-16T09:07:00,8.2,9.8
d5874786-0217-435b-a596-2de2949c88e2,"Elon Musk is hiring for software engineer role, says there is no need for a degreeElon Musk aims to reshape hiring by prioritising skills over degrees, with the larger goal of transforming X into a unified platform that integrates services like payments, messaging, e-commerce, and multimedia.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-is-hiring-for-software-engineer-role-says-there-is-no-need-for-a-degree-2665483-2025-01-16,"Elon Musk is once again challenging traditional norms, this time by rethinking hiring practices and pushing forward his ambitious Everything app. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk made a global call for hardcore software engineers to join him in building what could become one of the most versatile digital platforms ever created. The message was direct, We dont care where you went to school or even whether you went to school or what 'big name' company you worked at. Just show us your code"", he says.    This isnt the first time Musk has questioned the value of formal education in hiring. Over the years, he has consistently prioritised skills and problem-solving ability over degrees. Back in 2014, he made it clear that a university degree wasnt a requirement to work at Tesla. In his view, its not about credentials but about what a person can deliver. He has often spoken about how education systems should focus on nurturing problem-solving abilities instead of relying on memorisation and standardised tests. This perspective is reflected in his hiring practices at Tesla, SpaceX, and now X. Musks stance has its supporters and critics. While some see it as an opportunity to level the playing field for talented individuals from non-traditional backgrounds, others argue that it could be impractical for larger-scale adoption. Still, the approach aligns with Musks broader philosophy of valuing innovation and results over conventional measures of competency. As for the Everything app, Musks vision for X has started to take shape. The idea is to transform X into a single platform that integrates a variety of services like payments, messaging, e-commerce, and multimedia. Think of this concept as Chinas WeChat, a widely used app that combines social networking, shopping, and payments in one place. Musk sees this as a way to move beyond traditional social media and create something much larger  a one-stop global marketplace for ideas, goods, and services. X is already laying the groundwork for this transformation. The platform plans to roll out several features by 2025, including X Money, a payment service, and X TV, a streaming platform for multimedia content. The AI chatbot Grok, launched in late 2024, is also set to receive significant upgrades. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, hinted at these developments in a recent announcement, calling the upcoming changes a way to connect users in ways never thought possible.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Tune InAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip ",technology,2025-01-16T09:05:00,11.8,2.0

Microsoft says it will no longer support Office apps on Windows 10 devicesMicrosoft is saying it will stop supporting Windows 10 devices starting October 14. Meanwhile, the company is also offering a free upgrade to Windows 11 to users who are still using Windows 10.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/story/still-using-windows-10-microsoft-says-it-will-no-longer-support-office-apps-on-windows-10-devices-2665492-2025-01-16,"Microsoft has announced that it will end support for Microsoft Office apps on Windows 10 devices after the operating system reaches its end of support on October 14, 2025. Users will need to upgrade to Windows 11 to continue using Microsoft 365 apps without potential issues, the tech giant stated on Tuesday. Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11, the company explained.  This announcement also affects standalone Office versions, including Office 2024, Office 2021, Office 2019, and Office 2016, meaning these versions will no longer receive updates or technical support on Windows 10 devices.  While the applications will still function beyond the support cutoff, Microsoft cautioned users about potential performance and reliability problems. We strongly recommend upgrading to Windows 11 to avoid performance and reliability issues over time, the company advised in a separate support document.  Microsoft has been urging users to migrate to Windows 11 since its launch in October 2021, even dubbing 2025 the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh. However, adoption has been slow, with only 35 per cent of Windows users worldwide running Windows 11 as of now, according to Statcounter Global data. Meanwhile, Windows 10 remains the dominant version, powering 62 per cent of all Windows systems globally. Why users are hesitant to upgrade  A key barrier to Windows 11 adoption has been Microsofts stringent hardware requirements, particularly the need for TPM (Trusted Platform Module) 2.0. The feature, which Microsoft claims enhances resistance to tampering and cyberattacks, has been labelled non-negotiable for Windows 11 installations. Many users with older hardware have found the requirement difficult to meet, prompting the creation of workarounds to bypass it.  In light of the challenges, Microsoft has offered some leeway for users unwilling or unable to upgrade. Home users can delay the switch to Windows 11 for an additional year by purchasing Extended Security Updates (ESU) for $30. Certain enterprise and specialised systems, including those using Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) and Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) editions, will continue to receive updates beyond the October 2025 cutoff. What this means for users  Although users can keep using their Windows 10 PCs and Office apps after support ends, they will no longer receive security updates, exposing them to increased risks over time. Microsoft has also reiterated that the free upgrade to Windows 11 remains available, provided users meet the minimum system requirements.  Margaret Farmer, a representative for Microsoft, emphasised this point: You need to confirm that your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the update, she stated. A looming deadline  The clock is ticking for the millions still on Windows 10. While the operating systems popularity has endured, Microsofts move to cut off Office app support adds another incentive for users to transition. For those who rely heavily on Microsoft 365 or other Office products, the decision to upgrade sooner rather than later is becoming increasingly pressing.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  TikTok prepares to shut down app in US unless Supreme Court overturns ban: ReportAlso read |  Elon Musk is hiring for software engineer role, says there is no need for a degreeAlso read |  Meta might roll back some WhatsApp features in India after antitrust data sharing ban",technology,2025-01-16T09:35:00,9.6,6.5

However, the device is expected to measure just 6.4mm in thickness, making it 1.2mm slimmer than the Galaxy S24. According to OnLeaks and Smartprix, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will have a thickness of 8.2mm, meaning the S25 Slim could be nearly 2mm thinner than Samsung's flagship model. Additionally, the S25 Slim is rumoured to feature a 200-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with 3.5X optical zoom. That said, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is being designed to give direct competition to the rumoured iPhone 17 Air. But which one will be better? Here is a comparison of both the phones based on the leaks. However, the exact difference can only be known after the launch of both the phones.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series details leak ahead of launch next weekAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim rumoured to launch in May: Everything else we know about the upcoming phoneAlso read |  Here is how much the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra could cost in IndiaMust Watch ",technology,2025-01-16T09:36:00,3.9,4.8

Congrats, it is free nowGoogle has made its AI tools, including the Gemini bot, free for Workspace Business and Enterprise plans, removing the Rs 1,500 per month fee. However, subscription costs will rise by Rs 125 per user. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/paid-rs-1500-a-month-for-gemini-in-google-apps-congrats-it-is-free-now-2665517-2025-01-16,"If youve been shelling out extra cash for Googles Gemini-powered AI features in Workspace apps, heres some good news: its now free. Google has announced that starting this week, all its AI tools  formerly locked behind the Rs 1,500 per month Gemini Business plan  are included in standard Workspace Business and Enterprise subscriptions. The move aims to make AI capabilities more accessible as Google races against Microsoft and OpenAI.advertisementThe catch: Slightly higher prices Before you celebrate too much, theres a small caveat. Google is hiking the price of all Workspace plans to cover these new features. Most businesses will now pay about Rs 125 more per user per month. For context, the base subscription that previously cost Rs 900 ($12) will now be priced at Rs 1,050 ($14). Its not exactly a bank-breaker, but its a notable shift for companies managing large teams. Whats in the AI package? With Googles Workspace AI suite, you get tools like email summaries in Gmail, automated meeting notes in Meet, spreadsheet design help in Sheets, and AI writing assistants in Docs. The Gemini bot, Googles flagship AI, acts as a personal assistant capable of summarizing emails, finding data, and even brainstorming ideas.  Before you celebrate too much, theres a small caveat.

Theres also NotebookLM Plus, a research assistant designed to break down complex topics. It lets users upload documents, extract insights, and share customised notebooks for collaboration.Why the freebie move?  Googles decision to scrap the extra fee for Gemini seems strategic. The AI race is heating up, and rival Microsoft recently made its own AI features part of standard subscriptions for certain Microsoft 365 plans. Google is betting that by removing the financial barrier, it can convince more businesses to try its AI tools.  Googles move to make AI a core part of its Workspace plans signals a shift in how businesses approach productivity. The company plans to keep rolling out new AI features over the next year, ensuring its tools remain at the forefront of workplace innovation.  For users, the message is clear: AI isnt an optional add-on anymoreits the future of work. Whether youre excited or skeptical, one thing is certain: Googles Gemini is here to stay, and its now a standard part of doing business in the digital age.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  Still using Windows 10?

This comes shortly after the company announced plans to lay off some employees, with sources indicating that less than 1 per cent of the workforce will be affected. The layoffs are part of Microsoft's efforts to tighten its spending as the company navigates through economic challenges. Alongside these cuts, Microsofts consulting division has paused hiring and will delay filling vacant roles, according to a memo obtained by CNBC. Derek Danois, a senior executive in the consulting unit, asserted in the memo that careful cost management is crucial, adding that internal meetings should be conducted remotely to avoid unnecessary travel expenses. The report says that top executives are asked to approve any travel to customer sites to ensure spending is aligned with the companys priorities. The memo also mentions that Microsoft plans to cut marketing and external resource costs by 35 per cent, further underlining the companys focus on controlling expenses. This wave of layoffs follows an earlier move by Microsoft in early 2023 when it let go of 10,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting strategy under CEO Satya Nadella. The company was responding to broader economic shifts and market conditions. Additionally, in January 2024, Microsofts gaming division, following its $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, laid off 1,900 workers to reduce overlapping roles. Microsoft isnt the only tech giant making such decisions. Meta has also confirmed plans to dismiss certain underperforming employees as part of its restructuring. These cost-saving measures show the growing trend among tech companies to streamline operations amidst the current market challenges. Microsoft is also planning to fire underperforming employees. While the company has confirmed the news, it has not disclosed the exact number of workers affected.A Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged the upcoming layoffs and reiterated the company's focus on high-performance talent. The spokesperson stressed that when employees fail to meet performance expectations, appropriate actions are taken. As part of its strategy, Microsoft evaluates staff performance across multiple levels, even reaching some senior employees at level 80.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 16, 2025 ",technology,2025-01-16T12:14:00,6.3,6.0
ffdc5b41-fe84-42b7-a532-3660ca628746,"Dreame AirStyle review: Smart hair-styler that is high on features and low on priceWe know hair-dryers and stylers can be smart. We have seen some earlier from Dyson. Now, we get one from Dreame. It's called AirStyle and it offers tons of features, performance to match and all of that at a relatively affordable price. In this Dreame AirStyle review we find it can match more expensive hair-stylers. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/dreame-airstyle-review-smart-hair-styler-that-is-high-on-features-and-low-on-price-2665613-2025-01-16,"What do you think of when you hear the word hair-styler? Probably a dumb device that can dry as well as help shape your hair while you are frantically going through your morning on a weekday. That is also probably accurate. But we have seen that companies like Dyson are changing this perception of hair-dryers and hair-stylers. They are giving smarts to these devices. One such company, apart from Dyson, and the products of which we are now starting to see in India, is Dreame. Earlier, at India Today Tech, we reviewed the Dreame L10s Pro Ultra Heat, a robot house-cleaner, and we were quite impressed with it. It was a premium, pricey product and an excellent automatic robot-cleaner for users who could afford it. Now, we are reviewing the Dreame AirStyle, a hair styler. There are a lot of similarities between the product philosophy of Dyson and Dreame. Recently, when Dreame launched its AirStyle  and yes, the name itself gives you deja vu, instantly making you think of the Dyson Airwrap  I was curious to see what Dreame had to offer. More than the name it's the pricing which roused my interest. The Dreame AirtStyle is Rs 24,999, almost half of the price of its more expensive competitor. This raises the obvious question of how. As in how can Dreame price something this low and does this mean it has a lot of cost-cutting? Does the lower price also mean a more cumbersome and ineffective user experience? Well, Ive used the AirStyle for about a week now and Im impressed. The Dreame AirStyle offers multiple attachments, is easy to use and clean, and comes in premium packaging. But of course, there are also areas where it is definitely not as premium as the Dyson one. Lets take a closer look.Premium design, easy to clean The Dreame AirStyle comes in this cream colour option with a metallic brass finish. Of course, it is made of plastic. But the paint job, which is extremely slick and premium, gives it stunning looks. The design of the hair-styler is minimalist. It weighs around 1 kg, which is not too heavy and is similar in weight to the Dyson Airwrap. Although using it with one hand while styling does give a workout for your arm.    In the box, there are five attachments, including a dryer, auto-wrap barrel, smoothing brush, round volumising brush, and flyaway attachment. All of these you can easily attach, remove, and even clean with water after styling your hair. The build quality of the attachments is quite sturdy, although they too are made of plastic. The AirStyler comes in an antique-looking suitcase box, which is easy to carry around and looks quite premium.   Using the Dreame AirStylerWell, it works as intended  effectively and fuss-free. Using the device is a pretty straightforward process. You pick the attachment you want to use, turn on the power, select air pressure and heat, and go.For the air pressure, there are three settings  low, medium, and high  that you can use as per styling requirements. Dreame also includes a user guide to help you set the settings according to your hair type and styling needs. The heat setting is really handy and includes cool air, medium heat, and high heat, which you can use as needed.   In my use, I often used the dryer attachment, which requires air pressure and heat at max. I have thin and long hair, and the AirStyler helped me dry them around 95 per cent in about 1520 minutes, which is quite impressive. However, to style, you need slightly damp hair, so after 5 to 10 minutes of drying, you can switch to the different styler attachments.advertisementNow, given I have thin and somewhat wavy hair, I also used the volumising attachment and the flyaway attachment. Both work extremely well and do the job effectively. Do understand that the AirStyler is not that compact, so it takes quite a while. Also, you need to switch arms to cover both sides. It's quite a workout and can take some time before you are done with it. In other words, on hurried mornings while you are rushing to reach the office quickly, you will not have time to style your hair.While the performance is there, as well as the feature set, I do notice that the AirStyler doesnt feel as refined as Dyson Airwrap. For example, the auto-wrap curler in the AirStyle lacks the option to switch the wrap direction, which makes it slightly cumbersome compared to the Airwrap. Another difference is the carrying box. The Airwarp box is just so much more premium compared to the AirStyler box. One important bit to remember here is the price. The AirStyler sells for less than half the price of the Airwrap, so the differences I talk of feel more like nitpicks and can be overlooked.   Dryer attachment of Dreame AirStyleadvertisementDreame AirStyle review: Is it worth it?If you want a good hair styling tool under Rs 25,000 with multiple attachments that also doesn't damage your hair with heat, the Dreame Airstyler is a good option. It's easy to clean, comes with a portable case, and offers both cool and hot air settings, making it an affordable alternative to more expensive options like the Dyson Airwrap. Additionally, the Airstyler is currently available at a more affordable price on Amazon, making the deal even more attractive. It is selling for Rs 19,999. So, the Dreame Airstyler gets big thumbs up from my side.You see the price is the real deal here.

During an interview on the Table Manners podcast, Cook shared that his first job involved delivering newspapers at the age of 11, followed by flipping burgers at a fast-food chain called Tastee-Freez when he was just 14 years old. Cook, who grew up in the small town of Robertsdale, Alabama, explained that his parents instilled the value of hard work in him, which has remained a guiding principle throughout his career. He said that the lessons from his early jobs have stayed with him, helping him approach challenges with dedication and perseverance. Despite coming from humble beginnings, Cook went on to pursue industrial engineering at Auburn University, and after graduation, he worked at tech firms like IBM. In 1998, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs personally invited Cook to join Apple as Senior Vice President of worldwide operations, marking the beginning of his journey at the tech company. When Jobs passed away in 2011, Cook took over as Apples CEO. In the interview, Cook also discussed his daily routine, talking about the importance of starting his day early. He revealed that he begins working before 5AM, using the early morning hours to focus on key tasks before the day becomes busy. This quiet time, he said, allows him to manage his workload more effectively. While Cook continues to lead Apple with the same dedication he developed in his younger years, he hinted at future retirement plans. However, he asserted that his version of retirement wont involve completely stepping away from work. Instead, Cook plans on staying active and mentally engaged, as he doesnt see himself slowing down entirely. Additionally, though Cook didnt offer details on upcoming Apple products, he mentioned that there are several exciting projects in development.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 16, 2025 ",technology,2025-01-16T13:13:00,8.2,0.7

Rumours also suggest a possible rebranding to 'iPhone 16E' and a price under Rs 50,000 in India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/iphone-se4-likely-to-arrive-in-april-faceid-48-megapixel-apple-intelligence-and-more-upgrades-expected-2665595-2025-01-16,"The affordable iPhone range from Apple has always been a hit amongst users. However, after 2022 -- with the launch of iPhone SE3-- Apple seemed to go on a hiatus as far as launching its new generation of iPhone SE is concerned. While nothing official has been announced or hinted at by the Cupertino giant about the future of this affordable series yet, the buzz around the iPhone SE4 has significantly increased in the past few months. This surge in interest follows reports from analysts like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Ming-Chi Kuo, who stated that Apple is likely to launch the new-generation iPhone SE4 in early 2025. Not only is the launch of the iPhone SE4 highly anticipated, but it is also speculated to feature significant upgrades over its predecessor. These upgrades could include Apple's latest A18 series chip, a larger 48-megapixel camera, and the long-awaited transition from Touch ID to Face ID. Recent reports even suggest that the affordable iPhone might be rebranded as the ""iPhone 16E"" to align with Apple's latest flagship naming conventions.iPhone SE4 design and display upgrades One of the most notable upgrades the new iPhone SE4 is expected to bring is its design. Drawing inspiration from the iPhone 14, the new SE is rumoured to feature a 6.1-inch OLED screen, slim bezels, and no physical home button. Apple is reportedly replacing the physical button with Face ID, making the affordable iPhone more secure, akin to its flagship counterparts. There were earlier rumours that the iPhone SE4 might feature the Dynamic Island. However, subsequent reports dismissed these claims, suggesting that Apple will likely reserve this feature for its premium flagships. Still, the iPhone SE4 might include the customisable Action Button feature introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro series, replacing the traditional mute switch. Additionally, in line with these design changes, the iPhone SE4 is expected to weigh slightly less at approximately 165g. Leaked CAD renders and unofficial images suggest a sleeker, more modern design, with colour options including Midnight, Starlight, and Product RED.iPhone SE4 performance upgrades In terms of performance, the iPhone SE4 is rumoured to receive the biggest ever upgrade yet. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the device will likely be powered by the A18 series chipset, bringing it closer to the iPhone 16 series in terms of performance. The phone is also rumoured to debut with Apple's in-house 5G modem, making it the first Apple device to feature the company's proprietary modem technology. The SE4 is expected to receive a power boost with RAM options of up to 8GB and storage configurations ranging from 128GB to 512GB. With the new chipset and increased RAM, the iPhone SE4 might also incorporate Apple Intelligence features, making it the most affordable iPhone to offer Apple's AI suite.iPhone SE4 camera upgrades The iPhone SE4 is also expected to feature significant improvements in the camera department. It may feature a single rear lens with a 48MP sensor, a notable upgrade from the 12MP sensor of the iPhone SE3. Additional features like Cinematic Mode, Smart HDR, AI photography, and Portrait Mode are anticipated. However, the device might not include Night Mode, despite the upgraded sensor.iPhone SE4 battery and charging upgrades Under the hood, the iPhone SE4 is rumoured to house a 3,279mAh battery, a significant increase from the 2,010mAh battery in its predecessor. Charging speeds are expected to reach 20W via cable and 12W wirelessly. In compliance with EU regulations, the iPhone SE4 will reportedly adopt a USB-C charging port.iPhone SE4 pricing in India Pricing will play a crucial role in the success of the iPhone SE4. Reports suggest it could be priced under Rs 50,000 in India (approximately $429 in the US). However, a slight increase to $499 is also predicted. With the rumoured rebranding of the iPhone 16E and its numerous upgrades, a marginally higher price than the iPhone SE3 is anticipated.When is the iPhone SE4 launching? As for the launch timeline, Mark Gurman has hinted at an early 2025 release, stating that mass production began in December 2024. Other analysts, like Jeff Pu, and reports from MacRumors also point to a 2025 launch. Based on Apple's history, the iPhone SE4 could arrive in late March or early April, aligning with the spring launch window of the iPhone SE3 in 2022.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also Read |  Apple may launch 20 new devices this year: iPhone 17, MacBook Air M4, iPad 11 and more in pipelineAlso Read |  Scammers now calling as TRAI officials, threatening users with account and number suspension to extort moneyAlso Read |  Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh review: Compact and multi-device charging ",technology,2025-01-16T13:04:00,8.3,1.5
dead4bb6-1822-479f-8f47-835df4a63973,Apple CEO Tim Cook says Apple Watch saved his father's lifeApple CEO Tim Cook has recently shared a personal life story on how an Apple Watch saved the life of his father years ago. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-ceo-tim-cook-says-apple-watch-saved-his-fathers-life-2665681-2025-01-16,"In a rare personal interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently shared a bunch of details about his personal life, his daily routine, what he likes to eat for breakfast, how he starts his day, what wine he likes, and his favourite restaurant. This was in an interview with Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware. While the podcast interview episode aired on Wednesday, this was recorded during Cook’s visit to the UK in December 2024.  As Cook spoke about flipping burgers at the age of 14, having a paper route at the age of 11, or coming from a very humble background, Cook also revealed something very interesting and personal about his family. The Apple CEO has on many occasions shared stories of how an Apple Watch shared someone’s life. He has spoken about anecdotes that people send to him by email and how he truly feels happy and grateful when he reads these stories. During the Table Manners interview, Cook recounted a similar story, except this was about his own father.  On being asked whether the Apple CEO ever had a medical alert on his Apple Watch, Cook said, “I haven't, but my father, when he was alive, he fell in the house, and he was living alone”. “And the other thing the watch does is send a notification to your family and to emergency services if you fall, it detects the fall because of the accelerometer,” he said. “It notified emergency services, and they came out to the house. He [Cook’s father] didn't respond to the door and so they kicked the door down — and it was a good thing they did because he was not conscious at the time.”  At this point of the story one would assume Cook’s father is feeling proud of his son for working at a company that created a product that is his life. But things are never that simple with parents, are they? The podcast interviewer asked Cook: So, was he proud of you? “No, he was focused on the door, to be honest,” said Cook. “He was more upset, they kicked out my door!” During the interview, Cook also revealed that he starts his day before 5.00 AM, answering emails in the quiet early hours, which he finds the most controllable part of his day. He works at Apple Park four days a week and from home on Fridays. Cook loves Chardonnay, dark chocolate, and hiking, and he frequents national parks. He recently went caving in Slovenia. For meals, he enjoys fish, cashew cereal, and dining at Ethel’s Fancy in Palo Alto. While hinting at future Apple projects, Cook shared that his ideal last meal would feature hamachi crudo, branzino, broccolini, and chocolate dessert.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  Apple CEO Tim Cook says he used to work at a burger restaurant at the age of 14Also read |  Microsoft is firing employees in 3 departments, set to take more actions to save costsAlso read |  Elon Musk is hiring for software engineer role, says there is no need for a degree

In one such scam a French woman not only lost Rs 7 crore but she also rushed into a divorce after getting DMs from ""Brad Pitt."" ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/first-dms-from-brad-pitt-then-rs-7-crore-loss-and-divorce-here-is-how-a-woman-fell-prey-to-online-scam-2665672-2025-01-16,"Most of us are obsessed with our favourite celebrities. Sometimes, some of us, go to great lengths — from sending overly expensive gifts to even getting tattoos celebrating our idols. But in this digital age, where we are surrounded by all sorts of cyber threats, now scammers targeting the celebrity-obsessed crowd. The latest victim of such a scam is a 53-year-old French interior designer named Anne. She lost around Rs 7.5 crore after getting herself entangled in a romance scam involving a fake account that was impersonating Hollywood actor Brad Pitt. At the same the DMs she received from this “Brad Pitt” probably expedited her divorce proceedings that she was already part of before scammers targeted her.    The scam began when Anne received an Instagram message from a profile named “Jane Etta Pitt,” claiming to be Brad Pitt’s mother. The scammers started a conversation with Anne and told her that “Jane” wanted to set her up with her son Brad, who had supposedly recently divorced Angelina Jolie. For Anne, this was more than a dream come true.  Soon, another fake account claiming to be Brad Pitt himself messaged Anne. As she was also going through divorce, she was already emotionally vulnerable and getting a proposal from Brad Pitt by his mother made her start fantasising about a life with the Hollywood heartthrob. Soon after Anne was swept into romantic conversations with the impersonator. To make the relationship seem genuine, the scammers even sent her love messages, AI-generated videos showing “Brad Pitt” talking to her, and other convincing gestures.Scammers exploit a rocky relationship Anne, who was emotionally vulnerable because of her ongoing divorce from her millionaire husband, fell deeper into the trap. The scammers exploited her emotional state, building trust through frequent affectionate messages. Although Anne never spoke to real Brad Pitt on the phone, the consistent messaging on social media convinced her that the relationship was real. Meanwhile, to further solidify the illusion, the scammers claimed to have sent Anne expensive gifts from luxury brands like Chanel and Hermes. They then asked her to pay 9,000 Euros – around Rs 8 lakh in customs fees to receive the items. And Anne paid for it. Once Anne was completely drawn in the trap, the fraudsters then began asking her for more money. They fabricated a story about Brad Pitt needing funds for kidney cancer treatment and claimed his bank accounts were frozen due to his fictional divorce from Angelina Jolie. The scammers even sent Anne AI-generated images of Brad Pitt appearing to be in a hospital bed to further manipulate her. Believing she was helping her celebrity lover, Anne ended up sending a staggering 850,000 euros — approximately Rs 7.5 crore. It was only when Anne saw real photos of Brad Pitt with his current partner, Ines de Ramon, that she realised she had been scammed. By then, her life savings were gone.Romance scam on rise While Anne’s story has made headlines, it’s not an isolated case. Romance scams involving fake celebrity profile – and many using Brad Pitt’s name names –  are on the rise. For instance, in another reported case from September 2023, Spanish authorities arrested five individuals for defrauding two women of 325,000 euros – around Rs 3 crore. These scammers posed as Brad Pitt on WhatsApp and targeted victims through fan pages dedicated to the actor. In this scam as well ,the scammers users similar tactics, including emotional manipulation and fabricated stories, to extract money from the victims. While romance scams are not new and we have seen cases of people being duped by their alleged love interests they met on the internet, now with the advance technology like artificial intelligence the scams are becoming more sophisticated, convincing and hard to escape. Scammers are using AI-generated content, like realistic images, videos, and voice simulations, to create highly believable personas to trick their targets.How to protect yourself If these scams are so well knit and  even professionals are falling into them,  then how can you stay safe? Well, be skeptical online. You see, making friends and lovers online is becoming a trend. However due to this increased digital footprints, scammers are now impersonating themselves. So in case you are up online talking to a new friend or unknown individual reaches out to you – be sceptical.  If you receive unsolicited messages from people claiming to be celebrities or their associates, cross-check profiles and verify their authenticity through official sources. Also never send money to strangers. More importantly do not transfer money to someone you haven’t met in person, regardless of their story or urgency. And to keep your bank account safe, do not share sensitive details that could be used for manipulation or extortion. If you suspect you’re being targeted, report the incident to the relevant authorities and the platform used for communication. This will help others to stay safe.

There’s no shortage of choices, with the latest models bringing the best of technology along with sleek designs. These phones may be pricey, but they promise unmatched performance and style. Here’s a look at the best flagship smartphones to consider buying this January in India. The list includes the OnePlus 13 and three more devices. advertisementOnePlus 13Let’s start with the OnePlus 13, the successor to the highly popular OnePlus 12. This phone truly embodies the company’s Never Settle philosophy. It’s loaded with everything you could ask for — the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a quad-curved AMOLED display with QHD+ resolution, up to 24GB of RAM, a massive 6,000mAh battery, and Hasselblad-tuned cameras. What makes it more special are features like an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, a USB 3.2 port, and an IP69 rating for durability. On top of that, it includes Aqua Touch and Glove Mode, making it handy in all kinds of conditions. The best part? Despite all these upgrades, the price increase over the last-generation model is minimal, starting at Rs 69,999 for the base 12GB RAM + 256GB storage variant. Sleek, practical, and powerful — the OnePlus 13 ticks all the boxes.Vivo X200 ProNext up is the Vivo X200 Pro, a smartphone that strikes a great balance between value and performance. Priced slightly above the entry-level iPhone 16 Plus, this phone packs some serious hardware. The 120Hz AMOLED display is a visual treat, with subtle curves around the edges that enhance its design. Under the hood, you’ll find the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 processor, backed by a massive 6,000mAh battery that supports 90W fast charging. There’s only one variant — 16GB RAM and 512GB storage — so you don’t have to worry about picking the right configuration. But the real star here is the camera setup. Its 200-megapixel periscope lens captures stunning shots, delivering excellent dynamic range and detail, even in tricky lighting. This one is for photography enthusiasts. iPhone 16 Let’s start with the OnePlus 13, the successor to the highly popular OnePlus 12. This phone truly embodies the company’s Never Settle philosophy.

Its 200-megapixel periscope lens captures stunning shots, delivering excellent dynamic range and detail, even in tricky lighting. This one is for photography enthusiasts. iPhone 16 Apple’s iPhone 16 series is also a strong contender, offering a premium experience with its signature simplicity. Powered by the A18 chip, built on a 3nm process, these phones handle demanding tasks with ease. This year, even the standard iPhone 16 models support AAA gaming, a feature previously reserved for the Pro versions. The 48-megapixel main camera delivers high-quality photos and videos, while the flat AMOLED display ensures a great viewing experience. That said, the 60Hz refresh rate does feel a bit dated compared to competitors. The iPhone 16 Plus, with its larger display and battery, is ideal for those who prefer bigger phones. And with iOS 18 onboard, you’re guaranteed seamless updates and access to Apple’s latest features. If you want an iPhone with all the essentials, this is your best bet.Google Pixel 9 Finally, we have the Google Pixel 9, a phone that’s all about the software and camera experience. It sports a vibrant AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it perfect for streaming videos and scrolling through social media. The Tensor G4 processor ensures smooth performance, paired with a 4,700mAh battery that’s good for all-day use. While its charging speeds (27W wired, 15W wireless) could be better, the Pixel 9 shines when it comes to photography. Its 50-megapixel primary camera produces sharp and vibrant photos, even in challenging conditions. The phone is also durable, thanks to its IP68 rating, and features an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor for added security. Available in a single 12GB RAM + 256GB storage variant, this phone was officially launched for Rs 79,999 but is currently selling on discount for a price of Rs 72,999 on Flipkart.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

We recently published an article on the Poco X7 Pro and why it’s worth considering. In this article, we’ll focus on its more affordable sibling — the Poco X7. Priced from Rs 21,999, the phone promises a blend of solid performance, impressive design, and reliable everyday features. But is it the right choice for everyone? Here are the top four reasons to buy the Poco X7 and one reason you might want to think twice.advertisementPoco X7 5G: 4 reasons to buySolid build with IP69 ratingPoco has stepped up its game when it comes to the design and durability of the X7 series. The Poco X7 brings back the brand’s iconic yellow colour, paired with a premium faux leather finish that feels good to hold and keeps fingerprints away. The large camera island adds a bold, modern touch, though the prominent Poco branding on the back might not appeal to everyone. What truly stands out is the phone’s dust and water resistance, which comes with IP66, IP68, and even IP69 ratings — something rare at this price point. Combine that with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection on the display — a feature usually reserved for pricier devices — and you’ve got a phone that’s built to last.

Combine that with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection on the display — a feature usually reserved for pricier devices — and you’ve got a phone that’s built to last.  Immersive multimedia experience The Poco X7 shines when it comes to multimedia consumption. The 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution delivers vibrant colours and sharp visuals. It supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, and the full DCI-P3 colour gamut, making it perfect for watching your favourite shows or scrolling through social media. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling, while the 3,000 nits peak brightness makes the display easy to view, even under direct sunlight. The stereo speakers are another highlight, providing loud, clear sound without distortion, even at higher volumes. Whether you’re watching movies, gaming, or just browsing, the Poco X7 offers one of the best multimedia experiences in its price range. Good battery life The Poco X7 comes with a large 5,500mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day. Of course, it is not as good as the X7 Pro’s mammoth 6,550mAh battery, but it gets the job done. From streaming videos to using social media, you can go about your day without constantly worrying about plugging in. While the 45W charging speed isn’t the fastest — especially when compared to the 67W charging on its predecessor, the Poco X6 — it’s still quick enough to fully charge the device in a reasonable amount of time. You can charge the phone from 0 to 100 per cent in about an hour, which is decent for a device in this price bracket. Decent camera performance On the camera front, the Poco X7 doesn’t disappoint, at least when you are shooting in good light. Its 50-megapixel Sony LYT 600 primary camera captures vibrant, sharp images with a good level of detail. While colours are slightly boosted, they don’t feel unnatural, and the images turn out appealing. The 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens adds versatility, and the 20-megapixel front camera clicks decent selfies, although some facial smoothing might not please everyone. Compared to some of its competitors like Nothing Phone (2a), the X7 holds its ground well. Its daylight images are often more vibrant and appealing, and its portrait shots offer good edge detection and colour reproduction.Poco X7 5G: 1 reason to skip Android 14: Should’ve been Android 15 for a new phone Here’s where the Poco X7 stumbles. The phone comes with HyperOS atop Android 14 out of the box, which is disappointing considering Android 15 is already available on its pricier sibling, the Poco X7 Pro. What’s more, Poco promises three years of major updates, but in reality, this means only two Android updates, since it already ships with Android 14. This means the phone will likely only go up to Android 16, leaving buyers with fewer updates than some competitors in the same segment. At a starting price of Rs 21,999, the Poco X7 5G offers plenty of value with its durable build, stellar display, reliable cameras, and decent battery life. It’s a solid choice for those seeking a phone that can handle everyday tasks with ease. However, the limited Android updates might give some buyers pause. If you can look past this shortcoming, the Poco X7 is still a fantastic device that ticks most of the right boxes.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  Poco X7 Pro goes on sale for Rs 27,999: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

The phone is compact, light and packed with premium features. While on paper it aces the game, is it as good in real-life? Let's find out in this India Today Tech review. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/realme-14-pro-plus-review-a-knight-in-shining-armour-2665746-2025-01-16,"After just 5 months of launching the Realme 13 Pro series, the company is back with its latest Pro models – the Realme 14 Pro and Realme 14 Pro+. I have been using the 14 Pro+ for over 2 weeks and I love it. I know, strong words for a review, but I did some thorough testing to back my claims. At a starting price of Rs 29,999, the phone sports premium features, including a bit gimmicky but interesting colour-changing rear panel, 6,000mAh battery and a 50-megapixel camera. Let’s dive into the details. 

 



Realme 14 Pro+
advertisementThe Realme 14 Pro+ and its shining armourThe Realme 14 Pro series’ design is hard to miss. Barring the centre-aligned round camera island, the 14 Pro’s design has received quite the overhaul. This is especially true for the Pearl White variant. The Realme 14 Pro+ comes in three colours: Pearl White, Suede Grey and Bikaner Purple. While others look good too, the Pearl White has my heart. This variant’s rear panel has a texture similar to that of a pearl. But that’s not all. The Realme 14 Pro+ features a temperature-sensitive, colour-changing rear panel, exclusive to the white variant. The panel changes colour when exposed to cold temperatures — specifically, below 16 degrees. Blue waves start to appear on the panel, giving it the look of a pearl in the ocean. Fortunately, the phone launched during Delhi winters, making it easy for me to test this feature. However, during the scorching Delhi summers, the only way to activate the colour change would be by pouring cold water on the phone. But even then, the effect will quickly revert to the original colour. To keep the blue waves visible, the sub-16-degree temperature needs to be consistently maintained.

But, for context, this is not the first phone that changes its rear panel with temperature. Vivo has been doing it since 2022 with the Vivo V25 and the Vivo Y100 among the first phones to feature the tech. In addition to the colour-changing back, the Realme 14 Pro+ also has some functional upgrades to the design. The phone has a compact form factor and a slim profile. It is just 7.99mm thick and sits perfectly in the palm. 
 


Coming back to the rear panel, the Realme 14 Pro+ features a circular island that houses a triple-camera lens. Unlike its predecessor, the camera arrangement looks like a fidget spinner. The module is outlined by a thick golden rim, which compliments the design and the frame perfectly. Bright and gorgeous display The Realme 14 Pro series’ design is hard to miss.

The module is outlined by a thick golden rim, which compliments the design and the frame perfectly. Bright and gorgeous display The Realme 14 Pro+ features a beautiful 6.83-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The brightness is impressive and I faced no issue reading text on the phone under the direct sun. 
 


I have been using the phone as my primary device and I enjoyed my time with it. Thanks to the 1.5K display resolution, binge watching Netflix, scrolling Instagram and playing graphic-demanding games have been a delight on the phone. The Realme 14 Pro+ features a quad-curved display, giving it a subtle curve that makes the bezels appear slimmer, which in turn makes the display look even larger. But the curve on the phone is also prone to accidental touches. Frequently, while scrolling through Instagram, my hand would unintentionally tap on icons towards the corners of the screen. That’s no fun.Great performance, better batteryThe Realme 14 Pro+ is a smooth runner. Under the hood, it packs a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset, and it runs on Realme UI 6.0 OS, which is based on Android 15. At this price, I will not say that it is the best performer, but it is definitely impressive. The phone handles day-to-day tasks pretty well. These tasks include, using social media apps, watching YouTube videos and other OTT platforms, reading articles on the phone and of course, answering and receiving calls. But all of this can be easily handled by an entry-level smartphone as well. So, what does the Realme 14 Pro+ bring to the table? The mid-budget smartphone can easily pull off tasks you would expect from a more premium smartphone. For example, graphic-intensive gaming. I played Call of Duty for an hour without any lag or heating issues. Cherry on top: the phone sports a dedicated game engine that helps customise your gaming experience.

advertisementTo further push the limits of the phone, I ran a few benchmark tests. On Geekbench, the phone clocked 1176 for single-core, and 3195 for multi-core. And that’s a decent score. To consider the competition, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ scored lower than the Realme 14 Pro+, as it noted 1079 and 3009 for single and multi-score, respectively. These scores indicate that the phone is capable of smooth single-threaded tasks like browsing and app usage, as well as multi-threaded performance for gaming and multitasking.

For instance, after a tough gaming session, when I immediately switch to Instagram, the phone took a few seconds to open the app. Overall, though, the Realme 14 Pro+ performs well. Backing this performance is also a solid 6,000mAh battery, which lasted me for an entire day. During my tests, I used the phone for an entire day after playing high-graphic games, watching Netflix and hours of scrolling social media. To put things in perspective, the battery dropped only 8 per cent (from 33 per cent to 25 per cent) after playing the Call of Duty for 40 minutes, and it dropped only 7 per cent (from 22 per cent to 15 per cent) after two episodes of Netflix’s Nobody Wants This (1 hour).

Leak reveals detailsSamsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S25 Slim, its thinnest smartphone ever, at the Galaxy Unpacked event next week on January 22.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-is-going-to-be-thin-but-just-how-thin-will-it-be-leak-reveals-details-2665748-2025-01-16,"Samsung is set to host its Galaxy Unpacked event on January 22, where it is expected to unveil four new smartphones, including the traditional lineup: the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, the fourth device promises to be something special. Samsung is rumored to announce the Galaxy S25 Slim, which is believed to be the slimmest phone ever released by the company. Speculation about this ""Slim"" phone has been circulating for quite some time. Interestingly, Apple is also rumored to be working on something similar for this year. But the burning question remains: just how slim will this phone be? The latest leak on the Galaxy S25 series might finally have the answer.  In a new report, Smartprix and OnLeaks have shared some high-quality 5K renders of the Galaxy S25 Slim.  Looking at the renders, the Galaxy S25 Slim lives up to its name, measuring a mere 6.4mm in thickness without the camera module and 8.3mm with it — an impressive feat when most phones fall between 8mm to 10mm before adding a camera bump. For context, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to be 8.2mm thick without the bump, making the Slim a standout.

 Samsung’s pursuit of slimness doesn’t compromise screen size. The Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to feature a 6.7 to 6.8-inch display, fitting into a compact frame measuring 159 x 76 x 6.4mm, according to reports. By comparison, the Galaxy S25 Ultra measures 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm, making the Slim 3.8mm shorter, 1.6mm narrower, and 1.8mm thinner.   Design-wise, the Galaxy S25 Slim stays true to the S25 series aesthetic. It features a metal frame, a glass back, and a triple rear camera setup. The bezels are ultra-thin, aligning with the rest of the lineup. The flat frame complements flat volume rockers and a power button, while the bottom houses a USB-C port, a single speaker grille, and a microphone.   The Slim’s flat display mirrors the design choices seen across the S25 series, offering a uniform yet sleek appearance. In terms of slimness, it dethrones Samsung’s previous record-holder, the Galaxy A8, which was 4.9mm thick but packed only a 3,050mAh battery. The Galaxy S25 Slim manages to combine its ultra-thin profile with a larger battery and cutting-edge internals, proving that slim doesn’t mean sacrificing functionality. The Galaxy S25 Slim is set to be unveiled at the Galaxy Unpacked event next week. However, reports suggest that the phone will go on sale some time later this year. We willl know about the timeline of the phone's launch and sale at the event on January 22.

The upcoming devices promise some interesting upgrades, particularly in AI and camera technology, which could be a big draw for users. According to the leaks, the key highlight of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, as expected, will be its camera setup. It retains the 200-megapixel primary camera and a 50-megapixel periscope with 5x optical zoom from the previous Ultra model, along with a 10-megapixel telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The big upgrade here is the 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera, replacing the older 12-megapixel sensor. This change comes after some criticism of the previous model's ultra-wide camera's performance. The front-facing camera, as with other models, will have a 12-megapixel sensor.

 As for endurance, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will feature a 5,000 mAh battery. Samsung claims that it can last up to 31 hours of video playback, which is similar to previous models in the Ultra range. The Galaxy S25+ and S25, on the other hand, will share a similar camera setup, including a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto lens, and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera. For selfies, there will be a 12-megapixel front camera on both devices. The S25+ will retain the same 4,900 mAh battery as its predecessor, ensuring up to 30 hours of video playback. All phones in the Galaxy S25 series will reportedly be powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, paired with 12GB RAM as standard, which should offer solid performance for day-to-day tasks, multitasking, and gaming. In addition to hardware upgrades, leaks suggest that Samsung will be introducing new AI features in the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. One of the key highlights is the Brief feature, which offers personalised summaries of your day. The morning brief will give you a weather forecast, your daily schedule, and an energy score if you have a Samsung wearable. During your commute, it will start navigation and music playback when you enter your vehicle, and the evening summary will provide an overview of your daily activity, including memorable moments in the form of photo collages.

 Additionally, the integration of Google’s Gemini AI assistant with Samsung’s own apps is a solid development. Users will now be able to ask Gemini to read content from apps like YouTube and interact with Samsung apps, such as Samsung Notes. This opens up new possibilities for voice-driven interactions and seamless integration between Samsung’s software and Google’s AI technology. While the Galaxy S25 series doesn’t bring any major redesigns, these updates give us an idea about the company’s seriousness when it comes to AI and camera enhancements.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

Referring to the work environment as ""unchained slavery,"" the anonymous writer detailed the issues he encountered during his nine-year tenure at the company. He left Infosys in 2017 and is now employed at an IT giant based in Bengaluru's Ecospace. In his post, which has gone viral, he has compared Infosys with current workplaces, painting a critical picture of Infosys' corporate culture. In the post, the person who claims to be an ex-employee of Infosys joined the company as a fresher in 2008 and stayed there for almost a decade. During this time, he says he was paid very less compared to industry standards. He revealed that his last salary at the tech company for Rs 35,000 monthly. ""When I left Infosys after nine years, my monthly salary was Rs 35,000. Today, I earn Rs 1.7 lakh, nearly 400 per cent more,"" he revealed. He also mentioned that whenever he refers former Infosys colleagues to his current company, they usually receive an 80-100 per cent hike in pay, revealing how underpaid employees at Infosys continue to be. Another aspect the former employee highlighted was the disparity in benefits. He noted that in his current organisation, transportation and parking are free, while at Infosys, employees had to pay out of pocket for these services. ""I paid Rs 3,200 monthly for transport at Infosys, while parking also came at an extra cost,"" he shared. The cafeteria, too, showed a marked difference, with subsidised prices at his new company. For instance, a fruit juice that costs Rs 15-20 at his current workplace would have set him back Rs 40 at Infosys. The post further touched on what the ex-employee called the ""myth of progression"" at Infosys. While the company promoted employees within sub-levels, such as from 4B to 4A, there were no big salary hikes or changes in responsibilities. In contrast, promotions at his current company come with real pay hikes of 15-25 per cent and additional responsibilities.  ""Infosys relied on single-digit annual salary hikes of 4-6 per cent, which made it difficult to earn a competitive salary over time,"" he added. One of the biggest challenges he faced during his time at Infosys was the 90-day notice period, which he described as a barrier to switching jobs. He noted that many prospective employers were unwilling to wait three months for an employee to join. In his current company, the notice period is only two months, which he feels is more reasonable and allows for smoother job transitions. Another issue he raised was Infosys' rigid work-hour policies. Employees were required to spend a mandatory number of hours on campus, tracked through ID card swipes. This led to what the writer called ""absurd scenarios,"" where employees would visit the campus on weekends just to meet their required hours. Finally, the ex-Infosys employee criticised the company’s emphasis on philanthropy while, according to him, neglecting employee welfare. He wrote employees often joked that the company should redirect some of its charitable efforts toward better salaries and benefits for its workforce. He also pointed out the lack of ""market corrections"" in salaries at Infosys, contrasting it with his current employer, which periodically adjusts salaries to align with market trends.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Trending Reel

The tech firm will also not use them while ranking or removing content on its platform, despite EU law requirements. An Axios report cited, to back its claim, a letter written to Renate Nikolay, Deputy Director General under the EU's content and technology wing by Google's representatives. The EU Code of Practice, introduced in 2022 for online platforms, trade associations and the advertising industry, requires them to keep under check fake claims, misinformation, motivated propaganda among others. The Code was originally enacted in 2018. Notably, Google has never added the fact-checking feature under its content moderation policy.  Kent Walker, Google's global affairs chief termed the fact-checking integration enacted by the European Commission's Disinformation Code of Practice ""not appropriate or effective"" for services offered by Google, expressing the tech giant's unwillingness to commit to it, the Axios report added. The European Commission is the executive body of the EU, which ensures that the bloc's policies and laws are implemented across Member States. It also deliberates on international agreements on the EU's behalf. To further affirm Google's stance on EU fact-checking law, Walker referred to the company's existing policy with regard to content moderation, calling it adequate and cited various elections that were held around the world last year to back his claim.   ""Google will continue to invest in improvements to its current content moderation practices, which focus on providing people with more information about their search results through features like Synth ID watermarking and AI disclosures on YouTube,"" Axios quoted Walker as saying in the letter. The development came a week after social media major Meta's chief Mark Zuckerberg asserted that EU data law required only big tech outlets to conform to its fact-checking rules and remove objectionable content.  ""Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws institutionalising censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there,"" Zuckerberg was quoted as saying by Reuters. Last week, Meta said it would halt efforts to fact-check and scale down policing of speech across major platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. As EU data law suggests, the code required Google to include fact-check results alongside its search results and videos on YouTube. It would also require Google to add a fact-checking feature to its ranking systems and algorithms. The EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) was brought into effect in 2022 in the wake of, as the Commission claims on its official website, fake news on vaccines, false healthcare information, hoaxes with misleading claims and conspiracy theories put many lives in danger during the Covid-19 pandemic.Published By: Vivek Published On: Jan 16, 2025Must Watch

The rumours and leaks have indicated that the fourth generation of iPhone SE will debut in April. Since the first hint of the launch, the rumours have been churning at godspeed. Previously, it was speculated that the iPhone SE 4 would follow the iPhone 14 design language. And now, a recent leak has made this rumour even more firm, sharing dummy photos of the upcoming phone. 
 


advertisementiPhone SE 4 dummy images leakedTipster Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) has recently shared images of iPhone SE 4 dummies. There have been rumours suggesting that the next â€ŒiPhone SEâ€Œ will adopt the design of the iPhone 14, and the latest images seem to confirm this. The device appears to feature a similar chassis to the iPhone 14, with an aluminium frame, a glass back, and a single-lens rear camera. 
 


 Although there have been talks about the â€ŒiPhone SEâ€Œ 4 potentially incorporating an Action Button or Camera Control button, features available on the iPhone 16 models. These elements are not seen in the current dummy models. While this doesn’t completely rule out the possibility of these features being included, it does make it less likely, as accessory manufacturers typically design cases based on known features. 
 


If these buttons were to be included, case makers would need to adjust their designs, making it less probable that the device will have these new functionalities. For now, the design closely resembles the iPhone 14 without those additions.iPhone SE 4 coming in April: What to expectThe foremost thing to note is that Apple might rebrand the iPhone SE with iPhone 16e. The rumours has it that it will feature several notable upgrades, including key elements from the iPhone 16 series. If these rumours are accurate, the iPhone 16e would represent a significant leap forward for Apple’s budget-friendly iPhone lineup.The iPhone SE 4 is expected to showcase several improvements over its predecessor, including a larger 6.06-inch OLED display, replacing the 4.7-inch LCD found in the previous model. This would provide users with a more vibrant and higher-quality screen. Additionally, the SE 4 is rumored to be powered by the A18 chipset, delivering a substantial performance boost and bringing it closer to the iPhone 16 series in processing power.

2705097d-bd9c-40ba-be61-8f36a7034bfa,"Apple launches Apple Store app in IndiaApple has launched a new Apple Store app in India, which will let you buy Apple products directly from the official Apple app. The app is available on the App Store for free.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-launches-apple-store-app-in-india-2666068-2025-01-17,"Apple has launched the Apple Store app in India, which has been available in its other markets for years. The app is available for download on the App Store. The app is meant to streamline access to Apple’s products and services in the country, which is in addition to the physical store, authorised sellers and third-party retailers that the customers have access to.  “At Apple, our customer is at the centre of everything we do, and we are thrilled to introduce the Apple Store app to reach even more users in India, further deepening our connections,” said Karen Rasmussen, Apple’s head of Retail Online. “With the Apple Store app, customers will discover a new and seamless way to shop for all our incredible products, receive personalised support, and really experience the best of Apple,” she added. The Apple Store app also has a bunch of customisations of users in India. For instance, it has a products tab, which allows users to explore Apple’s lineup of devices and accessories, learn about trade-in programs, and access financing options. There is also a For You tab, which shows tailored recommendations and a quick-access section for saved or favourited items. There is also a Go Further tab on the app. What it does is: After a purchase, customers can connect with Apple Specialists for online Personal Setup sessions, access tips via short videos, or join Today at Apple sessions at local stores to unlock their devices’ full potential.   The app also brings Apple’s customisation features to India, allowing users to engrave devices such as AirPods, iPads, and Apple Pencils with names, initials, or emojis in various languages. Customers can also configure Macs with upgraded specifications or personalise their Apple Watch orders.   With the Apple Store app, Indian customers can choose between home delivery and in-store pickup, making it easier than ever to access Apple’s products.  
The introduction of the Apple Store app comes at a time when Apple is increasing its investments in the Indian market. Beyond its partnerships with authorised resellers and third-party retailers, Apple opened its first physical stores in Delhi and Mumbai in April 2023. In the press note, Apple has also confirmed that it will be opening new stores in Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi-NCR, and Mumbai soon.  This digital expansion through the app signifies Apple’s intent to offer the same premium experience for Indian consumers that it offers in other countries. By combining personalised shopping, customisation options, and convenient delivery or pickup methods, Apple is setting new standards for customer engagement in India.

11207605-6bf5-4376-a036-b86f715d543c,Crash Detection on Apple Watch helps save man after passing out while drivingA man from Easthampton credits his Apple Watch with saving his life after a terrifying car crash left him trapped upside down in a neighbour's swimming pool.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/crash-detection-on-apple-watch-helps-save-man-after-passing-out-while-driving-2666063-2025-01-17,"A 55-year-old man from Easthampton, Massachusetts, credits his Apple Watch for saving his life after a terrifying car crash left him trapped upside down in a swimming pool. Brent Hill was driving home on December 16 when he suddenly began to feel unwell. Moments later, he blacked out completely. The next thing he knew, he was slowly regaining consciousness, disoriented, and unable to make sense of his surroundings. Hill’s car, which had veered off the road, had smashed through a neighbour’s garage before plunging into their swimming pool. Surveillance footage from a nearby camera captured the harrowing moment when his car accelerated uncontrollably, likely caused by his foot pressing the accelerator as he passed out. As he regained consciousness, Hill was shocked to hear what he initially thought was a voice from the afterlife. In reality, it was his Apple Watch that had detected the crash and called emergency services. The voice from the watch reassured him that help was on its way, giving him a glimmer of hope in a desperate situation. “If emergency services had not contacted me through that watch and coached me through it, there’s no way I would’ve got out of there,” Hill said. He recalled hearing faint noises outside the car but couldn’t comprehend them properly. “I knew there was commotion, but I didn’t know where I was. That voice from the watch kept me calm. Without it, I probably would have drowned.” Thanks to the Apple Watch's crash detection feature, emergency responders arrived quickly and rescued Hill before the situation worsened. Although the crash left him with minor injuries, Hill believes it could have ended much worse without the watch’s intervention. Neighbour Elizabeth Laprade-Appelquist, whose garage and pool bore the brunt of the crash, was astonished when she learnt how the Apple Watch played a key role. “My husband called 911, but they were already speaking to the driver through his watch. It was incredible to hear how it all worked out,” she said. Hill hopes his story encourages more people to understand the value of technology in emergencies. “This feature saved my life. It’s a reminder that these devices are more than just gadgets; they can be lifesavers.” This incident adds to the growing number of reports highlighting how smartwatches, especially the Apple Watches, have repeatedly proven how invaluable technology can be in such critical moments.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

However, the buzz surrounding the Galaxy S25 Slim stands out as particularly intense.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-may-feature-smaller-battery-compared-to-rest-of-the-galaxy-s25-lineup-2666056-2025-01-17,"Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event, scheduled for January 22, is expected to showcase four new smartphones. The lineup will likely include the usual suspects—the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, the highlight could be the Galaxy S25 Slim, rumoured to be the company’s slimmest phone to date.  With just a few days left for the launch event, we have been coming across several leaks and rumours about the phones. Earlier this week, we wrote about a report that revealed just how slim the Galaxy S25 Slim would be, and another on how much the Galaxy S25 series will cost in India. Now, there is another report that claims that the battery capacity of the Galaxy S25 Slim will be the smallest in the new lineup.  Digital Chat Station, a well-known source on the Chinese platform Weibo, claims that the battery capacity of the Galaxy S25 Slim will range between 3,000mAh and 4,000mAh. The post claims that the phone’s ultra-slim design will likely challenge heat dissipation and battery performance. That is quite understandable because the S25 Slim is rumoured to measure just 6.4mm. Where is Samsung supposed to fit in a larger battery?  As per the leak, the same will be the scenario with the iPhone 17 Air, which is rumoured to be even thinner than the Galaxy S25 Slim. But just how slim? As mentioned above, a recent report revealed how slim the Galaxy S25 Slim will be. It claims that the smartphone’s thickness will be at just 6.4mm without the camera module and 8.3mm with it –– that is far thinner than the typical 8mm to 10mm profiles of most smartphones. Even compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which measures 8.2mm thick without its camera bump, the Slim stands out.   Despite its sleek build, the Galaxy S25 Slim doesn’t compromise on display size, boasting a 6.7 to 6.8-inch screen. Its compact dimensions, reported at 159 x 76 x 6.4mm, make it shorter, narrower, and slimmer than the Ultra, which measures 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm.   Design-wise, the Slim aligns with the rest of the Galaxy S25 series, featuring a metal frame, glass back, triple rear cameras, and ultra-thin bezels. The flat frame integrates seamlessly with the volume rockers and power button, while the base includes a USB-C port, speaker grille, and microphone.   The Galaxy S25 Slim surpasses Samsung’s previous slimmest model, the Galaxy A8, which was 4.9mm thick but limited by a 3,050mAh battery. Reports suggest the Slim will incorporate a larger battery, balancing its ultra-thin profile with advanced hardware, making it a blend of style and functionality.

6c4d78f5-dffe-48ab-ab3f-b9defc2a6761,"Samsung Galaxy S25 could be the first phone to support Hey GeminiThe Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event is scheduled to take place on January 22, 2025. The event is expected to unveil the next-gen Galaxy S series. With the launch, the rumour has it that the Galaxy S25 series could be the first one to debut with the 'Hey Gemini' wake words. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-could-be-the-first-phone-to-support-hey-gemini-2666071-2025-01-17,"For the longest period of time, Google has been going around with ""Hey Google"" for its AI assistant, but this might change soon. With the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series this month, Google might shift its wake words to 'Hey Gemini'. If this holds to be true, then the upcoming series will be the first one to debut with a new call for its assistance. For context, Gemini AI on Android currently lacks its own dedicated wake word, relying instead on ""Hey Google"" as the primary hotword for both Google Assistant and Gemini (depending on your default setting).  Google debuting its features with a Samsung phone should not come as a surprise. The trend of introducing a new Google AI-feature into a high-end Samsung device started a year back, when the Galaxy S24 series debuted with Circle to Search. But here is a thought: Is Google, by working with Samsung to load AI smarts in its phones, undermining its own Pixel phones? Hey Gemini: Google might release its wake words this month Hints of a possible ""Hey Gemini"" hotword have surfaced before, though not in the context of smartphones. Toward the end of last year, Google introduced its Android XR platform, designed to power next-generation VR/AR devices such as Samsung's ""Project Moohan"" headsets and smart glasses, with Google Gemini integrated at its core. 
 


 Teaser videos for Android XR revealed that the platform is built to leverage the ""Hey Gemini"" hotword, particularly since it is not expected to support Google Assistant. While it was initially unclear if this wake word would remain exclusive to the ""Android platform built for the Gemini AI era,"" new evidence suggests that it could soon be extended to smartphones—possibly during the Galaxy Unpacked event, scheduled for January 22.  This speculation stems from a leaked Galaxy S25 marketing document, highlighting the series' advanced AI capabilities. The leak, published by the Brazilian outlet Tecnoblog, includes promotional materials for Samsung's flagship series. Samsung Galaxy S25 series: What to expect The upcoming Galaxy S25 series is set to introduce notable upgrades, particularly in AI capabilities and camera technology, which are expected to appeal to users. Here is the gist of what is expected to arrive, but if you want to read in detail, we have also got you covered (read here).  According to leaks, the standout feature of the Galaxy S25 Ultra will once again be its impressive camera system. While it retains the 200-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel periscope with 5x optical zoom, and a 10-megapixel telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom from its predecessor, the major enhancement lies in the ultra-wide camera. Samsung has replaced the previous 12-megapixel sensor with a new 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera, addressing past criticisms of its performance. The front-facing camera will continue to feature a 12-megapixel sensor across the lineup.  Beyond hardware, the series is expected to debut new AI-driven features. Among them is the ""Brief"" feature, which delivers personalised daily summaries. In the morning, it offers a weather forecast, a rundown of your schedule, and an energy score if paired with a Samsung wearable. During commutes, it can initiate navigation and play music upon entering your vehicle. At the end of the day, it provides an overview of your activities, including photo collages of memorable moments.  Additionally, the integration of Google’s Gemini AI assistant with Samsung apps marks a significant development. Users will be able to leverage Gemini for tasks like reading content from YouTube or interacting with Samsung Notes, enabling more seamless and voice-driven interactions between Samsung’s ecosystem and Google’s AI technology.

But should you buy it right now or wait for the iPhone 17?",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/iphone-16-pro-available-with-big-discount-should-you-buy-it-or-wait-for-iphone-17-2666103-2025-01-17,"If you’ve been waiting for the perfect moment to upgrade to the iPhone 16 Pro, now might just be the right time. Apple’s latest and greatest flagship phone is currently available at a discounted price on Amazon. The base 128GB model, originally priced at Rs 1,19,900, is now selling for Rs 1,12,900. But the savings don’t end there — thanks to some attractive exchange offers, you could potentially bring the price down to as low as Rs 77,400. Yes, you read that right. Amazon is offering a flat discount of Rs 7,000 on the iPhone 16 Pro, bringing the price down to Rs 1,12,900. On top of this, the exchange offer allows buyers to save up to Rs 35,500 depending on the phone they trade in. For example, if you’re trading in an iPhone 13 Pro, you could receive an exchange value of up to Rs 31,000, further reducing the price to Rs 82,900. Similarly, if you own an iPhone 13 Pro Max in good condition, you could potentially qualify for the full Rs 35,500 exchange benefit, effectively bringing the cost of the iPhone 16 Pro down to an impressive Rs 77,400. The exact exchange value will, of course, vary based on the condition and market value of your existing handset. To check how much your device qualifies for, simply head over to Amazon, select your desired iPhone 16 Pro colour variant, and explore the exchange offer for your device. You’ll be able to see the estimated value Amazon is offering for your phone. All in all, with the current discount and the lucrative exchange deals, this is an excellent opportunity to snag the iPhone 16 Pro at a considerably reduced price. But, should you buy it, or should you wait for the iPhone 17 coming later this year? iPhone 16 Pro: Should you buy it or wait for iPhone 17? While this is the right time to buy the iPhone 16, Apple will unveil the iPhone 17, including the iPhone 17 Pro, in September this year. Based on the leaks and rumours, the iPhone 17 series is expected to bring a host of upgrades over the iPhone 16 series, enhancing both performance and user experience. Apple’s iPhone 17 series is shaping up to be one of the most exciting updates in years, with several major design and hardware changes rumoured to be in the pipeline.  Apple is reportedly working on a slimmer iPhone model — iPhone 17 Air. This device is expected to be around 6.25mm thick, making it significantly thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro, which is 8.25mm. If true, this would make the iPhone 17 Air the thinnest iPhone Apple has ever produced.  Significant design updates are expected for the iPhone 17 Pro models. Apple is rumoured to be ditching the titanium frame introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro series and returning to aluminium. This shift would also bring a new half-glass, half-aluminium back panel, with the bottom half remaining glass to support wireless charging. Not only could this make the Pro models more durable, but it would also mark a departure from the all-glass backs used since the iPhone X. The camera module is also set for a redesign. While current camera bumps are square, leaks suggest the new Pro models might feature an elongated oval or rectangular shape made from aluminium. However, other sources claim the camera layout will remain triangular, keeping things similar to existing designs but with a fresh twist. Speaking of cameras, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to pack a trio of 48-megapixel sensors for the primary, ultra-wide, and telephoto cameras. Meanwhile, all iPhone 17 models are said to feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, a big jump from the current 12-megapixel lens. Some models may even include a mechanical aperture, allowing users to adjust the light intake for more control over depth-of-field in photos. Another big change that's expected is the expansion of ProMotion. Apple’s 120Hz refresh rate technology has been exclusive to Pro models, but it is expected to make its way to the standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air in 2025. This could potentially make way for features like always-on displays across the lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to come equipped with the A19 Pro chip, paired with 12GB of RAM. Meanwhile, the standard iPhone 17 models are likely to feature the A19 chip with 8GB of RAM, offering solid performance for everyday use. As for pricing, the iPhone 17 Pro is rumoured to start at $999 in the US. If Apple follows its current pricing trend, this could translate to Rs 1,19,900 in India, matching the launch price of the iPhone 16 Pro in the country. The leaks surrounding the iPhone 17 series, along with details about the current iPhone 16 Pro, make the upcoming lineup seem like a major upgrade. That said, buying the iPhone 16 Pro now still has its advantages. With Apple’s trade-in program likely to offer attractive deals for upgrades next year, it could be a smart investment for those who want the latest tech now. Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro already delivers a premium experience, powered by iOS 18, ensuring top-notch performance and features for immediate use.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-releases-ios-183-beta-3-for-developers-includes-updates-in-notification-summaries-camera-controls-and-more-2666117-2025-01-17,"Apple has rolled out the third beta of iOS 18.3 to developers, introducing several fixes and refinements across apps and features to improve the user experience. The first two betas of iOS 18.3 were relatively light and primarily focused on bug fixes. However, the newest beta brings a few notable updates to features such as Notification Summaries, Camera Controls, Messages, and PDF editing. Let’s take a quick look at everything new in the latest iOS 18.3 beta 3. Notification Summary One of the major upgrades in the third beta is for Notification Summaries. For the News and Entertainment categories, Apple has temporarily disabled notification summaries. Apple Intelligence will no longer summarize news notifications until further refinements are made, allowing the company to improve the accuracy and reliability of summaries in future updates. Apple has also noted in the Settings app that this feature remains in beta and is subject to potential errors. Additionally, Apple has introduced a clearer setup message for Notification Summaries. The new message cautions users that “summarization may change the meaning of the original headlines,”  as noted by MacRumors. With this update, summarized notifications are now italicized to differentiate them from standard notifications, providing better visual clarity. Moreover, with iOS 18.3 beta 3, users can manage Notification Summaries directly from the Lock Screen. Swiping on a notification and selecting the “Options” button now provides an interface to disable summaries for specific apps, offering a more convenient customization experience. These updates are currently in beta and will soon be available to users across iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3. Upgrades in Camera Control For iPhone 16 users, Apple has included a new feature in the Camera Control settings. The previous “AE/AF Lock” option has been renamed “Lock Focus and Exposure,” making it more intuitive for users unfamiliar with technical photography terms. This new setting allows users to lock focus and exposure with a light press and hold on the Camera Control button, mimicking the functionality of DSLR cameras. Genmoji Integration in Messages In the Messages app, Apple has added a new entry for Genmoji creation. Accessible via the “+” button in any conversation, the Genmoji option directs users to the creation interface, providing another way to personalize conversations with custom emojis. Previously, Genmoji creation tools were only accessible through the emoji keyboard button. With the iOS 18.3 beta 3 updates, this feature is now easier to access. PDF Editing Warning The latest beta introduces a new alert for PDF editing. When cropping a PDF through the screenshot interface, users are warned that cropped content is not fully removed from the document. The message reads: “Content outside the cropped area won’t be visible in most PDF viewers, but it can be made visible in some apps”. Availability The iOS 18.3 beta is currently available to registered developers. It will soon be available for public beta testers and, eventually, all users. Interested users can download it via the Apple Developer Center or as an over-the-air update on devices enrolled in the beta testing program.

From what the rumours suggest so far, at the time of the event, Samsung will only be launching its usual suspects, the standard variant, the plus variant, and the Ultra variant. The Galaxy S25 Slim, however, is expected to only be unveiled at the event next week, with the launch believed to happen some time later. The timeline for the S25 Slim’s launch and sale is yet to be revealed.  While Samsung has been keeping mum about the details about its 2025 flagship smartphones, nothing has been able to stop the rumour mill from churning out constant speculation about what the Galaxy S25 phones could be like. And thanks to the myriad of reports ahead of the launch event next week, we already know what to expect from the design, chipset, camera, and pricing of the new phones. Samsung Galaxy S25 series: Expected price in India  Pricing for the Galaxy S25 series has surfaced through leaks, giving us a glimpse of how much it would cost in India. And from what the reports suggest, the smartphones are going to be more expensive than last year’s Galaxy S24 series. Galaxy S25: The base 128GB variant is expected to start at 964 euros (approximately Rs 85,000), with 256GB and 512GB models priced at 1,026 euros (Rs 91,000) and 1,151 euros (Rs 1,01,000), respectively.   Galaxy S25+: Starting at 1,235 euros (Rs 1,09,000) for 256GB, while the 512GB variant could cost 1,359 euros (Rs 1,20,000).   Galaxy S25 Ultra: The most premium model starts at 1,557 euros (Rs 1,38,000) for the base variant and goes up to 1,930 euros (Rs 1,70,000) for the 1TB configuration.   For comparison, last year’s Galaxy S24 series launched at slightly lower prices than the anticipated Galaxy S25 lineup. The Galaxy S24 was available at a starting price of Rs 79,999 for the 8GB + 256GB variant, while the 8GB + 512GB model was priced at Rs 89,999.   The Galaxy S24+ had a starting price of Rs 99,999 for the 12GB + 256GB option, increasing to Rs 1,09,999 for the 12GB + 512GB version. The Galaxy S24 Ultra started at Rs 1,29,999 for the 12GB + 256GB configuration, with the 12GB + 512GB variant priced at Rs 1,39,999 and the 12GB + 1TB model costing Rs 1,59,999.  Samsung Galaxy S25 series: Specifications and features Design and build  The Galaxy S25 and S25+ retain a familiar aesthetic with three distinct rear cameras, sleek frames, and ultra-thin bezels. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumoured to adopt a rounded design, deviating from the boxy look of its predecessors. Notable tweaks include thinner bezels and camera lens rings that match the frame colour, giving it a more refined appearance.   The standout device, the Galaxy S25 Slim, is rumoured to be just 6.4mm thick without the camera bump, making it Samsung’s thinnest phone yet. Despite its slim profile, the smartphone will reportedly offer a 6.7 to 6.8-inch display.  Cameras The Galaxy S25 and S25+ are believed to share a triple-camera setup:  
- 50-megapixel primary sensor  
- 10-megapixel telephoto lens (3x zoom)  
- 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera   The Ultra model features a quad-camera setup, including a 200-megapixel main sensor, a 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with 3.5x optical zoom. Selfies across the series will be handled by a 12-megapixel front camera.   Performance and battery All models are believed to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. This was also hinted at in a tweet posted by Snapdragon, which was a reply to Samsung’s announcement of the Galaxy Unpacked event. The post read: “See you there”.
 


 The Galaxy S25 phones are also expected to be paired with up to 12GB RAM. The Ultra model is said to feature a 5,000mAh battery with up to 31 hours of video playback. The S25+ will likely retain its predecessor’s 4,900mAh capacity. AI-driven features The Galaxy S25 series will debut Gemini AI, Google’s rebranded assistant. The new “Hey Gemini” wake word replaces “Hey Google,” and Gemini will integrate with Samsung apps like Notes and YouTube. Additionally, AI features such as “Brief” deliver daily summaries, commute assistance, and photo collages for end-of-day highlights.  Samsung Galaxy S25 series: Pre-reservation   Ahead of the launch event on January 22, pre-reservations for the Galaxy S25 series in India are open. You can pre-order a Galaxy S25 device for Rs 1,999, which will not exactly reserve a phone for you –– you can’t even pick and reserve a particular model right now –– but it will provide early access and benefits valued up to Rs 5,000 to customers who reserve the device right now. The payment is fully refundable in case of cancellation. Customers who pre-order through Samsung’s website can select exclusive colour options, customise RAM and storage configurations, and enjoy premium trade-in offers for their existing devices.

Here's everything you need to know about the upcoming high-end smartphone.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-leaks-design-battery-display-and-everything-else-to-know-2666192-2025-01-17,"Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is rumoured to get a new addition this year, with the company set to release the Galaxy S25 Slim alongside the usual S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. The S25 Slim, as its name suggests, promises to be the thinnest model in the series, and recent leaks are offering a closer look at what to expect. The Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to be remarkably thin. A recent leak suggests the phone will measure just 6.4mm in thickness. For comparison, the Galaxy S24+ is slightly thicker at 7.7mm. This should make the new model an appealing choice for those who prefer a sleeker, more compact design without sacrificing too much on performance. However, that slim profile may come with trade-offs, particularly when it comes to battery life and heat management. The Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to feature a 6.7-inch to 6.8-inch display, placing it in the same size range as the Galaxy S25+ model. The slim design, however, may impact the overall battery capacity, which is expected to be between 3,000 mAh and 4,000 mAh. This is disappointing for a flagship, especially considering that mid-range Chinese phones such as the Poco X7 Pro already have a 6,550mAh silicon carbon battery under the hood. Samsung and Apple have yet to adopt the new silicon carbon technology to boost battery density, and it’s likely the S25 Slim will struggle to keep up in this area.

 On the performance front, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to pack Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, paired with 12GB of RAM. It will run Android 15 with One UI 7 from day one. Early benchmark results from a prototype show a single-core score of 3,005 and a multi-core score of 6,945. While these scores may seem low, it’s important to remember that prototypes often deliver lower results. The slim design of the phone could be playing a role here, possibly affecting the device’s heat dissipation capabilities, which could impact performance. The Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to feature a triple-camera setup, including a 200-megapixel primary camera, a 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with 3.5x optical zoom. This camera array is likely to compete with other flagship phones in terms of photography and video quality, despite the S25 Slim’s more compact form.

 While the design and specs are certainly exciting, some questions remain regarding whether the trade-offs for the slimness will be worth it. With battery life likely to be a concern, and the phone’s performance potentially hindered by its thin frame, it will be interesting to see how the Galaxy S25 Slim holds up once it launches later in 2025. Samsung is expected to reveal more about the S25 Slim during its Unpacked event on January 22. Rumours suggest the phone itself won’t hit the market until later in the year.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

According to a report, the IT giant is resuming its salary revision process after previous delays.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/infosys-is-said-to-offer-6-8-per-cent-salary-hike-to-employees-2666189-2025-01-17,"Infosys is reportedly gearing up to offer a salary hike of 6-8 per cent to its employees, with the increments set to be rolled out in two phases, starting from January 1, 2025, and April 1, 2025. According to a report from CNBC, the IT giant is resuming its salary revision process after previous delays. Jayesh Sanghrajka, the Chief Financial Officer of Infosys, indicated that these salary hikes are likely to impact the company’s margins in the last quarter of FY25 and the first quarter of FY26. The raises are tied to the performance appraisal cycle, which covered the period from September 2022 to October 2023.  Eligible employees received their performance ratings in December 2023, though the increments, which usually take effect from July, were delayed last year. The previous round of salary revisions was implemented in November 2023. It is worth noting that this isn’t the first time Infosys has adjusted its salary hike timelines. In FY22, Infosys had put a hold on salary hikes to conserve cash, but it resumed its appraisal process in October 2023. Employees received their salary revision letters by December 2023, restoring the company’s standard review and compensation procedure. Meanwhile, the Bengaluru-based company saw its workforce grow, with a net addition of 5,591 employees during the October-December 2024 quarter, raising its total headcount to 323,379 by the end of September 2024. Infosys also recorded a net profit of Rs 6,806 crore for the December quarter of FY25, reflecting a 4.6 per cent increase, showing resilience despite industry challenges. Besides, it was recently reported that Infosys plans to hire more than 20,000 freshers in FY26, as the company is trying to fulfill demand and a revival in discretionary spending across industries, according to Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka. Speaking on January 16, Sanghrajka mentioned that the company is on track to meet its target of recruiting around 15,000 freshers by the end of FY25. This hiring strategy contrasts with HCLTech, a major competitor, which recently cut its fresher hiring goal from 10,000 to 7,000 due to efforts to boost efficiency through measures like Project Ascend.  Infosys recently added 5,591 employees in the third quarter ending December 31, marking the second quarter in a row of positive headcount growth.  ""We have had strong hiring in Q3, with expansion of over 5,000 employees. We see (hiring) based on some our discretionary (spending), this will continue. But this will have seasonality as we see in our revenue,"" Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys said.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 17, 2025

The fraudsters reached out to him through WhatsApp messages and promised him tips to make big profits in trading. However as soon as the victim fell for their lucrative promises, the scammers made him invest large sums, which the victim was never able to recover. According to the case reported by The Times of India, the victim, who was already an experienced trader, was first contacted by the fraudsters on WhatsApp in December last year. The fraudsters shared detailed information and tips about online trading and emphasized on how they can offer him better opportunities to earn significant profits. Impressed by their tips and information, the victim decided to explore the offer further. As the victim followed the instructions of the scammers, he was directed to invest a small amount in the scheme, through which he received timely returns. These initial returns made the victim think the opportunity was real, and he went ahead, trusting the scammers. As the victim showed more interest, he was then instructed by the scammers to download a mobile application that allowed him to track his investments and view the profits earned. The app’s seamless interface and the continuous display of increasing profits further motivated the victim to increase his investments. According to the report, over a period, the victim made 12 transactions, investing various amounts up until January 10 of this year. However, when the victim tried to withdraw his investments and profits displayed on the app, the fraudsters cited ""technical issues"" and urged him to invest more to unlock his earnings. The victim followed the instructions. However, his suspicions arose when his repeated withdrawal attempts failed, and the victim finally realized he had been duped. He lodged a complaint with the city cyber police, who revealed that the funds had been transferred to seven different bank accounts. A case was registered against eight unidentified persons, including the one who initially contacted the victim on WhatsApp. Notably, this is not the first case where we have seen scammers reaching out to individuals on WhatsApp or other platforms and offering tips on online trading. In the past few months, many individuals have lost lakhs to these scammers and their lucrative offers of earning easy money with guaranteed profits in trading. However, it is important to note that online trading never promises guaranteed profits, especially not like 500 per cent. If someone is promising returns that are too good to be true, it is likely a scam. If you get such messages, do not respond. And if you are planning to invest through any app, always download it from official channels like Google Play Store or Apple Store. Always check the legitimacy of any trading platform before investing. Look for reviews, ratings, and registrations with regulatory authorities. Additionally, be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls on WhatsApp or social media platforms. Never share personal or financial information without verification. If you suspect fraud, contact the cybercrime cell or lodge a complaint at www.cybercrime.gov.in.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Also Read |  Apple releases iOS 18.3 beta 3 for developers, includes updates in Notification Summaries, Camera Controls and moreAlso Read |  First DMs from Brad Pitt, then Rs 7 crore loss and divorce: Here is how a woman fell prey to online scamAlso Read |  Dreame AirStyle review: Smart hair-styler that is high on features and low on price

But, what exactly is the Everything app? Here is everything you need to know. What is Elon Musk's Everything app? The ""Everything app"" is at the core of Musk’s plans to revolutionise X into a one-stop solution for all users' needs. Confused? Well, Musk wants to create the X app similar to China’s WeChat. This app will integrate a wide range of services, including payments, messaging, streaming, and e-commerce, making it a multi-purpose tool for users.  During an internal meeting in October 2023, Musk explained that X is being rapidly transformed from ""Twitter 1.0"" into a platform that will include a variety of services. This shift aims to make X more than just a social network, providing a solution where users can access multiple services through a single app. Additionally, X CEO Linda Yaccarino recently announced that financial services and streaming options, under X Money and X TV, will be introduced in 2025. Additionally, improvements to X's AI chatbot Grok are also planned, adding further functionality to the platform.Job offer and requirements for software engineers In a unique approach to hiring, Musk has called for software engineers who are passionate about coding, regardless of their educational background or previous employers. In his post, Musk asserted that traditional qualifications are not needed and asked interested candidates to send their best coding work directly to X.  ""If you’re a hardcore software engineer and want to build the everything app, please join us by sending your best work to code@x.com,"" Musk wrote. He added that it doesn't matter where candidates went to school or worked previously, as long as they have the coding skills and dedication required for the job. This hiring philosophy aligns with Musk’s views on education, where he has advocated for a problem-solving-based system over the current model that relies heavily on memorisation and standardised tests. He has consistently promoted skill-based learning, prioritising real-world coding ability over traditional degrees.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 17, 2025

As noted in our review of the phone, the OnePlus 13 is a solid flagship smartphone for smart buyers as it brings a compelling package of top hardware and a good price. With this phone, the brand aims to uphold its legacy of delivering a smooth user experience and polished software along with raw performance. But who should actually buy it? OnePlus 13: Who should buy it? The OnePlus 13 is available in three RAM and storage variants — 12GB + 256GB, 16GB + 512GB, and 24GB + 1TB, priced at Rs 69,999, Rs 76,999, and Rs 89,999 respectively. ICICI Bank card users can get an instant bank discount of Rs 5,000, bringing the prices down to Rs 64,999, Rs 71,999, and Rs 84,999 respectively. Additionally, there are exchange offers available of up to Rs 39,500, which can further reduce the effective price. If you are coming from a year-old device, such as the OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24, or iPhone 15, we suggest using your current phone for at least another year, as these devices still have good mileage. These last-generation flagships can hold their own, even in 2025. However, if you are coming from a two-year-old or older smartphone, you will notice significant gains in user experience by upgrading to the OnePlus 13. Now, let’s assume you are in the market for a brand-new smartphone that should be an Android flagship device, and your budget is around Rs 80,000, plus or minus. If you don’t plan to exchange an old phone, simply go ahead and purchase the OnePlus 13. It won’t disappoint. To learn about our experience with the device, you can read our full review. If you wish to exchange an old smartphone for the OnePlus 13, things get interesting. For instance, if you exchange the base 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant of the OnePlus 11 in good condition, you can get up to Rs 20,000 off, bringing the effective prices of the OnePlus 13 down to Rs 44,999, Rs 51,999, and Rs 64,999 for the 12GB, 16GB, and 24GB RAM variants respectively. Similarly, if you have the base 8GB RAM + 128GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy S22+, the exchange offer goes up to Rs 22,400, reducing the effective prices of the OnePlus 13 to Rs 42,599, Rs 49,599, and Rs 62,599 for the respective RAM variants. For those switching from iOS to Android, the exchange value can be even better. For example, exchanging an iPhone 14 can yield up to Rs 32,300, bringing the effective prices of the OnePlus 13 to Rs 32,699, Rs 39,699, and Rs 52,699 for the 12GB, 16GB, and 24GB RAM variants respectively. This makes the OnePlus 13 the most affordable Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered phone. Even the top-end 24GB RAM variant is priced lower than the base variant of the iQOO 13. Once again, please note — the exact exchange value depends on the condition and market value of your current device. To check your device’s eligibility, the best way is to simply head over to Amazon, as it provides a no-frills experience, select your desired OnePlus 13 variant, and explore the exchange offer for your device to see the estimated value.  The OnePlus 13 is a top-tier Android flagship that delivers speed, fluidity, and performance, courtesy of OxygenOS 15 and the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. Its 6,000mAh battery offers solid endurance, while the 120Hz AMOLED display, now flat, is bright and vibrant, featuring Aqua Touch technology and Glove mode. Additionally, the type-C port and optical fingerprint sensor from the OnePlus 12 have been upgraded to a USB type-C 3.2 port and an ultrasonic fingerprint reader.

The iPhone 17 series, anticipated to arrive in fall 2025, is rumored to bring several much-awaited upgrades, including a higher refresh rate across the lineup, improved cameras, the A19 chipset, and more. However, more than the hardware, the buzz around a new iPhone model is drawing significant attention.

Historically, we have seen Apple making trade-offs in its Air models to prioritise a lightweight, slim profile. So the iPhone 17 Air will likely follow the same line.  Let's take a detailed look at everything we know so far about the iPhone 17 Air, expected to debut alongside the iPhone 17 series.iPhone 17 design expectations The rumoured iPhone 17 Air is expected to be just 5.5mm thick at its slimmest point, potentially making it the thinnest iPhone ever—surpassing even the iPhone 6’s 6.9mm frame. To achieve this sleek design, Apple may use a titanium-aluminum alloy, combining lightweight durability with a premium finish.iPhone 17 display expectations The iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to feature a 6.6-inch OLED display, placing it between the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max in size. This display is expected to include Apple’s ProMotion technology, offering higher refresh rates of up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling and responsiveness. In fact, even the standard iPhone 17 is rumoured to adopt ProMotion, allowing Apple to introduce high-refresh-rate screens across the lineup. Additionally, the iPhone 17 Air is likely to include Face ID, Dynamic Island, and an anti-reflective coating for improved visibility and durability.iPhone 17 performance rumours The iPhone 17 Air is likely to be powered by the A19 chip, built on an enhanced 3nm process. While it may not match the A19 Pro chip slated for the Pro models, it’s expected to deliver significant improvements in speed and efficiency compared to the current A18 chip. The device is also rumoured to feature 8GB of RAM, ensuring smooth multitasking and support for Apple Intelligence features. Another significant update is Apple’s in-house 5G modem, marking a shift from third-party solutions. Apple is rumoured to debut this modem with the iPhone SE4, and subsequently in all the upcoming new generation of  devices, including the iPhone 17 Air, are expected to adopt it.iPhone 17 Air camera expectations In line with its minimalist design, the iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a notable downgrade from the multi-camera setups on other iPhone models. The front will likely house a 24-megapixel camera with a six-element lens. To maintain its slim profile, the device may include only a single earpiece speaker, removing the bottom speaker for a cleaner aesthetic.iPhone 17 Air and eSIM adoption Apple is also expected to double down on its eSIM strategy, with the iPhone 17 Air potentially eliminating the physical SIM card slot entirely. This change could help free up internal space, contributing to the model’s slim design.iPhone 17 Air battery expectations A smaller chassis naturally limits battery capacity, and the iPhone 17 Air will be no exception. While exact battery specifications are unknown, it’s expected to have a smaller capacity than other iPhone 17 models. Apple is likely to rely on the efficient A19 chip and LTPO display technology to optimise battery life.iPhone 17 Air pricing expectations The price of the iPhone 17 Air remains a topic of speculation. Some rumours suggest it could be positioned as a high-end device, priced above the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Others believe it will occupy a mid-tier spot, with Apple limiting certain hardware to keep the device sleek and lightweight.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Also Read |  Kerala man loses Rs 71 lakh after downloading an app to invest money in online tradingAlso Read |  Apple releases iOS 18.3 beta 3 for developers, includes updates in Notification Summaries, Camera Controls and moreAlso Read |  First DMs from Brad Pitt, then Rs 7 crore loss and divorce: Here is how a woman fell prey to online scam

ce0ca89b-d5c9-4b99-9f0f-00f1f9cb5eae,"Samsung teases true AI companion: Could this be the return of Bixby?Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked 2025 is around the corner, with teasers hinting at AI upgrades. The event might also see the return of an improved Bixby assistant, promising smarter smartphone interactions.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-teases-true-ai-companion-could-this-be-the-return-of-bixby-2666307-2025-01-17,"Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event, set for January 22, 2025, is right around the corner, with the company sharing numerous teasers on social media hinting at major new features. The South Korean tech giant appears ready to showcase advancements that could transform how users interact with their smartphones. This time, the spotlight is on the potential return of the familiar Bixby voice assistant, which may take on a far more advanced role in the Galaxy S25 series. For those who may not remember, Bixby has been Samsung’s native voice assistant since 2017. It initially debuted with the launch of the Galaxy S8 series. However, it didn’t make much of a splash compared to competitors like Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa. Over the years, the assistant seemed to fall behind, and Samsung eventually stepped back from promoting it. But it appears the company isn’t ready to give up on Bixby just yet.  A recent teaser video for the Galaxy Unpacked event shows a lady asking a virtual assistant to find a pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating, then book a reservation and share the details with a friend. This type of seamless interaction is a far cry from the Bixby we’re used to, which has always struggled with complex requests. Interestingly, Samsung has already been testing an upgraded version of Bixby in China on the Galaxy W25 and W25 Flip. Powered by a large language model (LLM), similar to Gemini and ChatGPT, the new Bixby is capable of understanding more nuanced commands, responding in context, and even providing results in text and video formats. It can translate web pages, and even work with Microsoft Office files like Word and PowerPoint. In terms of design, the upgraded Bixby now offers a cleaner, modern interface with the ability to multitask, allowing users to pull up Bixby on top of other apps for quick interactions. While these enhancements have been available to Chinese users for a while, the Galaxy Unpacked event will likely mark the global launch of this upgraded Bixby. If it comes to the Galaxy S25, it could make a real difference in how people use their phones. Unlike the previous, more basic version of Bixby, this new iteration should be able to handle complex commands that combine several tasks at once. For example, asking it to find a restaurant, make a reservation, and send the details to someone — all in one go — was previously out of reach for the assistant. The new Bixby will also reportedly have on-screen awareness, which means users can ask it about things currently displayed on their phone. This is particularly exciting because it’s not just the latest Samsung devices that will benefit. Since the AI upgrade doesn’t require the latest hardware of the Galaxy S25 series, existing Samsung smartphones could get the update as well, bringing the new features to a wider audience. Whether this updated Bixby can compete with Gemini and Siri, remains to be seen, but it’s clear that Samsung is definitely up to something here. We’ll find it soon.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

d5a3290d-588f-49e9-849c-4ecaddd40a52,Black Panther 2.0: Meet the robotic dog that can sprint past human athletes Black Panther 2 has been developed by Zhejiang University and a startup called Mirror me. It is just a prototype right now and it can already sprint up to 100 meters in under 10 seconds.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/black-panther-20-meet-the-robotic-dog-that-can-sprint-past-human-athletes-2666302-2025-01-17,"A Chinese team has unleashed a speed demon in the form of a robotic dog, Black Panther 2.0, which has sprinted into the elite ""10-second club"" of the 100-meter dash. Developed by Zhejiang University and the Hangzhou-based startup Mirror Me, this 38-kg, 0.63-meter tall quadruped robot is redefining what machines can achieve. With a peak stride frequency of five strides per second, it has clocked a 100-meter sprint in under 10 seconds, outpacing even many human sprinters.   This feat places Black Panther 2.0 leagues ahead of its predecessor, the Hound robot from Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, which completed the same dash in 19.87 seconds. While it’s still no match for the fastest land animals like cheetahs or ostriches, this robotic marvel is closing the gap between biological and machine mobility.   Inspired by nature, Black Panther 2.0 features a biomimetic design that borrows heavily from the animal kingdom. Its carbon-fibre shins, modelled after the jerboa desert rodent, offer 135 per cent more stiffness with only a 16 per cent weight increase, while spring-loaded knee joints act as shock absorbers, mimicking the flexibility of black panthers. Even its ""running shoes,"" inspired by cheetahs' claws, enhance grip performance by an impressive 200 per cent.

— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) January 15, 2025 Powered by AI-driven gait optimisation, advanced high-power-density motor drivers, and real-time adjustments, Black Panther 2.0 moves with unprecedented precision and fluidity. According to Jin Yongbin, a researcher from the institute, the robot uses the Huygens’ coupled pendulum principle for synchronised gait movements, a breakthrough enabling it to move with the coordination of a seasoned sprinter.   The robotic dog is no slouch when unloaded, reaching a top speed of 12.43 mph, a pace that would give some professional athletes a run for their money. However, even at its peak, Black Panther 2.0 falls just short of the legendary Usain Bolt, who still holds the world record for the 100-meter sprint at 9.58 seconds — a record unchallenged since 2009. Despite this, the robotic sprinter represents a significant step forward in robotics, with potential applications ranging from industrial tasks to disaster response. As Wang Hongtao, the chief of the institute, explains, this project came together in just three months, showcasing the rapid strides being made in integrating cutting-edge hardware with advanced software.   With future developments in sight, the team aims to bridge the gap between robotic and natural mobility further — maybe one day, Black Panther 2.0 will not only rival Usain Bolt but also outrun the fastest animals on Earth.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Also read |  What is the Everything app for which Elon Musk is looking to hire software engineersAlso read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Kerala man loses Rs 71 lakh after downloading an app to invest money in online trading

According to a recent report, this phone is a rebranded version of the Vivo S20. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/vivo-v50-ncc-certification-reveals-key-specs-including-display-charging-and-more-2666287-2025-01-17,"After launching the Vivo V40 in August 2024, the company is rumoured to be working on its successor -- the Vivo V50.

Instagram and YouTube hope to scoop TikTok users, tell employees to standbyIt is possible TikTok may become inaccessible to American users this Sunday because of a tussle between the US government and TikTok. Now, tech giants like Instagram and YouTube are hoping to scoop these users if the app stops working in the US. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/tiktok-ban-in-us-instagram-and-youtube-hope-to-scoop-tiktok-users-tell-employees-to-standby-2666401-2025-01-17,"There is a possibility that TikTok may become inaccessible in the US this Sunday, similar to how it happened in India in 2020, because of a tussle between the US government and the Chinese company. There are reports that the US government asked TikTok to either sell itself to a US-based entity or risk a ban. TikTok, meanwhile, seems to have decided that it would rather cut off access to the US users instead of choosing a poison pill. And the day cut-off is likely to be the coming Sunday.  However, as the end-game for TikTok comes closer, other tech giants like Instagram and YouTube are hoping to scoop the users who are currently on TikTok and offer them similar service — the short video platform. A New York Times report suggests that the US tech giants have already aligned employees to swing into action as soon as TikTok stops working in the US. These employees have been told to be on standby. The idea seems to be similar to what happened in India in 2020. When India banned the Chinese social media app TikTok in 2020 over security concerns, all TikTok users were left with no choice but to look for alternatives. At that time, apps like Instagram and YouTube grabbed the opportunity, offering features like Reels and Shorts, mimicking the short video format TikTok users were familiar with.

When the ban on TikTok in India was enforced, the app had around 200 million users here. After the ban, most of these users restarted their short video journeys on Instagram and YouTube. Now, the NYT says that a similar situation is unfolding in the US. Tech giants Meta and Google, the companies behind Instagram and YouTube respectively, are refining their strategies to attract TikTok's 170 million monthly US users. Sharing insights from a recent Q&A session, the NYT notes that Meta’s Chief Marketing Officer Alex Schultz revealed the company’s active preparations to capitalise on TikTok’s uncertain future. According to employees present at the meeting, Meta is not only monitoring the fate of TikTok but has also allocated resources to prepare for an influx of TikTok creators and users. The report reveals that behind the scenes both Instagram and YouTube have already deployed their employees and have asked them to get ready to handle the potential migration of TikTok users. Additionally Meta has also asked its employees to modify Instagram features to better accommodate TikTok creators and explore ways to help them transition their existing content to the platform. Meanwhile, YouTube is also reportedly making a push to appeal to TikTok creators through its Shorts feature. The platform recently increased the maximum length of shorts videos from one minute to three, catering to creators accustomed to TikTok’s 10-minute video option. YouTube has also launched initiatives like a “boot camp” for content creators, aiming to familiarise them with the platform’s shopping features and monetisation tools. While Meta and Google have not commented publicly, their behind-the-scenes efforts clearly show that they are eagerly eyeing TikTok users in the US.  After all, when the ban on TikTok took place in India, one of the biggest beneficiaries of it turned out to be reels. Before the ban, TikTok was the de facto short video app in India, with the app hosting a vibrant community of Indian creators and users. At that time, Instagram Reels were hardly on anyone’s radar. But since then Reels have now become arguably the most used feature on Instagram, so much so that they are part of the cultural and lifestyle conversation in India nowadays. YouTube Shorts, although not as popular as Reels yet, also saw its usage increase rapidly in India after TikTok was banned here.

But, before we talk about that, let's first have a look at the deal price of the MacBook Air M3 model.advertisementMacBook Air M3 price drops, deal explainedThe 8GB RAM model of the MacBook Air M3 is listed at its lowest-ever price on Reliance Digital's online store. It seems that the platform is clearing stock of the 8GB RAM variant, as Apple has phased out this version and made 16GB the new standard for future models. Currently, you can purchase the 8GB RAM model with 256GB SSD for Rs 98,606, down from its original launch price of Rs 1,14,900, giving you a flat discount of Rs 16,294. There’s also an additional Rs 1,000 discount available when using select bank cards, including BOB and OneCard credit cards. However, this offer is only valid for the Space Grey colour variant.

For those looking to buy the 16GB RAM model, it’s priced at Rs 105,990, which is lower than its original retail price.Is it worth buying MacBook Air M3 or should you wait for M4 model? If you are currently using a MacBook Air M1, upgrading to the MacBook Air M3 would be a smart choice, as you will experience a noticeable boost in performance. However, for those using the M2 model, it might be worth waiting for the upcoming M4 model, especially if you don't urgently need a new Apple laptop and want to experience the latest tech. The M4 model is expected to have AI capabilities and offer faster speeds. Apple typically compares new devices with models from two generations ago, not their immediate predecessors. For example, Apple compared the iPhone 16 Pro with the iPhone 14 Pro in terms of performance boost. The same approach applies to MacBooks. So, if you are using a one-year-old model like the MacBook Air M2, it is better to wait for the next upgrade, such as the M4. However, for those with older devices like the M1, the latest M3 model offers enough improvements to justify upgrading. While the MacBook Air M2 is also on sale at a discounted price, the M3 model is a more attractive option, particularly for those upgrading from the M1. The M3 chip provides a big performance upgrade, making it ideal for those looking for faster speeds and more advanced features. It is worth noting that MacBooks have always been dependable as they are known for their durability, long-term stability and long battery life. And the M3 model is no different. It also offers excellent photo editing capabilities, smooth performance, a vibrant display, and a sleek, lightweight design. Additionally, it can handle basic 4K video editing and promises long-term software support. You can consider buying a MacBook Pro model if you need a machine that can handle intensive tasks, including 3D rendering, advanced 4K video editing, graphics creation and more. With close to 10-11 hours of screen-on-time, it is a great option for office workers and students who need a laptop that can last a full day without constant recharging. One of the standout features of the M3 is its support for dual external displays, which is particularly useful for multitaskers, though this feature requires the laptop's lid to be closed. Despite this, the M3 retains Apple's iconic lightweight and portable design, making it easy to carry without compromising on performance. For those unaware, the MacBook Air M3 also comes with support for up to 24GB of RAM and Wi-Fi 6E, so that it remains relevant and functional for years to come. With smooth performance and reliable software support for at least six years, the MacBook Air M3 is a solid investment for those looking for a laptop that will last long-term.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 17, 2025

Moving on, the Galaxy S25+ is rumoured to begin at Rs 1,04,999 for its base 12GB RAM + 256GB storage model, up from the Galaxy S24+'s Rs 99,999 starting price. The higher storage option of 12GB RAM + 512GB storage could cost buyers Rs 1,14,999, according to the leak. As for the top-of-the-line, Galaxy S25 Ultra, the leaked pricing may come as a shock. The base variant with 12GB RAM + 256GB storage could be priced at Rs 1,34,999, compared to last year’s Galaxy S24 Ultra, which started at Rs 1,29,999. The 16GB RAM +512GB storage variant is expected to cost Rs 1,44,999, while the top-tier 16GB RAM + 1TB storage model might come with a mind-boggling price tag of Rs 1,64,999. The rumoured price hike could be linked to Samsung’s adoption of the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which is expected to power the Galaxy S25 series. The latest chip comes with a higher production cost, which could explain the bump in pricing. Whether this performance boost justifies the price increase remains to be seen. Samsung has already begun accepting reservations for the Galaxy S25 series in India. Customers can pre-book the smartphones through the company’s website, Samsung Exclusive Stores, and various online and offline retail outlets. As the launch date approaches, it’s clear that the Galaxy S25 series could push premium pricing to a new level. Only time will tell if the features live up to the hefty price tag.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 18, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

On its support page, the company says that it has removed TikTok as well as other apps by ByteDance from its App Store in the US. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-removes-all-apps-by-tiktok-from-us-store-says-just-following-the-law-2666976-2025-01-19,"TikTok has stopped working in the US. Deemed a security risk, the app has been lawfully barred from operating within the US. The Chinese short video platform has been in a tussle with the US government for a while and was given time to either sell the platform to a US-based firm or face a ban. While the permanent ban is yet to take place, Google and Apple have removed the app from their respective app stores.  Apple has also issued a clarification about the removal of TikTok and several other apps from ByteDance, stating that the company is following the “laws in the jurisdictions where it operates.” Clarifying the removal of TikTok and other apps from the App Store, Apple in its support page notes, “TikTok and ByteDance Ltd apps are no longer available in the United States, and visitors to the United States might have limited access to features.”  The company emphasised that the removal aligns with US law and the ""Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,"" which affects apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries. According to Apple, apps from ByteDance, including TikTok, TikTok Studio, TikTok Shop Seller Center, CapCut, Lemon8, Hypic, Lark - Team Collaboration, Lark - Rooms Display, Lark - Rooms Controller, Gauth: AI Study Companion, and MARVEL SNAP, are no longer available for users in the US on the App Store for download or updates starting January 19, 2025.  However, if users already have these apps downloaded on their iPhones, they won’t be able to redownload the apps if they are deleted or if they switch to a new iPhone, and the apps will not be restored. Additionally, some apps will not work or will have limited functionality, and any in-app purchases or new subscriptions will no longer be available for US users. For travellers visiting the US, Apple clarifies that the apps from ByteDance will be available and functional in regions where the apps are permitted. Apple says that when in the US these users won’t be able to download, update, or make in-app purchases or new subscriptions in any of ByteDance Ltd apps until they leave US boundaries. The apps will function normally once they leave the US borders.  For TikTok in particular, the app stopped working last Saturday in the US, showing a message indicating that the ban has been enacted in the country. However, the company is holding onto hope with President Trump, assuring users that it is actively in talks with him to bring a solution to restart the app once he assumes office. Now, all eyes are on Trump to see what fate his government decides for these Chinese apps. For now, Trump told NBC, “The 90-day extension is something that will most likely be done, because it's appropriate.” However, the final announcement will likely be made on Monday.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 19, 2025Also Read |  TikTok ban in US?

In just 3 months, the company might get started with the beta version of Android 16. The speculation is that Google will release the first beta version of Android 16 this month. That said, a new leak reveals launch dates for the upcoming beta version. It looks like Google will launch the second and third beta versions in February and March, respectively. While the stable version release is still under wraps, after this leak we can assume that it might launch earlier than the Android 15. advertisementAndroid 16 beta version launch dates As per the latest leak, spotted by the Android Authority, Google is ready to push out beta versions of Android 16, before it can launch a stable one. The information comes from a comment on the Android Gerrit, where a Google employee, most likely, shares tentative release dates for the Android 16 betas. According to the comment, Beta 3 is expected to be released on March 12.

  While the leak specifies that the Android 16’s first beta version is scheduled for January 22, there is no official notification so far. Similarly, the Beta 2 is expected to arrive on February 19.  More importantly, this new information suggests that Android 16 could achieve platform stability by mid-March, setting the stage for Beta 4 to arrive in April or May, with a stable release potentially before the end of Q2. While this may still be a few months off, it’s earlier than the mid-October rollout of Android 15 last year. Android 16: What to expect Android 16 made headlines a few days back for its upcoming features. The rumour has that the upcoming OS could feature revamped volume controls, a sharper UI and enhanced accessibility. A few new features that are speculated to come with the Android 16 are health records, better adaptive refresh rate, enhanced security and privacy.  A few reports have also indicated that it might also improve battery performance. However, since Google is yet to share the details, we expect you to take this information with a pinch of salt.

For context, the current thinnest foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic V3, measures 4.35mm when unfolded and 9.2mm when folded.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oneplus-open-2-design-leak-tipped-to-be-worlds-thinnest-foldable-smartphone-2667146-2025-01-20,"The OnePlus Open 2, expected to launch internationally as a rebranded Oppo Find N5, has been in the rumour mill regarding its design and features. If the recent leaks are true, the OnePlus Open 2 could become the thinnest foldable smartphone in the world — even thinner than the current record-holder for being the thinnest foldable smartphone, the Honor Magic V3. Oppo has recently announced that their new foldable smartphone, the Find N5, will be released in China in February. Based on past launches, the Find N5 will likely be marketed globally as the OnePlus Open 2. The leaked information, shared by popular leakers Digital Chat Station and Smart Pikachu, is quite exciting for fans who have long-awaited the sequel to the OnePlus Open. When it comes to the design, Oppo’s Senior Vice President Liu Zuohu has described the Find N5 as the world’s thinnest foldable. For context, the Honor Magic V3 measures 4.35mm when unfolded and 9.2mm when folded. According to leaks, the Oppo Find N5 — and by extension, the OnePlus Open 2 — could go even slimmer, reportedly measuring around 4mm in its unfolded state. The camera layout has also grabbed attention. A circular camera module is expected, positioned in the centre, much like the Oppo Find X8 Pro and the original OnePlus Open. The setup is expected to feature a periscope telephoto lens, a Hasselblad branding at the centre, and a flash in the lower right corner. Additionally, the leakers have hinted at a minimal crease on the foldable display, adding to the phone’s premium feel. Another potential upgrade is the use of a titanium frame, which would make the phone lightweight without compromising durability. With foldable phones often criticised for their fragility, this is an interesting move from OnePlus and Oppo.  On the hardware front, the OnePlus Open 2 is expected to come with a triple-lens Hasselblad camera, satellite communication support, a 6,000mAh battery, and wireless charging. At its core, it will likely be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. Rumoured colour options include black, white, and possibly additional finishes. A leaked image of the inner display shows a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera in the top right corner, maintaining a sleek and modern design. While the Chinese launch is slated for February, the international release of the OnePlus Open 2 is expected to follow soon after. It could give the phone a significant head start over competitors like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which will likely launch later in the summer.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

He also revealed that the app will feature “a dedicated tab for inspiration, another to keep track of any early ideas you might have”. The Instagram CEO also mentioned that the Edit app will use “a much higher quality camera,” though it’s unclear what he is comparing the camera quality to. Additionally, he says that the app will feature “all the editing tools you’d expect, the ability to share drafts with friends and other creators, and, if you decide to share your videos on Instagram, powerful insights on how those videos too”.

 As for availability, Mosseri has announced that the Edit app is already available to pre-order on the Apple App Store and it will be available on Google Play store for Android smartphones soon. “You can preorder the app today in the iOS App Store, and it’s coming to Android soon”, he wrote in the Threads post. Notably, the Instagram CEO has said that the Edit app will be only available some time in the month of March. “The app won’t be available to download till next month, and in the meantime we’re going to work with a handful of video creators to get their feedback and improve the experience. More to come soon”, Mosseri said. Interestingly, the announcement about the Edit app has a timing that seems deliberate. Mosseri announced the video editor just as TikTok was facing the deadline for a US ban on January 19. The Edit app also seems to have an uncanny resemblance to CapCut, an app owned by TikTok-maker ByteDance. On Sunday, all ByteDance apps were briefly removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. But this isn’t the first time Meta’s timelines have been found suspicious. Meta has tried to take advantage of the gap in the markets several times before. For instance, when TikTok was banned in India in 2020, Instagram rushed to launch Reels in the country just a month after the ban. Similarly, in 2023, Meta launched Threads, just after Twitter was purchased by Elon Musk and the platform was going through a revamp.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Also read |  TikTok ban comes into effect in US, users can no longer access video-sharing appAlso read |  Good morning, America: Why India banned TikTok 5 years backAlso read |  'Something needs to change': Musk opposes TikTok ban, wants X services in China

The news was shared by popular tipster Evan Blass, who put up an email from Pei on his X (formerly Twitter). The email reportedly revealed that 2025 would be Nothing’s biggest year yet, thanks to the launch of its new device, which is expected to showcase the company’s first steps into AI-powered technology. The two-year gap between the Nothing Phone 2 and the upcoming Phone 3 breaks from the typical annual refresh cycle followed by most smartphone brands. This extended timeline suggests big upgrades, especially with the introduction of AI-driven features. Nothing has been relatively quiet since the launch of the Phone 2 in July 2023, but Pei’s confirmation has reignited excitement for the brand.  According to earlier leaks and a video shared by Pei, the Nothing Phone 3 will be a central hub for a personalised, AI-driven experience. AI will be deeply embedded into the operating system, aka, Nothing OS — potentially reimagining how users interact with their home screens and daily tasks. One of the standout features rumoured for the Nothing Phone 3 is an Action Button, similar to the one found on iPhones. This button is expected to offer customisable shortcuts, letting users personalise their experience further. The device will also reportedly feature a 6.5-inch display.  As for the pricing, with the previous Nothing Phone 1 and Phone 2 priced at Rs 32,999 and Rs 44,999 respectively, it remains to be seen how the Phone 3 will fit into this pricing spectrum. Leaks suggest that the upcoming model could feature an upper mid-range chipset, such as the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 or MediaTek Dimensity 9200+, which might place it closer to the more affordable end of the market.  When the Nothing Phone 2 hit the market, it faced criticism over its pricing. Not because of its hardware, which was quite competitive and on par with its peers, but largely due to the perception surrounding the brand itself. At the time, Nothing was still relatively new, having launched its first phone just a year prior. The Rs 12,000 jump in price from the first-generation Phone 1 to the second-generation Phone 2 left many questioning whether the increase was justified. Granted, the Phone 2 offered premium specifications and features, but some consumers felt that the steep hike didn't align with the brand’s early-stage positioning in the market. While the Nothing Phone 3 is said to focus on accessibility, a Pro variant with better specifications, including a larger 6.7-inch display, is also expected to launch alongside, likely targeting premium buyers. That said, details around this Pro variant are scarce at this moment, and we suggest you take this information with a big pinch of salt.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

It is expected to launch by the end of this month. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-is-reportedly-going-to-unveil-ai-super-agents-with-phd-level-intelligence-later-this-month-2667224-2025-01-20,"OpenAI executives have on several occasions spoken about the next-generation AI, and often its intelligence has been compared to that of a graduate or a PhD-level human being. Earlier it was speculated that OpenAI’s GPT5 would be announced next. However, reports now suggest that the company is working on an AI super-agent, and it may release as early as January 30. There is also a new report by Axios that claims that OpenAI is meeting with the US government officials regarding the launch.  But what does it mean for an AI agent to have PhD-level intelligence? And what is an AI agent? An AI agent is a sophisticated software system that can perform complex tasks on its own, with minimal human supervision. It can make decisions on your behalf, adapt and react to different situations, analyse large amounts of data and multiple options. It is basically able to mimic human intelligence when you give it a goal-oriented task. And from what the reports suggest, the said AI super agent that OpenAI is working on will be capable of addressing complex problems with the proficiency of a doctoral graduate.  In the rumoured meeting with US government officials, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also expected to talk about the impact of AI on economic growth. This is in line with a blueprint that OpenAI had recently shared which talks about integrating artificial intelligence software systems into the US economy.  Meanwhile, Axios report also claims that with the speedy development in the AI systems, some OpenAI employees are concerned about the issues that may come with the progress in AI that the company is making. While the timeline for the launch of the AI super agent is new, this is not the first time we have heard about it. There has been speculation about an agent called the “Operator” that OpenAI may be working on. Reports suggest that the AI tool will be able to perform several tasks on a user’s behalf like writing code or booking a flight or researching a topic, or any other complex task that requires multiple actions.  The timing of the said OpenAI AI super agent or the Operator is interesting as it comes at the heels of a private blog post by the company’s CEO Sam Altman where he spoke at length about humanity stepping into the “Intelligence Age”. In another more recent post, Altman has also written about AI agents joining the workforce in 2025. “We believe that in 2025 we may see the first AI agents join the workforce and materially change the output of companies,” Altman wrote.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Also read |  After Google, OpenAI plans to launch its new tool that automates tasks in JanuaryAlso read |  Job crisis and layoffs?

The phone likely contained malware, allowing scammers to access and empty his bank account.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/bengaluru-man-loses-rs-28-crore-after-getting-free-new-phone-and-sim-from-online-scammers-2667205-2025-01-20,"A new case of cyber fraud has been reported from Bengaluru, where scammers siphoned off Rs 2.8 crore from a victim after sending him a free smartphone and a SIM card. The fraudsters reached out to the victim on the social media platform WhatsApp, where they offered him a package containing the smartphone and asked him to change his SIM card. However, as soon as the victim used the phone, the scammers managed to empty his bank account. As per the case reported by Deccan Herald, the scam began when the 60-year-old victim received a WhatsApp call from an unknown individual in November 2024. The individual introduced himself as a representative of Citibank. The caller informed the victim that the bank had issued a credit card in his name, and to use the credit card, he would need to change his phone number to one authorised by the telecom operator Airtel. The scammers further explained that they would send him a new SIM and a phone to set up for the process. Thinking it was a legitimate offer—given that banks often call users about new credit card schemes—the victim agreed to accept the card, the new phone, and the SIM card. Following his approval, on December 1, the scammers sent a Redmi mobile phone worth Rs 10,000 to the victim’s address. After the delivery of the phone, the scammers asked the victim to switch his SIM to the mobile phone they had sent. However, as soon as the victim set up the new phone and SIM card, he received a notification about an unauthorized transaction. When he checked with his bank, he was informed that Rs 2.8 crore had been debited from his account. Upon noticing the unauthorized transaction, the victim filed a complaint with the police, and a case has been registered. ""I switched my SIM card to the mobile phone they had sent on the same day. After that, I didn’t receive any notifications from my bank,” the victim reportedly informed the police. But how did this scam happen? This case is likely linked to the use of a malicious smartphone. Since the scammers sent the victim a new phone, it is suspected that the phone was pre-installed with malware. As soon as the victim set up the device, added sensitive information such as banking details, and changed his number, the scammers were able to clone his information. This enabled them to access his bank account and empty it.How to stay safe This appears to be one of the first few cases of a cyber scam involving a new trick where scammers send a targeted victim a new phone and SIM card. To stay safe, it is highly advisable not to trust any unknown caller. Bank representatives typically contact users through their registered mobile numbers and not via social messaging platforms like WhatsApp. Even when banks call, they usually inform users about new schemes but never ask for sensitive details. If you receive such calls, hang up immediately. Avoid opening any links sent via social media by unknown users. If you suspect your sensitive data has been compromised, file a report with the police and the cyber cell. Remember, scammers are constantly devising new tricks to deceive people.

ec53239d-779b-48e7-b980-3ab590a0d237,"Apple has almost cleared the inventory of iPhone SE 3, ahead of anticipated iPhone SE 4 launchApple is rumoured to launch its new iPhone SE during the Spring launch. Ahead of the anticipated launch, Apple is reportedly clearing up inventory of the 2022 launched iPhone SE3 to make way for the new gen affordable iPhone. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-has-almost-cleared-the-inventory-of-iphone-se-3-ahead-of-anticipated-iphone-se-4-launch-2667264-2025-01-20,"Apple is highly anticipated to launch its next-generation iPhone SE this year. The brand has remained silent for nearly three years since the launch of the iPhone SE3 in 2022. However, in 2025, Apple is finally expected to break the hiatus and introduce its new affordable offering. While the launch of the iPhone SE4 has been rumoured for early 2025, a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman further adds to these claims, hinting that the release is almost confirmed and closer than expected.  In his latest newsletter, Gurman reveals that Apple is clearing out the inventory of its current iPhone SE making way for the new gen model. Sharing insights from various Apple employees working in retail operations, the report highlights that U.S. stores have nearly cleared their stock of the iPhone SE3 to make way for the new iPhone SE4. Although the iPhone SE3 is still available for purchase online and is being shipped within a few days, it is becoming harder to buy the device from the  offline stores as inventory clears out. Notably, Apple has also stopped selling the 2022-launched iPhone SE in the European Union following the latest directives mandating Type-C USB ports. The current iPhone SE features the older Lightning port, which no longer aligns with the regulations. Additionally, Gurman notes that with shrinking inventory and significant upgrades expected for the iPhone SE4, Apple is likely to stop selling the iPhone SE3 even at a discount once the new model arrives.Expected specifications for iPhone SE4 According to Gurman, the upcoming iPhone SE– codenamed V59–  will be Apple’s first device to feature its in-house cellular modem chips, moving away from Qualcomm. Taking design inspiration from the iPhone 14, the device is also expected to feature a 6.1-inch OLED display, slim bezels, and Face ID. This will allow Apple to ditch the  traditional Touch ID and the home button from devices, which previously served dual purposes. Although the Dynamic Island is expected to remain exclusive to flagship models, Gurman suggests the SE4 might adopt the Action Button introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro series. Under the hood, the iPhone SE4 is rumoured to be powered by the A18 series chip, aligning with the flagship iPhone 16 series. Along with the new gen chipset, the new iPhone SE is also likely to come with up to 8GB of RAM and storage options reaching 512GB, which will further allow Apple to offer users its  Apple Intelligence features in the budget iPhone. In fact, the iPhone SE4 is said to be the most affordable iPhone to offer Apple Intelligence features. The device could also pack a 3,279mAh battery with USB-C charging, complying with EU regulations. All in all, reports suggest that the iPhone SE4 will focus on a sleeker and lighter build. The new iPhone SE is likely to arrive in Apple’s spring launch with colour options including Midnight, Starlight, and Product (RED). iPhone SE4 expected pricing in India  Pricing will be a key factor for the iPhone SE4. While the significant upgrades are expected to make the device slightly pricier than its predecessor, the iPhone SE4 is still anticipated to remain under Rs 50,000 in India. For context, Apple launched the iPhone SE3 in India at Rs 43,900 for the base 64GB storage model. The upcoming SE4 is expected to compete in a similar range, and Apple is likely to price it competitively.

5ac43f73-0894-42c5-b938-0037f0272ddc,"iOS 19 tipped to feature visionOS inspired camera interface designiOS 19 will reportedly be getting a camera UI redesign, which is expected to be showcased at the upcoming WWDC 2025 in June.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ios-19-tipped-to-feature-visionos-inspired-camera-interface-design-2667294-2025-01-20,"Apple could reportedly be planning a big update for its iPhone’s camera app in iOS 19, bringing it closer to the minimalist design seen in its visionOS operating system, used in the Apple Vision Pro. The reported camera UI redesign, which is expected to be showcased at the upcoming WWDC 2025 in June, promises a more intuitive and immersive experience for iPhone users, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. While the new look is still in development, leaks have started to surface, giving us an idea of what to expect. According to tipster Jon Prosser, the iOS 19 Camera app will be getting a complete redesign. The interface will reportedly feature translucent menus that will allow the viewfinder to take centre stage. This means users will have more space to focus on capturing photos or videos, while settings will be condensed or, you can say, features will be neatly tucked away in expandable panels. These changes are expected to mirror the interface of visionOS. Additionally, one of the key goals of iOS 19 is to make the camera interface less overwhelming. The new design will hide some of the less-used features under expandable toggles. For instance, when switching between photo and video modes, the app will display additional settings like depth control, panorama, and exposure adjustments.  When recording video, the top of the screen will showcase resolution and frame rate controls, making it easy to adjust on the fly without needing to jump into submenus. The camera app will also allow users to select different modes, such as slow motion, time-lapse, action, posture etc., from a clear and easy-to-navigate menu. This overhaul will likely make the camera app more consistent with other Apple products, including the Vision Pro, and could be a sign of further UI updates across the rest of iOS 19. Although Apple has yet to confirm these changes, these early leaks sound exciting, especially for users who are eager to see how the design elements of visionOS will be adapted for the iPhone. The transition from iOS 18, which did not feature a visionOS inspired design, could be a big leap forward in terms of user experience.  The official reveal of iOS 19 is expected to take place during Apple’s WWDC 2025 in June. A beta version will likely follow shortly after, with the full release of the update arriving in September, coinciding with the launch of the iPhone 17 series.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

240b2e7c-02b7-41a0-a853-d7474bebefb8,"Sam Altman declares AGI is just Twitter hype, says cut expectations 100xAfter much anticipation, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that AGI is not one of the themes that is coming soon on its AI-platforms. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sam-altman-declares-agi-is-just-twitter-hype-and-they-have-not-even-built-it-yet-says-cut-expectation-100x-2667333-2025-01-20,"On December 31, 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X (formerly Twitter), asking for suggestions to improve its AI platforms. After going through the comments, he deduced that one of the most common themes (suggested by the users) for improving openAI is to introduce AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Since then, rumours started churning that OpenAI is eyeing to integrate AGI into its platforms. Fuelling up these rumours, Altman also penned down a note in his blog post (titled Reflections) 2 weeks ago, stating that the company is confident about creating AGI. But now, after much anticipation, Altman has finally cleared the air, whether AGI is coming to town or not.  He posted that the company is planning to release ""cool stuff"" next month, but AGI is not a part of this regime. He also said that these rumours were only based on Twitter (now X) hype and nothing more. Since the hype was so out of control, he urged users that even though OpenAI is planning to launch interesting updates and features, they need to cut down their expectations 100 times. 
 


 But why is AGI such a distant thought for OpenAI, even though it is the next step? Artificial General Intelligence or AGI is defined as an AI system that can tackle any task just like a human would. After AGI, we get to artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is AI that exceeds the capabilities of the human mind. Right now, we are working on AI chatbots like ChatGPT that uses natural language processing to create human-like conversational dialogue. In the same blog post, he said, ""As we get closer to AGI, it feels like an important time to look at the progress of our company. There is still so much to understand, still so much we don’t know, and it’s still so early. But we know a lot more than we did when we started."" This signifies that OpenAI still has a lot to work on to achieve the AGI-level. Now, the question is: If not AGI, then what is coming for OpenAI? OpenAI to launch AI-agents soon Someone who keeps tracking the headlines would think that GPT-5 must be the next step for OpenAI. However, a few recent reports have suggested that the next flagship model is still in the pipeline, with no decided launch date. Rather, the company is seeking to be working on an AI super-agent, and it may release as early as January 30. There is also a new report by Axios that claims that OpenAI is meeting with the US government officials regarding the launch. 

Altman said in the blog, ""We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes.""  This AI agent is a sophisticated software system that can perform complex tasks on its own, with minimal human supervision. It can make decisions on your behalf, adapt and react to different situations, analyse large amounts of data and multiple options. It is basically able to mimic human intelligence when you give it a goal-oriented task. And from what the reports suggest, it said AI super agent that OpenAI is working on will be capable of addressing complex problems with the proficiency of a doctoral graduate. Read more about the upcoming OpenAI AI-agent here.  Hence, we can say that this AI-agent is a step closer to AGI. With this speed, we can also deduce that AGI is also not that far from becoming a reality.

Here are 8 things that you should know based on the leaks so far.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-india-launch-in-2-days-8-things-to-know-2667306-2025-01-20,"The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will finally arrive in India in two days as the launch event is set for January 22. The company is likely to announce three models in its 2025 flagship series - standard, Plus and Ultra. There have been rumours of a new Slim model as well, but it is reportedly to debut after a few months. Out of the three models, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is tipped to receive maximum upgrades in comparison to its predecessor. If you are planning to buy the upcoming Ultra version, here are 8 things that you should know based on the leaks so far.advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra India launch in 2 days: 8 things to knowAny design changes?The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will continue to offer a phablet-style design. The leaks suggest that the new phone will have 2-3 major design changes. One is that the bezels around the screen will be more slim and the second one is that we could see rounded corners in the latest model. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is also said to have a slimmer profile (8.2mm) compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra and it should also feel lighter (219g), according to the leaks. Also, it might retain the IP68 rating. It is currently unknown whether Samsung will also add IP69 water-resistant support for better protection against water.Display upgrades?Another point to note here is that the Ultra's display won't receive a lot of upgrades, according to leaks. The new model will feature a slightly bigger screen - 6.9-inch instead of the 6.8-inch panel seen on the previous version. The rest of the display specs might remain the same. That means, you could see a QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with an adaptive refresh rate of 1Hz to 120Hz. Old leaks have suggested that Samsung could offer higher brightness levels (3,000nits), but recent reports claim that it will be the same as S24 Ultra (2,600nits). New chipset, cooling system? The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will continue to offer a phablet-style design. The leaks suggest that the new phone will have 2-3 major design changes. One is that the bezels around the screen will be more slim and the second one is that we could see rounded corners in the latest model. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is also said to have a slimmer profile (8.2mm) compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra and it should also feel lighter (219g), according to the leaks. Also, it might retain the IP68 rating. It is currently unknown whether Samsung will also add IP69 water-resistant support for better protection against water.Display upgrades? Another point to note here is that the Ultra's display won't receive a lot of upgrades, according to leaks. The new model will feature a slightly bigger screen - 6.9-inch instead of the 6.8-inch panel seen on the previous version. The rest of the display specs might remain the same. That means, you could see a QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with an adaptive refresh rate of 1Hz to 120Hz. Old leaks have suggested that Samsung could offer higher brightness levels (3,000nits), but recent reports claim that it will be the same as S24 Ultra (2,600nits). New chipset, cooling system? As per the leaks, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will use Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. While we have already seen this chipset's prowess, it will be interesting to see how well Samsung is able to deliver in terms of performance because every phone is optimised differently. Qualcomm has asserted that its latest chipset can deliver better performance compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 while also consuming less battery life. The chipmaker has claimed that the Oryon CPU on the Snapdragon 8 Elite can offer 44 per cent improvement in power efficiency and one will also notice a 40 per cent improvement in GPU. Additionally, the Ultra model is said to offer a 42 per cent better cooling mechanism than its predecessor and the device is rumoured to use a vapour chamber system for better thermal management.Bigger battery? If we go by the recent leaks, the S25 Ultra will offer the same battery as its predecessor. So, you might see the same 5,000mAh unit under the hood. While it would have been great to see some upgrades in this area, the new flagship chipset is efficient and should offer longer battery life compared to the previous version. Charging The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is said to come with faster wireless charging support, that is you might see 25W power support instead of 15W available on the previous version. 25W is still quite low because OnePlus is giving 50W support and the power users will likely require faster charging speeds, but this is still better than having 15W. As for wired charging, the company might retain the 45W power support on the new model as well.Camera We could see big upgrades in the camera department if leaks are to be believed. The S25 Ultra is said to feature a new 50-megapixel Ultrawide camera, but the same old 200-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel periscope telephoto lens and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera. While the setup looks good on paper, it is also similar to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. There are chances that Samsung could use different camera sensors for a better imaging experience, something which we will only know about when the Samsung Galaxy S25 series goes official on January 22.New AI features Samsung is reportedly bringing several AI features with the Galaxy S25 series to improve user experience. AI might help prioritise important conversations and push their notifications to the top of the list. AI could also summarise messages directly in notifications. It is being said that notifications from the same source will be grouped automatically by AI. Additionally, Samsung is introducing a smarter Bixby assistant with advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. We could also see AI summarising YouTube videos and giving the option to save them in Samsung Notes. The Galaxy AI could also suggest apps, music, or directions based on your routine, like when you're driving. Other features could also be introduced, but the details regarding the same are currently scarce.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra to receive a price hike? The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra was launched in India at Rs 1,29,999 and the new version isn't expected to receive a price hike. The price of the Ultra model is already quite high and if the company wants to remain competitive in the market, it would be wise to offer it at the price of its predecessor. Apple also didn't increase the price of its Max model and instead offered it at a slightly lower price. Moreover, Apple's iPhone Pro models are being sold with massive discount offers for a few weeks now. So, if Samsung wants to have an edge over Apple, it should keep the prices aggressive while also offering a solid performance to users, a strategy which has worked wonders for brands like OnePlus.  Now, there are leaks claiming that Samsung is considering increasing the price of its Samsung Galaxy S25 series by a few thousand rupees in several markets, which also means that the brand could also introduce some bank offers at the launch to offer the new models at the price of Galaxy S24 series. But, nothing is confirmed. You can stay tuned to India Today Tech for all the updates.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 20, 2025

In just 24 hours, TikTok and other apps owned by Chinese company ByteDance, were banned and unbanned in the country. And in between that time, the new US President Donald Trump was involved, there was talk about selling 50 per cent ownership of TikTok in the US, Elon Musk suggesting “something needs to change”, and more. There are also questions about why the app was being banned in the first place, and why was it suddenly unbanned? If you are looking for a quick lowdown on everything that has happened around the TikTok ban in the US, you have landed at the right place. Here is a 5-point explainer on everything that you need to know about the TikTok drama. advertisementWhy was TikTok being banned in the US?For a few weeks, TikTok was facing a deadline for January 19 for a ban in the US. The threat of ban was over national security concerns that were tied to its parent company ByteDance. The US government claims that the TikTok parent company has tied with the Chinese government and it fears that its apps could be collecting data from American users like their location, phone records, messages, etc.This has been a longstanding issue. Authorities in the US were also pushing ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations, however, the company decided on shutting down its operations in the US entirely, unless the US Supreme Court overturned the ban. The ban didn’t lift, so TikTok was shut down in the US on Sunday morning. For a few weeks, TikTok was facing a deadline for January 19 for a ban in the US. The threat of ban was over national security concerns that were tied to its parent company ByteDance. The US government claims that the TikTok parent company has tied with the Chinese government and it fears that its apps could be collecting data from American users like their location, phone records, messages, etc. This has been a longstanding issue. Authorities in the US were also pushing ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations, however, the company decided on shutting down its operations in the US entirely, unless the US Supreme Court overturned the ban. The ban didn’t lift, so TikTok was shut down in the US on Sunday morning. The US Supreme Court, last week, passed a ruling which upheld the law signed by US President Joe Biden in April, to ban TikTok in the country. How was Donald Trump involved in this?  Interestingly, the timing of TikTok’s ban in the US coincided with the transition to a new administration in the country. The Biden White House passed enforcement responsibility to President-elect Donald Trump on January 20. During his victory rally, Trump announced that he will ""save"" TikTok. On Monday, Donald Trump said he is putting out an executive order to delay the enforcement of the TikTok ban. Soon after, TikTok was again made available on app stores in the US. TikTok had also put up a post thanking Trump for “providing the necessary clarity and assurance” after the company got a green flag for reviving the app in the country.Why does TikTok need to sell 50 per cent of its ownership to the US? However, Trump also said that he would only “approve” TikTok in the country on the condition that the US owns 50 per cent of the app. He said this was necessary to save jobs in the US and ensure that the US does not give its business to China. What did Elon Musk say about the TikTok ban? In this mix of drama, Elon Musk is right at the centre. Musk says he does not support the ban. However, he did slip in that his support is despite the fact that China has banned X in the country. He says that is “unbalanced”, and that “something needs to change.” “I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change,” he wrote in a post on X.
 


 While there has not been any confirmation around this, the speculation is that Elon Musk may be in line to buy the 50 per cent stake in TikTok. His suggestion about change and there being a lack of balance could also be seen as a hint at the same.Why was the TikTok ban lifted in the US? Within 24 hours of a ban being imposed on TikTok, it was lifted. Why? Because Donald Trump said that “we have to save it”. During his victory rally on Sunday, Trump passed an executive to delay the ban. However, he did it on the condition that ByteDance would sell 50 per cent of TikTok’s ownership to the US. 
Despite being temporarily saved from a ban in the country, TikTok’s future is still uncertain. As the Trump administration is taking over, the focus will be on ByteDance  finding a balance between addressing the US government’s security concerns and Trump’s expectations about 50 per cent ownership of the app in the US. Whether the platform will be sold, banned, or face new regulations is yet to be seen.

He also stressed that the ban on X (formerly Twitter) in China creates an ""unbalanced"" scenario, given that TikTok operates freely in the US while X is restricted in China. -Musk reiterated his long-standing opposition to banning TikTok, even though it could potentially benefit X. He asserted that such actions contradict the principles of free expression that America stands for. -The US Supreme Court recently upheld a federal law banning TikTok unless it is sold by its China-based parent company. The court cited national security risks posed by TikTok's ties to China as a valid concern, outweighing free speech arguments. -Ahead of his inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump had told NBC News that he is considering giving a 90-day extension to TikTok to let the company finalise a deal. This reprieve could allow the app to continue operating under certain conditions. -Additionally, speculation has arisen that Elon Musk may be a potential buyer for TikTok’s US operations. Some reports suggest that China is exploring options for Musk's X platform to take control of TikTok's American business, although TikTok has strongly denied these rumours.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 20, 2025

While there is no official word out yet, the rumours and leaks have painted a good enough picture of the upcoming iPhone 17 phones. Based on the rumours, Apple is focusing on revamping the series over its predecessor. This includes bringing a new entry -- the iPhone 17 Air. A recent leak has now added another bullet point to the list of what is new in the rumoured iPhone 17 series. This leak indicates that the upcoming series might feature a vapour cooling chamber and do away with the heat sinks.  Apple has been using heat sinks for a long period of time, whereas Android phones were the OGs using vapour cooling champers. Now, iPhones will also be a part of this gang soon, as reported by the GSMArena. Previously, it had been rumoured that only the iPhone 17 Pro Max would get a VC cooling system. However, the latest leak claims all models of the iPhone 17 series are up for this change. That being said, it will be interesting to see how the iPhone 17 Air will fit the VC system at just 6mm thickness.  For context, vapour chambers are enclosed metal components containing a small amount of liquid, typically de-ionized water. When the chipset generates heat, the liquid evaporates, turning into vapour that spreads across the chamber's surface. This process helps distribute heat efficiently, cooling the device effectively. The VC cooling system is not the only upgrade coming to all the models. The non-Pro iPhone 17 variants are also rumoured to finally get high-refresh-rate screens. It remains to be seen whether those panels will be 90Hz or 120Hz.iPhone 17 series: What to expect The latest rumours suggest that the iPhone 17 series will bring a significant redesign across the entire lineup. While the iPhone 16 attempted a similar update for the base and Plus models, the iPhone 17 series is expected to feature a camera bump reminiscent of Google Pixel devices. Overall, it looks like Apple is trying to break the narrative of bringing same design and pattern every year.  Additionally, the lineup is rumoured to introduce a new anti-reflective display, said to be more scratch-resistant than the current Ceramic Shield. Apple is reportedly working on a ""super-hard anti-reflective layer"" to enhance durability and better withstand daily wear and tear.   The higher-end iPhone 17 models are expected to come equipped with 12GB of RAM, while the standard model may feature 8GB. Furthermore, all iPhone 17 variants are rumoured to include an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens, a notable improvement over the current 12-megapixel selfie camera.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Also read |  iPhone 17 may get 120Hz display but there's a catchAlso read |  Apple is rumoured to release either iPhone SE 4 or iPhone 17 Air in 2025Also read |  iPhone 17 Air price details leaked, will cost less than Pro modelsMust Watch

Considering that Trump owns about 80 percent of the tokens and its current price is around $52, his wealth has been boosted by approximately $45 billion. The $TRUMP crypto token has been built on the Solana blockchain, which has now turned into a goldmine for Donald Trump. Interestingly, as the crypto token becomes more popular, investors would just be adding to the new US President’s personal wealth.  Trump’s crypto holdings rallied overnight and by Sunday morning they were valued at an eye-watering $58 billion. According to a report by Axios, if this number is combined with his other assets, he would now rank among the 25 richest people in the world.  

 



Screenshot from CoinGecko
 As mentioned above, Trump owns 80 per cent of the tokens. Which means, out of the total 1 billion tokens that were issued, 200 million are being traded actively by the public.  The new $TRUMP memecoin takes you back to Donald Trump’s first term in the US as president, when a lot of concern was raised about how people could be benefiting him personally by staying at his Washington Hotel and contributing to his personal wealth. The crypto token, however, is a newer and a more direct way of adding to Trump’s wealth. First, he listed a meme stock where he owned more than half the shares, and now the meme coin is a new avenue for him to generate funds with lesser accountability.  But there is an interesting twist in the story here. Enter the first lady Melania Trump. Hours after Donald Trump released his memecoin, his wife, Melania Trump launched her own memecoin called  $MELANIA, late on Sunday. Her memecoin was able to briefly cause a crash in Donald Trump’s token, which saw a decline by 50 per cent. As of Monday morning, Melania Trump’s memecoin jumbed 2000 per cent in value and is trading at $0.1261.

70d44738-0345-4976-807f-d56ef76e9c1d,"Apple is planning to launch MacBook Air with OLED display, but not very soonA new report reveals that Apple is planning to launch a MacBook Air with an OLED screen in 2029. This decision is likely due to the slower-than-expected sales of the 2024 launched iPad Pro, which features an OLED screen. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-is-planning-to-launch-macbook-air-with-oled-display-but-not-very-soon-2667378-2025-01-20,"Last year, Apple finally introduced OLED displays—Ultra XDR Retina Display—in iPad Pro models. With this, the next Apple device expected to get the OLED display is the MacBook. While MacBook Pro models are said to get the OLED display by 2026, Apple is reportedly planning to wait a few more years to bring OLED to the MacBook Air models. A new report by Korean publication The Elec notes that Apple has likely pushed the launch date for the first MacBook Air with an OLED display from 2027 to around 2029. According to the report Apple is planning to delay the launch of the OLED MacBook Air after receiving a cold response to the expected sales projections for the OLED iPad Pro. Earlier there were reports that with the OLED MacBook Pro in 2026, we might see OLED screens in the MacBook Air by 2027. However, now this new reports suggest that with the iPad Pro sales performance, Apple might be reconsidering its plans to offer premium OLED displays in the considerably budget-friendly MacBook Air lineup. While the introduction of OLED displays would definitely bring a better display experience with improved brightness, deeper blacks, and enhanced battery efficiency, this display technology is expensive and significantly impacts the overall production cost. Hence, Apple is likely to keep its plans for OLED on hold for the affordable MacBook Air models to align with both production costs and sales performance. However, while the OLED display might take a while to feature in the MacBook Air, Apple is considering upgrading the current LCD displays. According to the reports, Apple is planning to feature “oxide TFT” technology in its 2027 MacBook Air. This new tech will allow future MacBook Air models to offer better durability, improved visuals, and higher contrast compared to the current LCD displays.MacBook Pro with OLED on track coming next year  While the reports of no OLED in MacBook Air for the next two years might disappoint Apple users, Apple is said to bring OLED displays to MacBook Pro models soon. According to several reports, including one from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models launching in 2026 could feature OLED displays. Infact Gurman suggests that the 2026 MacBook Pros will be the “true overhaul” for Apple’s the MacBook Pro. These reports are further supported by predictions from Apple analysts Ming-Chi Kuo and Ross Young, who earlier have said Apple will phase out mini-LED displays in MacBook Pro models after the 2025 lineup. Additionally, the OLED technology will allow Apple to make MacBooks even thinner. For instance, the OLED iPad Pro introduced in 2024 became Apple’s thinnest device that year. Similar design changes are expected with MacBooks after the adoption of OLED technology. As for the 2025 MacBook Pro, Apple is likely to give few upgardes including better performance with the new M5 chip.MacBook Air with M4 launching in 2025 As for the upcoming MacBook Air, this year Apple is reportedly planning to update its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the new M4 chip in the coming months. These new MacBook Air models will continue to rely on LCD technology but are expected to offer improved performance and efficiency, while keeping the device powerful and competitive in their segment.

The phone is expected to be unveiled soon as it makes its way through key certifications. The Galaxy A36, expected to debut in global markets, including India, was recently spotted on the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) certification website, indicating the phone will be launched soon in the country. A Samsung smartphone, tipped to be the Galaxy A36, with the model number SM-A366E/DS was listed on the BIS database. The DS in the model number stands for dual-SIM support. This same model has also been spotted on Samsung’s global support pages, including those in Kazakhstan and Russia, further confirming its association with the Galaxy A36.

Samsung Galaxy A36 BIS listing
 While the BIS listing itself doesn’t reveal much about the Galaxy A36’s specifications, other certifications and benchmark numbers have already given an idea of what to expect. For starters, the Galaxy A36 will likely be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor. Geekbench listings reveal that the chipset features four cores clocked at 2.40GHz and four at 1.80GHz, paired with the Adreno 710 GPU for graphics. The Galaxy A36 scored 967 points in single-core and 2,750 points in multi-core tests on Geekbench. In comparison, the last-generation Galaxy A35, powered by the Exynos 1480 scored 1011 and 2905 in single-core and multi-core in our testing. Furthermore, the device is expected to come with 6GB of RAM in its base configuration, though higher RAM variants might also be available. Samsung will likely ship the Galaxy A36 with Android 15 out of the box, running on the latest iteration of its custom One UI 7 skin. Another notable feature of the Galaxy A36 is its charging capabilities. The IECEE certification has confirmed support for 45W wired fast charging, which is an upgrade over the 25W support seen in many of Samsung’s current mid-range devices.  Samsung is reportedly making some changes to the camera hardware as well. Unlike the Galaxy A35’s 13-megapixel front camera, the Galaxy A36 is rumoured to feature a new 12-megapixel selfie camera. Although the megapixel count is slightly lower, Samsung might focus on improving image quality through better sensors or software optimisations. While we await more concrete details, the multiple certifications give us somewhat of a clear idea of what to expect from the Galaxy A36. In comparison to the Galaxy A35, the upcoming model has a new processor, faster charging, along with an upgraded selfie snapper.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

Scheduled for January 22, the new Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup is expected to include the vanilla Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a new anticipated entry, the Galaxy S25 Slim. While there is a lot of buzz about this new variant, the latest leaks suggest that Samsung might keep the variant selective to certain countries. According to a recent render by PhoneArena, while Samsung may introduce a new Slim variant in the Galaxy S25 series, the new variant will arrive later in the year. Additionally, with the delay in the launch, Samsung might also limit the availability of the Galaxy S25 Slim to 39 countries. The list of countries includes:
Afghanistan
Australia
Austria
Brazil
Caucasus
Croatia
Egypt
France
India
Iraq
Ireland
Israel
Kazakhstan
Kenya
Libya
Malaysia
Mexico
Morocco

Singapore

South Africa
Sri Lanka
Switzerland
Thailand
Tunisia
Turkey
UAE
United Kingdom
Uzbekistan
Vietnam
 While the list is extensive, notably, the U.S. is not included. However this list is not the first one to suggest the unavailability of Galaxy S25 Slim in US. Earlier in his posts on X, tipster Evan Blass suggested that that the upcoming slim device from Samsung will ""almost certainly not be offered through U.S. carriers."" Evan noted that this will be a similar move to Samsung's approach with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition, which only debuted in South Korea in October 2024. However, it is important to note that nothing has been confirmed by Samsung yet. Although the availability of a fourth device has been hinted at by Samsung through its teaser for the launch event. In the shared teaser, Samsung is showing corners of four phones, suggesting the launch of four devices in the upcoming Galaxy lineup. As for what to expect from the slimmest Galaxy S25, the model appeared on Geekbench as model number SM-S937x/DS and is rumoured to feature a 6.66-inch display, likely similar in size to the Galaxy S25+ model. However, the device is expected to be comparatively thinner, sporting a 6.4mm thin profile without the camera module. With the camera module, the Galaxy S25 Slim is likely to measure 8.3mm. Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, coupled with 12GB of RAM, and run on Android 15 with the One UI 7 skin on top. For photography, the Samsung S25 Slim will likely feature a 200-megapixel primary camera, a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 50-megapixel 3.5x telephoto camera.

This basically means TikTok has close to two months to reassess how it can make its services in the US permanent again.  The executive order commands government agencies in the country to find a way that will save TikTok while protecting national security. Essentially, with the order, Donald Trump has asked the US Attorney General to hold off the TikTok ban for 75 days. “I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans,” the executive order reads. The ban was enforced under the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). The original deadline for the ban was January 19, when within a span of 24 hours, the app was banned and then unbanned in the US. “During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act,” the order further reads. During his victory rally on Sunday, Donald Trump got the TikTok app unbanned in the US, hours after the TikTok services went dark in the country and all ByteDance apps were pulled down from the app stores. However, while helping revive TikTok services, Trump said that it would only allow TikTok to work in the country on the condition that it sells 50 per cent of its ownership to the US.  For the uninitiated, TikTok has been facing a threat of ban in the US over concerns about national security tied to its parent company ByteDance. The US government believes that TikTok’s parent company is working with the Chinese government, and could be sending out personal and sensitive data of US users to China.  At the moment, there is no update on how TikTok will continue to offer its services in the US, who will buy TikTok, or anything else. For now, what we know for certain is that TikTok services are currently available in the US, and will continue to be available for at least the next 75 days, which is April 6, 2025.

The commission, which proposes big budget cuts and agency reforms, could soon become an integral part of federal operations. However, its legality remains uncertain as legal challenges loom.  The executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) as the U.S. DOGE service while retaining its acronym. Originally set up by former US President, Barack Obama to modernise technology, the USDS will now focus on Musk’s DOGE vision. This includes a detailed software modernisation plan to improve outdated government IT systems and infrastructure.  At the signing ceremony, Trump outlined plans for DOGE teams within federal agencies. Each team, consisting of at least four members, will include a team leader, an engineer, an HR specialist, and an attorney. Agency heads have been instructed to establish these teams within 30 days and collaborate with DOGE to streamline operations.  A temporary organisation, the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organisation, has also been created. Its mandate is to advance Trump’s 18-month DOGE agenda, with a termination date set for July 4, 2026. Trump stressed that all DOGE-related initiatives must conclude by that date, ahead of the Ohio gubernatorial election in November, later that year. Despite Trump’s confidence in the plan, DOGE faces legal and political hurdles. Critics have already filed three lawsuits, accusing the commission of violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which mandates transparency and balanced representation in advisory groups. Democracy Forward has criticised it as a shadow operation lacking transparency. National Security Counsellors argue that DOGE bypasses proper advisory procedures. Meanwhile, Public Citizen, the State Democracy Defenders Fund, and the American Federation of Government Employees claim that DOGE’s members fail to represent the interests of ordinary Americans. These lawsuits argue that DOGE, under Musk’s leadership, did not comply with these requirements.  Elon Musk initially suggested that DOGE’s proposals could save up to $2 trillion by cutting waste, eliminating redundant agencies, and reducing the federal workforce. However, he later moderated these claims, acknowledging the complexity of such goals. Reports indicate that DOGE is exploring controversial measures, such as nullifying the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and restructuring it alongside the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Musk has also proposed eliminating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a move that experts have heavily criticised. The commission’s journey has not been without drama. Co-leader Vivek Ramaswamy left DOGE after reported disagreements with Elon Musk. He is now expected to run for governor of Ohio, raising further political stakes for the initiative.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Tune InAlso read |  US President Donald Trump signs executive order delaying TikTok ban by 75 daysAlso read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?

As we draw closer to the first phases of launches—Apple typically starts launches with spring events in March or April—the anticipation around what’s new is growing higher. For starters, in its spring launch, Apple is likely to announce the new lineup of iPad Air models, and a new report suggests that these models will feature the M3 chip. In one of his latest private posts on X— as reported by MacRumors—tipster Evan Blass shared an image of source code mentioning the names of the anticipated 11-inch iPad Air, 13-inch iPad Air, and iPad 11 models. This image suggests the possibility of these launches and the chipset these devices will come with. Although Blass has not shared the source, the image hints that Apple is likely to launch the new iPad Air lineup soon. The launch was earlier suggested by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who stated that Apple is likely to launch the new iPad Air lineup around April 2025. Meanwhile, the leaked source code image by Blass indicates that the upcoming iPad Air models and the iPad 11 will feature the M3 chip—removing the possibility of the M4 chip, which was earlier speculated. Additionally, an earlier report by Gurman noted that the new iPad 11 will come with the A17 Pro chip and 8GB of RAM, which will allow these iPads to support the Apple Intelligence features and its AI units. Additionally, the iPad Air is also likely to arrive with a 90Hz display and could include Wi-Fi 7 support, a better mic array, and potentially Apple's own 5G modems, ditching the reliance on Qualcomm's chips. The iPad 11 is also expected to feature improved connectivity with Wi-Fi 6E/7, Bluetooth 5.3, and possibly 5G support. In addition to more improvements and powerful chipsets, the new iPad Air lineup and iPad 11 are also speculated to come with new Magic Keyboards. In one of his newsletters, Gurman shared that Apple is planning to launch a new Magic Keyboard for entry-level iPads. These keyboards will be updated and have some new features adopted from the 2024-launched Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. This may include a thin and lightweight design with an aluminum palm rest, a larger glass trackpad, and a row of function keys with shortcuts for features like display brightness and volume. All the new iPad Air, iPad 11, and Magic Keyboard models are likely to arrive in Apple’s spring launch, which is possible in late March or early April. Along with the iPad Air refresh, the upcoming launch slot is also expected to bring the new-gen iPad SE—the iPhone SE4—with significant upgrades over its predecessor. With an A18 series chip, support for Apple Intelligence, a 48-megapixel rear camera, and Apple's in-house modem, the new affordable iPhone is expected to deliver an improved experience.

e952000a-f270-42d9-9b6b-e9ebfa813d8f,"As Trump delays TikTok ban, China is reportedly working with US to keep TikTok runningPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of a ban of popular short-video app TikTok that was slated to be shuttered on January 19. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/as-trump-delays-tiktok-ban-china-is-reportedly-working-with-us-to-keep-tiktok-services-running-2667865-2025-01-21,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of a ban of popular short-video app TikTok that was slated to be shuttered on January 19. While signing the order, Trump suggested the United States government should be a half owner of TikTok's US business in return for keeping the app alive and warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. China has reportedly given a strong hint that it is ready to secure some deal with the US for TikTok. ""When it comes to actions such as the operation and acquisition of businesses, we believe they should be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference. ""If it involves Chinese companies, China’s laws and regulations should be observed."" Mao noted that TikTok ""has played a positive role in boosting US employment and consumption"" and asserted that his country is hoping that ""the US will earnestly listen to the voice of reason and provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for market entities from all countries."" The executive order capped 48 hours of legal maneuvering and political intrigue that left millions of US TikTokkers struggling for answers about the fate of their app. The drama began Saturday when the short video app used by 170 million Americans was taken offline for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Sunday. The next day Trump said he had plans to ""Save TikTok"". Within hours, the company began restoring its service in the US, thanking the soon-to-be-inaugurated President for providing assurances to TikTok and its business partners that they would not face hefty fines to keep the app running. The app and website were operational on Monday, but TikTok is still not available for download in the Apple, opens new tab and Google app stores. Trump's order, signed hours after he was inaugurated on Monday, mirrors his earlier promises and directs the attorney general to not enforce the law to give his team time ""to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok."" But the legality of Trump's executive order is unclear. The law requiring the divestiture was passed by big majorities in Congress, signed by President Joe Biden, and upheld by a unanimous Supreme Court. The law also does not grant Trump authority to extend the deadline unless ByteDance has ""binding agreements"" to sell TikTok and it is unclear any agreements exist. 
Representative Frank Pallone said Trump's order is ""circumventing national security legislation passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress."" The debate over TikTok comes at a tense moment in US-China relations. Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China's leader. While signing the executive order Monday evening, Trump said that he “could see” the US government taking a 50 per cent stake in TikTok and as part of that stake, the US could police the site. Trump added that if a deal isn't approved by China, ""there's no value. So if we create that value, why aren't we entitled to like half?"" He said the company could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The US has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed last year gives the Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 21, 2025

According to a new leak, the upcoming affordable iPhone could have a potential design inclusion that brings it closer to the flagship models.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-is-coming-with-dynamic-island-new-leak-suggests-2667855-2025-01-21,"The iPhone SE 4 has long been in the rumour mill and is expected to launch soon. The latest leak from tipster Evan Blass brings new information that’s sure to excite Apple fans. In a private social media post, Blass shared some interesting details about Apple’s next affordable iPhone, including hints of a potential design inclusion that brings it closer to the flagship models. According to the leak, a purported image of the iPhone SE 4 showcases the Dynamic Island — a feature that first debuted with the iPhone 14 Pro series and is now standard across the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 line-up. This could be a solid addition to Apple’s budget line-up, giving it a look and feel that is in line with the current-generation iPhones, compared to the dated design of the iPhone SE, which still features thick bezels and a home button.

 Interestingly, Blass also shared what appears to be source code referencing the iPhone SE 4. This puts to rest rumours of the device being called iPhone 16E. However, the name in the code could still be a placeholder, so there’s no official confirmation yet. Apart from the design upgrade, the iPhone SE 4 is rumoured to come with a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, and Apple’s latest 5G modem. Under the hood, it could pack an A18 chip and 8GB of RAM, thus having support for features like Apple Intelligence. If true, these updates could finally bring the SE model in line with the top-tier competition.  There’s also speculation about pricing. While the current iPhone SE starts at $429 (Rs 47,600 in India), the added features and design changes might push the price up a notch. Still, it’s expected to remain Apple’s most affordable iPhone. As for the release date, Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted a launch around March or April 2025, following the same timeline as previous SE models. This gives Apple fans plenty of time to speculate and debate whether Dynamic Island will indeed make its way to the SE. In the same leak, Blass also hinted at updates for Apple’s iPad line-up. New 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models, along with the next-generation entry-level iPad, could be unveiled in early 2025. The iPad Air is expected to feature the M3 chip, while the basic iPad might feature the A17 Pro chip with 8GB of RAM.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

The latter, however, is said to only be unveiled at the event tomorrow, with its launch scheduled for some time later.

This comes from a teaser from Snapdragon itself. In a post by Samsung on X, announcing the official launch date for the Galaxy Unpacked, Snapdragon responded with a “See you there”. This all but confirms that the Galaxy S25 smartphones will be powered by the company’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.

Compared to the Galaxy S24, it launched in India with a price tag of Rs 79,999 for the 256GB variant, and Rs 89,999 for the 512GB model. For the Galaxy S25+, the pricing is expected to start at 1,235 euros, which would be somewhere around Rs 1,09,000 for the 256GB variant, while the highest variant with 512GB storage is said to cost 1,359 euros, which roughly translates to Rs 1,20,000. In comparison, the Galaxy S24+ price in India started at Rs 99,999 for the 256GB variant, while the 512GB model was priced at Rs 1,09,999. As for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the base model will reportedly be priced starting at 1,557 euros, which in direct conversion would be around Rs 1,38,000, while the price of the top variant with 1TB storage is believed to be as high as Rs 1,70,000 approximately. For perspective, the Galaxy S24 Ultra was priced starting at Rs 1,29,000 for the base variant, and the top model cost Rs 1,59,999. Galaxy S25 series storage options Leaks have also revealed the storage options we can expect on the Galaxy S25 series phone. Reportedly, the Galaxy S25 will come in three storage variants: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options. The Galaxy S25+ is believed to skip the 128GB variant this year and come with only the 256GB and 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, on the other hand, is rumoured to come in a 512GB and a 1TB variant. Galaxy S25 Slim-ness leaked One of the highlights of the Galaxy Unpacked event is expected to be the much-talked-about Galaxy S25 Slim. And as the name suggests, the device is expected to be the slimmest phone by Samsung yet. A recent leak revealed that the Galaxy S25 Slim will measure a mere 6.4mm in thickness –– that’s if you don’t include the camera module’s protruded thickness. If you include that, it would reportedly measure around 8.3mm. That is still quite impressive considering the  Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumoured to be 8.2mm thick even without the camera bump.Galaxy S25 series pre-reservations Samsung has officially opened the pre-reservations for the Galaxy S25 series devices in India. For a refundable amount of Rs 1,999, customers can pre-reserve their Galaxy S25 ahead of the official launch. Do note, this is not equivalent to pre-booking a device, you will still have to place an order for the device you want. However, this will ensure early access, and will also let you avail some discounts worth up to Rs 5,000. The pre-reservation benefits will be available both at online and offline stores.

Among these will be its long-rumoured tri-fold phone, which could be the next big thing in the realm of foldable smartphones. Of course, foldables have come a long way since they first hit the market, with improvements in design, durability, and usability. However, the market for foldable phones hasn’t grown as fast as some might have hoped.  According to leaker, Jukanlosreve, citing a report by Korean outlet The Elec, Samsung’s 2025 lineup of foldables will include the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, two expected names that will carry forward the Z-lineup. However, there’s talk that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 might lose the S Pen digitiser. This would mean a thinner device, but also a stylus that needs charging — a detail that might divide fans.

 Alongside these two flagship foldable smartphones, Samsung may launch the Galaxy Z Flip FE — wherein FE possibly stands for Fan Edition — aimed at making foldables more affordable. This move could help Samsung compete with brands like Motorola and Tecno, which are already offering relatively affordable flip-style foldables. However, the real star of the show this year, though, is expected to be Samsung’s first tri-fold device. This device is said to feature two hinges, which will allow for a much larger display than the Galaxy Z Fold 7. When fully unfolded, the screen could measure between 9.9 and 10 inches — putting it closer to Galaxy Tab space. For comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a 7.6-inch inner screen. Production for this ambitious tri-fold phone is rumoured to start in Q2 2025, with a launch expected in Q3. This fits with Samsung’s usual second Unpacked event, typically held in late summer. However, with such a bold new design, there’s a chance it could arrive later than the other foldables. Samsung reportedly plans to produce around 200,000 units of this tri-fold device in 2025, suggesting the company is keeping expectations modest for now. After all, Huawei beat Samsung to the punch last year with the Mate XT, the first tri-fold phone, which had a hefty price tag of nearly CNY 19,999 (roughly Rs 2,37,000). However, Huawei’s offering is only limited to China, while in Samsung’s case, this phone will most likely make a global debut.  With these four devices, 2025 could be a critical year for Samsung to cement its dominance in the foldable segment. What would be the price? We are not sure for now, but, don’t expect it to be light on your pockets.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

You can expect to see at least three flagship models at Samsung's biggest tech event of the year. These include Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 Ultra. While some reports have been claiming that the new Samsung Galaxy S series is set to receive a big price hike, very few leaks suggest that the new devices could be introduced at the same old prices. This has confused a lot of users who have been considering buying the upcoming phones. While we will get the official prices of the Galaxy S25 series at the Samsung Unpacked event, here is a look at the leaked prices of all the upcoming models for the Indian market. advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25 launching tomorrow: India prices of all models leakedTipster Tarun Vats has leaked the potential Indian prices of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series models, with a note that the details are from the local retailers.If we go by the leak, the Samsung Galaxy S25 will come with a starting price of Rs 84,999 for the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage model. The company is also said to offer a 12GB + 512GB model, which is tipped to cost Rs 94,999. Tipster Tarun Vats has leaked the potential Indian prices of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series models, with a note that the details are from the local retailers. If we go by the leak, the Samsung Galaxy S25 will come with a starting price of Rs 84,999 for the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage model. The company is also said to offer a 12GB + 512GB model, which is tipped to cost Rs 94,999. The Samsung Galaxy S25+ might be priced at Rs 1,04,999 for the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage model. The 512GB storage model could be sold at Rs 1,14,999. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will reportedly be on sale with a starting price of Rs 1,34,999 for the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage model. The leak suggests that 16GB + 512GB model could cost Rs 1,44,999, whereas its 1TB storage model could be offered at Rs 1,64,999. Samsung Galaxy S24, S24+, S24 Ultra India prices -Samsung Galaxy S24 price was set at Rs 79,999 (8GB RAM + 256GB storage)
-Galaxy S24+ price started from Rs 99,999 (12GB RAM + 256GB storage)
-Galaxy S24 Ultra was launched at Rs 1,29,999 (12GB RAM + 256GB storage)Is Samsung Galaxy S25 series getting a price hike? With every generation, we have mostly seen a price hike of a few thousand rupees. So, the same could happen with the upcoming models as well, something which the above leak is also suggesting. It says that the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series could increase by Rs 5,000 in comparison to the Galaxy S24 series. Because of this, the standard model is said to cost almost Rs 85,000 and the Plus model's price will exceed Rs 1 lakh in comparison to the previous generation.  If we compare the prices of Apple's iPhone 16 Pro models with Galaxy S25+ and Ultra, Samsung is smartly keeping the prices on the lower side. However, if the company manages to retain old prices, it is likely to see better sales because of the greater value proposition that the new devices will be able to offer. Also, the leak suggests that the standard S25 model's price will be more than the iPhone 16, which is likely to make it tough for Samsung to justify the price if there are no big upgrades.  But, these are not the official prices, so people are advised to take these details with a pinch of salt. Also, Samsung is said to bring several upgrades with the upcoming Galaxy S25 series in terms of chipset, AI features, charging, design and a bit in the camera department. So, it remains to be seen whether Samsung will increase the prices of the new models or retain old prices to woo consumers.

According to the leak, the iQOO Neo 10R is said to feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset and up to 12GB RAM, making it a strong contender in the sub-Rs 30,000 price segment. If the rumours hold true, the Neo 10R could give tough competition to the Motorola Edge 50 Pro and the recently launched Poco X7 Pro. While exact pricing details are not confirmed, the iQOO Neo 10R 5G is expected to fall below the Rs 30,000 mark. This will make it an attractive option for folks who want a phone with top-tier performance without the premium price tag associated with flagship phones. However, it remains unclear if all RAM and storage configurations will fit within this price range. The device is expected to launch in two colours — Blue White Slice (white) and Lunar Titanium (black/ dark grey).  The iQOO Neo 10R is expected to feature a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate. The phone could come in two RAM and storage configurations — 8GB + 256GB and 12GB + 256GB. On the software side, it will feature Funtouch OS, possibly Funtouch OS 15 atop Android 15. Under the hood, the device is tipped to house a massive 6,400mAh battery with support for 80W fast wired charging. For photos and videos, the iQOO Neo 10R might offer a dual-camera setup on the back. This could include a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-600 sensor as the primary camera and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens. In the front, there could be a 16-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. Interestingly, iQOO’s Neo series for India has often been rebranded versions of its Chinese counterparts. For example, the Neo 9 Pro in India was a rebranded Neo 9 from China with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, while China’s original Neo 9 Pro used the Dimensity 9300+ chip. Following this trend, the Neo 10 Pro for India could be a rebranded Neo 10 from China powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

c906598e-c7bf-42d8-8ee1-6f494faddcf6,"Apple's next device could be a wall-mounted device with home control, Siri and FaceTime supportApple is reportedly planning to launch a new smart home device. This device is likely to feature a big display and serve as a home command centre with Apple Intelligence features and Siri integration. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-will-soon-launch-an-ai-smart-assistance-with-big-display-2668017-2025-01-21,"2025 is said to be a very significant year for Apple device launches. This year, the Cupertino giant is likely to launch around 20 new devices across the year, expanding its ecosystem. One of the highly anticipated devices is a smart digital assistant with a big display. This new device is rumored to allow Apple to expand its offerings in the smart home market and give users a dedicated smart device with a big display to control their smart home devices. According to Mark Gurman, this new smart device—codenamed J490—will feature a wall-mounted design with a big screen that will allow users to control smart devices, do video conferencing, and even offer smart AI-powered apps through Apple Intelligence and Siri for voice assistance. According to Gurman, this new device will feature a 7-inch display and will be squarish in shape, resembling an iPad and as big as two iPhone 16 Pro Max models placed side by side. The device is also said to feature thick bezels and a camera at the top for FaceTime—likely making the device seamlessly integrate with other Apple ecosystem devices.  It will also said to come with a rechargeable built-in battery and internal speakers. To power the device, Apple’s upcoming home device is said to arrive with a new dedicated OS, likely called ‘HomeOS,’ which, according to Gurman, “looks like a blend of the Apple Watch operating system and the iPhone’s recently launched StandBy mode.” Sharing more of the specifications, the report reveals that this new smart home control device from Apple will feature a touch interface similar to the Apple Watch operating system and the StandBy mode released for iPhone with iOS 17. This interface will not only allow users to operate other devices but will also serve as an aesthetic smart device on the wall. This much anticipated Apple device is also said to include adjustment modes that will respond to the distance between the device and the user—for instance, from a distance, the device might show time and updates, but when users come closer, it will offer control functions. All in all, the new smart device from Apple is expected to serve as a smart home hub and security device, including features like speakers to allow users to utilise it as a multipurpose device—whether in the living room, kitchen, or on a desk. Apple has also said to have designed various attachments for its smart home display device, including mounts to affix the screen onto walls. When is Apple launching its new smart display device? According to Gurman, citing sources close to the development, Apple has been working on this smart device for years. In fact, for the past three years, it has been trying to bring it to market. But the launch had been delayed. However, Apple is now likely to launch this new smart home device in March 2025 and introduce it as a command center for the home. The company may offer this new smart device in silver and black colour options.  Meanwhile, it’s not just the smart display that is rumoured. There are also reports about a smart doorbell that Apple is working on, and it might be possible for Apple to launch this display alongside attachments like the doorbell to offer an integrated home control centre. However, it is important to note that all these are speculations, and nothing has been confirmed by Apple as of now. Apple’s current smart home lineup includes the HomePod, HomePod mini, and Apple TV 4K. However, these devices do not support Apple’s latest Apple Intelligence.

At the event, the company is expected to launch three smartphones: the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Samsung also unveiled the highly-anticipated Galaxy S25 Slim, but that may only be available some time in May this year. Besides the phones, the South Korean giant may also talk about the next-generation Galaxy Ring. However, at the heart of any device the company launches at the event, will be Galaxy AI.  Galaxy AI is Samsung's own AI tools and software that are embedded across its devices, including smartphones and tablets. It powers several features on the device, like Bixby, Samsung voice assistant, contextual suggestions, image recognition, etc. These features are meant to make the experience on the device more intuitive and smarter. With the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy AI debuted for the first time and the features and tools were available on the smartphones for free.  However, according to recently leaked marketing material that was first shared by Evleaks, this year, Galaxy AI will be available for free for Galaxy S25 users only until the end of this year. Starting in 2026, users may have to start paying for the features.  With the Galaxy S24, Samsung had promised to make Galaxy AI features available for free for two years. On the basis of that, the report seems legitimate. 
This also means that by 2026, all Samsung users –– whether using the Galaxy S24 smartphones, the Galaxy Z-series foldables or the upcoming Galaxy S25 series –– will no longer have free access to Galaxy AI.  Currently, it is unclear how Samsung will be charging for these features. There is no clarity about whether Galaxy AI will be available on a subscription basis or it will be a suite that you make a one-time purchase for. We will know about it all soon enough though, as the Galaxy Unpacked is just hours away.  As for subscriptions, Samsung is also rumoured to be kicking off its subscription plan for renting out the new Galaxy S25 series. However, this subscription plan is said to be made available only to customers in South Korea for now.

However, there have been rumours that this year's event could also see the launch of a new smartphone - Galaxy S25 Slim. But, is it really coming? Well, fresh leaks have suggested that Samsung is preparing to launch the new Slim model in May this year. What this means is that we may not see it debuting at tomorrow's Samsung Galaxy S25 launch event, but there are chances that the company could tease it to surprise its fans. In the recent past, Samsung has done something similar with its smart ring. The brand first teased it at the launch of the Galaxy S24 series and the product was then shown off at MWC 2024 event and later made available on shelves. Here are 5 things you should know about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim.advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25 Slim launching soon: 5 things to knowBiggest design upgrade?The leaks have claimed that the Galaxy S25 Slim will have the slimmest design that people have ever seen on a Samsung smartphone. It could have 6.4mm thickness, which is a bit lower than 6mm thickness rumoured for the iPhone 17 Air model but it is still quite impressive if the company is able to achieve it. The device is likely to appeal to those who are in favour of a very slim profile and lightweight design. But, a slim form factor also means that you might get a smaller battery, downgraded heat dissipation system, and lower camera quality over other S25 models because the company would have less space to fit in the best of tech in a thin frame. Also, the slimmer body could also make it more fragile and prone to damage. But, this is why companies like Samsung and Apple could be taking time to launch such smartphones because there are challenges that they need to address.Also, it is good to see Samsung experimenting with something new in the flagship range to offer users a better experience. However, whether this turns into a reality is something that remains to be seen.Display The leaks have claimed that the Galaxy S25 Slim will have the slimmest design that people have ever seen on a Samsung smartphone.

Also, it is good to see Samsung experimenting with something new in the flagship range to offer users a better experience. However, whether this turns into a reality is something that remains to be seen.Display The Galaxy S25 Slim is tipped to come with a 6.7-inch display, which also means that this model could have a larger screen compared to the 6.3-inch panel rumoured for the standard Galaxy S25.  While specifics about the display technology remain undisclosed, the Slim model is at least expected to come with support for an adaptive refresh rate that adjusts from 1Hz to 120Hz. This would allow for a smoother scrolling experience while also conserving some battery life when a lower refresh rate hits based on the content. Samsung has always offered an AMOLED panel, even with mid-range devices, so the Slim variant won't be an exception.New chipset? The Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to use the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which would be a good move by Samsung because Qualcomm chips have proven to offer solid raw performance out of the box. However, it is currently unknown whether the company is planning to offer this chip in selected markets. We could see Exynos 2400-powered Galaxy S25 Slim in some markets, but nothing is confirmed right now.A flagship camera? Leaked reports suggest the Galaxy S25 Slim might feature a 200-megapixel main camera, similar to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. While it is unclear if additional lenses will fit the device’s slim body, Samsung's upcoming ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) technology could enable a sleeker, thinner build with a good camera setup. Expected to debut at MWC 2025, this tech may allow the Slim to maintain high-end camera performance without compromising its slim design. But, there is no solid information on the camera bit, so users are advised to take the details with a pinch of salt.What could be its price? Will it be positioned in Galaxy S25 series? There is a rumour that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim could be a replacement for the Galaxy FE models. On the contrary, there are also reports suggesting that the company could position the new model among the flagship S25 series. It could be similar to what Apple is doing with the Plus model, offering a bigger display and battery compared to the standard iPhone model. Speaking of battery, rumours suggest that the S25 Slim could feature a capacity between 3,000mAh and 4,000mAh. It’ll be interesting to see how well that holds up for a flagship device — assuming this model is indeed being positioned as one. Realistically, the positioning depends on the specs that the Slim version will have and it is too early to talk about this because there are very less details about the smartphone.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/trump-says-he-is-open-to-musk-buying-tiktok-if-tesla-ceo-wants-to-do-so-2668336-2025-01-22,"US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was open to billionaire Elon Musk buying social media app TikTok if the Tesla CEO wanted to do so. The short video app used by 170 million Americans was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Sunday. Bloomberg News reported last week that Chinese officials were in preliminary talks about a potential option to sell TikTok's operations in the United States to Musk, though the company has denied that. Trump on Monday signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after US officials warned that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. TikTok remained unavailable to download on Apple and Android devices in the United States on Tuesday afternoon. ""I would be, if he wanted to buy it,"" Trump told reporters on Tuesday when asked if he was open to Musk buying the platform. ""I have met with owners of TikTok, the big owners,"" Trump added. ""So, what I am thinking about saying to somebody is 'buy it and give half to the United States of America.'"" Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the US Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden. The company says US officials misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle, while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the US. Musk, who spent more than $250 million to help Trump win November's presidential election, has said there was an ""unbalanced"" business environment between the US and China. ""I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced,"" Musk, who owns social media platform X, said over the weekend.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also read |  As Trump delays TikTok ban, China is reportedly working with US to keep TikTok services runningAlso read |  As Donald Trump unbans TikTok in US, Elon Musk complains about X ban in China: Story in 5 pointsAlso read |  US President Donald Trump signs executive order delaying TikTok ban by 75 days

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-will-soon-let-you-share-whatsapp-status-directly-to-instagram-and-facebook-accounts-2668323-2025-01-22,"WhatsApp will soon be linked to other Meta’s social media platforms, including Instagram and Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s company is working to build a seamless ecosystem, which will sync all three; Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook. In a post, Meta announced that it is eyeing to integrate WhatsApp into its Account Centre. The change, rolling out globally “over the next few months,” will let WhatsApp users share status updates across Instagram and Facebook, as well as enable a single sign-on. 
 


 Meta states that the WhatsApp link won't be activated automatically, so it's up to you to choose whether to connect WhatsApp to the Account Centre. If you decide to do so, Meta will use your WhatsApp data to ""provide, personalise, and enhance its products and services, including showing you ads,"" as explained on a help page about the update.  Additionally, it further ensures that even after users choose to link their WhatsApp account to the Account Centre, the chats and calls will remain end-to-end encrypted.  In the blog, Meta added that it is working on several such features that work across its apps. For example, the ability to manage avatars, Meta AI stickers and Imagine Me creations will soon be accessible in one place. Meta’s Account Centre  Meta's Account Centre, launched in 2020, is a central hub where users can manage and link their accounts across various Meta platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. It allows you to control settings related to your profile, login credentials, and preferences for cross-platform features like sharing content, messaging, and notifications.  The aim of connecting apps to Account Centre is that you can streamline your experience and manage your social media accounts from one place. How to connect to an Account Centre After you have updated your WhatsApp to the latest version, go to settings menu. Here you will find the option to add your account to Accounts Centre. If it's not available, it might not have rolled out in your region yet.
 


 To link accounts, tap the option, follow the instructions, and log in with your Meta account credentials if prompted. Now, as soon as this feature will be rolled out, you would also have to configure how you want to share updates, such as enabling WhatsApp Status posts on Facebook or Instagram. If you decide to stop using this feature, simply return to settings and unlink WhatsApp from Accounts Centre.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also read |  Apple's next device could be a wall-mounted device with home control, Siri and FaceTime supportAlso read  |  As Trump delays TikTok ban, China is reportedly working with US to keep TikTok services runningAlso read |  iPhone SE 4 is coming with Dynamic Island, new leak suggestsMust Watch

OpenAI announced the new company in a blog post, which also revealed that the Stargate Project will begin deploying an initial $100 billion immediately to build AI data centres for OpenAI in the United States.  Along with OpenAI, the Stargate project is backed by companies like SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX. The initiative will be led by SoftBank and OpenAI. The two companies will also divide responsibilities with SoftBank looking at the finances, and OpenAI handling the operations. As per the blog post, SoftBank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son will serve as chairman of the Stargate Project.   OpenAI has announced other partnerships as well for the Stargate Project. The company will be working with the likes of Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Oracle for the same. “As part of Stargate, Oracle, NVIDIA, and OpenAI will closely collaborate to build and operate this computing system. This builds on a deep collaboration between OpenAI and NVIDIA going back to 2016 and a newer partnership between OpenAI and Oracle,” OpenAI writes on the blog post.
OpenAI says that the initial construction is going on in Texas. The company is also looking at new sites for future offices.   OpenAI is confident that the company will bring great benefits to the US economy. “This infrastructure will secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefits for the entire world. This project will not only support the re-industrialisation of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies,” the company’s blog post reads. As for Microsoft, the company says that the new project will build on the “existing OpenAI partnership with Microsoft” and that the company will “continue to increase its consumption of Azure”. Microsoft also announced an update on its partnership with OpenAI late Tuesday. The company said that its agreement with OpenAI will stay intact until 2030, which includes Microsoft’s access to OpenAI’s intellectual property, their revenue-sharing arrangements, and exclusive rights to OpenAI’s APIs.   However, there was another significant update announced: There is a shift in Microsoft and OpenAI’s exclusivity agreement for additional capacity. In the blog post, Microsoft has announced that going forward, it will retain the “right of first refusal (ROFR)”, which means Microsoft will have the right of refusal on a new capacity that OpenAI wants to build.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also read |  Trump says he is open to Musk buying TikTok if Tesla CEO wants to do soAlso read |  TikTok banned and unbanned within 24 hours, Donald Trump talks of 50 per cent sale: Full story in 5 points

The company is expected to launch the Galaxy S25 series, including the Galaxy S25, S25+, S25 Ultra and possibly the long-rumoured S25 Slim, at the event. However, the phones may not be the only devices we see at the launch event. Reportedly, the company may also unveil its first XR headset, codenamed Project Moohan at the Galaxy Unpacked. This move comes at a time for the XR industry where Apple's Vision Pro launched last year. While generating excitement, it also highlighted areas for improvement in terms of user experience and accessibility.  Samsung, however, seems determined to avoid the same pitfalls with its Vision Pro rival. Project Moohan is being developed in collaboration with tech giants Google and Qualcomm. While Samsung is leading the development, Google is creating a dedicated Android XR operating system, and Qualcomm is lending its expertise to XR platforms. Together, the trio is aiming to address key challenges like comfort and a lack of engaging content, which have hindered the adoption of previous XR devices. At the Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung is expected to showcase a prototype or possibly a teaser of the XR headset, giving visitors a first look at its capabilities. The headset is expected to hit the market later this year. Reports suggest it will also integrate Google’s generative AI service, Gemini, to offer a smarter and more intuitive user experience. XR technology is clearly on the rise, with Samsung aiming to take a headstart over the competition. But it isn’t alone in this race. Meta, which generated quite an interest with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, is reportedly working on new glasses featuring built-in displays, slated for release later this year. Meanwhile, Sony is set to launch an industrial XR head-mounted display on January 23, developed in collaboration with Siemens. Even Chinese smartphone makers like Vivo are entering the XR space, with plans to roll out devices of their own. Smart glasses are another area Samsung is exploring. Qualcomm previously confirmed that the company is working on XR-powered glasses. While there’s no word on whether Samsung will showcase these at Galaxy Unpacked, their development gives us an idea of the growing potential of wearable technology in the years ahead. Market research indicates that the smart glasses market is gaining momentum, with shipments expected to skyrocket from a few million units today to 20 million by 2030.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

bf123f56-6e24-4410-8ebc-4f2be4fa1b50,iPhone 17 Air design leak ahead of September launch: Here is everything we know so farThe leaked iPhone 17 Air design reveals a rectangular camera bump housing a single camera lens. This upcoming model is rumoured to be the slimmest iPhone in the Apple-verse. Let's look at what the leak suggests.  ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-17-air-design-leak-ahead-of-september-launch-here-is-everything-we-know-so-far-2668361-2025-01-22,"The iPhone 17 series is anticipated to hit the market globally in September. In 2025, the rumour has it that the company will release a new entry, iPhone17 Air, replacing the Plus model. While there are several speculations doing rounds online, a recent leak shows what the phone might look like. The leak shared on X (formerly Twitter) revealed the alleged rear panel of the iPhone 17 Air. Aligning with the previous rumours and leaks, a tipster, Majin Bu shared images of two of the back panel, featuring a rectangular camera bump. 
 


 In the leak, the tipster shared a hazy image of the alleged iPhone 17 Air's back cover. Even though he posted that it is the design of iPhone 17, the single camera lens indicates otherwise. For a long time now, the standard iPhones have been featuring a dual-camera and the iPhone 17 series is also expected to follow the same. Hence, the single camera lens cut out on the left side of the bar indicates this image belongs to the upcoming iPhone 17 Air. The leaked image also shows a pill-shaped, raised camera bar at the top, which is essentially the revamped design of the iPhone 17 series. The right side appears to house an LED flash and a small microphone opening.  Now, since the launch of iPhone SE 4 or 16e is approaching, X users have been speculating that this leak could also belong to it. And it seems plausible looking at the single-camera lens. However, the design language agrees more with the flagship series. Moreover, the iPhone SE 4 design was also leaked, and it looks a lot different from the iPhone 17 Air. That said, the exact details will only be revealed during the launch, most likely to take place in September. The iPhone SE 4 launch in April should also clear some air around it. iPhone 17 Air: What to expect from the slimmest iPhone Based on the rumours, the iPhone 17 Air is to feature a slim profile with just 5.5mm thickness. If this rumour comes out as the real dimension, the iPhone 17 Air will beat the iPhone 6 (slimmest for now). For this ultraslim design, Apple might cut a few edges, including removal of physical SIM tray, a single camera lens and a smaller battery. It is also interesting to note that the iPhone 17 Air will be in direct competition with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim, expected to launch in May.  The iPhone 17 Air is also rumoured to feature a 6.6-inch OLED display with ProMotion technology, enabling a 120Hz refresh rate. If implemented, it will mark the first time Apple extends this feature to non-Pro models, potentially setting a new standard for mid-range devices. The iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to feature a simplified design, highlighted by a single 48-megapixel rear camera—a shift from the dual-lens systems of current models. This streamlined setup is expected to save space and enhance the device's slim profile. On the front, it may include a 24-megapixel TrueDepth camera, delivering double the resolution of its predecessors.   In terms of performance, the iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to be powered by Apple’s A19 chipset, promising greater efficiency and processing power. Additional upgrades are expected to include 8GB of RAM and Apple’s new in-house modem, codenamed “Sinope.”Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also read |  Apple could copy Android phones by bringing vapour cooling chamber to iPhone 17Also read |  iPhone 17 Air launching in 2025?

The scammers managed to trick him into making large investments after adding him to a WhatsApp group.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/udupi-man-loses-rs-234-lakh-after-being-added-to-whatsapp-group-2668390-2025-01-22,"In yet another case of an online trading scam, a man from Udupi ended up losing Rs 23.4 lakh after being added to a WhatsApp group. The fake group promised the victim tips and tricks to help him earn good profits in online trading. However, as soon as he invested a large sum of money, the scammers refused to give back his profits or the invested amount. The case involves Baptist Maurice Lobo, who ended up losing money in this online scam. According to The Times of India, Lobo revealed in his complaint that one day a few individuals added him to a WhatsApp group named Aarayaa HSS. In this group, the alleged admins introduced themselves and informed him that the group offers tips and guidance on online trading. The group also had some other members who claimed to be earning good profits from their investments. Thinking it to be a good opportunity to make some easy profits, Lobo got convinced and transferred a total of Rs 21.4 lakh from his and his mother's bank accounts to several accounts shared by the scammers between December 2, 2024, and January 6, 2025. However, when he tried to withdraw his profits, the scammers refused and even cut off contact, leaving the victim to lose both his profits and the invested money altogether. Later, he registered a case at the CEN crime police station.What is an online trading scam? The above case is not the only case of online fraud where individual lost money after being added to a WhatsApp group. In fact, in the past few months, many individuals have fallen for similar investment scams. The method is often the same. Scammers create WhatsApp groups, name them to look like they’re part of some big organisation, and add individuals to these groups. Once people join, the scammers introduce themselves as experts and claim they can help group members earn high profits through online trading. To further convince their targets, the scammers ask them to download an app that they maliciously create. Initially, when individuals invest small amounts, the scammers show fake profits, encouraging them to invest larger sums. But as soon as the victims invest significant amounts, the scammers deny access to withdraw the money or demand additional payments under some pretext. In the end, they cut off all communication, leaving the victims financially drained. We have also explained the scam in details you can read here: First they share tips, then dupe people to steal their money: Online share market scam explainedHow to stay safe To stay safe from such scams, don’t fall for opportunities that sound too good to be true. Investments in the stock market are always subject to risks, and no one can guarantee huge profits, like 500 per cent. If someone claims they can, it’s likely a scam. Also, avoid downloading random apps shared by unknown people. These apps may look genuine but can be malicious and allow hackers to access your device. If you find yourself added to any suspicious investment groups on WhatsApp, block and report the group immediately.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also Read |  Apple's next device could be a wall-mounted device with home control, Siri and FaceTime supportAlso Read |  Apple likely to launch new iPad Air models with M3 chip in April 2025Also Read |  Samsung may launch Galaxy Slim on 22 Jan, but only in selected countries

But, he is not asking these tech leaders to buy this social media platform completely and is suggesting that somebody can buy it and give half to the United States of America.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/donald-trump-says-he-is-okay-with-elon-musk-buying-tiktok-will-the-app-return-to-india-2668446-2025-01-22,"At a press conference, President Donald Trump announced he is okay with his billionaire supporter Elon Musk or Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok. But, he is not asking these tech leaders to buy this social media platform completely and is suggesting that somebody can buy it and give half to the United States of America. ""What I’m thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half, and we’ll give you the permit. And they will have a great partner, the United States.""  ""Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr President,"" Ellison said. So far, Musk hasn't commented on this matter. Also, it is unclear how this joint venture between the Chinese TikTok app and the US government will work.  TikTok hasn't yet responded to the latest comment from Trump, but it recently denied reports of the platform considering a sale to Elon Musk or any other entity.  The latest comments by Trump came after the US Supreme Court upheld a law that bans TikTok in the country unless its China-based parent company, ByteDance, sells the app’s operations. With Trump’s suggestion now in the mix, one question that comes to mind is whether such a deal could influence TikTok’s return to other banned markets like India.Could this deal lead to TikTok’s return to India? While the prospect of Elon Musk buying TikTok is primarily focused on the US market, it has raised questions about whether the deal could make way for TikTok’s return to India, where the app has been banned.  India was one of the first major markets to ban TikTok, citing concerns over data privacy and national security. The ban, which was imposed in June 2020, saw TikTok removed from app stores and millions of users cut off from the platform.  For TikTok to return to India, several hurdles would need to be cleared. First and foremost, the Indian government would need to be convinced that the app no longer poses a risk to the country’s data privacy laws. With the possibility of Elon Musk or any other American entity owning a big stake in TikTok, there could be an argument that the app’s ties to the Chinese government are sufficiently weakened, potentially satisfying Indian authorities. However, there is no indication yet that the Indian government is reconsidering its stance on TikTok. India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has not made any statements regarding the app’s potential return, and the ban remains in place. Additionally, in the recent past, India has promoted domestic alternatives to TikTok, such as Chingari and Moj, which have tried to fill the void left by TikTok’s departure. The government’s ""self-reliant"" digital push makes it uncertain whether a foreign entity, even one partially owned by an American, could easily re-enter the Indian market. Moreover, while TikTok was immensely popular in India before the ban, re-entering the market would require the company to rebuild trust and assure the Indian government and public that user data would not be compromised. TikTok’s previous issues with data handling and its alleged links to the Chinese government continue to cast a shadow over any discussions about its return.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 22, 2025

Here is how you can get the discount. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-pixel-8-available-at-half-its-launch-price-how-to-get-the-offer-2668424-2025-01-22,"The Google Pixel 8 is currently available on Flipkart at its lowest-ever price –– under Rs 50,000. This offer is available on the 128GB variant of the phone. As per the listing on the e-commerce website, there is a flat discount of Rs 26,000 available, which brings the price of the Pixel 8 down to Rs 49,999. However, if you use an HDFC Bank credit card and buy the smartphone on EMI transactions, you can get an additional Rs 3,000 off on the phone’s purchase. Which means, the phone’s price comes down to Rs 46,999 effectively.  Additionally, there are exchange offers available up to Rs 35,000 that can further bring down the price of the phone. For instance, at the time of writing the story, we checked the exchange price for a Pixel 7 which is in good condition. For that, you can get up to Rs 13,365 in exchange. This means, if you do end up getting that amount at the time of exchange, the price of the phone eventually comes down to around Rs 33,000. In case you have an old smartphone that you do not have a use for, we recommend you format and factory reset your device, save any and all the data you need from it, and then consider an exchange. It is a great way to save some extra money on a phone purchase.  Notably, in August 2024, Google also officially announced a price cut for the Pixel 8 series and the Pixel 7a. The Pixel 8, in particular, received a considerable price drop. Its base variant with 128GB, which was launched in India at Rs 75,999 had a price revision to Rs 71,999. The 256GB model of the phone was earlier priced at Rs 82,999 and its price was brought down to Rs 77,999 after the price cut.  However, with the currently ongoing offer on Flipkart, the pricing of the Pixel 8 is even lower than that of the Pixel 8a after the price cut in August.  And if you are wondering if the Pixel 8 is still a good choice with the Pixel 9 launched last year, and the Pixel 10 series due for October 2025, we think the phone is still worth considering. In our review of the Pixel 8, we found that the device not only “looks good”, it also has a “fast processor, [and an] amazing camera”. At the time of our review, the only thing we thought that could hold back a purchase of the phone was its steep pricing. However, with the recent price cut and the current discount, the phone will be absolutely worth the money.

Before that, the Release Candidate (RC) update is now available for developers and public beta testers. The update, which follows iOS 18.2, brings a mix of new features and improvements, including updates to Visual Intelligence on the iPhone 16 and changes to the Apple Intelligence notification summaries. One of the standout features of the iOS 18.3 RC beta release is to make Visual Intelligence better. Initially introduced with iOS 18.2 for the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, Visual Intelligence allows users to long-press the Camera Control button to access an AI-powered camera mode, which works similar to how Google Lens does.  With iOS 18.3, Visual Intelligence is getting two new useful features: — Calendar Integration: When your iPhone detects dates on posters or flyers, you can instantly add them to your calendar with a simple action. — Plant and Animal Identification: Visual Intelligence can now identify plants and animals, making it a handy tool for nature enthusiasts. These features, which Apple has demonstrated before, are now becoming widely available. For example, being able to add events to your Calendar app straight from your camera is a practical addition, especially for people who often attend events or meetings. Similarly, the plant and animal identification feature could be a fun way to learn more about your surroundings. Currently, Visual Intelligence works by pulling information from platforms like ChatGPT and Google, but Apple’s focus on tying it into its native apps like Maps and Calendar shows a clear direction for this feature.  Beyond Visual Intelligence, iOS 18.3 also addresses some key concerns with Apple Intelligence notification summaries. Following criticism from outlets like the BBC over misinformation being spread through these summaries, Apple has taken a step back. In the iOS 18.3 RC release, notification summaries for the News & Entertainment category of apps have been temporarily disabled. Users will also notice that summaries now feature italicised text to help distinguish them from regular notifications. Additionally, you can now disable notification summaries for individual apps directly from the lock screen, offering more control over what you see. Apple has also made it clear that the notification summaries feature is still in beta and may have errors.  Alongside the Visual Intelligence upgrades and notification changes in iOS 18.3, the update also includes bug fixes, such as one for the Calculator app. The public release is expected later this month.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

However, the prices haven't hiked for Indian users yes. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/netflix-increases-prices-of-its-subscription-plans-but-you-dont-need-worry-about-it-yet-2668450-2025-01-22,"Netflix has again announced an increase in prices across all its subscription plans in several countries, including the United States, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. The new pricing was revealed through the company’s latest Q4 2024 earnings report. According to Netflix, the increased prices align with the company's efforts to maximise revenue while continuing to invest in its programming and platform improvements. In the United States, Netflix has increased the Standard plan with ads to $7.99 per month, up from $6.99. The price of the Standard plan, offering ad-free 1080p HD video, has also risen from $15.49 to $17.99 per month. Meanwhile, the Premium plan, the only option supporting 4K streaming, has been increased from $22.99 to $24.99. Similar price adjustments are expected for Netflix users in other countries, including Canada. Netflix has cited these new price revisions as part of its efforts to improve its platform. “As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members, we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improve Netflix. To that end, we are adjusting prices today across most plans in the US, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina (which was already factored into the 2025 guidance we provided in October 2024),” the company said in its report.  Notably, the increase in Netflix's prices comes just over a year after the company not only raised the cost of its Standard and Premium plans but also introduced a new ad-supported plan. With the new ad-supported plan, Netflix removed the Basic ad-free plan, requiring users to either pay more for an ad-free experience or opt for the ad-supported tier, in an effort to increase revenue through both subscriptions and ad revenue. However, the new price hike does not apply to Indian users. For now, Indian users can continue using Netflix with the currently available subscription plans. For context, in India, Netflix offers four plans – Mobile, Basic, Standard, and Premium. The Mobile plan is priced at Rs 149 per month and offers fair video quality with 480p resolution. However, the plan only supports one device, either a mobile or tablet, at a time within a household. The Basic plan is priced at Rs 199 in India, offering 720p resolution and support for TV, computer, mobile, and tablet devices. However, only one device can stream at a time within a household. The Standard plan is priced at Rs 499 and offers 1080p HD resolution. It supports all devices and allows two devices to stream simultaneously within a household. Lastly, the Premium plan is priced at Rs 649 per month, offering 4K resolution, spatial audio, and support for up to four streaming devices simultaneously within a household. At any time, content can be downloaded on up to seven devices.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also Read |  Udupi man loses Rs 23.4 lakh after being added to WhatsApp groupAlso Read |  Apple's next device could be a wall-mounted device with home control, Siri and FaceTime supportAlso Read |  Apple likely to launch new iPad Air models with M3 chip in April 2025

He had said that he hopes that people will soon say:“Truecaller finally works on iPhones”. While it is definitely a welcome update to the Truecaller app, it is interesting to see if this would really boost the app’s adoption, considering Apple launched its own caller ID lookup feature that automatically suggests who could be calling. That said, Apple uses data from your messages and mails to offer a caller suggestion. However, Truecaller has a much larger database of phone numbers and IDs, so if you are using Truecaller, you would get a much more accurate caller ID suggestion.

Additionally, with the rollout of the feature, Truecaller says that iPhone users will also be able to take advantage of the feature that automatically blocks spam calls. Truecaller on iOS will now also allow users to search for previously identified calls, letting them go as far back as 2,000 previous numbers in the recent list on the Phone app.  Notably, the number search and caller ID features will be available for Truecaller Premium users. However, if you are a free user on iOS, you can still use the feature, but you will see ads while using the feature. Auto-blocking of spam is already available to all users globally. The new Caller ID feature will be rolled out starting January 22.How to enable caller ID on Truecaller iOS app? To enable the caller ID feature on Truecaller iOS app, you need to first ensure that your iPhone is running iOS 14.0 or later. Then, open iPhone Settings, head to Apps, then Phone, then Call Blocking & Identification. Here, you need to enable all Truecaller switches and open the Truecaller app again. And you are set. The rest of the setup happens automatically.

9c8a5123-7460-4d68-ae4a-d200e9c4ed93,"Marshall Willen II review: Small but mighty The Marshall Willen II is the smallest and most affordable speaker from the company. And despite the size, the speakers are able to deliver the signature Marshall sound. So what we have is good sound and great price — but is it perfect? Well, almost. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/marshall-willen-ii-review-small-but-mighty-2668492-2025-01-22,"  I absolutely love the new Marshall Willen II. Yes, those are some big words to start off a review, but I have my reasons for saying so. This new Bluetooth speaker from Marshall is cute, compact, lightweight, and offers balanced sound while smoothly juggling between highs and mids, and hitting the treble just right. In fact, this is one of the best portable — like really portable — Bluetooth speakers you can buy right now. However, it costs Rs 12,499.    Now, if you are a Marshall fan, or aspire to own a Marshall speaker, you might even think it’s affordable –– considering the usual prices of Marshall products –– but if you look at alternatives in general, you might be able to get a more affordable option too. For instance, you can get a JBL Go 4 Ultra, which is around Rs 4,000 and just as compact –– may be even lighter than this. But here is the thing, if you can shell out the money, we would still recommend the Marshall Willen II, and here is why.   But before I get into the whys and whats of the speaker, let’s take a quick look at its specifications.    The Willen II features the classic Marshall design. It is dust- and waterproof with an IP67 rating, which means the device can handle accidental water splashes or even a dip in a pond. The Willen II also comes with a microphone, so you can take calls on the speaker. It has a square body. And like I said it’s quite portable. It is 10.05 cm thick, 4.34 cm tall, and weighs 0.36 kg. It has a flexible strap at the back which can be used to hold the device. Or you can detach it from one end and strap it to your belt or table or chair.   Small but tough    Design is one of the highlights of the Willen II –– and full marks for that. I reviewed the black variant. Its design is similar to traditional Marshall speakers — a leatherette finish with a grille on the front and the Marshall logo in matte gold. While you would usually see compact speakers made in a rectangular shape, the Willen II’s square built makes it more portable. In fact, I’ve been carrying the device in my pocket while traveling.  
 


 In spite of being lightweight, you don’t see Marshall compromising on the build quality of the speakers. It feels sturdy, and sports IP68 rating, which means good overall durability.    I like my black variant, but after using it for about 10 days, I feel the other cream colour variant could be a better choice. That is because the black finish attracts a lot of dust. While it is easy to clean the rest of the body of the speaker, the grille is a bit tricky.   
 


As for controls, there’s a Type-C port on its left. On top, you’ll find controls like the power button, Bluetooth pairing, microphone, and a battery indicator (which uses a red LED). When you see the device, you will notice there is no dedicated pause or volume button on it. The Willen II features a tiny joystick on the top corner of the grille. It lets you pause, play, control volume, or skip tracks forward.  While the little button adds a touch of style, it can be a bit tricky to use, as it’s partially embedded into the Willen II’s body. Pausing or playing music is simple, but toggling it to the side might be slightly tough — especially for those with longer nails or fatter fingers (no offence intended).  Other than that, the design of the Willen II is quite good. It matches Marshall’s signature experience and turns heads wherever you go. 
 


advertisement Sounds right   Talking about being a headturner, the speaker’s sound gets big credits for that. The Marshall Willen II offers balanced sound. I listened to a lot of hits, including Die With a Smile by Bruno Mars and a LOT of Coldplay songs — I had to make up for missing the Coldplay concert in some way. The speaker was also used at all the house parties at my place in the last 10 days. And during this time, I found that the speaker sounds just right, regardless of the genre of music you are listening to. It lacks a bit of bass though. I would have also liked to see more equaliser controls in the app. But the default sound output is pleasant.   
 


Volume is also decent, especially for casual listening. In a crowded room, however, you may find yourself wanting an option for higher volume.   advertisementBattery is another highlight. Every weekend since I got the device, I would charge it just once on a Friday and that sorted my entire weekend. Of course, I didn’t play continuously for 42 hours, but it ran for no less than 15 hours. It could have gone another one hour, I think, but I think 15 hours of playtime on a single charge is still pretty good. Charging speed of the Willen II is also quite fast, it gets powered up in around two hours.  
 


Marshall Willen II review: Should you buy it?   If you want to experience the Marshall signature sound without spending on the signature Marshall price tags, Willen II is a speaker to consider. And if you are in the market for something compact and portable, then you have really hit the jackpot with the Willen II.   The speakers offer a tiny build without compromising on sound. It is lightweight, easy to carry, and fits easily in a handbag or pockets. The sound is great, the battery life is long, and the app offers a bit of extra control.   advertisementHowever, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy music, then the Willen II might not be the right pick for you. The speakers may also not be the right choice for loud house parties with large crowds.   As for the price, it’s not cheap for sure but it also offers an experience that cheaper alternatives from brands like Boult or Boat do not.

Earlier this week, Oppo even confirmed the device’s impressive IPX9 rating for water resistance — which will be a first for any foldable smartphone. Now, Zhou Yibao, Head of Oppo’s Find series, has announced that the Find N5 will support wireless charging — something its predecessor, the Find N3, lacked. According to Zhou Yibao, the wireless charging speed on the Oppo Find N5 will max out at 50W, a feature that puts it in direct competition with Huawei’s Mate X6 and Honor’s Magic V3, which also offer similar charging speeds. However, what sets the Find N5 apart is its design. Rumours suggest it could become the thinnest foldable phone in the world to feature such fast wireless charging. If true, it would break the current record held by the Honor Magic V3, which measures 9.4mm when folded and 4.4mm when unfolded. For context, Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Google’s Pixel 9 Pro Fold lag far behind in wireless charging speeds, offering only 15W and 7.5W respectively. This should give Oppo, and probably even OnePlus too, a significant edge, particularly in markets where Huawei and Honor’s foldables aren’t available. Yibao also shared that the Find N5 will support in-car wireless charging and reverse wireless charging, though the latter’s exact charging speed hasn’t been confirmed yet. Apart from wireless charging, the Oppo Find N5 will come with several standout features. The foldable smartphone will come with an IPX9 rating, which ensures protection against water and introduces an underwater photography mode. The phone will reportedly be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, paired with 16GB RAM. For those who prefer traditional charging methods, the phone is expected to support 80W fast wired charging. The OPPO Find N5 is set to launch in China next month, probably after the Spring Festival celebrations conclude. The foldable smartphone is expected to debut globally as the OnePlus Open 2. For reference, the OnePlus Open, which was a rebranded version of the Oppo Find N3, launched in India for Rs 1,39,999 (16GB RAM + 512GB storage) in October 2023. A 1TB storage version of the phone was also launched last year in August, priced at Rs 1,49,999.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

The latest rumour suggests Samsung is said to use a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera on the next-generation Galaxy S26 Ultra.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-tipped-to-feature-a-massive-periscope-camera-upgrade-2668515-2025-01-22,"Samsung is all set to unveil the Galaxy S25 series to the world at the Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose, California, on January 22, 2025. However, even before the upcoming devices have become official, rumours around the next-generation Galaxy S26 series have started popping up. Reportedly, the South Korean tech giant is planning some big upgrades, including advanced camera features and the latest battery technology.  One of the most exciting details comes from a new leak on Weibo by tipster DigitalChatStation. According to the source, Samsung is said to use a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera with a 1/1.5-inch sensor. To put this into perspective, the Vivo X200 Pro already features a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera with a slightly larger 1/1.4-inch sensor. If Samsung moves forward with this idea, the Galaxy S26 Ultra — possibly rebranded as the S26 Note — could see a big upgrade in zoom capabilities compared to its predecessors. Currently, the Galaxy S24 Ultra uses a 50-megapixel periscope lens with 5x optical zoom and a 10-megapixel telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumoured to feature a similar setup. DigitalChatStation also hinted that three out of five flagship smartphones launching this year might feature a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera, suggesting this could be a growing trend. Another major development is the rumoured use of silicon-carbon battery technology. Samsung is reportedly working on finally adopting silicon carbon batteries for the Galaxy S26 series. For those who don’t know, silicon carbon batteries offer higher energy density, allowing for larger capacities without increasing the device’s bulk. We have already started seeing this latest battery technology in many high-end flagship phones, such as the recently launched Vivo X200 series, OnePlus 13 and more. Even the recently launched Poco X7 Pro — a sub-Rs 30,000 smartphone — features a 6,550mAh silicon carbon battery under the hood.  Apart from the camera and battery upgrades, Samsung is also said to be exploring improvements in display technology. The Galaxy S26 Ultra might use Colour-filter-on-thin-film-encapsulation (CoE) technology, which could reduce screen thickness while enhancing light transmittance. This would likely contribute to a more immersive viewing experience along with having a relatively slimmer profile compared to current generation models. Interestingly, Samsung’s naming conventions might also see a shake-up. Rumours suggest that the Ultra model could be renamed as the Galaxy Note, while the Plus variant might become the Galaxy Pro. If this happens, the Galaxy S26 lineup could consist of the Galaxy S26, S26 Pro, and S26 Note.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

The updates reportedly focus on providing Special Tariff Vouchers (STVs) with voice and SMS benefits, but data offerings have been scaled back. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/airtel-revises-2-popular-prepaid-recharge-plans-check-out-latest-benefits-2668560-2025-01-22,"Airtel has revised two of its popular prepaid recharge plans at the start of 2025, a move which likely has been taken to align with a recent directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The updates reportedly focus on providing Special Tariff Vouchers (STVs) with voice and SMS benefits, but data offerings have been scaled back. Here is everything you need to know about it. Airtel has a Rs 509 prepaid recharge plan, which is the company's old pack but the benefits have been refreshed. The plan is still valid for 84 days and it now targets users who mainly require voice calls with no cap and a lot of SMS benefits, with no mobile data benefits. It comes with unlimited voice calls and 900 SMS. Earlier, this plan also included 6GB of data, but the updated pack has removed it. Airtel users will still get additional perks like free access to the Airtel Xstream app, Apollo 24/7 Circle membership, and Hello Tunes. Those who also need some data can consider buying the Rs 569 Airtel prepaid plan as this one comes with 6GB of mobile data along with the same voice and SMS benefits. Now, the second Airtel prepaid recharge plan that has been revised is its Rs 1,999 annual pack. While it continues to provide unlimited voice calls and 3,000 free SMS, the 24GB of mobile data previously included has been removed. Users of this plan can still enjoy extra services such as the Airtel Xstream app, Apollo 24/7 Circle membership, and Hello Tunes. The changes are in response to TRAI’s mandate that requires operators to offer STVs meant for voice and SMS services. This means that the new Airtel plans, while offering strong voice and SMS benefits, now come with fewer data options, requiring customers to purchase separate data packs if needed. One can also simply consider buying other packs that offer unlimited benefits. Additionally, charges for SMS beyond the free limit are set at Rs 1 for local and Rs 1.5 for STD.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 22, 2025

22884fb7-221c-4cbe-8223-75592fa16124,"Android 16 first beta releasing in January? Here is everything we knowGoogle is reportedly planning for an early beta release of its upcoming Android 16 by January 2025. The new OS upgrade will introduce features like revamped notifications, adaptive refresh rate improvements, and enhanced security. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/android-16-first-beta-releasing-in-january-here-is-everything-we-know-2668659-2025-01-22,"Google is planning to release the first beta of its new-gen OS update– Android 16, by the end of January 2025. The tech giant is reportedly pushing the annual beta testing for the OS update early to make the final release all set to roll in May 2025– around the time of developer’s conference. With the upcoming Android 16 Google promises to bring users a host of new features and improvements, including revamped notifications, better adaptive refresh rate support, and more. According to a report by the Android Authority, Google plans to release the first beta build of Android 16 in January, with subsequent beta updates rolling out between February and March. This timeline reportedly matches Google’s plan to push the stable release by May 2025– certainly before the launch of the new flagship Pixel 10 launch. According to the reports, Google is said to be following this timeline:
January 22, 2025: First beta release.
February 19, 2025: Second beta release.
March 12, 2025: Third beta release.
May 2025: Stable version launch, possibly coinciding with Google I/O 2025.
 The early cycle of beta releases is likely due to the launch of the Pixel 10 series, expected in August 2025. Notably, the latest Pixel 9, which was launched in August 2024 was shipped with the older OS Android 14 as Android 15 was delayed. However, this year, Google is planning to bring the new flagship pre-installed with the latest OS update. Right now, Android 16 is in early beta and available for developers to test upcoming features on supported Pixel devices.What’s new in Android 16? While not all features have been revealed, the early betas have confirmed and hinted at several exciting updates for Android 16. Upgraded lock screen notifications: One of the most anticipated updates in Android 16 is the introduction of a ""Compact"" notification view for the lock screen. This feature, discovered by Android expert Mishaal Rahman, allows users to collapse all notifications into a small pill below the clock, showing only app icons. Tapping the pill expands the notification list, giving users a cleaner and more organised lock screen. Embedded Photo picker: Android 16 is also set to improve the embedded photo picker, reportedly enabling better integration with cloud media providers. The new feature will allow users to search for images directly within the picker, making it easier to upload photos to apps. Health records integration: Building on the success of Health Connect, Android 16 is also reportedly introducing support for Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. This feature will let users access and manage health data securely, though functionality remains limited for now. Improved adaptive refresh rate support: Google introduced Adaptive Refresh Rate (ARR), with Android 15. Now in the new OS update, the company is bringing improvements to this feature. Google is reportedly introducing new APIs to make it easier for developers to optimise apps for ARR, offering smoother visuals and improved power efficiency on supported devices. Security features: Just like every year, the new OS Android 16 also includes new security features. This year, improving the security, Google is strengthening Wi-Fi location services, using the 802.11az standard. This will enable more accurate and secure proximity-based applications, like unlocking devices or vehicles. Writing tools API: A new Writing Tools API is also included in Android 16, letting app developers disable AI writing tools in specific contexts, such as password fields or numerical inputs, ensuring better accuracy and security in user interactions.Android 16 early access for Pixel users Right now, Pixel device owners can try out Android 16 early through the beta program. Google will release a full list of supported devices closer to the official release date. However, interested users can enrol in the beta program can explore the new features and provide feedback to Google before the stable release.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Also Read |  Marshall Willen II review: Small but mightyAlso Read |  Netflix increases prices of its subscription plans, but you don't need worry about it yetAlso Read |  Udupi man loses Rs 23.4 lakh after being added to WhatsApp group

This is notable as the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is currently one of the top foldable devices available in India. It is known for its slim design, good performance, and convenient multitasking features. If you're looking to own a flagship foldable, this is probably the best time to get one, as discounts of this scale on Samsung's high-end models are quite rare.advertisementSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 gets big discount, deal explainedThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is currently listed on Croma with a starting price tag of Rs 108,990 for the 256GB storage model.

With the latest Rs 46,000 discount offer, the deal has become quite attractive for those who could not buy it last year after the launch as the device was a bit expensive.  One common concern when buying a foldable phone is the fear of it breaking easily. However, the same risk exists with traditional smartphones if they are dropped from a certain height onto a hard surface. But, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 5 has a strong hinge and a durable design. Additionally, you will hardly notice creases on the inner display, which Samsung has improved with every generation. It is also not that bulky and you can easily use it as your daily driver. The device even has an IPX8 rating, which makes it resistant to water immersion up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. So, you don't have to worry about everyday spills or accidental splashes. Although, it doesn’t have dust resistance. It features a massive 7.6-inch AMOLED inner screen, which offers rich colours and refreshes at 120Hz for a smoother scrolling experience. One of the interesting parts is that the camera is incorporated under the inner display. You can just unfold the device to watch a movie or video on the bigger screen. You can also use the device in laptop or tent mode. You can switch to the outer 6.2-inch cover screen anytime if you want to use the phone as a regular smartphone.   When the device is partially folded in laptop mode, apps like the camera or video players automatically adapt their interface, with controls appearing on the lower half of the screen, while the content remains on the top. It’s a smart use of the folding design and makes the device feel more comfortable to use. The software is well-optimised for multitasking, allowing you to run up to three apps simultaneously on the inner display with quick app-switching and window-resizing options. The Edge Panel lets you quickly access apps and drag them onto the screen, making multitasking intuitive and fluid. App Continuity is another standout feature — if you’re using an app on the outer display and unfold the device, the app transitions to the larger screen without any issue. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. While this is 2 generation older flagship chipset, it is still a capable chipset and will offer users a fast performance. But, people who require raw power should maybe buy the Z Fold 6 model or consider buying the Galaxy S24 Ultra for better performance gains. Despite its slim profile, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 houses a 4,400mAh battery, which may seem small for such a large dual-display device, but Samsung has done an excellent job optimising battery efficiency. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and better power management in One UI, the phone can comfortably last through a day of average use, with close to 8-9 hours of screen time. The heavy users might need a top-up by the evening. Also, Samsung doesn't bundle a charger with its phone and this one has support for 25W wired charging, which takes about 30 minutes to fully charge the device.  Foldables often have to compromise on camera performance to fit all the folding mechanics, but Samsung hasn’t skimped here. The Galaxy Z Fold 5 sports a triple-camera setup on the rear with a 50-megapixel primary sensor, 12-megapixel ultra-wide, and 10-megapixel telephoto lens, which delivers excellent results. The main sensor is capable of capturing sharp, detailed images, even in challenging lighting conditions, with good dynamic range and colour accuracy. The 10-megapixel telephoto sensor offers 3x optical zoom, which is solid for a foldable, and the ultra-wide lens is good for capturing landscapes or group shots. You can expect to get good low-light shots as well with the Samsung phones with the output having decent details, good colours, enough sharpness and almost no noise. The 4-megapixel under-display camera on the inner screen is less impressive, but it serves its purpose for video calls or occasional selfies when using the large display. The outer 10-megapixel front camera on the cover display is more reliable for everyday selfies and video calls. All-in-all, it is a great deal for foldable phone lovers.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 22, 2025

The company has announced three models, a standard, Plus and Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Slim — which was heavily rumoured — hasn't been teased. This suggests that Samsung might be keeping it under wraps only to surprise you later. The latest Samsung Galaxy S25 series comes with a starting price of $799 (around Rs 69,000) in the US. The Galaxy S25+ will cost $999, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra is priced at $1,299. The India prices of the new flagship phones are still under wraps, but you can check out the specs below.advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Full specsThe new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra takes a big step forward with upgrades in design, performance, and functionality. Starting with its display, the phone features a larger 6.9-inch screen, up from 6.8 inches in previous models, with more rounded edges that move away from the sharper Galaxy Note design. Despite this, the Ultra is lighter, weighing just 218 grams, while still housing the same 5,000mAh battery that has powered Ultra models since the Galaxy S20 Ultra.One of the standout improvements is in the camera system. The 200MP primary sensor is now accompanied by a 50MP ultra-wide camera, replacing the 12MP sensor used in earlier models. There’s also a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom and a secondary 10MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The 12MP front-facing camera remains unchanged but it is expected to offer better performance for selfies and video calls.

The 12MP front-facing camera remains unchanged but it is expected to offer better performance for selfies and video calls. The Galaxy S25 Ultra comes with 12GB of RAM across all storage options — 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. This 12GB RAM configuration is consistent across the entire Galaxy S25 lineup, as Samsung has decided to eliminate the 16GB RAM variant this year. At the core of the device is the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, a custom-tuned version of Qualcomm’s latest flagship chipset for 2025, featuring an advanced APU for improved efficiency and performance. Additionally, Samsung claims to have improved heat management by increasing the vapour chamber size by 40 percent on the S25 Ultra, with smaller but notable improvements of 15 per cent on the S25 and S25+.Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+: Specs The newly launched Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+ carry forward a bit of the hardware from their predecessors. The S25 features a compact 6.2-inch display, while the S25+ offers a larger 6.7-inch screen. Both devices come equipped with a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 10MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. Battery capacities remain unchanged, with the S25 housing a 4,000mAh battery and the S25+ featuring a 4,900mAh cell. Charging speeds are also consistent, offering 25W wired charging for the S25 and 45W for the S25+. These devices run on Android 15 with Samsung's One UI 7 interface and promise extended software support, including 7 years of OS updates and security patches. The base model of the Galaxy S25 starts with 128GB of storage. Samsung is now offering 12GB RAM as the base model for the standard and Plus versions. Also, the Snapdragon 8 Elite powers the new devices.
 


New AI features The new phones are running on the latest One UI 7 custom skin based on Android 15, which the company says is built from the ground up with AI.  Samsung is pushing the boundaries of AI integration in One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25 with a suite of Gemini-powered features. At the heart of these updates is the introduction of ""AI agents,"" which streamline how users interact with their phones. Gemini now allows for chaining multiple commands and app interactions to make complex tasks feel effortless. Users can also access Gemini directly by long-pressing the power button, ensuring quick and intuitive access to its capabilities. Furthermore, Samsung apps are being upgraded with Gemini extensions. On the AI front, Samsung is bringing several new features to its Galaxy lineup. ""Generative Edit"" in the photo editing tools has been upgraded to not only remove people from images but also their shadows. The ""Now Brief"" feature provides a personalised daily summary to keep users informed, while Samsung Gallery now supports searching for images using natural language, making it easier to find specific photos. To tie it all together, the on-device ""Personal Data Engine"" analyses user data securely, all while maintaining a focus on privacy, according to the company.  There is also a new AI Select tool that suggests relevant AI features based on screen activity—such as offering writing assistance to summarise, spell-check, or adjust text tone. On-device search now supports detailed queries, like finding a photo of a dog in a red coat near a cake. Samsung also added voice-triggered tasks, such as activating a blue light filter when you mention eye strain, eliminating the need to navigate menus. Another standout is Live Video, which provides step-by-step guidance by analysing activities, like giving baking instructions as you roll dough. The AI system now supports translations in 20 languages for calls and in-person interactions, expanding its utility.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 22, 2025

And just like every year, this year too we have 3 new Galaxy phones. These are the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Galaxy S25+, and the vanilla S25. Now one device, if the rumours were anything to go by, was missing in this announcement. That is until the very end of the Unpacked 2025, the Samsung event where it launches its flagship phones. And this one was Galaxy S25 Slim, a name circulating in rumours for a while. But at the close of the event Samsung brought out a teaser of a new phone. This one is called the Galaxy S25 Edge.  In other words, the Galaxy S25 Slim exists. But it is now officially called the Galaxy S25 Edge.  What it will be, we do not know for sure for now. However, the teaser shown at the unpacked event shares the first look, showing a new Galaxy device with a flat design and two cameras at the rear. As for everything else, that’s for later.

 



Samsung teases the upcoming launch of the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge
 But of course, here too rumours come to rescue. And we have seen that so far rumours around the Galaxy S25 series have turned out to be mostly accurate.  Going by these reviews it is safe to say that the galaxy S25 Edge is likely to come with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plenty of RAM — say 12GB at least — and two rear cameras, one of which is expected to use the 200MP sensor that is also in the other flagship S25 phones, and another one is said to be a slimmed down periscope lens. It is also likely that the phone will have a 6.7-inch display, complete with top features like 120Hz refresh rate and extra high brightness.  But the main feature of the phone, which also gives the device its name, is the design of the phone. It is expected that the Galaxy S25 Edge is likely to be just 6.4mm slim.  Now, another rumour about the S25 Edge is that it is not going to be available anytime soon. While the other three S25 phones are going on sale from February 7, the S25 Edge is likely to be available for sale only from May and that too only in some countries. It is possible that in many countries, including in India, the phone might not even arrive.  Given that the S25 Edge is not launching along with the other S25 phones it seems like that the phone is an afterthought by Samsung, possible to counter the iPhone 17 Air that has also been in rumours for the last few months. It is almost certain that Apple is going to launch the iPhone 17 Air, a rather slim and petite iPhone later in September or October. Chances are that Samsung also wants to have a similarly slim-profile phone in its lineup.  As for the new Galaxy S25 series, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is leading the Samsung lineup with a larger 6.9-inch display, an upgraded camera setup featuring a 200-megapixel primary sensor and dual telephoto lenses, and the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with advanced thermal management. The Galaxy S25 and S25+, meanwhile, retain the familiar designs from their predecessors and offer respective 6.2-inch and 6.7-inch displays.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Also Read |  Android 16 first beta releasing in January?

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-tells-india-court-chatgpt-data-removal-will-breach-us-legal-obligations-2668859-2025-01-23," OpenAI has told an Indian court that any order to remove training data powering its ChatGPT service would be inconsistent with its legal obligations in the United States, according to a recent filing seen by Reuters.  The Microsoft-backed AI firm also said that it was not within the jurisdiction of Indian courts to hear a copyright breach case brought by local news agency ANI as OpenAI had no presence in the country.  In the most high-profile and closely-tracked lawsuit on AI use in India, ANI sued OpenAI in Delhi in November, accusing it of using the news agency's published content without permission to train ChatGPT. OpenAI responded to the lawsuit, which is also seeking the deletion of ANI's data already stored by ChatGPT, in an 86-page filing at the Delhi High Court dated January 10, which has not previously been reported. OpenAI and other firms have faced a wave of similar lawsuits from prominent copyright owners over alleged misuse of their work to train AI models, including a case brought by the New York Times against OpenAI in the United States.  OpenAI has repeatedly denied the allegations, saying its AI systems make fair use of publicly available data. During a November hearing, OpenAI told the Delhi court it would not use ANI's content anymore but the news agency argued its published works were stored in ChatGPT's memory and should be deleted. In the January 10 submission, OpenAI said that it is currently defending litigation in the United States concerning the data on which its models have been trained, with laws there requiring it to preserve the data while hearings are pending.  OpenAI ""is therefore under a legal obligation, under the laws of the United States to preserve, and not delete, the said training data"", it said. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.  In its submission, OpenAI also said the relief being claimed by ANI was not subject to the processes of Indian courts and was beyond their jurisdiction. The company has ""no office or permanent establishment in India ... the servers on which (ChatGPT) stores its training data are similarly situated outside of India"".  ANI, in which Reuters holds a 26 per cent interest, in a statement said that it believes the Delhi court has jurisdiction to decide on the matter, and it would file a detailed response. A Reuters spokesperson did not respond immediately to a request for comment but the agency in November said it was not involved in ANI's business practices or operations. The New Delhi court is due to hear the case on January 28. OpenAI has been gearing up to transition from a non-profit enterprise into a for-profit business as it looks to capture even more funding to stay ahead in the costly AI race after raising $6.6 billion last year. In recent months, it has signed deals with Time magazine, the Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, France's Le Monde and Spain's Prisa Media to display content. ANI has also said it is concerned about unfair competition given OpenAI's commercial partnerships with other news organisations, and has told the court that in response to user prompts, ChatGPT reproduced verbatim or substantially similar extracts of ANI's works. In its rebuttal submission, OpenAI argues that ANI ""has sought to use verbatim extracts of its own article as a prompt, in an attempt to manipulate ChatGPT"".Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Must Watch

The much anticipated slim variant of the series was also teased during the launch-- the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will feature a flat design and two rear cameras. Apart from this, all the other details are still under wraps for the Edge. At a starting price of Rs 80,999, the series comes with enhanced features over its predecessor. The Galaxy AI is one of the standout features. For instance, the series is the first one to come with Gemini as its default AI assistant, something which was only exclusive for Google phones. Let's delve deeper to find out more about these upgrades. advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25 series AI-featuresGemini AI assistant: This is not the first time that Google's Gemini has been integrated into any of the Samsung phones, but it is the first time that the Gemini is the default AI assistant of the series. It has already enabled users to perform several tasks across apps like YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and Spotify. But now, with the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Gemini expands its capabilities to integrate with Samsung apps, including Samsung Calendar, Notes, Reminder, and Clock.  
 


Users can now use Gemini to handle multiple tasks in a single prompt. For instance, if you need high-protein lunch ideas, you can ask Gemini for recipes and save them directly to Samsung Notes or Google Keep.

 Users can now use Gemini to handle multiple tasks in a single prompt.

To make Gemini even more accessible on Galaxy S25 devices, simply long-press the side button to summon it for assistance or to interact with content on your screen. Additionally, for Advanced users, access to Deep Research in the Gemini mobile app will begin rolling out later this week, offering a powerful tool to save time on research, even while on the move.
 


 Gemini Live: Gemini Live now offers an even more dynamic conversational experience, enabling users to engage in natural, free-flowing chats while incorporating images, files, and YouTube videos into their conversations.  
 


 This enhanced version of Gemini Live is being rolled out to the Samsung Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as Pixel 9 devices. Furthermore, Google plans to introduce Project Astra features, including screen sharing and live video streaming, to the Gemini mobile app on Android and the Samsung Galaxy S25 in the coming months. Circle to Search: This Google AI-feature was first introduced in the Samsung Galaxy S24 series. And now with the new series in town, Samsung seeks to take it up a notch. The feature will now automatically identify phone numbers, email addresses, and URLs, making it easier for users to interact with them. Additionally, AI Overviews in search results have been enhanced to support a wider range of visual search queries. This increases the likelihood that using Circle to Search on an image of a location, artwork, or object will produce an AI Overview in the results.
 


 Briefs: A standout feature is the Brief tool, which provides personalised daily summaries. The morning brief includes the weather forecast, your schedule for the day, and an energy score if you're using a Samsung wearable. During your commute, it automatically initiates navigation and plays music when you get into your vehicle. In the evening, it offers a summary of your day, highlighting key activities and showcasing memorable moments through photo collages.
 


 The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is available for pre-order beginning January 23, 2025, through all major online and offline retailers. Customers can also pre-order directly on Samsung’s official India website. The devices are set to go on sale starting February 7, 2025.

In a wonderful surprise for Samsung fans, the company also announced the revival of the Edge series. Basically, the slimmest smartphone by Samsung, which we thought would be called the Galaxy S25 Slim, is actually called the Galaxy S25 Edge. Samsung only shared a brief sneak peek of the Galaxy S25 Edge, but we have all the details about the other three smartphones.  Over the Galaxy S24 series, the Galaxy S25 does not feature prominent hardware upgrades, but when you get to the pricing, you will notice something interesting.  The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is priced the same as last year’s Galaxy S24 series –– well, almost. While there is a slight increase in pricing for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Galaxy S25+ is priced exactly the same as the Galaxy S24+. Meanwhile, the standard variant has seen a minimal increase in price for the base variant, but there is a legitimate reason for that. Let’s dive deeper into the pricing.  The Samsung Galaxy S25’s base model is priced starting at Rs 80,999 this time, whereas in 2024, the Galaxy S24’s base model was priced at Rs 79,999. That’s a small difference of one thousand, but the big difference here is RAM. The Galaxy S24 offered only 8GB RAM, while the new S25 comes with 12GB RAM for both the 256 and 512GB storage models.  As for the Galaxy S25+, the RAM and storage specifications are exactly the same as those of the Galaxy S24+. The price of the 12GB RAM and 256GB storage model is also the same at Rs 99,999. However, there is a slight bump in price for the 12GB RAM and 512GB storage model of the Galaxy S25+, which is priced at Rs 1,11,999, while the Galaxy S24+’s same variant was priced at Rs 1,09,999 –– a difference of Rs 2,000.  There is a more visible difference in the prices of the Galaxy S25 Ultra though. The Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in three variants with all of them featuring 12GB RAM, and options for 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage. The prices for these are Rs 1,29,999, Rs 1,41,999, and Rs 1,65,999 respectively. Compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the prices for the 256GB and 512GB models of the S25 Ultra are pretty much the same, with a small difference of one or two thousand. The only significant bump in price you notice is with the 1TB variant, which is Rs 6,000 more expensive.  For context, the Galaxy S24 Ultra also featured 12GB RAM. Its 256GB storage model was priced at Rs 1,29,999, the 512GB model was priced at Rs 1,39,999, and the 1TB variant cost Rs 1,59,999 at the time of launch.  TL;DR: With the taxes and duties that smartphone manufacturers have to pay, it is always great to see when there isn’t a dramatic hike in their flagships from one year to the other. With the Galaxy S25 series, we think Samsung has done a pretty good job with the phones’ pricing.

However, if you don’t mind buying a generation-old flagship smartphone — in this case, the Galaxy S24 Ultra — you can end up saving a good amount of cash. Here’s how you can buy the S24 Ultra for under Rs 1 lakh.advertisementSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra available for Rs 98,000 on AmazonIf you search for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra on Amazon, you will find a bunch of listings for new and refurbished models.

Even without the cashback offer or without exchanging an old phone, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra deal in itself is quite good. For the unaware, the phone was initially launched for Rs 1,29,999, but with the current deal, prospective buyers are easily getting about Rs 36,000 in discount — no questions asked. For under Rs 1 lakh, it makes a lot of sense to buy the Galaxy S24 Ultra. One of the prime reasons is that it is not all that different from the newly launched Galaxy S25 Ultra. Granted, the S25 Ultra gets the latest chipset, a larger VC cooling system, a new 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera, new AI features, and more. The Galaxy S24 Ultra still has everything to hold its ground. The display is top-tier with anti-reflective properties. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 with 12GB RAM is a powerhouse. The camera system, led by the 200-megapixel sensor, is one of the best you can get on any smartphone. And finally, the price at which you get this overall package. Maybe, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a better deal and justifies the extra Rs 30,000 over the S24 Ultra. However, we can only be sure of this once we have tested the latest model. For now, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra makes a lot of sense for anyone looking to buy a top-tier flagship smartphone for under Rs 1 lakh.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

40c16b0b-3e37-436a-a026-f227c3654c6a,"Elon Musk slams Sam Altman as Trump backs OpenAI's Stargate ProjectWith US President Donald Trump backing Sam Altman's latest initiative, the Stargate Project, Elon Musk is lashing out. In a series of posts about the OpenAI CEO, Musk has called him a liar, claimed lack of funds in his new company, and more. Here is the whole drama between Elon Musk and Sam Altman. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/elon-musk-vs-sam-altman-as-trump-backs-openais-stargate-project-musk-lashes-out-and-calls-him-a-liar-2668997-2025-01-23,"Elon Musk is furious. He has again picked up a fight with Sam Altman, and the trigger this time is OpenAI’s Stargate Project. What makes things worse is that the AI project is backed by Musk’s new favourite, US President Donald Trump. Musk’s new tirade is laced with accusations and screenshots of old tweets. Things seem to be taking a personal turn as he (once again) publicly accuses Altman of playing a game with the agenda of making money, which is in contrast to the vision Musk and Altman once shared for an open-source, non-profit AI organisation.   There is more. In the middle of the feud is Musk’s complaint about Altman’s alleged $10 billion demand, which is equivalent to a 7 per cent share in the new Stargate Project. Musk says that this is after Altman testified to Congress that he will not be taking any compensation or pay from OpenAI. Trump is unhappy that Altman is now looking to make money by setting up a new AI company.
 


 Unsurprisingly, it is not as if Musk is completely impartial here. His own AI company called xAI is a direct competitor of OpenAI and is tangled in lawsuits with the company at the moment. Musk and his AI company have accused OpenAI of anticompetitive behaviour, and of discouraging investors from putting their money in its rival companies.  And it gets better: Just like OpenAI needs AI infrastructure –– that’s where the Stargate Project steps in –– to advance its AI systems, Musk’s xAI needs the same backing. xAI has reportedly spent around $12 billion on a single AI data centre. But Donald Trump’s support for the Stargate Project, which has a $500 billion investment plan, has added fuel to the fire.  Musk has accused Altman of being a ""liar"" for demanding $10 billion from his new company after testifying that he won't be taking compensations from OpenAI. He has also suggested in a post on X that Altman’s new initiative lacks sufficient funds. “They don’t actually have the money,” he wrote in a post replying to OpenAI’s announcement of the Stargate Project. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority,” Musk added. Altman’s new initiative is led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with the latter responsible for managing the financial aspect of things. Altman quickly responded to Musk’s claims. “Wrong, as you sure know,” wrote the OpenAI CEO as he denied Musk’s accusations. “Want to come visit the first site already underway? This is great for the country. I realise what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you'll mostly put [America] first”, Altman’s post on X read. 
 


Elon Musk is heading a newly formed US advisory commission called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that has been tasked with proposing ways to make federal agencies more efficient. The DOGE commission was first announced last year and as Trump was officially sworn in on Monday, it was made more official with an executive order signed by the new US president.Musk is now digging up old tweets by Altman, some of which reveal him writing about stopping Trump from being re-election as the US president.
 


Musk has also shared posts on X that accuse Altman of ""funding Axios, which pushes against Trump and anti-American propaganda"". 
 


advertisementIn response to accusations of being anti-Trump, Sam Altman also responded by saying that his perspective has really changed about the new US President. 
 


In a separate post, Altman also said that he thinks Musk is “not a nice person”. “I don’t think he's a nice person or treating us fairly but you have to respect the guy and he pushes all of us to be more ambitious,” his post read. 
 


The Elon Musk vs Sam Altman drama has been going on for years, and it doesn’t seem to be remotely close to ending any time soon –– primarily because what started as a debate over OpenAI’s original mission has now escalated into a super-publicised feud of egos and ambitions, and OpenAI’s new Stargate Project is the latest hot button.

For the longest time, leaks around the device have dropped left, right and centre, giving us a good idea of its expected features, software, and possible launch timeline. Alongside the affordable iPhone SE, new details about the next-generation iPad 11, iPad Air, and MacBook Air models have also emerged, setting the stage for an exciting first quarter of 2025 for Apple enthusiasts. As per the latest rumours, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to ship with iOS 18.3 preinstalled, as will the upcoming iPads with iPadOS 18.3. A private social media account, known for its reliable Apple-related leaks, has shared build numbers for these software versions — iOS 18.3 (22D8062) for the iPhone SE 4, and iPadOS 18.3 (22D2060 and 22D2062) for the iPad 11 and iPad Air. While the exact launch date remains unclear, the information hints at an announcement before the iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 rollout, suggesting a March or April launch window. In terms of design, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to resemble the standard iPhone 14 or the upcoming iPhone 16, making it a major upgrade over its predecessor. Rumoured features include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, and the addition of a USB-C port — a welcome change that will bring it in line with the latest-generation iPhone models. Performance-wise, the iPhone SE 4 will reportedly house a newer A-series chip, possibly the A17 Pro, along with 8GB of RAM. This upgrade is big, as it positions the device to support Apple Intelligence features, like advanced machine learning and on-device AI tasks. It will also debut Apple’s first in-house 5G modem, potentially improving connectivity and reducing reliance on Qualcomm. Coming to the iPads — they are also shaping up to be promising upgrades. The iPad 11 is expected to feature the A17 Pro chip and 8GB of RAM, mirroring the iPhone SE 4 when it comes to hardware prowess. As for the iPad Air, there’s some debate about its processor. While earlier rumours hinted at the M3 chip, recent leaks suggest Apple might opt for the more powerful M4 chip, aligning it with the latest iPad Pro models. Meanwhile, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M4 chip are reportedly on track to launch earlier than the iPhone SE 4 and the new iPads. Mark Gurman has repeatedly emphasised that the upcoming MacBook Air is already in production, with a release as early as January or February 2025 looking increasingly likely.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

Notably, the iPhone 16 Pro Max comes with 8GB RAM, whereas the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has 12GB RAM. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs iPhone 16 Pro: Specs Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra makes significant strides in design, performance, and functionality. Its display has been upgraded to a larger 6.9-inch screen, an increase from the previous 6.8 inches, and now features more rounded edges, moving away from the sharper Galaxy Note aesthetic. Despite the size increase, the Ultra is lighter, weighing just 218 grams, while still retaining the reliable 5,000mAh battery that has powered Ultra models since the Galaxy S20 Ultra.   A key highlight is the revamped camera system. The 200-megapixel primary sensor is now paired with a 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera, replacing the previous 12-megapixel sensor. Additionally, there’s a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, along with a secondary 10-megapixel telephoto camera offering 3x optical zoom. The 12-megapixel front camera remains the same but is expected to deliver enhanced performance for selfies and video calls.   Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, a custom-optimised version of Qualcomm’s latest flagship chipset for 2025, designed with an advanced APU for greater efficiency and performance. iPhone 16 Pro Max: The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a 6.9-inch display, marking the largest screen ever on an iPhone. It showcases Super Retina XDR technology with Always-On and ProMotion features for a smooth and immersive visual experience. Apple has introduced a sleek new gold colour option and a highly anticipated Camera Control button exclusive to the Pro models. This button is pressure-sensitive, responding differently based on how hard you press, and it also allows you to scroll for seamless zooming.   The iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a lightweight titanium body paired with next-generation Ceramic Shield, which Apple claims is twice as durable as any other smartphone glass.   Under the hood, it is powered by the new 3nm A18 Pro chipset. Apple states that this chip features a 6-core GPU, offering 20 per cent faster performance compared to the A17 Pro. It also includes next-gen machine learning accelerators, enhanced USB 3 speeds, and ProRes video recording support, ensuring top-tier performance and efficiency. But, we ran the phone under real-life scenarios and here is our detailed review of the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 Pro Max also comes with an upgraded triple-camera system. The primary 48-megapixel Fusion camera includes a second-generation quad-pixel sensor, enabling zero shutter lag for ProRAW and HEIF photos. The camera supports 4K120 video recording and introduces a 48-megapixel ultra-wide camera with autofocus. Additionally, a 12-megapixel telephoto lens with a 5x optical zoom and 120mm focal length enhances zoom capabilities.

A new rumour suggests the iPad 11 will instead be powered by an A16 chip and won't come with Apple Intelligence support.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ipad-11-is-likely-to-launch-soon-but-will-it-support-apple-intelligence-2669061-2025-01-23,"The iPad 11 is expected to be unveiled by March or April, but questions remain about whether Apple’s upcoming entry-level tablet will support its Apple Intelligence suite of features. While Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman had confidently predicted in his Power On Newsletter, that the iPad 11 will have the hardware necessary to support these advanced AI-driven features, a new leak casts some doubt on the matter. According to an anonymous account on X (formerly Twitter) known for accurate Apple leaks, the iPad 11 will be powered with a chip identified as T8120. This identifier matches the A16 chip found in devices like the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 15 duo. The problem? The A16 chip doesn’t currently support Apple Intelligence — this is also why the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus didn’t support the features, as opposed to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which are powered by the A17 Pro chip and support Apple Intelligence.  This is also the reason that Apple Intelligence features are limited to devices with at least the A17 Pro chip and 8GB RAM, such as the latest generation iPad Mini, iPad Pro, and M1-powered iPads. So, if this leak is about the iPad 11 featuring an A16 chip paired with 6GB RAM turn accurate, it would be a modest improvement over the iPad 10, which is powered by an A14 chip with 4GB RAM. However, this hardware configuration would not meet Apple’s current minimum requirements for Apple Intelligence. So, what gives? Mark Gurman has been clear about the fact that the iPad 11 will have the A17 Pro chip and 8GB RAM, setting it up to join the Apple Intelligence ecosystem. He suggests that Apple’s upcoming entry-level tablet will bring significant performance improvements but no major design changes compared to the iPad 10. Gurman also expects Apple to release an updated Magic Keyboard accessory for the iPad 11 alongside the launch. Both sources may be correct, with Apple offering multiple configurations of the iPad 11 at different price points. For instance, a base model with the A16 chip could target budget-conscious buyers, while a higher-end version with the A17 Pro chip might cater to those who wish to have Apple Intelligence features on their devices. The iPad 10 launched in October 2022 at $449 (Rs 44,900 in India) but saw a price cut to $349 (Rs 34,900 in India) in mid-2024. If the iPad 11 starts at the same price point, it could make sense for Apple to introduce a range of options to appeal to more buyers. Of course, Apple has yet to confirm any details, so speculation continues to swirl. Either way, the iPad 11 — with or without Apple Intelligence — should offer improved performance over its predecessor.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/govt-asks-google-apple-to-pre-install-state-owned-apps-on-their-smartphones-report-2669083-2025-01-23,"The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has reached out to Google, Apple and other OEMs to open up a state-backed app store. According to the latest report, published by Bloomberg, the ministry has contacted smartphone companies to work out its idea -- creating government-app suite. The report states that the officials reached out to Apple and Google executives last month, requesting them to grant Indian users direct access to the government’s range of apps. With this move, the ministry is focused on increasing the reach of its public welfare services using technology. It also wants the state-supported app suite to come pre-installed on devices before they hit the market and to be downloadable from third-party sources without triggering warnings. Officials requested the tech companies to include the state-backed GOV.in app store in their marketplaces, such as Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store, according to reported sources who spoke anonymously as the discussions have not been made public.  That said, both Google and Apple are unlikely to agree to the requests. The report said, ""Google, whose Android operating system accounts for more than 90% of the country’s roughly 700 million smartphones, is pushing back on the initiative, the people said, adding that Apple is also unlikely to agree. In the meeting, government officials discussed the possibility of a policy mandate or using legal measures to get Apple and Google to comply."" Currently, the government's apps are accessible individually through Apple and Google digital stores in India. However, officials believe that bundling these apps into a GOV.in app suite within the stores could significantly increase their usage. Notably, this is not an aloof idea. Apple has done in for Russia in 2021. It offered an option for users to install government-suggested applications, complying with local regulations.  Likewise, India also wants to make a separate app-suit for its citizens. The nation has frequently taken a leading role in implementing stringent regulations on global tech companies. For instance, the 2020 ban on the video app TikTok and a legal demand for Meta to grant access to encrypted WhatsApp messages under certain conditions-- a move the US social media giant has challenged in court. New Delhi's tech policies often set a precedent for other nations, posing significant challenges for major technology firms. Looking at the rise in smartphone usage and vulnerabilities, a strict approach becomes important. If Apple and Google comply with the request, it could improve the cybercrime statistics in the country. Apple and Google, which typically retain 30 per cent of app revenue, actively manage developers' contributions to their platforms, ensuring reduced exposure to viruses, cyber threats, and faulty software. These companies maintain tight control over their app stores, a key factor enabling them to wield significant influence over smartphones worldwide.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Tune InAlso read |  ChatGPT data removal in India will breach US legal obligations, OpenAI tells Delhi High CourtAlso read |  Donald Trump says he is okay with Elon Musk buying TikTok: Will the app return to India?Also read |  OpenAI may launch its AI super agent called Operator as early as this weekMust Watch

The biggest rumour was around the AI company working on artificial general intelligence (AGI). Several reports even suggested that this year OpenAI will roll out AGI. However, very recently OpenAI CEO Sam Altman busted that rumour saying the company has not even started work on AGI, forget launching it. That said, Altman may have denied reports on launching an AGI system, but has been frequently talking about AI agents. He even wrote in a post earlier this week, that AI agents will become a part of the workforce in 2025.  While OpenAI has not yet spoken about a launch, there are many reports that claim that the company is preparing to launch its AI agent by the end of this month, with several of them suggesting January 30 as the date of launch. But now, a new report suggests it could launch as early as this week, according to a report by The Information.  Rumoured to be called the Operator, the AI super agent is believed to have “PhD-level intelligence”. The AI agent is believed to be able to handle complex tasks like booking a table at a restaurant on your behalf, or booking a flight ticket for you, or any other talks that require multiple steps and actions. 
The reports about the launch of OpenAI’s agentic AI also seem like it is because of a recent blog post about the company’s CEO where he wrote about humanity stepping into the “Intelligence age”. In another post he also spoke about “AI agents joining the workforce” and “changing the output of companies” in 2025. Separately, earlier this week, Altman also popped the bubble of AI-enthusiasts about AGI launching this year. He dismissed the conversation around AGI as just Twitter hype, and said that the company is working on something cool, but people need to reduce their expectations of it by 100 times. “Twitter hype is out of control again. We are not gonna deploy AGI next month, nor have we built it. We have some very cool stuff for you but pls chill and cut your expectations 100x!” Altman wrote in a post. The rumour about the launch of the AI agent system comes on the heels of OpenAI's announcement about a new AI company called The Stargate Project, which is aimed at building AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. The initiative is led by OpenAI and SoftBank. OpenAI has announced an ambitious investment of $500 billion in the project in the next four years, with the deployment of $100 billion immediately.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Also read |  OpenAI announces new company called Stargate Project, will invest $500 billion to develop AI data centresAlso read |  â Elon Musk vs Sam Altman: As Trump backs OpenAI's Stargate Project, Musk lashes out and calls him a liar

The feature allows users to quickly find information by circling, scribbling, or tapping on anything they see on their Android screen. It was initially launched last year with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series. Now, as Samsung has unveiled its new generation of flagships – the Galaxy S25 series – Google has announced new improvements for the Circle to Search feature, which will make the new Galaxy phones smarter. During the Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung revealed that it had doubled down on its collaboration with Google. Following this partnership, Google’s Gemini AI will be the default smart assistant on all three new Galaxy S25 devices – Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. But that’s not all. Bringing more AI powers to Galaxy devices, Google has announced new upgrades to the Circle to Search feature, including AI Overviews and one-tap interactions.AI overviews for visual searches The most notable addition to Circle to Search is the integration of AI Overviews. Previously, the feature would generate a list of Google search results based on the selected content. The new update will now provide users AI-generated summaries of the circles subject for visual searches. These AI summaries, according to Google, will deliver more context and deeper insights without requiring users to leave the app and search on the web. For instance, circling a photo of any dish on a plate will provide a concise overview of the dish and even its origin or related details. With this update, Google aims to offer users a quicker and easier way to use the Circle to Search features and understand anything at a glance.One-tap actions Another upgrade to the Circle to Search feature is the addition of one-tap actions for recognised phone numbers, email addresses, and URLs on the subject of the visual search . With this update, users will be able to directly call, email, or visit a website without any extra steps.First for the Galaxy S25 series  Just like last year, Google is first rolling out these new upgrades for Circle to Search with the Galaxy S25 series. However, the feature will not be exclusive to Galaxy phones. With the launch of Pixel phones later in the year, the feature will arrive in Google's own flagship devices. In fact, Google plans to roll out the enhanced Circle to Search experience across all Android devices that support the feature. Initially, these updates will be available in English, with potential expansion to other languages in the future.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Also Read |  Is your Aadhaar safe?

The device, developed in collaboration with Google, marks Samsung's first foray into the realm of Extended Reality (XR) and was showcased at the Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose, California. With the headset expected to launch in 2025, the South Korean tech giant is aiming to make its presence felt in VR space. Project Moohan will be powered by a Qualcomm chipset and run on Android XR, a new operating system developed by Google specifically for XR devices. This collaboration ensures a seamless experience, bringing popular Google features and services to the headset. One such feature is Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, which will give users access to device controls and real-time information based on what they’re viewing. Google Maps, for example, is expected to get a futuristic upgrade when experienced in XR, kind of similar to what Apple users experience on the Vision Pro. Samsung’s VR headset will offer a mixed-reality experience, allowing users to remain present in the real world while overlaying virtual elements. Like other XR devices, it will also provide the option to fully immerse oneself in virtual reality. Samsung has been working on creating a headset that is lightweight and ergonomically designed for maximum comfort, though details about its weight and design are still under wraps. Samsung’s announcement comes as competition in the XR space heats up. While the Apple Vision Pro has already set benchmarks for mixed-reality headsets, it also left room for improvement in areas like pricing and user comfort. Samsung appears to be positioning itself as a more accessible option, learning from Apple’s early feedback. Despite similarities in functionality with devices like the Vision Pro, Samsung's headset aims to carve out its own identity by leveraging Android XR and Google’s ecosystem of apps. This partnership could prove to be a key differentiator, offering a familiar and versatile experience to Android users. Details about Project Moohan are still sparse, as Samsung is likely fine-tuning the design and finalising hardware specifications. Some industry insiders speculate that the company is waiting to see how competitors, including Apple, go forward with their products. Reports of an Apple Vision Pro 2 in development might influence Samsung's strategy. With the Samsung VR headset expected to hit the market in 2025, the focus will be on balancing performance, comfort, and cost. Extended reality is still finding its place in the mainstream, and devices that can provide a comfortable and affordable experience are likely to resonate with users.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

Reliance aims to power it with renewable energy and lower AI computing costs for India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/mukesh-ambani-buys-nvidia-ai-chips-plans-to-build-largest-data-centre-in-india-report-2669382-2025-01-24,"Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, is reportedly planning to build what could become the world’s largest data centre in Jamnagar, Gujarat, India. The facility, expected to boast a total capacity of three gigawatts, would be a huge move in India’s tech landscape, easily outpacing current global benchmarks by a big margin. For comparison, the largest operational data centres today, mostly located in the United States, are under one gigawatt. To support this ambitious move, Reliance is procuring advanced AI semiconductors from Nvidia Corporation. These high-performance chips are essential for the complex computations required by AI-driven tools, such as ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms. The timing of Mukesh Ambani’s move is no coincidence. Globally, tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have been spending billions of dollars on expanding data centre capacities to keep up with the high demand for AI services. Earlier this week, a consortium including OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle announced plans to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure under a project called Stargate. If this initiative goes ahead as planned, Ambani’s Jamnagar facility will not only surpass existing data centre capacities but also give India a competitive edge in the growing AI market. As of now, India’s total data centre capacity — just like the USA — is under one gigawatt. Tripling this capacity in one project would be a major milestone for the country, potentially accelerating its AI development. While the scale of the project is unprecedented, so is its estimated cost. Building such a massive facility could require an investment of $20 to $30 billion, according to industry estimates. Although Reliance Industries has about $26 billion in cash reserves, funding such a project would still be a challenge. The company has not commented on the reports yet. Ambani’s strategy appears similar to his approach in the telecom sector, where Reliance Jio disrupted the market by offering services at affordable prices. This time, the aim is to lower the cost of AI inferencing — the computational process behind running AI models — which can be prohibitively expensive for startups and established firms alike. Jamnagar, already the site of Reliance’s oil refining and petrochemical operations, will now play a central role in the company’s push for renewable energy and AI. The data centre is expected to be powered largely by green energy, with Reliance building solar, wind, and green hydrogen projects nearby. However, experts point out that maintaining a continuous energy supply for such a massive facility may still require fossil fuels or large battery storage systems. Ambani has made it clear that his ultimate goal is to make AI accessible to everyone in India. “We want to offer the lowest AI inferencing costs in the world, making AI affordable and available to all,” he said last year.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

OpenAI plans to expand it to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and integrate these capabilities into ChatGPT in the future.
 


 In the blog, OpenAI states, “Operator is powered by a new model called Computer-Using Agent (CUA). Combining GPT-4o's vision capabilities with advanced reasoning through reinforcement learning, CUA is trained to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs)—the buttons, menus, and text fields people see on a screen.“  The operator can ""see"" the browser through screenshots and ""interact"" with it using standard mouse and keyboard actions, allowing it to perform tasks on the web without the need for custom API integrations. But is it better when it comes to hallucinations? OpenAI explains that if the Operator faces challenges or errors, it can use its reasoning abilities to correct itself. If it reaches an impasse and requires help, it seamlessly hands control back to the user, ensuring a fluid and cooperative experience. 
 


 Similar to using multiple tabs on a browser, users can have Operator run multiple tasks simultaneously by creating new conversations. o3-mini to come to free users  Just as OpenAI introduced Operator, its first AI agent, CEO Sam Altman took to X (formerly Twitter), saying that the company has decided to introduce o3-mini in the free tier.
 


 The o3-mini marks a significant advancement over its predecessor, the o1-mini, by integrating enhanced reasoning capabilities that enable step-by-step logical analysis. This AI model is yet to see the day of light. According to Altman, it could be launched within 2-weeks.

e2729339-dc36-42ae-b765-370f093590c0,Trump dismisses Elon Musk's complaint about Altman's Stargate ProjectDonald Trump says Elon Musk hates one of the people who are part of the Stargate Project deal. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/trump-disregards-elon-musks-complaint-about-stargate-says-he-hates-one-of-the-people-in-the-deal-2669400-2025-01-24,"Elon Musk and Sam Altman on Thursday had an ugly back and forth on X, which was largely centred around Sam Altman’s new company called the Stargate Project. Musk accused the company of having no money, and in a separate post he also called Altman a liar. Altman also fired back at his posts. Now, commenting on the online fight between the two, Trump has dismissed Musk’s complaints saying “he hates one of the people in the deal”.  “I’ve spoken to Elon, but — spoken to all of them, actually. The people in the deal are very, very smart people – but Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. But I have certain hatreds of people too,” Trump said at the White House, according to a report by CNN Business.  Trump’s comment about Musk hating someone was a clear suggestion that he was talking about Altman. Musk and Altman have a longstanding feud going on, which is largely based on the SpaceX CEO’s argument that OpenAI –– a company that he set up along with Altman –– has moved away from its original mission. OpenAI, he says, was supposed to be open-source and non-profit. However, he has accused Altman of now being driven by a money-making agenda, forgetting the original purpose behind setting up the company.  One of the tweets that Musk posted about Altman on Thursday was again about the money he would make through the Stargate project. Musk claims that in spite of testifying to the congress that he would not take any compensation from OpenAI, now with the setup of the new AI Stargate Project, Altman is seeking 7 per cent of the company, which would apparently be equal to $10 billion.  Musk also tweeted saying that SoftBank and OpenAI, the two companies that will be leading the Stargate Project initiative, “don’t actually have the money”. “SoftBank has well under $10 billion secured. I have that on good authority,” Musk said in a tweet.  To this, Trump responded saying: “I don’t know if they do, but you know, they’re putting up the money –– the government’s not putting up anything, they’re putting up money. They’re very rich people, so I hope they do.” During the Trump inauguration, OpenAI and Softbank announced the new AI company, the Stargate Project. The initiative– which will have an ambitious investment of $500 billion– is backed by the US President. The company is aimed at building AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States.  Besides the online fight on Thursday, Elon Musk and Sam Altman are also tangled in lawsuits, which also go back to Musk’s accusation that OpenAI has moved away from its original purpose.

The scam, which spanned several months, involved scammers impersonating government officials and making the victim buy multiple policies with the promise of high maturity benefits. According to the police complaint, as reported by the Indian Express, the fraud began at the end of 2023 and continued until recently. During this time, the victim received several calls from individuals posing as government officials, including those from reputed agencies like the Ministry of Finance, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The scammers claimed to represent these organizations and offered the victim several insurance policies with guaranteed high maturity benefits. To further establish their credibility, the scammers even misused the names of prominent personalities such as Deendayal Upadhyaya, along with fictitious titles of finance experts and government officials. The calls were so convincing that the victim ended up believing them. Over time, the victim was coaxed into purchasing various insurance policies and was asked to pay multiple charges, including GST, Income Tax, TDS, transaction fees, verification charges, and NOC charges. According to the report, the criminals operated under at least 19 different identities to maintain their deception. Each time the victim followed the instructions to send money for policies, the scammers asked her to transfer additional funds under the pretext of processing or recovery fees. As the scam progressed, the victim even started receiving calls from purported officials who claimed her previous payments had been diverted to fraudulent accounts. To recover those funds, she was instructed to make further payments, causing her to lose even more money. During the scam period, the victim lost her savings while being threatened and manipulated by the scammers. While the case is under investigation, individuals are urged not to fall for such calls or offers that sound too good to be true. Note that cyber frauds involving insurance and financial benefits are becoming increasingly common in the country. To protect yourself, it’s crucial to follow these safety measures: If you receive calls from unknown persons asking about investments, always cross-check the identity of the callers claiming to represent government agencies or financial institutions. Use official contact details available on their websites. Never share personal or financial details, including bank account numbers, OTPs, or policy numbers, over the phone or with someone you barely know. Be skeptical of unrealistic offers. Investments that guarantee high returns or benefits should raise red flags. Be cautious about requests for payments such as GST, TDS, or other fees. If you need to send money, always first confirm the legitimacy of such demands with the concerned organization.

The much-anticipated action also ordered that banking services for crypto companies be protected, alluding to industry claims that US regulators have directed lenders to cut crypto companies off from banking services - something regulators deny. The order also banned the creation of central bank digital currencies in the US which could compete with existing cryptocurrencies. In another key action pushed for by the crypto industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission late on Thursday rescinded accounting guidance that had made it very expensive for some listed companies to safeguard crypto assets on behalf of third parties. The crypto industry said that guidance had stymied digital asset adoption. On the campaign trail, Trump courted crypto cash by pledging to be a ""crypto president"" and promote the adoption of digital assets. That is in stark contrast to former President Joe Biden's regulators which, in a bid to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering, cracked down on the industry, suing exchanges Coinbase, Binance and dozens more, alleging they were flouting US laws. The companies deny the allegations. Thursday's order was cheered by the crypto industry, which had been pushing for the new administration to send a strong signal of support in Trump's first few days in office. ""Today’s crypto executive order marks a sea change in US digital asset policy,"" said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto company Anchorage Digital. ""By taking a whole-of-government approach to crypto, the Administration is making a significant first step toward writing clear, consistent rules of the road."" If implemented by the relevant regulators, Trump's order has the potential to push cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, regulatory and crypto experts said. It follows Tuesday's SEC announcement that it was creating a taskforce to overhaul crypto policy. Bitcoin hit a fresh record high of $109,071 on Monday amid investor excitement over the new crypto-friendly administration, although it was down to about $103,000 as of late Thursday afternoon. ""Just days into his administration, President Trump is delivering on his promises... to keep the United States a leader in digital assets innovation,"" Senator Tim Scott, the Republican chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. The industry has for years argued existing US regulations are inappropriate for cryptocurrencies and have called for Congress and regulators to write new ones clarifying when a crypto token is a security, commodity or falls into another category. The working group, which will include the Treasury secretary, chairs of the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with other agency heads, is tasked with developing a regulatory framework for digital assets, according to the order. That includes stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the US dollar. The group is also set to ""evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile... potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts."" The order did not provide further details on how such a stockpile would be set up and analysts and legal experts are divided on whether an act of Congress will be necessary. Some have argued the reserve could be created via the US Treasury's Exchange Stabilisation Fund, which can be used to purchase or sell foreign currencies, and to also hold bitcoin. In December, Trump named venture capitalist and former PayPal, opens new tab executive David Sacks as the crypto and artificial intelligence czar. He will chair the group, the order said.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Tune InMust Watch

As the popular social media app remains unavailable for new downloads, iPhones with TikTok already installed are popping up on eBay, with some sellers demanding mind-boggling prices of up to $25,000 (roughly Rs 21.6 lakh). The situation stems from a temporary ban that saw TikTok removed from the Apple and Google app stores in the U.S. Although the app has recently become accessible again for millions of users who already had it downloaded, others who deleted it or never installed it are still unable to find it in the stores. This has created a market for phones with the TikTok app pre-installed. Listings for these devices on eBay reveal a wide range of prices. While some sellers are asking for hundreds of dollars, others are going to extremes. For instance, an iPhone 15 Pro Max with TikTok installed was recently listed for $10,000 (roughly Rs 8.62 lakh) by a seller in Florida. Another user in North Carolina listed an iPhone 16 Pro Max for a staggering $25,000 (roughly Rs 21.6 lakh). In one case, an iPhone 15 Pro with TikTok and ByteDance’s video-editing app CapCut installed was listed for a staggering $4.5 million (roughly Rs 38.81 crores). Despite these crazy high price tags, it’s unclear whether such phones are actually selling. Many listings have drawn attention, with some receiving thousands of views, but most devices don’t appear to have active bids. The phones that do have offers tend to be older models priced much more modestly, between $100 and $200 (roughly between Rs 8,600 to Rs 17,200). The demand for these TikTok-equipped phones comes as users wait for the app’s official return to the app stores. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order delaying the enforcement of the TikTok ban has given some hope. However, there is still no timeline for when the app might be reinstated. Trump has suggested the possibility of a joint venture where the U.S. would own 50 per cent of the app or even a potential sale to high-profile figures such as Tesla’s Elon Musk or Oracle’s Larry Ellison. General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, a major investor in TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon. Speaking at an event in Davos, Switzerland, Ford suggested that discussions involving both the Chinese and U.S. governments are moving forward and could yield results by the end of the week.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

While the post is a little cryptic, the teaser shows a drawing of screws and other consols suggest that the Nothing Phone (3) might continue the legacy of a transparent back case. A few weeks ago, CEO Carl Pei said 2025 is going to be the company's biggest year so far, thanks to the launch of the Nothing Phone (3). He added that the phone will mark the Nothing's first step towards its AI-powered platform.

It means that Nothing is planning to launch its CMF Phone 2. Hence, the design could also be the one featuring in the upcoming CMF Phone 2.

However, if the Nothing Phone (3) is to launch in March, which is just a month later, it makes more sense to share details around it. Nothing Phone (3) launch: What do we know so far The highly anticipated Nothing Phone (3) is set to introduce several exciting features, including an iPhone-inspired Action Button and a 6.5-inch display, according to recent leaks. Additionally, a Pro variant is also rumoured to debut alongside it, featuring a larger 6.7-inch screen. Previously, Pei and his team hinted at advanced AI integration in the upcoming Phone (3). The device aims to deliver a highly personalised user experience, with AI seamlessly woven into the operating system. A revamped home screen is speculated to be among the first significant upgrades driven by this integration. Based on its predecessor, the Nothing Phone (3) could feature a mid-range chipset, such as the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 or the MediaTek Dimensity 9200+. In comparison, the previous Nothing Phone (2), equipped with the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, entered the premium segment. But, it is important to note that since the phone will come with several advanced AI-powered features, like personal assistant, it might need a better and stronger processor.

A full release is expected in Q2.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/android-16-first-public-will-roll-out-today-set-to-bring-live-updates-to-your-phones-lockscreen-2669424-2025-01-24,"Google is rolling out the first public beta of Android 16 today, giving early testers a chance to see what the next version of the company’s operating system has in store. This release comes with some big updates, including dynamic notifications for live activities and a push to ensure apps work better on larger screens like foldables and tablets. One of the standout features in Android 16 is called Live Updates, which are real-time notifications designed to help users keep track of ongoing activities like ride-sharing, food deliveries, and navigation. Think of it as Android’s answer to Apple’s Live Activities, introduced in 2022. However, Google’s version is more focused. Unlike Apple’s approach — which supports everything from sports scores to shopping updates — Android’s Live Updates currently only work with progress trackers for specific apps. Interestingly, Samsung showcased a similar feature during the launch of its Galaxy S25 phones during Galaxy Unpacked. Named the Now Bar, Samsung’s take on live notifications appears as a floating bar at the bottom of the lock screen and supports various app types, including sports updates. In contrast, Android 16’s Live Updates are pinned to the top of the standard notification stack, staying true to Android’s simpler design. The Android 16 public beta also brings a change aimed at improving how apps work across devices with different screen sizes. Developers will now have to make their apps resizable, ensuring they run seamlessly on tablets and foldable phones. This means apps will open in full-screen on larger displays and allow users to multitask more easily. For now, developers can opt out of this requirement, but by the time Android 17 arrives in 2026, resizable apps will be mandatory. Games, however, are exempt from this rule. Aside from these changes, Android 16 is adding other features, such as support for the Advanced Professional Video (APV) codec, improved vertical text rendering, and scene detection in camera apps to enable night mode automatically. These features build on improvements introduced in earlier developer betas, such as richer haptic controls, a more refined photo picker menu, and the Health Connect app for sharing medical data across apps securely. Another interesting development is Google’s work on its Gemini AI assistant. Gemini now supports multi-app prompts, though compatibility is currently limited to Google’s apps, a few from Samsung, and third-party platforms like Spotify and WhatsApp. Google promises broader support soon. The Android 16 public beta is available starting today for Pixel 6 and newer devices, as well as the Pixel Tablet. If you’re not ready to dive into beta software, you won’t have to wait long. Google plans to release the stable version of Android 16 by Q2 this year, much earlier than its usual late-summer launch schedule.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

Now, after this teaser, the phone has been spotted on the 3C certificate website, giving a hint of other details, especially the battery capacity. Tipster Abhishek Yadav (@yabhishekhd) has recently posted on X that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge might pack a 3900mAh battery.

Notably, the Samsung Galaxy S25's vanilla variant houses a 4,000 with 25W charging support. This indicates that with the Edge model, the company is not cutting the edges to an extreme point to make it slim. Previous leaks indicate that it will be significantly thinner than the 7.6mm Galaxy S24. Hence, it is a win-win over the S24 from both thickness and battery perspective.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/nobody-in-their-right-mind-will-use-genai-llms-in-the-next-5-years-meta-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-2669493-2025-01-24,"Speaking at a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Meta chief AI scientist, Yann Le Cunn, has predicted “a new paradigm shift of AI architectures”. He says that the AI we know right now, which is generative AI and large language models (LLMs), are not capable of much. They get the basics done but still fall short. And in the next five years, “nobody in their right mind would use them anymore”, he said. “I think the shelf life of the current [AI] paradigm is fairly short, probably three to five years,” LeCun added.  “We’re going to see the emergence of a new paradigm for AI architectures, which may not have the limitations of current AI systems,” he predicts.
The Meta chief AI scientist also believes that in the next few years we could be living in the “decade of robotics” where we will see a whole new application of the technology that will combine robots and AI.  LeCun also explains why he thinks the current AI models aren't capable of doing much. He gives four reasons for that. One, he says, the current models lack the awareness and understanding of the physical world. Two, there is a limitation to how much it remembers at once and does not have a continuous memory. Three, it lacks the power of reasoning. And four, it is unable to perform complex planning tasks.  “So there’s going to be another revolution of AI over the next few years. We may have to change the name of it, because it’s probably not going to be generative in the sense that we understand it today,” LeCun says.  LeCun points out that the “AI revolution” could be some 10 years away, but with the way AI is progressing right now, the big change could be closer. “LLMs are good at manipulating language, but not at thinking,” LeCun said.  While “Debating Technology” at Davos, LeCun may have also revealed what Meta’s AI labs are working on right now. “So that’s what we’re working on — having systems build mental models of the world. If the plan that we’re working on succeeds, with the timetable that we hope, within three to five years we’ll have systems that are a completely different paradigm,” he said. “They may have some level of common sense. They may be able to learn how the world works from observing the world and maybe interacting with it.” Interestingly, as the Meta AI chief scientist spoke about the current AI and LLM models’ lack of performing complex tasks, OpenAI and Perplexity on Friday, unveiled new agentic AI, which they claim excel at performing complex, multi-step tasks. For instance, OpenAI’s AI agent called Operator –– which is unfortunately available only in the US right now –– is capable of ordering groceries for you if you give it a shopping list, or it can book flight tickets for you if you share your itinerary with it. It can also create memes for you. Basically, anything you do on the web, the agentic AI can do on your behalf.

He used the watch to track his lifestyle and identified how unhealthy habits were impacting his sleep. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/whole-foods-founder-uses-apple-watch-to-get-rid-of-his-drinking-habit-says-it-changed-his-life-2669532-2025-01-24,"We have seen many reports about how the Apple Watch saved the lives of individuals from fatal accidents. Time and again, Apple’s smartwatch has been praised for its ability to protect users during emergencies. However, it seems like the Apple Watch is not just guarding users from emergency situations but is also proving to be a powerful tool for promoting healthier lifestyles. In fact for Whole Foods Founder John Mackey his Apple Watch even helped him get rid of his alcohol addiction.  Mackey, in his recent conversation with Business Insider, revealed that three years ago, he started his alcohol-free journey, and thanks to insights from the Apple Watch, he was able to overcome his addiction. He shared that he had been tracking his sleep using the Apple Watch, which showed him that on some days, he was getting good sleep, while on others, he was not. In fact, his deep sleep was the most affected. ""So, I started to ask the question, 'Well, what did I do differently when I didn't sleep well?’"" he told Business Insider. Using these sleep insights, Mackey shares that he happened to track his lifestyle and was finally able to identify three factors affecting his sleep: alcohol, irregular eating habits, and exercise. ""One was how much exercise I did—more exercise led to better sleep. Second was if I ate a big meal late, I didn't sleep very well. And third was if I drank any alcohol at all, my deep sleep went to zero. I didn't get any deep sleep,"" he said. He even tracked his sleep whenever he had a drink, and his Apple Watch helped him figure out that whenever he consumed alcohol, his deep sleep was highly impacted. ""Total sleep would drop, on average, about an hour (when drunk)...,"" he revealed. Thanks to all this data, Mackey shared that he started leaning toward a healthier lifestyle and ultimately decided to quit alcohol altogether. According to the Sleep Foundation, a study based on approximately 160,000 participants found that nearly 90 per cent of respondents who regularly consumed alcohol in the evening reported at least one sleep-related problem. While Apple does offer sleep tracking in its iPhone and Watch, Mackey also noted that he used an app on the Apple Watch—AutoSleep—to track his sleep. The app is a paid one, available on iOS. But it’s not just sleep; the Whole Foods founder also mentioned that he has been using other health features like heart rate, blood pressure, and other trackers on the Watch to monitor his lifestyle and make conscious decisions accordingly. ""We can create plans for people and monitor them to help people be the healthiest versions of themselves,"" he said. Notably, during the launch of the Apple Watch 10, Apple introduced a new sleep apnoea detection feature for users. This feature aims to help users track their sleep and specifically assist in detecting and tracking sleep apnoea, a condition often left undiagnosed in millions. Apple explained that this new feature uses the Watch's accelerometer to monitor breathing disturbances during sleep. The feature can detect signs of moderate to severe sleep apnoea. “The Sleep Apnoea Notifications feature can look for breathing disturbances while you're sleeping and notify you if they show consistent signs.”Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Also Read |  Retired bank manager from Pune loses Rs 2.22 crore after buying multiple insurance policiesAlso Read |  ChatGPT down: Both web and app versions not opening for many usersAlso Read |  Google is making Circle to Search feature smarter, new update coming first to Galaxy S25 series

Here is how much we expect it to be priced in India when it launches in the country.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-finally-teased-will-it-be-cheaper-than-standard-s25-model-2669577-2025-01-24,"Samsung just launched the latest Galaxy S25 series at its Unpacked event and while we were expecting to see three flagship phones, no one knew it had one more device up its sleeve to surprise fans - the Galaxy S25 Edge. But, could this be the Galaxy S25 Slim that has been in the rumour mill for a few months now? Well, it is likely the same device if we go by the small teaser video Samsung showed at the end of the event. It confirmed a few things about the Galaxy S25 Edge, which also makes us question whether it could be cheaper than the standard S25 model. Let's see.advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Will it be cheaper than standard S25 model?Well, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is tipped to debut in May 2025 and while we are just about three months away, there is no leak yet on its pricing. Now the question of whether this could be cheaper than the standard Galaxy S25 model actually depends on the tech it will offer. Let's first talk about the confirmed and leaked features so far.The teasers have shown that the device will have a very slim form factor, with rumours claiming it to be as thin as 6.4mm. This is super thin and also very cool, but we also see a prominent camera bump at the back. This will likely make the device wobble when put on a flat surface, but then people also want both a bigger, better camera on a high-end phone and a slimmer design.  Well, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is tipped to debut in May 2025 and while we are just about three months away, there is no leak yet on its pricing. Now the question of whether this could be cheaper than the standard Galaxy S25 model actually depends on the tech it will offer. Let's first talk about the confirmed and leaked features so far. The teasers have shown that the device will have a very slim form factor, with rumours claiming it to be as thin as 6.4mm. This is super thin and also very cool, but we also see a prominent camera bump at the back. This will likely make the device wobble when put on a flat surface, but then people also want both a bigger, better camera on a high-end phone and a slimmer design.  Now, the phone will have two cameras at the back - as shown in the official video - compared to the triple camera system seen on the Galaxy S25 and its Plus model. So, we might see a main camera and an ultra-wide sensor on the rear panel of the Galaxy S25 Edge because you can't expect to see a telephoto sensor here. The leaks have repeatedly suggested that the back camera setup will have a 200-megapixel main sensor and a 50-megapixel ultrawide sensor, a setup similar to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.
 


 Also, there is no official information on the chipset part, but leaks claim that it will offer the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, coupled with a 3,900mAh battery. We could also see it having the display size of the S25 Plus as per leaks - a 6.7-inch panel. But, what might differentiate the Galaxy S25 Edge from the Plus model is its use of tandem OLED display tech, which will help Samsung keep the form factor thin while also offering a big bright screen. We have seen this panel on Apple's iPad Pro. It basically needs no backlight and the tandem OLED tech ""emits light through each pixel, allowing for a thinner display. To deliver extreme high brightness over a large, expansive display, iPad Pro uses a Tandem OLED design — with two OLED panels,"" according to Apple. So, what am I trying to say here? Well, on the whole, it will reportedly have a new OLED display tech, a super thin profile, the latest flagship chip, and a dual rear camera system similar to the S25 Ultra. So, it could be positioned between the regular Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus models. The leaked info suggests that the Slim model would have more to offer compared to the standard model in terms of performance and design, barring the telephoto camera and a bigger battery that you get on the vanilla S25.  For your reference, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is priced at Rs 80,999, whereas the Plus model is priced at Rs 99,999. So, there is enough of a price gap between the two phones for Samsung to fit in the new Galaxy S25 Edge model. Yes, there were a few rumours of the company planning to replace its Galaxy FE models with the latest Edge version, but it seems pretty unlikely because of its rumoured features. Oh, and the upcoming Samsung smartphone seemingly has a premium metal body design, which one can make out from its showcase at the Unpacked event. So, expect solid durability as well. But, this price part is just a speculation, based on the leaks as well as teasers. We will have to wait for the official announcement, which is likely just a few months away. You can stay tuned to India Today Tech for all the updates.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 24, 2025

The launch of these features is expected in the coming months.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-wallet-is-getting-two-big-features-tap-to-transfer-and-instant-installment-2669571-2025-01-24,"Samsung Wallet — Samsung’s digital wallet app for its Galaxy devices will be getting two big features, set to arrive later this year. The first one is peer to peer payments, known as Tap to Transfer. While the second one is a buy now pay later service called Instant Installments. Of course, the company’s goal here is to make Samsung Wallet more versatile and popular, so that more people — especially those who use Galaxy smartphones — use it for their online and offline transactions. The first feature — Tap to Transfer — allows users to send money by simply tapping two NFC-enabled devices together. Think of it as Apple's Tap to Pay feature. However, Samsung does it one better here in comparison to Apple, as you get third-party digital wallet support on Samsung Wallet. This way, Samsung’s service becomes more inclusive and useful for a wider range of users. Rather than tying the transaction directly to Samsung Wallet, Tap to Transfer works with the debit card or credit card linked to your account. Payments will be processed through Visa and Mastercard, which means you don’t need to be exclusively tied within the Samsung ecosystem to use it. The second feature — Instant Installments — takes a different approach to the growing trend of buy now pay later schemes. Do note, that, unlike other platforms, Samsung isn’t offering credit directly. Instead, it’s simplifying the process for users to turn their purchases into instalments at checkout. Samsung has described it as the first offline payment plan experience, meaning it will work both in physical stores and online. Payments will rely on Visa and Mastercard credit cards, so the feature isn't limited to Samsung Wallet users. While Instant Installments won't transform Samsung into a lender, it will help users keep track of their installment payments through the Wallet app. This could be particularly useful for managing finances more easily, as you’ll be able to see all your payments in one place. Exact details are still unknown, and how exactly the system will work remains unclear. It’s possible Samsung is focusing more on giving users better tools for payment management rather than competing head-on with established players in the credit market. Samsung has confirmed these features are not tied to the launch of the Galaxy S25 but will roll out later, possibly around March or in the second quarter of the year. They will also be available on older Galaxy devices, making them accessible to a wide user base.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-might-release-tri-fold-smartphone-with-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-all-you-need-to-know-2669445-2025-01-24,"Samsung has been working on a triple-fold smartphone for a very long time. In 2022, the company showcased a prototype of what the triple-foldable smartphone will look like. However, before this prototype could see the light of day, Huawei launched its Mate XT in China, the world's first triple-fold smartphone. And now, it is almost high time for Samsung to release its innovation into the market. According to the recent leaks, the company is planning to launch the device as early as September. Interestingly, the launch timeline of the Samsung triple-fold phone aligns perfectly with the launch of the Galaxy Z Flip 7.  Rumour has it that Samsung is planning more than just two traditional foldables this year. Apart from the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7, the company is anticipated to release a budget-friendly, Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and a triple-fold smartphone. Samsung triple-fold smartphone: Everything we know Details about Samsung's upcoming tri-fold device remain scarce, but one compelling theory suggests it could feature a 12.4-inch display when fully unfolded. This impressive screen size positions the device as a versatile hybrid, potentially replacing both traditional smartphones and tablets, and outclassing the 10.2-inch display of Huawei’s Mate X3. Additionally, a partially unfolded mode offering a screen size of approximately 10.5 inches could further enhance its appeal with a premium viewing experience.   Rumours also hint at the absence of under-display camera technology. While this decision could improve the quality of the front-facing camera, it would likely require a **hole-punch cutout** on the main screen, slightly affecting the device's seamless design. However, this trade-off might prove worthwhile for users prioritising superior camera performance.Samsung Galaxy Flip 7 FE: What do we know In late November, rumours surfaced suggesting that Samsung could debut the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7. The FE model is rumoured to be powered by the Exynos 2400e, the same chipset found in the Galaxy S24 FE, offering reliable performance while allowing Samsung to maintain a more affordable price point. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to feature the more advanced Exynos 2500, a next-generation processor that has yet to be officially announced. In a related affair, Samsung has recently launched its flagship series -- Samsung Galaxy S25 series. For now, the series includes three phones: Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra. Apart from these phones, the company has also teased a new slim variant, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which is expected to be launched in May. Combining all of these new variants, it looks like the company has a lot on its plate. If these rumours are true, the triple-fold, Galaxy Z7 series (Flip and Fold), Galaxy Flip 7, and the Galaxy S25 Edge will hit the market this year only. It will be interesting to see how Samsung will pull all these launches and how the audience will take it.

This feature is designed to tackle scenarios where someone might gain access to your device even if they know your passcode, PIN, or password. With Identity Check, users will now have to authenticate themselves using biometrics like fingerprints or facial recognition when trying to access sensitive account or device settings. This follows the company's broader efforts to protect user data in case of theft, including tools like Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock. This added security measure activates only when your device is outside trusted locations, such as your home. Google hopes Identity Check will make it harder for thieves to disable anti-theft features or change your security settings. However, the feature won’t be very helpful if the person accessing your phone is already in one of these trusted locations. The concept behind Identity Check isn’t entirely new. Rumours about it began circulating last year itself hinting at its development. Now, with the feature officially available, we have a clearer picture of how it works. When you’re away from your trusted locations, any attempt to access critical settings — like changing your device's PIN, disabling theft protection, or even accessing Google’s Passkeys — will trigger a biometric authentication request. This ensures that only the rightful owner can make such changes, even if someone else has access to their password. Google detailed how the feature integrates with the Theft Protection toolset, which already includes useful safeguards. Theft Detection Lock, for example, locks your device automatically if it detects that someone has snatched it from your hand. Similarly, Offline Device Lock ensures that your phone locks shortly after it goes offline. These features, introduced in late 2024, are now globally available on Android 10 and newer devices. The rollout of Identity Check begins with Pixel phones running Android 15 QPR1 stable and eligible Samsung Galaxy devices on One UI 7. Users can access the feature by heading over to Settings > Google services and preferences > select your primary Google account > All services > Theft protection. The update is likely rolling out through the Find My Device app or Play Services. For now, it is expected that other Android device manufacturers will bring the Identity Check feature to their phones later this year.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

A leak has recently spurred confusion over the new iPhone design. The leak shared an image of a rear panel, claiming it to be iPhone 17. It sported a pill-shaped module, housing a single camera lens, which is anticipated to come in both. The phones are scheduled to launch this year. While the iPhone SE 4 is expected to launch in April, the iPhone 17 might be released in September with the rest of the iPhone 17 series.

The tipster, Majin Bu, took to X and posted an image of two rear panels. He captioned the images as ""iPhone 17"", but it is pretty clear that these images belong to either iPhone 17 Air or iPhone SE 4. The image shows that this upcoming phone will have a single camera lens with a rectangular camera panel on the top. The right side appears to house an LED flash and a small microphone opening. Now, the internet has been divided. 
 


We think this leak indicates the rear panel of the iPhone 17 Air. The only common point here, between both phones, is the single camera lens. Otherwise, the design pattern is similar to what is being anticipated for the iPhone 17 series. However, the dual-tone is missing. Adding to this narrative, an earlier leak also suggests that iPhone SE 4 will not follow this design language. There have been rumours suggesting that the next iPhone SE 4 will adopt the design of the iPhone 14.

The more premium iQOO Neo 10 version could launch later and it is likely to compete with higher-end devices like the OnePlus 13R in the Rs 40,000 price segment. Although official specifications are yet to be confirmed, leaks have already provided insights into what the Neo 10R might offer. The smartphone is rumoured to come equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. It is also expected to feature a 6,400mAh battery with 80W fast charging support, and the company is likely to include a charger in the box, a move that continues iQOO’s customer-friendly approach. The iQOO Neo 10R could be offered in two configurations — 8GB RAM + 256GB storage and 12GB RAM + 256GB storage. The device is tipped to sport a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate. On the camera front, the Neo 10R may come with a dual-camera setup at the back, featuring a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-600 main sensor and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. While it lacks a third camera, which is often found in this price range, the exclusion of a macro lens might not be missed, as such sensors typically offer limited value. The front camera is rumoured to be a 16-megapixel sensor for selfies and video calls. While all this information is based on leaks, the rest of the features are currently under wraps. But, official details about the iQOO Neo 10R, including the official launch date, is expected to be announced soon. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 24, 2025

Yes, iPhone mirroring gives 2-in-1 access and can change how you work One of the coolest features that Apple has introduced in the last few years is iPhone Mirroring. It arrived with the beta versions of the latest macOS and iOS last year, and is now available to users. It can also, at least for some, be a life-changing feature. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/iphone-inside-your-mac-yes-iphone-mirroring-gives-2-in-1-access-and-can-change-how-you-work-2669712-2025-01-24,"This is not a new feature. Not new in a sense because we first saw it in the middle of the last year when Apple announced it at the WWDC. I am talking about the iPhone Mirroring, a feature that allows people to pair their iPhone with a MacBook laptop. But it is only now I have discovered and have realised just how useful and powerful it is. But why now?  Well, an office colleague nudged me. You see, I like memes – or absolutely love some if they are purrfect. It's like a daily dose of happiness. However it is also becoming an addicting dose. In fact, every time I unlock my iPhone my muscle memory somehow makes me check all my notifications, messages, WhatsApp chats, and in no time I end up spending minutes scrolling through Instagram or Twitter where there are always funny and furry animals waiting to distract us.  While this looks and does no harm, or so I feel, the constant itch of checking the phone and FOMO is real. One moment I am working on my laptop and then there is a tiny TING! Next moment, after checking the source of that TING, I am on Instagram, scrolling through reels. I have tried dealing with this by turning the silent mode on the phone, but then that brings anxiety. What if I miss an important ping from a friend or family member. What if there is an urgent message from my bank that requires immediate attention.  The iPhone Mirroring supposedly solves this problem. And potentially a few others. As I use the iPhone Mirroring, I believe I have found a way to solve my FOMO.So, what is iPhone Mirroring Well, I started using the iPhone Mirroring feature a few weeks ago after updating my iPhone and the MacBook to the latest software. The feature was launched in September 2024 with the release of macOS Sequoia and right now it is available for users with an iPhone running iOS 18 and a Mac running Sequoia.  As its name suggests, this new feature allows Apple users to mirror their iPhone display on the screen of the MacBook. And not just screen. Once turned on, the feature also allows you to control your iPhone using the trackpad and keyboard through the Mac. Essentially you can use almost all iPhone apps that you have installed on your phone through the paired MacBook. It allows you to use these apps — for example you can open an Ola or Uber app on your MacBook and book the cab without picking up your phone. Or can use an app like Splitwise, which is mostly used by people on their phone.  Most significantly, though, you can even drag and drop files or photos between the iPhone and the MacBook. It’s kind of awesome!Setting up iPhone Mirroring Now, Mirroring is not a new concept or feature and some Android phones too offer something similar. But after using the feature regularly for days, I can assure you that no one has done better than Apple. Now, before you can use the iPhone Mirroring, you need to start with it. Here is how you go about it.  – To start the iPhone Mirroring feature, update your MacBook to macOS Sequoia and iPhone to iOS18. Once updated, your MacBook will automatically show the mirroring app feature in the doc. If not, you can also find it in the Applications folder.

 — The feature requires you to have the Bluetooth and WiFi turned on. It doesn’t matter that you are not connected to the WiFi but you need to have it turned on.  — It is important that you are using the same Apple account on both the iPhone and the Mac.  – Follow on-screen instructions. You will need to put in Phone PIN and Apple account passwords.  – Once the mirroring is done, you will see your iPhone screen on your MacBook. Now you can also adjust the screen by tapping on View and adjust the size.  – Once everything is set to your liking, you can start using your iPhone through your Mac. You can either open it as one of the screens in a multi-screen window or just keep it minimised.  – Note that the iPhone Mirroring works only if your phone is locked. As soon as you unlock the phone, the Mirroring will pause. 

 



iPhone Mirroring app pauses when you use your iPhone
iPhone Mirroring pros and cons Having said that, chances are you won’t need to pick the iPhone frequently. As noted earlier, this feature not just allows you to use the iPhone on Mac, but it also shows phone notifications directly in the Mac notification panel and when you click on a notification, it opens in the mirrored window. There is absolutely no need to go to the phone to take action on a notification.  Like noted earlier, this is one feature that is actually letting me curb my excessive phone use. I pick my phone less every day now. When I am working and have to respond to something on the phone, I can now do it directly through the Mac.  This seamless integration of notifications also helps me when I have kept the phone away during meetings or while charging. I can do so and not have FOMO.  Another thing that helps — basically has helped me — with my phone addiction is the necessary friction that the iPhone Mirroring brings to my usage. Using the phone through mirroring requires a little bit more effort, and that I believe is a good thing.   The mirrored iPhone screen allows you to access your phone, but you navigate it using a trackpad and keyboard. The scrolling doesn’t get the benefit of the mighty thumb and a super-smooth screen. Instead, you scroll through the trackpad and that means even if you force yourself to binge on reels, your fingers get tired soon. In other words, the experience of using the phone through the Mac is slightly cumbersome and that is less addictive. Hence, you do use the iPhone Mirroring to access your phone, but it naturally forces you to limit yourself to important stuff and not doom scroll all the time. Now, this doesn't mean that at work I am just working slavishly on the Mac — something that my boss would definitely prefer me to do. I mean a little break is always a good idea. And since the big screen allows multitasking, I often use the mirroring app to quickly glance through my social media apps and check on messages, or any funny reels from friends – sometimes the memes and reels can be urgent you know. But as I noted,  scrolling needs effort on a trackpad and it is not as easy as on a phone so I no longer end up scrolling for tens of minutes.

 What’s the catch? There are some limitations. The camera app, for example, cannot be accessed or used in the mirroring mode. Netflix is another app that didn’t work as I tried using it in mirroring mode. At the same time, there is the UPI app for which I always needed to use the phone.  My sense is that the best use case for most people with the iPhone Mirroring is going to be its potential to cut down on phone use, FOMO and screen addiction. It is also a convenient way to access the phone in situations where you might otherwise not. For example, you can keep the phone on charging in a different room in your house and still access it through a MacBook. While travelling too, if you are working on your Mac you can keep your iPhone in your pocket or a bag while you work on your laptop in the airport waiting area.  At the same time, I believe, the usability and versatility of this feature means different people might even find different sorts of usage for it. I am using the iPhone Mirroring to deal with my social media issues. Someone else might find it the best way to move files between two devices. Someone else might find some other use for it. But irrespective of how you use it, you will likely find it the best implementation of device mirroring that we have seen so far in the world of consumer technology.

This marks a big step toward global mobile connectivity without relying on traditional ground-based cell towers. Musk confirmed the news in a reply to a similar Starlink post published by Mario Nawfal, founder of IBC Group, on X. ""Starlink direct from satellite to cell phone Internet connection starts beta test in 3 days,"" Musk wrote on X. But, what exactly is Direct-to-Cell satellite service? It will allow mobile phones to connect directly to satellites, effectively bypassing traditional cellular infrastructure. This could revolutionise communication, enabling people to text, call, and browse the internet from any location, even in remote or isolated regions with no access to regular cell towers.  Nawfal described this as ""cell towers in space,"" with the potential to eliminate dead zones and improve mobile communication. Notably, users won’t need new phones or additional hardware for this service, as it works with existing devices. The beta phase is expected to be a key milestone for SpaceX as it expands Starlink’s offerings. If successful, this new service could greatly benefit those living in or travelling through areas with poor or no cellular coverage. In times of emergency, the service could be crucial when traditional networks fail. With this development, Starlink aims to address the long-standing issue of limited connectivity in rural and hard-to-reach locations. The introduction of next-generation Starlink satellites is expected to further boost speeds, potentially exceeding 2Gbps, making this a promising evolution in global telecommunications. SpaceX leveraged its experience in manufacturing and launched the world's most advanced rockets and spacecraft to deploy Starlink satellites with the Direct to Cell capability at scale. Direct to Cell satellites were reported to first launch on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and then on Starship. On orbit, the satellites immediately connect over laser backhaul to the Starlink constellation to provide global connectivity. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 24, 2025

Even though, while testing the projector, I only used it as a home entertainment setup, it can easily and very well work as a portable solution for work presentations. I used it as a replacement to the television in my bedroom. I was projecting onto a 100-inch retractable projector screen, and every bit of the two-month review period was a delight.

It offers a native resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) with an aspect ratio of 16:9. It offers 1,500 lumens of brightness, and 3,000,000:1 contrast ratio. It weighs 0.95 kg.

It has a throw ratio of 0.78:1, which means you can project a 100-inch screen from just 1.7 meters away.When it comes to visuals, the projector delivers in spades At the very beginning of the testing, my attention was first caught by the image quality that the projector offers. The Optoma OMA-S projects sharp, full-HD visuals. The colours are vibrant that truly pop. During the test period, I watched a lot –– and I mean A LOT –– of content using the projector. Whether watching 1994’s Il Postino or watching a Wes Anderson movie, the experience was deeply immersive. Even when I watched 1966’s Teesri Kasam, the details in the visual were well visible. That is thanks to its 1080p resolution and a brightness of 1,500 lumens. It also helps that the projector offers a contrast ratio of 3,000,000:1. 
 


Setting up the projector is a breeze  The Optoma OMA-S 1080ST offers ports for USB Type-C, HDMI, and USB Type-A that allow you to power devices like a Chromecast or an Amazon Fire TV Stick.I connected a 4K Fire TV stick via the projector’s HDMI port –– it was seamless. I also tested the projector by pairing it with an old Windows laptop. The setup was easy and worked very well. The projector also supports Mac –– I connected it with an M1 MacBook Air. I love the flexibility the projector offers in terms of connectivity and setup. What makes it even better is that it powers dongles through its USB Type-A port, instead of you needing an extra power socket –– which is always a hassle. 
 


Compact and portable One of the standout features of the Optoma OMA-S 1080ST is its portability. It weighs under 1 kg. And if you have a medium to large sized back-pack or a medium-sized tote, you can even easily fit into a bag.  One of the standout features of the Optoma OMA-S 1080ST is its portability.

Also, the majority of projectors that are made to be portable come with built-in batteries, but Optoma has taken a different approach and I think it’s smarter. The OMA-S 1080ST comes with a USB Type-C power input, which lets you power the device with even a power bank –– just make sure that it offers a speed that is 65W or higher. I used it with my Xiaomi’s 20,000mAh power bank, and I was about to use the projector with it for a couple of hours –– closer to two. And it made me think that it’s such a great device to carry with you in case you want to do an impromptu movie date outdoors. 
 


advertisementWho doesn’t love remotes?Remotes don’t feel like an exciting addition anymore, but the convenience of a basic remote control support is always appreciated by users. The OMA-S comes with a remote control that makes navigating through the controls and the general interface quite simple. The remote uses dual IR receivers on the front and back, which means you don’t need to point it at the projector –– which feels very unintuitive, especially in a home entertainment setup –– you can use it from any angle. Auto keystone correction is another thing that makes using the projector so easy. A quick setup with it makes the screen look so good without needing to struggle with manual adjustments. Auto Keystone is especially a blessing if you want to project at an angle. Like me, if you too had the “would love to have the TV on my roof” dreams, make them come true with a device like this one. advertisementWhile there is a lot to love about the Optoma OMA-S 1080ST projector, I do have one issue with it. It uses a built-in 3W speaker, which is decent for casual viewing or for presentations, but if you're planning to use the projector as a TV replacement like me, then you may feel slightly disappointed by the audio output –– especially in larger rooms or during action-heavy scenes. But I love the Optoma OMA-S despite that flaw because of the sheer convenience it offers to connect external speakers or soundbars via Bluetooth or the 3.5mm audio jack. Should you buy the Optoma OMA-S 1080ST projector?  The Optoma OMA-S ML 1080ST is priced at Rs 1,75,000. Yes, that seems expensive.

In its updated plan, Perplexity AI has suggested a deal where the U.S. government could end up owning 50 per cent of the new company, combining Perplexity AI and TikTok U.S. As reported by CNBC, this ownership would only happen after the new company goes public. The new entity, which is being called NewCo, would bring TikTok U.S. and Perplexity AI together. However, TikTok’s famous recommendation algorithm wouldn’t be part of the deal. Instead, ByteDance would let its investors trade their stakes in TikTok U.S. for shares in the new company. Perplexity AI would do the same with its investors. The money to fund this deal would come from outside investors, who would also provide extra cash to pay a one-time dividend to ByteDance’s investors and help the new company grow. Perplexity AI has had a massive rise over the past year. At the start of 2024, the company was valued at around $500 million. By the end of the year, that number had jumped to $9 billion. The generative AI boom played a big role in this growth, as more investors saw the potential of AI search tools as a serious challenge to Google. That said, Perplexity hasn’t had a smooth ride. The company has faced some criticism over claims of plagiarism, which has put it under the spotlight for the wrong reasons at times. The idea behind the merger is to create a stronger, combined entity that benefits both sides. ByteDance would still hold on to a stake in TikTok U.S. without fully selling it, and Perplexity AI would gain access to TikTok’s massive video platform. This would be a big boost to Perplexity’s ambitions. What makes this deal stand out is the part where the U.S. government could own half of NewCo after it goes public. Perplexity believes this could help address national security concerns that have surrounded TikTok for years. ByteDance has always made it clear it doesn’t want to sell TikTok U.S., but Perplexity’s pitch is different because it’s framed as a merger rather than a sale. This could make the idea more appealing to ByteDance. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s administration has been heavily involved in TikTok’s uncertain future. TikTok has temporarily avoided being banned in the U.S., but Trump has hinted at plans to bring in American stakeholders and possibly give the government a stake in the company. With other players like Microsoft, Oracle, and Elon Musk reportedly interested in TikTok, the next few weeks could be critical. A final decision on the matter is expected soon.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

This would enhance multitasking, improve performance with demanding apps, and better support advanced features like AI and machine learning. Additionally, the inclusion of 128GB of storage would further enhance the overall user experience.One of the most exciting upgrades could be the 48-megapixel rear camera, bringing the iPhone SE 4 in line with the iPhone 16 series in terms of camera quality. If these rumours prove accurate, the SE 4's camera would deliver performance on par with higher-end iPhone models.

 Tipster Majin Bu (@MajinBu) took to X and shared a short video revealing the iPhone SE 4’s design. In the video, the phone makes the rumours of a boxy design even more firm. 
 


 If this video holds to be true, the iPhone SE 4’s rear panel will feature a single camera lens. The single camera shooter has been the SE’s usual, but this time it could feature a bulgy camera ring. It looks like the upcoming phone will sport a glass back panel with a prominent Apple logo on it. While the video was enough, the tipster has also shared a couple of photos. Take a look.

iPhone SE 4 to launch in April: Everything else we know so far  After all the leaks, Apple might not actually launch another SE. The rumours revealed that the company might rebrand iPhone SE 4 as iPhone 16e. This means that the upcoming toned-down version will be a part of the iPhone 16 series, which was launched in September 2024. Other than the name, the device is expected to carry several upgrades over its predecessor.  The iPhone SE 4 (or 16e) is rumoured to feature the powerful A18 chipset, offering a significant performance boost that brings it closer to the iPhone 16 series in terms of processing power.

But how is it different from the ChatGPT platform? Let's find out. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sam-altman-compares-operator-launch-to-chatgpt-here-is-how-they-are-different-2670620-2025-01-27,"OpenAI is climbing up the ladder in AI-verse with every passing day. The company started with the ChatGPT launch in 2022, and now it has reached a mark where AI can perform tasks for you. While OpenAI's ChatGPT is the ultimate AI chatbot, the Operator is the company's first super AI agent. The Operator can independently perform tasks and can search the web for you. With this, you only need to instruct the agent, for example, share a list of groceries and the agent will order it on your behalf. This is for sure a win for OpenAI and a significant invention in the AI world. Even though the users are reporting issues, CEO Sam Altman has praised the AI agent. He posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the Operator is getting as much attention as ChatGPT. He stated, ""Fun watching people react to Operator, Reminds me of the ChatGPT launch."" 
 


 It is true that the Operator is one of the first steps to what we thought AI would be like. Personally, whenever I thought about AI in the early years, I always thought of it as a machine that could perform tasks for me. And now the Operator is finally here. While it is only available for US users for now, the company plans to expand the agent to other regions as well. How is the Operator different from ChatGPT?  The main difference between the two platforms is: ChatGPT is a chatbot and the Operator is an AI agent. ChatGPT requires you to chat with the bot, and it helps you find answers to the queries. On the other hand, the Operator helps you perform tasks on your behalf on the web. The company explains, “using its own browser, it can look at a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling.”

 The Operator is capable of handling a variety of repetitive browser tasks, from completing forms and ordering groceries to crafting memes. By utilising the same interfaces and tools people interact with daily, AI enhances its practical applications. This not only helps individuals save time on routine activities but also opens new avenues for businesses to connect with their customers effectively.  Overall, we can say that ChatGPT helps you with productivity, whereas the Operator helps you save time on routine tasks. That said, the Operator uses a few ChatGPT capabilities to pull off the tasks assigned. In the blog, OpenAI states, ""Operator is powered by a new model called Computer-Using Agent (CUA). Combining GPT-4o's vision capabilities with advanced reasoning through reinforcement learning, CUA is trained to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs)—the buttons, menus, and text fields people see on a screen."" Coming to the part where AI has been struggling for a while, hallucinations. Previous reports have stated that the ChatGPT, at times, hallucinates and provides false instances. But with the Operator, OpenAI explains that if the Operator faces challenges or errors, it can use its reasoning abilities to correct itself. If it reaches an impasse and requires help, it seamlessly hands control back to the user, ensuring a fluid and cooperative experience. But issues have also been surfacing recently. Operator faces issues and challenges Early users of the tool have shared critiques, citing slower responsiveness compared to demo performances and instances of hallucinations similar to those seen in the standard ChatGPT chatbot, as reported by Quartz.
 


 In a related account reported by Bezingza, user complaints on X caught the attention of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. One user described issues with the Operator’s interactions on a news website, prompting Altman to respond with a promise to address the problem quickly. However, it remains unclear whether the incident was a genuine error or another example of the Operator’s hallucination tendencies.
 


 But as these teething issues rise, it looks like Sam Altman is making sure that all of them should be fixed as early as possible.

Powered by the DeepSeek-V3 model, which its creators say ""tops the leaderboard among open-source models and rivals the most advanced closed-source models globally"", the artificial intelligence application has surged in popularity among US users since it was released on Jan. 10, according to app data research firm Sensor Tower. The milestone highlights how DeepSeek has left a deep impression on Silicon Valley, upending widely held views about US primacy in AI and the effectiveness of Washington's export controls targeting China's advanced chip and AI capabilities. AI models from ChatGPT to DeepSeek require advanced chips to power their training. The Biden administration has since 2021 widened the scope of bans designed to stop these chips from being exported to China and used to train Chinese firms' AI models. However, DeepSeek researchers wrote in a paper last month that the DeepSeek-V3 used Nvidia's H800 chips for training, spending less than $6 million. Although this detail has since been disputed, the claim that the chips used were less powerful than the most advanced Nvidia products Washington has sought to keep out of China, as well as the relatively cheap training costs, has prompted US tech executives to question the effectiveness of tech export controls. Little is known about the company behind DeepSeek, a small Hangzhou-based startup founded in 2023, when search engine giant Baidu released the first Chinese AI large-language model. Since then, dozens of Chinese tech companies large and small have released their own AI models, but DeepSeek is the first to be praised by the US tech industry as matching or even surpassing the performance of cutting-edge US models.Published By: Devika BhattacharyaPublished On: Jan 27, 2025

This move comes as a big relief for millions of Indians, particularly those using basic mobile services or maintaining secondary SIM cards solely for calls and messages. The new plans cater to a long-standing demand from users who were previously forced to purchase expensive bundled packs with unwanted data benefits. TRAI’s mandate, part of its Telecom Consumers Protection (Twelfth Amendment) Regulations, aims to address this issue and ensure consumers only pay for what they use. Airtel's new recharge plans include a Rs 1,849 annual pack offering unlimited voice calls and 3,600 SMS for 365 days, with an effective daily cost of Rs 5.06. For shorter durations, Airtel has a Rs 469 plan that provides 84 days of validity, unlimited calls, and 900 SMS, costing Rs 5.58 per day. Jio, known for its competitive pricing, offers a Rs 1,748 plan with a validity of 336 days. Like Airtel, it includes unlimited calls and 3,600 SMS but at a slightly lower effective daily cost of Rs 5.20. Jio also provides a Rs 448 plan for 84 days with unlimited calls, 1,000 SMS, and access to JioCinema and JioTV services. This plan costs Rs 5 per day, making it one of the most affordable options in this segment. Vi's approach is slightly different. Its Rs 1,460 plan offers a validity of 270 days, unlimited calls, and 100 SMS per day, with additional messages priced at Rs 1 for local and Rs 1.5 for STD. The daily effective cost of this plan is Rs 5.41. These changes are part of a broader regulatory effort by TRAI to make mobile services more consumer-friendly. The regulator’s survey revealed that many users, especially in rural areas, rely on basic voice and SMS services and find data-inclusive plans unnecessarily expensive. The new rules also extend the validity of Special Tariff Vouchers (STVs) up to 365 days, compared to the previous limit of 90 days. This means users can enjoy longer periods of uninterrupted service without frequent recharges. Additionally, telecom operators have been directed to make top-up vouchers available in smaller denominations starting from Rs 10, ensuring more accessible options for users on tight budgets.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

This change reflects Meta's push for a unified design across platforms, with Android finally catching up.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/latest-whatsapp-update-brings-new-icon-design-to-android-2670609-2025-01-27,"The latest update for WhatsApp on Android brings a visual change that users may not notice immediately, but it signals a larger shift towards a unified design language across Meta’s apps. If you’ve updated to WhatsApp version 2.25.1.75, available via the Google Play Store in India, or 2.25.1.76 in some other regions like Canada, you might spot new icons in the attachment sheet. This feature pops up whenever you tap the paperclip icon in a chat. While the attachment options — Document, Location, Gallery, and Contact — remain the same, the icons have ditched their old round design for squircles or, say, squared-off icons with rounded edges. The revamped WhatsApp icons feature colourful art inside and look more polished compared to the earlier design that used solid colours with white line art. It's not just a cosmetic tweak. This update aligns WhatsApp more closely with Meta’s other platforms like Instagram and Messenger, which already feature similar design elements. Interestingly, these design changes were first spotted way back in early 2023 during WhatsApp's development phase. Beta testers got a glimpse of the updated icons in iOS apps before Android users did. However, it took nearly two years of testing, feedback, and tweaking before the new icons started showing up in stable builds for Android. If your app hasn't been updated yet, you might want to check the Play Store or manually sideload the APK and install it. While this update might seem small in the grand scheme of things, it reflects WhatsApp's larger push toward better integration and consistency across its apps. This attachment sheet redesign, along with previous changes like the tabbed bottom sheet for the Gallery menu, shows how Meta is polishing WhatsApp to keep it relevant in today’s fast-paced tech world. The rollout appears to be global, with multiple reports of the update reaching Android users in various countries. Whether you’re in India or Canada, chances are the change is already available. And if not, it’s just a matter of time. For those eager to test this out, joining WhatsApp’s beta program on the Play Store could give you early access to new features. Alternatively, APK sites like APKMirror and APKPure also host beta builds, though caution is advised when sideloading apps.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in January 2025: OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro and more

This update is expected to introduce major updates on the AI front. The company has been rolling out the Apple Intelligence features since October 2024. However, a few big ones that made it to the WWDC 2024, are yet to come out. For instance, the Siri overhaul, new languages and more. iOS 18.3 is also expected to expand the Apple Intelligence features to more languages. Let's look at it in detail. advertisementApple Intelligence could be in India as soon as AprilCurrently, users in India are exploring Apple Intelligence by changing the default language to US English or Canadian English. Other than this, Apple Intelligence is available in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and UK regions. However, Indian English is yet to arrive. But what does it mean? It means that when these features support Indian English, users need not change their default settings. It also means that if you are planning to buy a new iPhone, which is eligible for Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro models or iPhone 16 series), Apple Intelligence will be ready to use. Apple previously confirmed, ""In April, a software update will deliver expanded language support, with more coming throughout the year. Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Vietnamese, and other languages will be supported."" iOS 18.4 new featuresadvertisement Currently, users in India are exploring Apple Intelligence by changing the default language to US English or Canadian English.

This update introduces three major Siri upgrades: Personal Context, On-Screen Awareness, and the ability to take action in apps.  
-- Personal Context: Siri will now leverage a deeper understanding of your personal data to offer tailored assistance. Misplaced a recipe shared by a friend and can’t recall if it’s in a note, text, or email? Need your passport number while booking a flight? Siri can search through relevant information on your device to help you quickly find what you need—all while maintaining Apple’s commitment to privacy. -- On-Screen Awareness: With Apple Intelligence, Siri gains the ability to act based on what’s on your screen. For example, if a friend sends you their new address via text, you can simply say, “Add this address to their contact card,” and Siri will handle the rest.   -- Taking Action in Apps: Siri will also enable seamless interactions within and across apps. You can ask it to send a draft email to specific recipients, saying, “Send the email I drafted to April and Lilly,” and Siri will know which email and app you’re referencing. It can also perform multi-app tasks, such as enhancing a photo by saying, “Make this photo pop,” and then asking Siri to save it to a specific note in the Notes app—all without requiring you to lift a finger.   New emojis: In recent years, Apple has consistently introduced new emoji with its spring iOS updates, a trend that is expected to continue. The Unicode Consortium has already revealed the latest batch of emoji, and it’s now up to Apple to bring them to iOS. This year’s additions include a fingerprint, face with bags under eyes, harp, root vegetable, leafless tree, splatter, and shovel, offering users even more ways to express themselves visually.  Improved news summaries: Apple had paused its News Summary feature, as it was reported to be generating fake headlines. However, iOS 18.4 could bring it back with required improvements.

The social media giant said it will monitor the test closely before scaling it broadly, adding that businesses will be able to extend their existing Meta ad campaigns to Threads. Meta will also begin testing an inventory filter for ads in Threads, which enabled through AI, allows advertisers to control the sensitivity level of the organic content their ads appear next to. ""The launch of Threads ads just weeks after Meta's content moderation makeover will raise advertiser eyebrows.

Meta earlier this month scrapped its US fact-checking program on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, three of the world's biggest social media platforms with more than 3 billion users globally. Threads was launched in July 2023 as a challenger to X, formerly Twitter, in a bid to win users from the de facto micro-blogging site during its chaotic takeover by billionaire Elon Musk. Meta does not expect Threads to be ""a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue,"" CFO Susan Li had said in a post-earnings call in October.

A 25-year-old woman from Coimbatore lost Rs 10 lakh in a courier scam, prompting the Coimbatore rural cybercrime police to take swift action. The victim, Rithika from Selakarichal, received a call on September 20, 2024, from an individual pretending to be a representative from FedEx in Mumbai. The caller falsely claimed that a suspicious package, using her identity proof, had been intercepted, allegedly containing drugs and illegal items.  The scammers further coerced Rithika into joining a Skype video call with people posing as cybercrime officials from Mumbai. They managed to obtain her bank details and other credentials, threatening her with a digital arrest if she didn’t cooperate. Under pressure, Rithika was forced to transfer Rs 10 lakh to various accounts, believing that the money was needed for verification and would be returned afterward. When the promised retransfer of funds never occurred, Rithika realised she had been scammed and immediately filed a complaint through the national cybercrime reporting portal. Acting on the complaint, the cybercrime police registered a case under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Act and the Information Technology Act. A police team, led by sub-inspector Ananth, tracked the suspects’ bank accounts and froze them. These accounts were also linked to similar fraud cases across Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. Based on this, a special team, under sub-inspector Marimuthu, travelled to South Delhi and arrested one of the key suspects, Gopi Kumar, aged 42. He was later brought to Coimbatore on a transit warrant. The police seized several items from Gopi, including mobile phones, debit cards, SIM cards, laptops, and other digital devices. Authorities believe that Gopi’s associates, who orchestrated the scam, are still at large, and a team is currently stationed in Delhi to apprehend them. For the same matter, investigations are ongoing, and the authorities are expected to bring the entire group responsible for this scam to justice.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 27, 2025

The media outlets including Adani's NDTV and Ambani's Network18 have told a New Delhi court they want to join an ongoing lawsuit against the ChatGPT creator, as they are worried their news websites are being scraped to store and reproduce their work to users of the powerful AI tool. Reuters is first to report the case filing by the digital news publishers, which escalates an ongoing legal battle against ChatGPT in India. In the most high-profile battle, local news agency ANI was first to file a lawsuit against OpenAI last year. Global and Indian book publishers have also now joined in. The 135-page case filing in the New Delhi court, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters, argues OpenAI's conduct constitutes ""a clear and present danger to the valuable copyrights"" of Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) members and other outlets. It refers to OpenAI's ""wilful scraping ... and adaptation of content"". Courts across the world are hearing claims by authors, news outlets and musicians who accuse technology firms of using their copyright work to train AI services and who are seeking to have content used to train the chatbot deleted. The filing was made by the Indian Express, Hindustan Times, Adani's NDTV and the DNPA, which represents roughly 20 companies including Mukesh Ambani Network18 and players like Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar, Zee News, India Today Group and the Hindu. Many of these outlets have a flourishing newspaper and television news business too. The Times of India is not taking part in the legal challenge despite being member of the DNPA. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on the new allegations. It has repeatedly denied such allegations, saying its AI systems make fair use of publicly available data.
None of the Indian media companies immediately responded to Reuters request for comment. The new intervention by Indian outlets will add firepower to ANI's lawsuit against the Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which is the most high-profile legal proceeding in the nation on this subject. A hearing in ANI's lawsuit against OpenAI is scheduled for Tuesday. Responding to the ANI case, OpenAI said in comments reported by Reuters last week that any order to delete training data would result in a violation of its U.S. legal obligations, and Indian judges have no jurisdiction to hear a copyright case against the company as its servers are located abroad. Reuters, which holds a 26 per cent interest in ANI, has said in a statement it is not involved in ANI's business practices or operations. In recent months, OpenAI has signed deals with Time magazine, the Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, France's Le Monde and Spain's Prisa Media to display content.
The Indian publishers in their new filing argue OpenAI has entered into partnership agreements with media outlets abroad, but has not entered into similar deals in India, hurting the media companies. Such conduct by OpenAI ""in India betrays an inexplicable defiance of the law,"" the Indian media outlets' filing said. The publishers also said OpenAI was set to become a profit-driven business benefiting from the creative works of the media industry. This would result in a ""weakened press"" and would not be in the best interests of a vibrant democracy, their filing said. OpenAI kicked off an investment, consumer and corporate frenzy in generative AI after the Nov. 2022 launch of ChatGPT. It wants to be ahead in the AI race after raising $6.6 billion last year. It made its first India hire last year when it tapped a former WhatsApp executive, Pragya Misra, to handle public policy and partnerships in the country of 1.4 billion people, where millions of new users are going online, thanks to cheap mobile data prices.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 27, 2025

It’s the same processor that also powered the likes of Realme GT 6 and Xiaomi 14 Civi from last year — smartphones that cost in the realm of Rs 35,000 to Rs 40,000.  The design of the iQOO Neo 10R takes inspiration from the Z9 Turbo Endurance Edition (from the Chinese market), featuring a squircle-shaped camera island on the back. However, the Neo 10R adds its own flair with a dual-tone design. The blue variant teased by iQOO has a white pattern on the left side of the rear panel, with the words “NEO POWER TO WIN” etched onto it. The flat sides with chamfered edges give the phone a premium, modern look. The iQOO Neo 10R is expected to launch in February, as hinted by a tweet from iQOO India’s CEO, Nipun Marya. Teasers also suggest the phone will fall under the Rs 30,000 price bracket, making it a competitive option in the midrange market. In terms of specifications, the phone is rumoured to feature a 1.5K AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate. It’s also said to house a massive 6,400mAh battery, which should easily last through a day of heavy usage. The phone could run Android 15 based Funtouch OS out of the box and come in configurations of up to 12GB RAM and 256GB internal storage. iQOO Neo 10R set to launch in India soon as company drops a teaser The iQOO Neo 10R’s camera setup on the back may include a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-600 primary sensor capable of 4K 60fps video recording, paired with an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens. For selfies, a 16-megapixel front camera is expected. The iQOO Neo 10R will likely be available on Amazon and possibly other online platforms. With the launch of the iQOO 13, the company announced its foray into the offline smartphone market. Stay tuned for more updates as the launch date approaches.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

This is a new AI model, but unlike the ones that we have seen so far, this one comes from China, and it has set the world of AI abuzz. But what is DeepSeek, and why is everyone talking about it? We explain.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/what-is-deepseek-r1-ai-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-story-in-5-points-2670808-2025-01-27,"If you go to X, aka Twitter, today and look at the conversation people are having around AI, or if you look at the AI news and developments, you will come across this word: DeepSeek. In particular, you will come across DeepSeek R1. Since this AI system became available last week, it has set the world of AI on fire. There are two specific reasons for that, and we will come to it. But the question that you might have is this: What is DeepSeek R1, and why is everyone talking about it?  The first part of the question is easy and straight to answer. DeepSeek is a Hangzhou-based AI research lab and the R1 is its latest AI model. The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, an engineer and entrepreneur with a background in AI and quantitative finance. Before creating DeepSeek, Liang led High-Flyer, a hedge fund known for using AI to analyse financial data. Liang’s team at DeepSeek mostly consists of fresh graduates from top Chinese universities like Tsinghua and Peking University. For the second part of the question, let’s have a closer look at all the buzz. And boy, is the buzz. If you look at the conversation, almost everyone has something or other to say about DeepSeek R1, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who used the moment to take a veiled potshot at OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman. Here is what Nadella tweeted, “Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of.”1 - What is DeepSeek R1? DeepSeek has two current models: The R1 and the R1 Zero. For now, only the R1 is available for users, although the differences between the two AI models aren’t all that clear-cut. On paper, though, we know that the R1 is a general-purpose AI system, whereas the R1 Zero uses only Reinforcement Learning, which means it is entirely self-taught. Anyway, those are technical bits and aren’t exactly relevant to users like us.  What is relevant for us to know is that the DeepSeek R1 is an AI model that has been created by a China-based company and that it is as good as the latest — and competent — available AI systems like the OpenAI o1 and the Anthropic Claude. 2 - DeepSeek R1 is free and (probably) unlimited One of the key reasons why DeepSeek has managed to create a buzz is its cost to end users: it is free. In a way, this is the first extremely advanced AI system that is available for free to users. Other systems, like the OpenAI o1 and Claude Sonnet, require a paid subscription. And even with subscriptions, there are limits to how much users can utilise them. Google Gemini, too, is available for free, but it is also limited to older models for free versions and does have usage limits. DeepSeek doesn’t seem to have limits. It is free to use, as in totally free. 3 - DeepSeek R1 is said to be extremely cost-effective One reason why DeepSeek is likely free is because it is said to have some key technology breakthroughs. One of DeepSeek R1’s biggest selling points is its cost-efficiency. While models like OpenAI’s o1 cost around $15 per million input tokens, the same tasks can cost as little as $0.55 for DeepSeek. The low cost is likely the reason why the R1 is free for end users. And DeepSeek has apparently figured out a way to bring the cost down of an AI system by optimising it so well that it doesn’t require huge computing or a gazillion graphics cards to run.  In fact, efficiency is the one point that has forced people to sit up and take note of DeepSeek, particularly in the US. This sort of efficiency was thought to be impossible until a few weeks ago, but now that DeepSeek has shown what is possible with just a few million dollars, AI companies like OpenAI and Google that are spending billions of dollars are looking like losers. advertisement4 - DeepSeek R1 is open sourceThis is another key point that has excited people. Unlike the OpenAI or Google systems, DeepSeek R1 is open source. What this essentially means is that not only DeepSeek is making big US tech companies look extravagant and irresponsible in the way they are spending money, but it also takes away their ability to price their products higher. After all, what DeepSeek is essentially telling people here is that you don’t have to spend 1000s of dollars to get access to OpenAI or Anthropic systems. Instead, you can just take this open-source model, tune it to your needs and use it in whatever way you want. At the same time, the implications are not just business-related. They are also geopolitical in nature. Instead of AI becoming another coveted and closely guarded system owned by certain countries like the US, an open-source model like DeepSeek frees up technology that can be used by any country in the world to create its own AI systems. This is probably why Marc Andreessen, an influential venture capitalist based in Silicon Valley, recently tweeted, “DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world.”advertisement5 - DeepSeek R1 is fun to useIf, after hearing about it so much, you go to DeepSeek and use the R1, you will find that another reason why everyone is talking about it is the way it works. The R1 comes with a feature that “shows” how the AI model thinks. It is incredible to see it reason itself and then do an analysis of the question or problem it is trying to address. Sure, models by OpenAI and others, too, do the same. But they don’t show this to users. DeepSeek R1, by default, shows it. And that sort of endears it to you while you use it to ask it questions or just have a chit-chat.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

Here is a list of 5 upgrades that you should know about the Galaxy S25 Ultra. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-first-india-sale-next-week-list-of-6-upgrades-2670877-2025-01-27,"Samsung just recently announced its Galaxy S25 series and the new devices are all set to go on sale for the first time in India next week, that is on February 7. While the standard and Plus models in the lineup have received minor updates compared to their upgrades, the new Galaxy S25 Ultra has made its debut with several upgrades. If you are confused about whether you should consider buying the Ultra version or not, here is a list of 5 upgrades that you should know about.  Also, for those who are not aware of its pricing, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will cost you Rs 1,29,999 for the 256GB base model. This is the same price as the Galaxy S24 Ultra, meaning Samsung hasn't increased the retail cost of the new version, something which one should keep in mind, given Samsung has refined the experience with some upgrades without increasing the selling price.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra first India sale next week: List of 5 upgradesNew Chipset The new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is using Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which is one of the biggest upgrades. Popular smartphones like OnePlus 13 and iQOO 13 have been launched with the same chip. And you can expect a powerful performance out of the box. The company is claiming that users will get 37 per cent better performance, 30 per cent improved GPU performance and 40 per cent better NPU performance compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It also comes with a Vulkan Engine and improved Ray Tracing for a better gaming experience.Better vapour chamber cooling system Samsung claims to have improved heat management by increasing the vapour chamber size by 40 per cent on the S25 Ultra, with smaller but notable improvements of 15 per cent on the S25 and S25+. This is a big claim from Samsung and if it works as it is intended to, then gamers are likely in for a treat. The device not only has a super fast chipset, but also a big battery. Lighter design, better screen durability Samsung has refined its design to offer a better user experience. The Galaxy S15 Ultra features a 6.9-inch screen, up from 6.8 inches in the previous model. The bezels around the display are seemingly slimmer. You will also notice that the device's panel has a more scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass coating, which Samsung claims is 29 percent more resistant to scratches and cracks than its predecessor. Additionally, it now has more rounded edges that move away from the sharper Galaxy Note design. Despite this, the Ultra is lighter, weighing just 218 grams, while still housing the same 5,000mAh battery that has powered Ultra models since the Galaxy S20 Ultra.New AI features? The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ships with OneUI 7 custom Android skin, which is based on Android 15. It brings several new AI features and even improves animations and offers a smoother experience. This update includes the improved Gemini assistant, also found on the Google Pixel 9 series, along with other features like personalised briefing, improved circle-to-search functionality, Cross, and an audio eraser. If you’re eager to try out these new features right away, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the way to go. With the S25 Ultra, users can quickly access Gemini by long-pressing the power button, while Samsung apps now come with Gemini extensions. The AI experience has also been upgraded with tools like ""Generative Edit,"" which can remove people and their shadows from photos, and ""Now Brief,"" which delivers personalised daily summaries. The Samsung Gallery app now supports natural language search, making it easier to find photos. Additionally, a new AI Select tool offers relevant suggestions based on screen activity, and voice commands can now trigger specific tasks, like activating a blue light filter when needed. The Live Video feature even provides step-by-step guidance for activities like cooking.New ultrawide camera Samsung has upgraded the rear camera system of the Galaxy S25 Ultra by replacing the old 12-megapixel ultrawide sensor with a new 50-megapixel sensor. While the rest of the setup is similar to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, people are likely to get better results compared to the older version because of its use of the new flagship Snapdragon chipset. Also, its predecessor already offered a good camera experience in its price range. So, the other three sensors in the rear camera setup are - a 200-megapixel primary sensor, a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera remains unchanged but it is expected to offer better performance for selfies and video calls.

As the device will be released in February in China, it could later be rebranded as the OnePlus Open 2. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oppo-find-n5-aka-oneplus-open-2-to-be-thinner-than-ipad-pro-m4-model-2670798-2025-01-27,"Oppo is set to release its next-gen foldable smartphone -- the Oppo Find N5 in China. The launch is scheduled to take place in February 2025. Previously, the company claimed that this foldable would be the world's thinnest fold and now, it has added further context to the slimness of the upcoming phone. Before we get into the details, it is important to know that Oppo Find N5 is most likely to be rebranded as the OnePlus Open 2. Latest reports suggest that the OnePlus Open 2 will launch by the second half of 2025. 
 


 President of Overseas Marketing at Oppo, Billy Zhang posted on X (formerly Twitter), comparing the upcoming Oppo Find N5 to the iPad Pro M4 model. For perspective, the M4 iPad Pro is the slimmest device in the Apple-verse so far, thanks to 5.1mm thickness. And now Oppo is claiming that it is bringing a fold that is slimmer than 5.1mm. While this seems impressive, you must know that this thickness is when the device unfolded. 
 


 Oppo's Chief Product Officer, Pete Lau also posted on X, sharing a better comparison. However, here the Oppo Find N5 is compared with an iPhone, which looks like iPhone 16 Pro. Hence, we can speculate that when folded, the Find N5 aka OnePlus Open 2 will be equally slim as the iPhone 16 Pro. Oppo Find N5 aka OnePlus Open 2: What to expect Leaks about the Oppo Find N5, also known as the OnePlus Open 2, have sparked interest with reports pointing to significant upgrades over its predecessor. The device is rumoured to feature Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a notable leap from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip found in the original OnePlus Open.   The device is also expected to include foldable displays with a 2K+ resolution, delivering a premium viewing experience. Camera upgrades are anticipated, with a 50-megapixel triple-lens setup that may incorporate a circular periscope telephoto lens, potentially enhancing the 3x optical zoom capability of its predecessor. Additionally, the Open 2 could introduce 3-stage wireless charging, a practical feature for its large foldable design.   In terms of aesthetics, the foldable is rumoured to feature a slimmer, lighter frame, with material options including plain leather and glass for a more refined and modern look. These enhancements suggest the OnePlus Open 2 is poised to compete strongly in the foldable market.  The company has also confirmed the wireless charging speed on the Oppo Find N5 will max out at 50W. This indicates that even though the phone comes with a slim profile, the battery may not be compromised.

The Meta-owned messaging app is reportedly testing multi-account support for iOS, which would allow iPhone users to log into two different WhatsApp accounts on the same device. This means you could use one account for personal chats and another for work, all without needing a second phone or relying on workarounds like WhatsApp Business. For Android users, this feature has been a lifesaver since it was rolled out in October 2023. It lets them switch between two accounts seamlessly, without the need for app cloning or carrying multiple devices. Now, it seems WhatsApp is working to bring the same convenience to iPhone users. According to WABetaInfo, the feature is currently in development and was spotted in iOS beta version 25.2.10.70. However, it’s not yet available for testing, so beta users will have to wait a little longer to try it out.

 The multi-account feature is expected to work similarly on iPhones as it does on Android. Users will likely be able to add a second account directly through the app settings. There will be two options — setting up a new account from scratch or linking to an existing one by scanning a QR code. This flexibility will make it easier for people to manage multiple numbers, whether for personal, professional, or other purposes. One of the biggest advantages of this feature is that it keeps everything organised in one place. Each account will have its own separate chats, notifications, backups, and settings, so there’s no risk of mixing things up. For those with dual SIM iPhones, this will be especially handy. Instead of juggling between WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business, users will be able to manage both numbers within the main app. While the feature is still under development, it’s clear that WhatsApp is aiming to create a consistent experience across both Android and iOS platforms. Once testing is complete, the multi-account support is expected to roll out to all iPhone users worldwide. However, it might take a few months before it’s officially available. For now, if you’re an Android user and haven’t tried this feature yet, setting up a second account is pretty straightforward. All you need is a second phone number. Even if you have your secondary SIM card (or eSIM) on your primary phone with your main phone number, that also works. Simply head to WhatsApp settings > tap the + icon next to your name > tap Add account, and follow the on-screen prompts.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 27, 2025

CEO Carl Pei has previously confirmed that the Nothing Phone 3 is to debut by March 2025. Now, the company has recently shared a teaser, which is anticipated to be a hint of its upcoming phone. In the X (formerly Twitter) post, the company shared a glimpse of its traditional LED lights and the rest is left for speculation. Barring the information that its new innovation is coming in on March 4, the company has not shared any details. This takes us to a point: is the teased phone Nothing Phone 3 or Phone 3a?  Is it Nothing Phone 3 or Phone 3a?  Chronologically, Nothing should release the Phone 3 before Nothing Phone 3a. The CEO's statement about launching the flagship in March and the 2-year gap indicates that this is a teaser belongs to the Nothing Phone 3 launch. The company released Nothing Phone 2 in 2023 and has been releasing follow-ups like Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus in the following years. And now, we think, it is time to revisit the flagship timeline and release Nothing Phone 3 before any of its siblings. However, there is no confirmation yet.  On the other hand, tipster Abhishek Yadav claims that the company will mix up the timeline this time by launching Nothing Phone 3a before the flagship. Another indication of Phone 3a's early launch is that the teaser looks like the Nothing Phone 2a's camera panel.    That said, only Nothing knows what is coming up in March, and we can only predict. Hence, stay tuned for the exact details on March 4 at 3:30PM. Nothing Phone 3: What to expect The Nothing Phone 3 marks a departure from the typical annual upgrade cycle, arriving two years after the Phone 2's launch in July 2023. This extended timeline hints at significant enhancements, particularly in AI-driven capabilities, and has reignited excitement around the brand, thanks to Carl Pei's recent confirmation. Leaked details and a video shared by Pei suggest that the Nothing Phone 3 will serve as a central hub for a personalised, AI-powered experience. AI integration will be deeply woven into Nothing OS, potentially transforming how users interact with their home screens and manage daily tasks. One of the standout features rumoured for the device is an Action Button, reminiscent of the iPhone, which is expected to offer customisable shortcuts for a more tailored user experience. The phone will reportedly feature a 6.5-inch display, maintaining its sleek design. In addition to the standard model, a Pro variant is rumoured to debut alongside it, catering to premium buyers with enhanced specifications, including a larger 6.7-inch display. However, details about the Pro model remain scarce, and this speculation should be taken with a grain of salt. Despite the quiet period following Phone 2, these developments suggest Nothing is gearing up to make a significant impact with its next release.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Also read |  Nothing teases its next flagship, might follow the transparent rear panel trendAlso read |  Nothing Phone 3 rumour round-up: Price, specs and all we know so farMust Watch

The decision comes amidst widespread outages and a surge in demand for its flagship AI model, DeepSeek-R1, which has generated quite a buzz globally. DeepSeek’s chatbot had recently become the most downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store, briefly surpassing OpenAI’s ChatGPT in popularity. However, the company’s systems faced major disruptions, with its status page reporting “major outages” for both its API and web chat services on Monday. While the API was operating with degraded performance by mid-morning, the web chat remained partially unavailable for hours. To address the ongoing issues, DeepSeek temporarily restricted sign-ups to users with +86 phone numbers, citing this measure as a way to ensure continued service. DeepSeek announced on its status page, “Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service. Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support.” Existing users, however, were unaffected and could continue to log in as usual. The restriction, though not officially called temporary, seems to be a way to manage the cyberattacks that happened as the chatbot’s global popularity grew quickly.  DeepSeek, founded in 2023 by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, has quickly emerged as a serious competitor in the AI race. Its latest model, DeepSeek-R1, released just last week, has gained attention for its advanced capabilities in tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning. What sets DeepSeek apart is its claim of developing models at a fraction of the cost compared to Silicon Valley giants like OpenAI and Google. This achievement comes despite US restrictions on China’s access to high-end AI chips, further fuelling speculation about the efficiency of its training methods. The rise of DeepSeek has not only intensified competition in the generative AI space but also impacted the stock market. On Monday, Nvidia, a key supplier of AI chips, saw its shares tumble by over 14 per cent, wiping out more than $500 billion in market value. Other tech companies in the US and Europe also saw drops as investors reacted to DeepSeek's low-cost approach to AI. The temporary outage and registration restrictions, however, haven’t brought down the enthusiasm among tech analysts. Many are watching closely to see how DeepSeek navigates this challenging period while scaling its operations. With global leaders such as OpenAI and Anthropic racing to maintain dominance in the AI space, the sudden emergence of cost-effective alternatives like the DeepSeek-R1 underscores China’s growing influence in the field. As of now, we'll have to wait and see how long these restrictions last.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

Recently, aiming to enhance personalisation, Meta is rolling out a new Memory feature. It will record “certain details, like how they love to travel and learn new languages” shared with Meta AI chatbot on Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp. The company shared that the feature is live for both iOS and Android users but only in US and Canada. 
 


advertisementWhat is the Meta AI’s Memory feature? Similar to Google or OpenAI, Meta’s AI memory feature allows the system to remember important details from previous interactions. For example, if a user has mentioned being vegan in a past chat, Meta AI will consider that when offering suggestions, like breakfast ideas, to ensure they align with the user's preferences.Meta confirms that Meta AI will only remember certain things you tell it in 1:1 conversations (not group chats), and you can delete its memories at any time.

 Such tools have always been controversial. It raises questions about security and privacy of the application for its users. But wait for another update, which is another step ahead. Meta AI new personalised features Meta says the chatbot will now draw on account information from across its apps to offer personalised recommendations. This could include details like a user's home location from their Facebook profile or recently viewed videos on Instagram. 
 


 In an example, Meta explains, “Let’s say you’re looking for something fun to do with your family this weekend, and you ask Meta AI to suggest something. Based on the home location you’ve listed as part of your Facebook profile, recent views of reels featuring live performances by various country artists and the memory that you have a partner and two young kids, Meta AI might suggest tickets for that weekend’s country music show at your local arena and reservations at a local brunch spot.” This feature is also available for US and Canada on all three platforms: Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.

He calls its R1 model ""impressive"". ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-calls-rival-deepseek-impressive-promises-to-deliver-agi-soon-2671152-2025-01-28,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently took to X (formerly Twitter) praising the debut of its rival, a Chinese AI startup called DeepSeek. Currently, DeepSeek has released the R1 and R1 zero, but Altman is quite impressed with the first one. In the post, he said that given the price the company is charging for its services, DeepSeek's R1 model is ""an impressive model"". For perspective, according to a post on DeepSeek's official WeChat account, the recently launched DeepSeek-R1 is 20 to 50 times more cost-effective than OpenAI's o1 model, depending on the specific task.
 


 That said, Altman has also released that to compete with this low-cost Chinese AI model, OpenAI has to pull up new releases. While he was thrilled with the competition, he said, ""we will obviosuly deliver much better models."" This comes after DeepSeek's free app has also taken over ChatGPT on Apple's App Store in several regions, including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China and Singapore. What is OpenAI's next step?  Sam Altman stated that OpenAI will continue to execute on its research roadmap. Looking at the competition, he added, ""more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission."" He also said that in this era of AI, the world will ask for a lot of AI. But OpenAI is ready to amaze its audience with its next-gen models.

 Giving a hint about its upcoming AI models, he also stated that OpenAI is ""looking forward to bringing up all AGI and beyond."" This is not the first time that Altman has teased AGI. A few weeks ago, via his blogpost, he stated that OpenAI is confident about creating AGI. This statement fuelled rumours around the launches in January.  Before any such announcement, Altman threw water on expectations. Not AGI, but OpenAI has recently launched its first AI-agent, the Operator, which can perform tasks on your behalf. The Operator can be tasked with a wide range of repetitive browser activities, such as completing forms, ordering groceries, or even creating memes. By leveraging the same interfaces and tools that people use every day, AI expands its practical applications, helping individuals save time on routine tasks. Currently, it is in a research preview, which means it has limitations and is open to feedback.  But soon after the launch of the Operator, DeepSeek came into the picture and stole the limelight. This pumped up Altman to bring back the magical word: AGI. Artificial General Intelligence or AGI is defined as an AI system that can tackle any task just like a human would. After AGI, we get to artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is AI that exceeds the capabilities of the human mind. What is DeepSeek, and why is it getting all the attention?  DeepSeek currently offers two models: the R1 and the R1 Zero. At present, only the R1 is accessible to users, though the distinctions between the two models remain somewhat ambiguous. On paper, the R1 is a general-purpose AI system, while the R1 Zero relies exclusively on Reinforcement Learning, meaning it is entirely self-taught. However, these technical details are unlikely to impact everyday users significantly. What truly sets DeepSeek apart and has generated significant buzz is its pricing—or lack thereof. The R1 model is completely free for users, making it the first highly advanced AI system to be offered at no cost. By contrast, other systems like OpenAI's o1 and Claude Sonnet require paid subscriptions and impose usage limits even for paying users. While Google’s Gemini also offers a free version, it is restricted to older models and comes with usage caps. DeepSeek, however, breaks the mold by being entirely free to use, without any apparent limits.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Also read |  DeepSeek limits new user sign-ups after surge in cyberattacksAlso read |  What is DeepSeek R1 AI and why is everyone talking about it: Story in 5 pointsAlso read |  DeepSeek's 'Sputnik Moment' sends Nvidia and AI giants reeling amid cost revolutionMust Watch

In a report released on Monday, the company revealed that its new model had surpassed OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion in key image generation benchmarks. This is another big achievement for the startup, which is quickly gaining attention in the AI space. Janus-Pro-7B is an upgraded version of DeepSeek’s previous model, Janus, which was launched late last year. The new model has been fine-tuned to offer better performance, stability, and image quality. It achieves this by utilising 72 million high-quality synthetic images alongside real-world data, helping it create more visually appealing and stable outputs. The model’s larger architecture, with up to 7 billion parameters, has also improved its training speed and overall accuracy. In terms of technical improvements, Janus-Pro-7B offers more refined image generation by balancing a wide range of data inputs. This has led to an increase in the richness of the details within the generated images, addressing some of the common limitations seen in previous models.  The launch of Janus-Pro-7B comes amid a wave of attention for DeepSeek’s other developments, notably its DeepSeek-V3 AI model, which recently became the top-rated free application on Apple’s App Store in the United States. The success of these models has had a notable impact on the stock market, with stocks like Nvidia and Oracle seeing declines as investors reconsider the sustainability of AI chip spending. What makes the Janus-Pro-7B stand out is that it can both understand and create images in a way that many other models cannot. It uses a smart and new approach called an autoregressive framework, which helps it process information step by step. What makes it even more unique is how it handles visual information. Instead of treating all visual data the same way, it splits the process of understanding images into different pathways. This separation makes the model more flexible, meaning it can handle a variety of tasks involving images, whether it’s understanding them or generating new ones. By doing this, Janus-Pro-7B avoids the problems that earlier models faced, where trying to do everything in one unified system often led to limitations. As a result, Janus-Pro-7B performs exceptionally well across many tasks without losing its efficiency or quality. While much of the focus has been on DeepSeek’s other model, the DeepSeek-R1, which is positioned as a challenger to OpenAI’s o1 model, Janus-Pro-7B has made a strong case for itself as a top contender in the field of image generation. Built on DeepSeek’s LLM architecture, the model incorporates a powerful vision encoder and a specialised tokeniser to generate images with impressive detail and accuracy.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalssharper

Ahead of the launch, the recent price leak suggests that the higher variant might witness a price hike over its predecessor, the Google Pixel 8a. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-pixel-9a-rumoured-to-get-a-price-hike-but-only-for-this-variant-2671198-2025-01-28,"After releasing the Google Pixel 9 series in India (in August 2024), the company is looking forward to introduce its younger sibling -- the Google Pixel 9a. While there is no official notification yet, the Pixel 9a might hit the market in March 2025. Ahead of the launch, a leak hints at a hike in prices for the upcoming phone, but here is the catch. The leak suggests that the base model (128GB) will be priced similar to its predecessor, Google Pixel 8a, but the high-end model (256GB) could witness a price hike.  In the US, the Google Pixel 9a will be priced at $499 (approx Rs 43,100) for the 128GB model, and $599 (Rs 51,800) for the 256GB model, according to a report published by Android Headline. The starting price of the upcoming Google smartphone is similar to the Pixel 8a's price. However, the 256GB model is $40 (approx Rs 3,400) more expensive. In India, the Google Pixel 8a was launched at a starting price of Rs 52,999 for the base variant and Rs 59,999 for 256GB. This means that the upcoming Pixel 9a price will begin at Rs 52,999 in India, but the 256GB variant could cost up to Rs 64,000. If this holds to be true, the difference between the two variants range over Rs 10,000. Google Pixel 9a to debut in March: What do we know In December 2024, the Google Pixel 9a was in the headlines for its leaked design pattern. The leaked image indicates that Google is doing away with its traditional camera bump, which was also seen in its flagship series, Google Pixel 9 series. Instead of the traditional camera bump, Google might integrate the camera directly into the body, giving it a sleeker appearance. The device is also expected to sport a sturdy build with rounded edges for a comfortable grip.  The Google Pixel 9a is rumoured to feature a 6.3-inch Actua display with a 120Hz refresh rate, matching the screen size of the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro. In terms of performance, the Pixel 9a is said to be powered by the Tensor G4 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM and storage options of either 128GB or 256GB. Battery life is another highlight, with leaks pointing to a 5,000mAh capacity, an 11 per cent increase over the Pixel 8a. It supports 18W charging, and the larger battery size aligns with the slightly bigger physical dimensions of the phone, making this claim credible. On the connectivity front, the Pixel 9a is rumoured to include the Exynos Modem 5300, a reliable but older modem also used in the Pixel 8 series. While it may lack some of the efficiency and advanced 5G features of the newer Exynos Modem 5400 found in the Pixel 9 series, the 5300 should still deliver stable and reliable performance for everyday tasks. Camera enthusiasts can expect a 48-megapixel primary sensor, a 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 13-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies and video calls, providing a robust photography setup. The Pixel 9a is slightly larger than its predecessor, with dimensions of 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mm and a weight of 186g. Interestingly, despite the increase in size, it is marginally lighter than the Pixel 8a, which weighed 188g. With these features, the Pixel 9a appears to strike a balance between modern design, performance, and practicality.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Also read |  Google Pixel 9a leak details: From pricing to specs, everything we know so farAlso read |  Oppo Find N5 aka OnePlus Open 2 to be thinner than iPad Pro M4 modelAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra first India sale next week: List of 5 upgrades

 This suggests that Nothing will bring the Phone 3a, before unveiling its Phone 3. For context, Nothing Phone 2a was launched in India in March 2023 and Nothing Phone 2 debuted in July 2023. This also means that the company is overlooking the 2-year gap by not bringing the Phone 3. And now it seems like the mid-range Phone 3a will debut first. The recently received BIS certification also indicates the same. The rumour also has it that this time as well, the company will bring Phone 3a along with a potential Phone 3a Plus model. The device, by the model number A059, was also spotted in an IMEI database alongside a variant labeled A059P. In Nothing's naming convention, the ""P"" likely signifies ""Plus,"" suggesting that the company is gearing up to release both the Phone 3a and a more premium Phone 3a Plus model. However, this remains speculation for now, and we recommend waiting for official updates from the brand on March 4 at 3.30PM. Nothing Phone 3a teaser
 


 Nothing shared a glimpse of its traditional LED lights and the rest is left for speculation. Barring the information that its new innovation is coming in on March 4, the company has not shared any details. It image looks like the rear camera module. We can see two separate islands, which could be hinting at a triple-camera setup. This is a step up from the usual dual cameras on all Nothing phones. Nothing Phone 3a: What to expect Leaks suggest that the Phone 3a will feature the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset, marking a shift from its predecessor, the Nothing Phone 2a, which was powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 7200 Pro. The Phone 3a Plus is also rumoured to include a more advanced chip, stepping up from the Dimensity 7350 Pro used in the previous generation.   Although detailed specifications remain limited, it's speculated that these devices will launch with Android 15, maintaining Nothing's reputation for offering a clean and optimised software experience.  While the exact camera configurations remain unknown, reports indicate that the Nothing Phone 3a could include a telephoto lens, while the Nothing Phone 3a Plus might feature a more advanced periscope lens.

This move is part of Meta’s strategy to compete with TikTok, especially as questions loom over TikTok's future in the US. As per a report by Business Insider, Meta has been reaching out to creators who have over a million followers on TikTok, offering them monthly payments ranging from $2,500 to $50,000 (roughly Rs 2 lakh to Rs 43 lakh). The contracts require the creators to produce and share short-form videos exclusively on Instagram for at least three months. The payout tiers vary depending on the size of the creator’s following, and the deals offer hefty sums based on their level of engagement. The creators are expected to post a certain number of Reels each month, with videos lasting between 15 seconds and three minutes. Additionally, they must share their Instagram content on other platforms like TikTok or YouTube, encouraging their followers to join them on Instagram. The report also mentions that Instagram is offering deals worth up to $300,000 (around Rs 2.5 crore) for six months. During this time, creators are required to post at least 10 Reels every month. Essentially, creators have the chance to earn up to $50,000 per month, with the top-tier creators, who have the highest engagement and followers, being eligible for the maximum payout. This would allow them to earn a total of $300,000 over the course of six months. The report highlights that creators are required to ""post 25% more to Instagram reels than their next largest short-form video platform. Once a day, engage with fans via comments, shares, or replies."" However, despite the attractive payouts, some creators are hesitant. Several have raised concerns over the exclusivity demands and the need to produce more content for Instagram than they do for other platforms. Talent managers handling these creators have said that balancing content creation across platforms, along with Instagram’s specific requirements, has made the deal less appealing for some. Though some creators are taking advantage of the big money, others remain wary. The exclusive nature of the deal and the structured content guidelines have caused frustration among certain creators. But, the latest move shows the challenge Meta faces in trying to get TikTok creators to switch to Instagram, even with the promise of big financial rewards. Meta is clearly trying hard to gain more ground in the competitive short-form video space if we go by the report.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 28, 2025

The update is now available for download on iPhone XR, iPhone SE (2nd generation), iPhone 11 series and later models. While the latest update introduces a bunch of improvements, it also comes with a notable caveat for Indian users regarding Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI-powered features. One of the standout additions in iOS 18.3 is the return of a familiar feature — repeated operations in the Calculator app. This functionality, which was present in iOS 17 but mysteriously removed in iOS 18, has been reinstated, much to the relief of users who rely on it for quick calculations. Another notable change is the introduction of sleep apnoea notifications in Brazil, a feature aimed at enhancing health monitoring for users in the region. For those with the latest iPhone 16 series, the update brings enhanced camera controls. Users can now enable Auto Exposure and Auto Focus Lock with a simple light press and hold on the Camera Control button. Additionally, the new Visual Intelligence feature allows iPhone 16 users to scan posters with location and date information, prompting them to create calendar events seamlessly. This feature also extends to real-time identification of plants and animals, making it a handy tool for nature enthusiasts. Notification Summaries have also seen a tweak in iOS 18.3. These summaries now appear in italicised text to distinguish them from regular notifications. However, following feedback from users and the media, Apple has temporarily disabled the ability for Apple Intelligence to create summaries for news and entertainment app notifications. The company has also added disclaimers across the iOS interface, noting that Notification Summaries may occasionally contain errors. Another interesting addition is the improved accessibility of Genmoji, which can now be easily created and used in Messages and other supported apps. On the security front, iOS 18.3 addresses 20 bugs and introduces measures to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive audio and visual data on iPhones. For Indian users, however, there’s a catch. Apple Intelligence, the AI-driven feature set, is not yet supported in Indian English. To access these features, users will need to switch their device's language to US English or Canadian English. This workaround will remain in place until Apple officially rolls out support for Indian English. To download iOS 18.3, users should ensure their device is backed up, connected to a stable internet connection, and has sufficient battery and storage. The update can be installed by navigating to Settings > General > Software Update and tapping on Download and Install. Once the update process is finished, the device will reboot, and you will be able to use your iPhone after that.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

The support pages for these devices have recently gone live on Samsung’s official India website, hinting that their release is just around the corner. While the company has not yet made an official announcement, the appearance of these pages, along with multiple certifications and benchmark listings, strongly suggests that the launch is imminent. The model numbers for these devices have been confirmed as SM-A066B/DS (Galaxy A06), SM-E066B/DS (Galaxy F06), SM-E166P/DS (Galaxy F16), and SM-M166P/DS (Galaxy M16). These model numbers were previously spotted on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) website, further hinting at the possibility of an Indian launch. Additionally, the Galaxy A06 and Galaxy F06 were seen on the Bluetooth SIG database, confirming their support for 2G, 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G connectivity, as well as Bluetooth and WLAN capabilities. The Galaxy A06 is expected to be a major addition to Samsung’s budget A0x series, marking the first time a 5G-enabled device will be introduced in this lineup. Recent Geekbench listings revealed that the phone could come with Android 15 out of the box, paired with 4GB RAM and a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset. On Geekbench 6, the device scored 731 in single-core performance and 1,816 in multi-core performance. There are also rumours that the Galaxy F06 might share similar hardware specifications, positioning it as a slightly more premium alternative to the Galaxy A06. As for the Galaxy F16 and Galaxy M16, these devices are speculated to be rebranded versions of the Galaxy A16, which was launched in India last year, in October. If this turns out to be true, both phones could feature a 6.7-inch FHD+ display, a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset, 8GB RAM, and a triple-camera setup with a 50-megapixel primary rear snapper. Other expected features include a 13-megapixel front-facing camera, a 5,000mAh battery, and support for dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz).

This Chinese startup recently gained attention with the release of its R1 model, which delivers performance similar to ChatGPT, but with the key advantage of being completely free to use. As a result, the DeepSeek app has shot to the top of the charts on the iPhone App Store, showing its growing popularity. But, what exactly is DeepSeek AI, how does it work, when was it founded, how can you access DeepSeek R1, and is it better than ChatGPT? We try to answer all these questions in this article.advertisementWhat is DeepSeek AI, who founded it and how does it work?DeepSeek AI was founded by Liang Wenfeng in May 2023, but it gained the limelight in early 2025 - all thanks to its latest developed large language models (LLMs) - DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1. They are designed to be both efficient and cost-effective. To be precise, DeepSeek-V3 is a general-purpose model, while DeepSeek-R1 focuses on tasks requiring reasoning and deeper thinking. Both the models have delivered impressive benchmarks and use fewer resources compared to their rivals. DeepSeek AI was founded by Liang Wenfeng in May 2023, but it gained the limelight in early 2025 - all thanks to its latest developed large language models (LLMs) - DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1. They are designed to be both efficient and cost-effective.  To be precise, DeepSeek-V3 is a general-purpose model, while DeepSeek-R1 focuses on tasks requiring reasoning and deeper thinking. Both the models have delivered impressive benchmarks and use fewer resources compared to their rivals. What sets DeepSeek apart from its competitors is the use of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This unique design ensures that only a small portion of the model’s parameters are active at any given time, reducing the amount of computing power required to process queries. Additionally, the AI models improve themselves through a trial-and-error learning process, which mimics human learning. This approach has helped DeepSeek gain a reputation for rapid advancement.How to use DeepSeek R1 AI model? Using DeepSeek is easy and accessible through both its website and mobile apps. People who are not aware, when they start using DeepSeek, the platform is by deault set to DeepSeek-V3 version. In the prompt box, people will also see a DeepThink R1 option, which one can select to start using the company's DeepSeek R1 AI version. It offers advanced reasoning capabilities. The R1 model excels in handling complex questions, particularly those requiring careful thought or mathematical reasoning. While the answers take a few seconds to process, they offer a more thoughtful, step-by-step explanation for the queries.DeepSeek AI vs ChatGPT: Which one is better? What are the key differences? While DeepSeek AI performs impressively in delivering accurate answers, it lacks some of the advanced features that ChatGPT offers. ChatGPT allows users to generate AI images, interact with various tools like Canvas, and even provides a multimodal interface for tasks like image analysis. Additionally, ChatGPT offers voice interaction for users who prefer speaking to the chatbot, while DeepSeek is limited to text-based interactions. In terms of performance, DeepSeek-V3 and R1 compete greatly with ChatGPT models, particularly in answering questions and generating code. You can expect similar and accurate answers with both AI chatbots. In addition to this, both of them have support for search the web feature, so that you can get the latest and accurate info via them.  However, users looking for extra features like customised GPTs (Insta Guru"" and ""DesignerGPT) or multimedia capabilities will find ChatGPT more useful. For your reference, GPTs are a way for anyone to create a more personalised version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks. That being said, DeepSeek’s biggest advantage is that its chatbot is free to use without any limitations and that its APIs are much cheaper. ChatGPT, on the other hand, has paid options for more advanced features. This makes DeepSeek a great option for users who just want a straightforward AI experience without any costs.  People who want to use DeepSeek for more advanced tasks and use APIs with this platform for coding tasks in the backend, then one will have to pay. However, the cost is still quite low compared to OpenAI's ChatGPT. For DeepSeek, one will have to spend $0.55 per mission input tokens and $2.19 per million output tokens. This is way lower than OpenAI's API, costing $15 and $60.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 28, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/microsoft-is-in-talks-to-acquire-tiktok-says-us-president-trump-2671401-2025-01-28,"US President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday that Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok and that he would like to see a bidding war over the app. Microsoft declined to comment. TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for a comment outside regular business hours. TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on January 19. Trump, after taking office on January 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. Trump said last week that he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in 30 days. The US president has previously said that he was open to billionaire Elon Musk buying the social media app if the Tesla CEO wanted to do so. Musk, however, has not publicly commented on Trump's offer. More recently, AI startup Perplexity AI on Sunday made a proposal to merge with TikTok, with the US government getting up to half of the new company in the future, a source told Reuters on Sunday. The reported talks mark the second time that Microsoft has been in the frame to acquire TikTok. During his first term, Trump ordered TikTok to separate its US version from ByteDance citing national security concerns. Microsoft emerged as a top bidder in 2020, but the talks soon collapsed, and Trump's divestment push ended a few months later when he left office. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called that deal the ""strangest thing I've ever worked on."" The US government had a ""particular set of requirements and then it just disappeared,"" he said in 2021.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Tune InAlso read |  Meta offering Rs 43 lakh per month to TikTok creators for creating content on InstagramAlso read |  New bid for TikTok from Perplexity AI could give US government 50% stakeAlso read |  Perplexity AI proposes US stake in TikTok merger: ReportMust Watch

According to Ross Young, the device will feature a notch, similar to the one found on the iPhone 14, rather than the Dynamic Island that has become a go-to design inclusion in Apple’s more recent premium models. This contradicts earlier leaks, including one from Evan Blass, which showed the SE 4 with a Dynamic Island. The confusion doesn’t end there. Earlier this month, leaker Evan Blass shared images of what was claimed to be the iPhone SE 4’s design, showcasing a device with a Dynamic Island. Adding to the mix, a leak from February 2024, via Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter), also suggested the Dynamic Island would make its way to SE 4. However, most other reports and rumours point towards Apple sticking with the older notch design, especially since the SE 4 is said to be modelled after the iPhone 14. If the iPhone SE 4 does end up getting the notch design, it would at least make sense from a cost perspective. The iPhone 14’s body and components are likely more affordable to replicate, keeping the SE 4’s price tag competitive. Alleged screen protectors for the SE 4 also seem to support the notch design, further hinting that these speculations are indeed true. Apart from this, one of the biggest changes coming with the iPhone SE 4 is the removal of TouchID. Apple is reportedly planning to remove the fingerprint sensor in its iPhone lineup, making FaceID the standard across all models.  In terms of specs, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to feature a 6.1-inch OLED display, a single rear camera, and 8GB RAM. Under the hood, it’s rumoured to be powered by the A17 Pro chip, which should make it capable of supporting Apple Intelligence, given the iPhone 15 Pro supports the company’s latest AI-driven features, and it is also powered by the A17 Pro chip. While some leaks have suggested a vertical rear camera bump similar to the rumoured iPhone 16 design, this remains unconfirmed. As for the launch, current rumours point to a spring release, likely between March and April. With the iPhone SE 4, Apple seems to be aiming to offer a more modern design and features at an accessible price point, though it remains to be seen how much of the premium iPhone experience will trickle down to this budget model. Globally, the phone is tipped to be priced under $500 (roughly 43,300). An earlier rumour placed its price between $499 (roughly Rs 43,200) and $549 (roughly Rs 47,500). This is a noticeable jump from the launch price of the iPhone SE 3, which debuted at $429 or Rs 43,900 in India. However, after just a few months, the Indian price of the SE 3 rose to Rs 49,900. So, the biggest question is — with its upgraded features, can the iPhone SE 4 remain under the Rs 50,000 price point in India? We’ll have to wait and see.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

The company will use Visa Direct, Visa's real-time money transfer solution, to fund X Money’s wallet, link to a debit card for payments to other users, and enable seamless transfers back to your bank account. In a post, X CEO Linda Yaccarino stated that X Money is scheduled to launch later this year. This X-Visa partnership will allow secure and instant funding to users’ X Wallet via Visa Direct, she added. It will also connect debit cards, allowing person-to-person payments. 
 


 X Money will also give users an option to instantly transfer funds to your bank account. Yaccarino claims that this is the ""first of many big announcements about X Money this year”.  The thought of adding financial services to X was communicated right after Musk took over. With this partnership, it looks like the services will arrive in the US first and then expand to the rest of the world. But as per previous reports, this service will be available to selected states first.  App researchers have repeatedly discovered code related to X Money, highlighting features such as the ability to load funds into a wallet on the platform and make payments to other users. The X Money service is set to launch in the first quarter, with additional partnerships in the works. According to the CNBC report, one of the initial use cases for X Money will be to enable creators on the platform to receive payments and store funds independently.  X Payments LLC is licensed in 41 states and registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), according to its website. In the recent affair, Musk has been reportedly sending emails to its X employees, signalling that the platform is struggling financially. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, he admitted that X is “barely breaking even,” citing stagnant user growth and underwhelming revenue.  He added, “Our user growth is stagnant, revenue is unimpressive, and we’re barely breaking even.”  Musk acquired the social media platform, previously called Twitter, in a $44 billion deal in late 2022. Since then, he has implemented several changes, such as eliminating the free verification program, launching a paid membership option, and rebranding the company as X.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Tune InTrending Reel

In the blog post, the company said that by making ChatGPT available to the US government, OpenAI aims to ensure ""AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people.""  OpenAI said the agencies can deploy ChatGPT Gov in their own Microsoft Azure commercial cloud, and will have access to many of the features and capabilities of ChatGPT Enterprise, including custom GPTs. The blog stated that ChatGPT Gov will help agencies control their own security, privacy, and compliance needs, including strict cybersecurity standards like IL5, CJIS, ITAR, and FedRAMP High. This setup can also speed up internal approval for using OpenAI’s tools with sensitive, non-public data.  Kevin Weil, OpenAI CPO, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the ChatGPT Gov delivers ""enormous potential tools to support the public sector in tackling complex challenges, from improving public health and infrastructure to strengthening national security."" OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov has similar features as ChatGPT Enterprise In the blog post, the company listed a few features, claiming that the features overlap with ChatGPT Enterprise. But these features come with enhanced security. As per the company, it allows government officials to save and share conversations within a secure workspace, as well as upload text and image files. Powered by the GPT-4o flagship model, it also enables employees to create and share custom GPTs within their workspace. This launch follows widespread adoption of OpenAI's AI technology across various government levels. More than 90,000 government employees have used ChatGPT, generating over 18 million prompts for tasks like document translation, drafting policy memos, code development, and application creation, according to the company. OpenAI is also pursuing FedRAMP accreditation for ChatGPT Enterprise, the foundation of ChatGPT Gov, to ensure compliance with government security standards. The launch follows a post by CEO Sam Altman on X, where he announced plans to accelerate certain releases. This was his first public comment after the low-cost Chinese AI startup DeepSeek disrupted AI-related stocks on Monday. Altman referred to DeepSeek as a ""new competitor"" after its free AI assistant surpassed ChatGPT in downloads on Apple's App Store. The model's rapid rise has prompted US tech investors to take a closer look at the billions of dollars committed to expanding AI operations.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Also read |  Elon Musk's X will launch its first digital wallet this yearAlso read |  DeepSeek AI: What is it, how it works and is it better than ChatGPT?

Could Apple's new design come at the cost of a key feature?",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-17-tipped-to-receive-big-design-overhaul-but-it-could-miss-out-on-this-feature-2671723-2025-01-29,"Apple’s iPhone 17 series is rumoured to bring one of the most impactful design changes in years, particularly to its rear camera module. Reports suggest that the Pro models might get rid of the iconic triangular lens arrangement in favour of a sleek horizontal bar-style setup, similar to what we get on Google’s Pixel 9. While this could give the iPhone a much-needed design change, it might come with a major trade-off — the potential loss of spatial video. Spatial video, introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro, is a feature that allows users to capture immersive, three-dimensional content for Apple’s Vision Pro headset. It works by using vertically aligned lenses to mimic the distance between human eyes, creating depth and perspective in videos. This alignment is crucial for the feature to function properly. However, if Apple shifts to a horizontal camera layout, as rumoured, spatial video capture in landscape mode could become impossible. This raises questions about Apple’s priorities. Spatial video has been a standout feature in recent iPhone models, heavily marketed as part of the Vision Pro ecosystem. Losing it on the Pro models, which are typically the most advanced in the lineup, would be a surprising move. Even more intriguing is the possibility that the standard iPhone 17 models might retain the vertical lens alignment, keeping spatial video functionality intact. If true, this would mark a big shift in Apple’s strategy, as advanced features have historically been reserved for the Pro models. On the other hand, if the horizontal design is adopted across the entire iPhone 17 series, including the rumoured iPhone 17 Air, spatial video could disappear altogether. The Air model, said to feature a single rear camera, would be essentially incompatible with the feature. This has left many wondering whether Apple is willing to sacrifice a key selling point for the sake of a design overhaul. However, there’s a chance Apple might have a workaround. Advances in computational photography, such as Gaussian splatting, could allow the company to retain spatial video functionality without relying on traditional lens arrangements. This technology, which creates 3D models from multiple camera angles, might offer a solution to the hardware limitations posed by a horizontal camera design. Having said that, it is still very early to talk about the iPhone 17 series. Until then, the rumours remain just that — rumours.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

According to a tweet by Gadget Bits on X (formerly Twitter), this upcoming mid-range device is expected to bring some notable upgrades over its predecessor, including a larger display, a new Qualcomm chipset, and an improved camera setup. While the company has remained tight-lipped about the specifics, leaks and certifications have given us a clearer picture of what to expect.

 The Nothing Phone 3a is rumoured to feature a 6.8-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it the biggest screen on any Nothing phone so far. The device will reportedly be powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset, a shift from the MediaTek Dimensity processor used in the Phone 2a. The phone will also run on Nothing OS 3.1, based on Android 15. One of the most exciting upgrades is the camera system. The Phone 3a is said to include a 50-megapixel primary rear camera paired with a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom, marking the first time Nothing has included a telephoto lens in its smartphones. However, this addition comes at the cost of the ultra-wide camera, which is expected to drop to 8-megapixel. On the front, a 32-megapixel selfie camera will sit in a hole-punch cutout, similar to previous models. In terms of battery life, nothing major is expected here, at least, if the leaks are to be believed. The Nothing Phone 3a will reportedly pack a 5,000mAh battery with support for 45W wired charging, matching the battery specs of the Phone 2a. Other expected features include NFC support and the company’s signature Glyph lighting. Interestingly, rumours suggest that Nothing might also launch a more premium variant, the Phone 3a Plus, alongside the standard model. The Plus variant could feature a periscope telephoto camera, offering a longer focal length than the 2x zoom on the Phone 3a. This would make it a more appealing option for photography enthusiasts. Both models have been spotted in certification databases, with model numbers A059 and A059P, respectively. Earlier reports suggested that Nothing might launch the Phone 3 series, including the flagship Phone 3, alongside the Phone 3a and 3a Plus on March 5. However, according to Yogesh Brar on X, it seems the Nothing Phone 3 may not debut on that date after all. Instead, the event is expected to feature the launch of three devices, but those eagerly awaiting the Phone 3 might have to wait a bit longer. If the Nothing Phone 3 doesn’t arrive on March 5, the question arises — what could the third device be, alongside the Phone 3a and 3a Plus? For now, it’s anyone’s guess, and only time will tell. We recommend taking this information with a healthy grain of salt until official details are confirmed.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

Microsoft's security researchers observed that, in the fall, individuals they believed to be connected to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI's application programming interface (API), the report said. OpenAI's API is the main way that software developers and business customers buy OpenAI's services. Microsoft, the largest investor for OpenAI, notified the company of suspicious activity, according to the Bloomberg report. Low-cost Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, an alternative to US rivals, sparked a tech stock selloff on Monday as its free AI assistant overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT on Apple's App Store in the United States. David Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto czar, told, opens new tab Fox News in an interview earlier on Tuesday that it was ""possible"" that DeepSeek stole intellectual property from the United States. ""There's substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI's models,"" Sacks said. Asked for comment on the Bloomberg report, an OpenAI spokesperson echoed Sacks in a statement that noted China-based companies and others were constantly attempting to replicate the models of leading US AI companies, without specifically naming DeepSeek or any other company. ""We engage in counter-measures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.""

As long-rumoured, the SE 4 retains the single rear camera setup from its predecessors. However, the camera module itself appears larger this time around.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-leaks-again-in-new-images-next-to-iphone-16-2671822-2025-01-29,"The iPhone SE 4 has been making quite the headlines lately, thanks to a series of leaks and rumours. Recently, new images and a hands-on video have surfaced online, giving us a closer look at what Apple’s next budget-friendly iPhone might offer. According to tipster Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter), the leaked images show the device in black and white, with a design that seems to blend elements from recent iPhones while keeping some familiar touches from the SE lineup. A separate post also shows the iPhone SE 4 posing next to the iPhone 16.

 According to the leaks, the alleged iPhone SE 4 appears to have a boxy frame with rounded edges, similar to the iPhone 14 and retains the power button on the right side. However, one of the biggest talking points is the rear camera setup. Unlike the dual-camera system seen on the iPhone 16, the SE 4 seems to stick with a single large sensor, accompanied by an LED flash. This keeps it in line with its predecessor, the iPhone SE 3, but with a noticeably larger camera module. The front design remains a bit of a mystery. While the leaked video doesn’t show the screen turned on, Majin Bu suggests that the final version will feature a notch, much like the iPhone 14. However, recent rumours have also hinted at the possibility of a Dynamic Island, which has become a signature feature on newer iPhone models. In fact, in a recent tweet, Ross Young claims that the iPhone SE 4 will feature a notch instead of the Dynamic Island. Amid the confusion, it’s unclear which direction Apple will take, but the notch seems more likely for a budget device. Another interesting detail is the inclusion of an action button, replacing the traditional mute switch. This change aligns the SE 4 with Apple’s current iPhone models, giving it a more modern feel. The phone is also expected to ditch the Lightning port in favour of USB-C. Under the hood, the iPhone SE 4 is rumoured to be powered by the A17 Pro chip, the same processor that’s also in the iPhone 15 Pro, along with 8GB RAM. The display is likely to be a 6.1-inch OLED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate, offering a big upgrade over the LCD screens used in previous SE models. The camera setup is expected to include a 48-megapixel primary rear camera and a 24-megapixel front-facing camera. As for the launch, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to hit the global market, including India, between March and April, later this year. Pricing is rumoured to start at $499 (roughly Rs 43,200). This is a noticeable jump from the launch price of the iPhone SE 3, which debuted at $429 or Rs 43,900 in India. However, after just a few months, the Indian price of the SE 3 rose to Rs 49,900. So, the biggest question is — with its upgraded features, can the iPhone SE 4 remain under the Rs 50,000 price point in India? We’ll have to wait and see.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

If this holds to be true, the upcoming foldables will not see a price increase. That said, rumours also suggest that Samsung will reveal a budget-friendly choice, to make up for the decreased price expectations. Samsung Galaxy Flip 7 might arrive with a younger sibling this year -- Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which would be a more affordable alternative to the flagship. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7: What to expect  The Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 are expected to introduce notable upgrades, including Samsung's Exynos 2500 chipset. Display sizes are rumoured to increase, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 featuring an 8-inch internal screen and a 6.5-inch cover display, matching the Galaxy Z Fold 6 SE. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 may boast a 6.85-inch main display, up from the Flip 6’s 6.7 inches, and a larger 4-inch cover screen compared to its predecessor's 3.4 inches. Both foldables are also expected to be 10 per cent thinner, offering a more refined and compact design. But there is more... Samsung to launch 4 foldables this year  As we discuss Samsung's plans for its next-gen foldables, the rumour has it that it will release 2 more devices other than usual. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and a triple foldable are also expected to hit the market, along with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7.  Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE: After Motorola and Infinix launched their flip phones for under Rs 50,000, Samsung is reportedly planning to expand its foldable tech into an affordable range. To maintain a low-cost, the FE model is reportedly powered by the Exynos 2400e, which also powers the Galaxy S24 FE.  Triple-foldable phone: Samsung has been developing a triple-fold smartphone for quite some time. In 2022, the company revealed a prototype of the device, but it has yet to be released. However, recent leaks suggest that 2025 might finally be the year for its debut, with a potential launch as early as September. Notably, this timeline coincides with the anticipated release of the Galaxy Z Flip 7.   While details about the tri-fold device remain limited, one intriguing theory indicates it could feature a massive 12.4-inch display when fully unfolded. This impressive screen size could position the device as a versatile hybrid, serving as both a smartphone and a tablet, and surpassing the 10.2-inch display of Huawei’s Mate X3. Additionally, a partially unfolded mode with a screen size of around 10.5 inches could offer a premium viewing experience, further boosting its appeal.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Also read |  Samsung is likely to launch four affordable smartphones in India soonAlso read |  Nothing Phone 3a specs leaked, said to feature 6.8-inch display and 50MP telephoto cameraAlso read |  iPhone 17 tipped to receive big design overhaul, but it could miss out on this featureMust Watch

Just days after the DeepSeek AI trend swept across tech circles, 16 robots from Unitree Robotics took centre stage, dancing alongside human performers in a display that quickly went viral and caught the attention of social media users on X and Reddit. The robots were made to perform a traditional Yangko dance — a folk art from northeast China. Users on social media are impressed by the performance of these robots because they move in perfect sync with the human performers. They even manipulated handkerchiefs with their mechanical arms, twirling and tossing them into the air with a precision that left audiences in awe.Social media users make fun of Elon Musk's Optimus robot Social media was quick to react to the performance, with platforms like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) flooded with comments from impressed viewers. Many expressed amazement at how smoothly the robots danced, with some users calling it a ""fascinating"" display of AI capabilities. One Reddit user commented, ""The way those robots spin those handkerchiefs is seriously impressive,"" while another added, ""I think it’s cool how they’re blending technology with culture. This is the future."" Comparisons are also being drawn between China’s humanoid robots and other robotics projects around the world, particularly Elon Musk’s Optimus robot. Some users noted that while Optimus is still in development and struggles with basic movements, China’s robots were already performing complex dance routines with ease. One X user humorously commented, ""While Musk’s robot is still learning to walk, China’s robots are already dancing like pros.""What tech these Chinese humanoid robots are using? Unitree Robotics, the Chinese company behind these humanoid robots, revealed that the robots used in the performance are part of their ""Fuxi"" series. According to the company, these robots are equipped with 360-degree of panoramic depth perception technology, which allows them to navigate their surroundings with precision. It allows them to perform complex movements like the waist-twisting and leg-kicking steps typical of the Yangko dance. This technology, combined with high-precision 3D laser SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping) positioning, enables the robots to perform on complex stages like the one at the Spring Festival Gala without missing a beat. Check out the robot dancing video below
 
Why is this a big deal? It is a big deal because China is giving tough competition to America in this AI race and the country is able to offer great AI products without making much of noise. As mentioned above, the new robots are designed with AI-driven motion control technology that allows them to mimic human movements and the accuracy is remarkable, something which can be seen in the viral video.  What set the performance apart was not just the robots' ability to replicate human dance moves, but their capacity to adjust in real-time to the music. Using advanced AI algorithms, the robots were able to ""understand"" the music, adapting their movements based on its rhythm and tempo. This ability to react to external stimuli is one of the key features of Unitree’s AI-driven robots, allowing them to function in dynamic environments like a live stage performance.China's growing presence in AI is likely a threat to the US market The viral success of the robot dance comes just days after another major AI breakthrough from China: the release of DeepSeek AI. It is an advanced large language model that has been gaining attention as a strong competitor to platforms like ChatGPT, which is free of cost with performance on point and it even uses fewer resources compared to its rivals.  Together, these two events shows China’s growing presence in the global AI and robotics space. Donald Trump has also issued a warning against the growing presence of Chinese AI tech with a statement that the success of DeepSeek AI should be a wake up call for the US tech industry. Well, so far, America has been dominating the AI space with companies like OpenAI and Google. With the debut of DeepSeek AI, Trump is seemingly worried about his country's future position in the AI tech space.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 29, 2025

Apart from other Apple Intelligence features and improvements, it has also introduced Starlink connectivity. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ios-183-introduces-starlink-connectivity-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work-2671704-2025-01-29,"Apple iOS 18.3 is finally here with a bunch of new features and bug fixes. Apart from the mainstream features, the company has also introduced Starlink connectivity, a new satellite connection. After introducing satellite connectivity features in 2022, iOS 18.3 has further improved the functionality. According to the Bloomberg report, Apple was secretly working with Space X and T-mobiles, to bring Starlink satellite connectivity to the iPhone.  The report added that T-Mobile has begun testing an early version of the Starlink service with a limited number of iPhones. This development coincides with the release of iOS 18.3, although Apple did not highlight this change in the update’s release notes.How does it work?  Now that Starlink is on board with Apple, it will allow users to send text messages even when there is no cellular network. But how is it different? The company explains, when a T-Mobile iPhone has no cellular signal, devices in the Starlink program will try to connect to SpaceX satellites. Users can also enable texting through the satellite menu for Globalstar or contact emergency services via Apple.  Currently, Starlink only supports texting, but SpaceX and T-Mobile plan to add data and voice services later. The program is available only in the US for now, unlike Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in multiple countries. SpaceX also aims to expand Starlink to other carriers worldwide. The Bloomberg report also highlighted another key difference. It states that Apple's current feature requires users to manually point their iPhone toward the sky to connect with a satellite. In contrast, the Starlink option is designed to work automatically, even when the phone is in the user's pocket. iOS 18.3 update: What is new Other than the Starlink connectivity, Apple has also improved certain existing features and introduced a few new ones.  Return of Calculator Repeated Operations: iOS 18.3 reinstates the repeated operations feature in the Calculator app, a popular functionality from iOS 17 that was removed in iOS 18. Its return has been welcomed by users who rely on it for quick and efficient calculations. New Features for iPhone 16 Series: The update introduces enhanced camera controls for iPhone 16 users, allowing Auto Exposure and Auto Focus Lock with a simple press and hold on the Camera Control button. The new Visual Intelligence feature also lets users scan posters with date and location details to create calendar events seamlessly and identify plants and animals in real-time—perfect for nature enthusiasts. Improved Notification Summaries: Notification summaries in iOS 18.3 now appear in italicised text, making them easier to differentiate from standard notifications. Genmoji Accessibility and Security Enhancements: Creating and using Genmoji is now more straightforward in Messages and other supported apps. On the security side, the update fixes 20 bugs and introduces safeguards to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive audio and visual data on iPhones.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Also read |  iPhone SE 4 leaks again in new images next to iPhone 16Also read |  iPhone 17 tipped to receive big design overhaul, but it could miss out on this featureAlso read |  iOS 18.3 stable update now rolling out to compatible iPhones

0c2ab0ae-ff56-4f3e-be46-708ed37cbeda,"Canon R5 Mark II review: One camera to do it all Cameras, once considered essential, have evolved into specialised tools. But in 2025 if you need one, irrespective of your requirement, chances are that you won't find a camera better than the Canon R5 Mark II. It is expensive but it also does everything. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/canon-r5-mark-ii-review-one-camera-to-do-it-all-2672002-2025-01-29,"Over here at India Today Tech we rarely review DSLR cameras nowadays. Reason for that is simple: as smartphones have improved at clicking photos in the last 7-8 years, the nature of big and hulking DSLR cameras has changed. Earlier cameras used to be a general-purpose tool. They would be required whenever we wanted to click photos. Now, most people use a phone for that. Cameras, essentially, have become specialised tools. So, why am I reviewing the Canon R5 Mark II today? Because it is an incredible machine, and while I am certain that a lot of people who use DSLRs already know about it well enough, it is a kind of gadget that is worth the attention from anyone thinking of upping their game and getting into serious photography, the kind of photography that is done not as a family service during a weekend outing, but as a hobby and for joy.  And talking of joy, here is my one-line review of the Canon R5 Mark II: It has been a blast to click photos with it over the last 10 days. The experience has been so good that it reminded me of days from a few years ago when I always had a DSLR camera in my bag.  Now, before I talk about my experience with it, first a quick primer on the R5 Mark II, largely for people who don’t track cameras. The Canon R5 Mark II is the first update to the popular R5. And as an update, it shares a number of similarities with the R5, as well as a few key enhancements. Over the last few years, there has been a flurry of improvements in the camera market. The mirror is now gone from DSLRs. The sensors have much higher resolutions and their read-out speeds have gone up significantly. The electronic viewfinders have become much much better. And most importantly — this is a trend that Canon kickstarted — the autofocus has acquired some new AI-driven tricks.Excellent sensor and hardware The Canon R5 Mark II, in a way, is a machine that brings to prosumers, professionals and hobbyists the best of this camera progress in a price that is high but palatable. It is built around a 45-megapixel sensor, which means it is versatile. Shooting landscape, portraits and architecture? Its sensor has enough pixels to give you a truckload of details. Shooting action such as your friends during a cricket match or a running wildebeest during a safari in Kenya? The sensor resolves enough details to let you do some aggressive cropping. Want to do some low-light shooting? The Canon R5 II sensor has enough dynamic range to make even extremely high ISO photography — say 12800 — usable. 
 


 The high-resolution sensor also means that the R5 Mark II can be a perfect tool for amateur or semi-professional videography. It can shoot video footage in up to 8K and 30FPS, with higher speeds of 120FPS and 60FPS available with 4K resolution. Even if you are going to only use 4K or 1080P footage for your content, the higher resolution gives you the ability to do more creative cropping. In other words, you can easily make the R5 Mark II work as your primary camera for YouTube content. This sensor is paired with the rest of the hardware that too is top of the line. The body of the R5 II is built well and is weather-sealed, offering a decent amount of protection against moisture and dust. Yet, it is also relatively light. It weighs just a little over 700 grams, which makes it handier and easier to use even for hours when paired with a relatively short and light lens. For example, I used the R5 Mark II with the RF 24-105 F4 lens, which is available as a kit option with the camera. The combination was perfect for day-to-day shooting. One more thing that helps as you use the R5 Mark II is its mature controls and grip. Unlike what I have seen with cameras from some other brands, the Canon grip and control system is well-tuned, making the camera feel like an extension of your arm. Inside the camera, there is the Digic X chipset accompanied by a separate accelerator chip. Apart from the sensor, it is this chipset that is largely responsible for the speed of the camera. And the R5 Mark II is extremely fast. Because of its electronic shutter, it can shoot at a speed of up to 30FPS. Although if you are a purist and choose to use a mechanical shutter — there is virtually no need though — the R5 Mark II still manages up to 12 frames per second, which is going to be more than enough for almost any kind of shooting a prosumer or hobbyist may want to do.  Rest of the hardware is exactly what you would expect in an expensive high-end camera. There are two card slots — one CFexpress and another a regular UHS-II. USB C with 3.2 is there and so is the full-size HDMI port. Using the accompanying app, the camera can be connected to a phone. The electronic viewfinder uses an extremely bright OLED with 5.76 million pixels, and the 3.2-inch LCD screen is vari-angle, something that is essential for video work. advertisementUsing the Canon R5 Mark II
 


As good as the hardware, the proof of the pudding is in eating. But before I share my experience with the Canon R5 Mark II, some notes: — I have used the camera mostly for shooting images, so my experience is primarily about that. But it is a capable camera for video shooting and content creation as well. For example, check this FIIBER by India Today video: the anchor links in it were shot with the R5 Mark II. Notice how sticky the auto-focus is in the videos, always sticking to the eyes of the anchor. — I used the R5 Mark II only with the RF 24-105 F4 lens.— I am not a professional photographer, so this is not a review from their point of view. They probably already know everything that is to know about the R5 Mark II. — The image samples used in this review have been edited as per taste. The technical ability of the R5 Mark II is not in doubt. Actually, there is no modern camera released after 2000 that is bad at image quality. So, this review is not about what image quality R5 Mark II can offer. It is about what a user can do with it, and that depends more on its auto-focus system, ergonomics, speed etc. I have also reduced the resolution of the image samples here to around 1200P width to keep this page mobile-friendly.advertisement— I didn’t shoot RAW. I know purists will scoff at it. But most people don’t shoot RAW, and I wanted to try the camera from the perspective of somewhat more regular users. Also, the image sensors have become so good that the differences aren’t that big between photos shot in RAW and then developed and photos that were simply shot as JPEG and then lightly edited. Now, let’s talk about the R5 Mark II in use. As expected, the camera excels at image quality. Whether in good light or in low, the image fidelity in photos clicked with the R5 Mark II is off the charts. All of this is expected, of course. But what surprised me in a pleasant way is the kind of colours this camera renders. I am more used to Nikon colours and in the past always found the Canon colours to be slightly warmer and lighter to my taste. The Canon R5 Mark II, however, gets it just right. More significantly, not only does it render colours brilliantly in good light but also in low light. For example, in the image samples, look at the photo of the woman near the lamp post: her red shawl is pleasantly vivid despite poor lighting in the scene. 

 



The Canon R5 Mark II is fast enough to shoot moving subjects like this woman on a bicycle.
One of the top reasons why you may want to get a super expensive DSLR camera even if you are not a professional shooter is the speed that these cameras offer. Despite advances in smartphones, or great image sensors in smaller cameras, if you want to shoot speed and action — think wildlife running and birds flying, children playing a competitive game, surfers and bikers — you need a proper full-size camera. The R5 Mark II is one such camera. While I did not get a chance to go birding with it, I did try the camera on kids playing in a housing society, as well as on people going on about their life on bikes and cycles. 

 



The 45-megapixel sensor in the R5 Mark II captures a tremendous amount of details.
The autofocus in the R5 Mark II is top-notch, driven by AI that uses subject recognition. There are several options to choose from and several settings to turn on or turn off. But irrespective of how you tune it, one key feature of the R5 Mark II is that it is always looking for and tracking eyes in a frame. You are shooting your pet dog, the camera locks on its eyes. You are shooting a pigeon cooing and strutting in your balcony, the camera finds its eye and sticks to it. You are shooting someone coming towards you speedily on a cycle? You get it, the camera finds the eyes of the person and locks its focus. The focus system in the R5 Mark II is fast, precise and incredibly sticky. It is a focus system designed to deliver sharp photos whether you are shooting the bride and groom at a wedding or seagulls on your holiday.

 



The R5 Mark II renders deep and rich colours in photos clicked with it.
The good focus, combined with fast shooting speed, meant that I could click photos of moving subjects easily and with almost no effort on my part. It was so easy that it felt like cheating. Another bit that I absolutely love about the R5 Mark II is how much leeway it has for cropping images. I was shooting with a 105mm lens, which means with hardly any reach. Yet, after clicking photos I could easily crop them aggressively. The sensor is so good that if the photo has been clicked in daylight it wouldn’t be a hassle even if you end up cropping almost 70-80 per cent of the photo to get closer to the subject. A good image sensor also means good performance in low light, even with high ISO. During my night-time walks with the camera I often used ISO as high as 25600 and 12800. At 12800, the images do get noisy but not so much that a run through Lightroom won’t fix them. Under dire circumstances, most shooters will find even 25600 ISO usable. Click on any photo below to access all the camera samplesThe speed is also evident in the way the electronic viewfinder works. As noted earlier, it uses OLED and it gets extremely bright. Compared to optical viewfinders, I find that the disadvantages of electronic viewfinders are now all gone. The visual acuity is superb and speed means there is no longer a viewfinder blackout, at least not in the R5 Mark II, even when you are shooting at a high frame rate. The LCD screen, meanwhile, I believe could have been better. It supports touch, which is always a good feature because it makes dealing with the unwieldy and over-complicated menu system in cameras easier. But I find that the LCD screen could have been sharper and brighter.Who should get the Canon R5 Mark IIAs I noted earlier, the R5 Mark II is a camera meant for anyone who wants to do photography either for work — hello, wedding photographers — or for joy. Otherwise, you can simply use a high-end smartphone. If you are looking to do more, if you want a camera that will let you click action and speed, which will give you images that are full of details, micro-contrast and high-dynamic range, you need a camera like the Canon R5 Mark II. It’s perfect at what it does. In fact, it is more than perfect given its versatility. From wildlife shooters to wedding photographers, everyone will appreciate it. It is also a camera that will even please content creators because of its ability to offer sticky auto-focus and high-resolution footage.One issue, however, is its cost. The versatility of the R5 Mark II comes at a price. At a price of Rs 405,995 to be precise for the camera body. Lenses, depending on what you get, will cost more. This is MRP and the market price would be lower. Yet, it is some serious dough to put on a camera if you are not a professional. Then there is another consideration: the availability of lenses. As much as I loved using the R5 Mark II, I do see that Canon has a few gaps in its RF lens lineup. In consumer-grade (and hence relatively cheaper), Sony and Nikon have a better super telephoto. Sony and Nikon also have cheaper, but optically superb, primes compared to Canon that has more exotic but pricier ones. Having said all this, I do find the R5 Mark II a gem of a camera. It is, arguably, the most versatile camera in the market. And while it is priced higher than its competition — Nikon Z8 and Sony 7R Mark 5 — it offers enough to justify its price to those who need its versatility.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 29, 2025

As it gains attention for its AI advancements, Musk’s comments on X (formerly Twitter) show he is not entirely convinced by its claims or hype. He has also made fun of DeepSeek AI in one of his social media posts. DeepSeek's AI chatbot has been hailed as a big innovation, with many comparing its abilities to leading American AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. What is notable, however, is that DeepSeek reportedly achieved these results with a much smaller investment. This has led to a lot of excitement in the AI community, with many seeing it as a strong competitor to the established players. The company’s rise to popularity has also triggered a noticeable shift in the market, as Nvidia, a key supplier of GPUs for AI, saw its market cap drop by a big margin after DeepSeek’s latest AI product was announced. Despite the buzz, Elon Musk has not been impressed. When Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised DeepSeek’s accomplishments and suggested that data and metadata are the real value of AI, Musk responded with a dismissive ""Lmao, no."" This short but sharp reply highlighted Musk’s doubt over the value of DeepSeek's AI model.

 Musk didn’t stop there. He also shared his views on DeepSeek’s hardware capabilities, particularly its use of GPUs. While DeepSeek claims to use around 10,000 A100 Nvidia GPUs, Musk and Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang speculated that the company might be hiding its true hardware capacity due to US export controls. Wang suggested that DeepSeek likely has access to around 50,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, which would make their AI system far more powerful than publicly disclosed. Musk responded to Wang’s claim with a simple ""Obviously,"" further indicating his belief that the company is not being transparent.
 


 In addition to his critical comments on DeepSeek’s AI technology, Musk also took the opportunity to poke fun at the company’s Chinese origins. When a user joked that DeepSeek’s AI, called R1, was ""leaked from a lab in China,"" Musk replied with a laughing emoji, referencing past controversies about China’s role in global technological developments.
 


 While DeepSeek continues to gain attention and recognition, Musk’s responses suggest he is not convinced that the company’s AI poses a serious challenge to the dominance of US tech giants like OpenAI. His scepticism also suggests that their is now a growing rivalry between AI companies from the US and China.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 29, 2025

The series includes 3 smartphones: Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra. While users can pre-order their next-gen Galaxy phone, the sale is scheduled to go live on February 7. Now, even before the sale begins, a recent report indicates that the company may launch a 128GB variant for the vanilla model, the Galaxy S25. Currently, Samsung has announced only 2 storage variants, 256GB and 512GB. This new model aims to lower the cost of the phone. advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25 to come in 128GB variantAccording to the latest report, by 91mobiles, the Samsung Galaxy S25 will soon appear with a lower storage option as well. It stated that the 128GB model could be priced at Rs 74,999. Currently, the phone is available in 256GB and 512GB at a price of Rs 80,999 and Rs 92,999, respectively. This means, with the introduction of a lower storage model, Samsung will offer a much more affordable phone with the same features. If this price leak holds to be true, then there is a Rs 6,000 difference. That said, we hope Samsung will offer bank discounts as well, making the price even lower and budget-friendly. While India still has to wait for the 128GB variant, the US market has already listed the model. On the Samsung website, the Samsung Galaxy S25 128Gb is listed at $799 (around Rs 69,100).

eb02b124-e4ff-4d6d-822e-dbac52290e29,"Alibaba releases AI model, claims it surpasses DeepSeek-V3On the first day of Chinese New Year, Alibaba released its latest AI model, Qwen 2.5. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/alibaba-releases-ai-model-it-claims-surpasses-deepseek-v3-2671891-2025-01-29,"Chinese tech company Alibaba 9988.HK on Wednesday released a new version of its Qwen 2.5 artificial intelligence model that it claimed surpassed the highly-acclaimed DeepSeek-V3. The unusual timing of the Qwen 2.5-Max's release, on the first day of the Lunar New Year when most Chinese people are off work and with their families, points to the pressure Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's meteoric rise in the past three weeks has placed on not just overseas rivals, but also its domestic competition. ""Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B,"" Alibaba's cloud unit said in an announcement posted on its official WeChat account, referring to OpenAI and Meta's most advanced open-source AI models.
 


 The January 10 release of DeepSeek's AI assistant, powered by the DeepSeek-V3 model, as well as the January 20 release of its R1 model, has shocked Silicon Valley and caused tech shares to plunge, with the Chinese startup's purportedly low development and usage costs prompting investors to question huge spending plans by leading AI firms in the United States. But DeepSeek's success has also led to a scramble among its domestic competitors to upgrade their own AI models. Two days after the release of DeepSeek-R1, TikTok owner ByteDance released an update to its flagship AI model, which it claimed outperformed Microsoft-backed OpenAI's o1 in AIME, a benchmark test that measures how well AI models understand and respond to complex instructions.
 


 This echoed DeepSeek's claim that its R1 model rivalled OpenAI's o1 on several performance benchmarks.DeepSeek VS Domestic Competitors The predecessor of DeepSeek's V3 model, DeepSeek-V2, triggered an AI model price war in China after it was released last May. The fact that DeepSeek-V2 was open-source and unprecedentedly cheap, only 1 yuan ($0.14) per 1 million tokens - or units of data processed by the AI model - led to Alibaba's cloud unit announcing price cuts of up to 97 per cent on a range of models. Other Chinese tech companies followed suit, including Baidu 9888.HK, which released China's first equivalent to ChatGPT in March 2023, and the country's most valuable internet company Tencent 0700.HK. Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek's enigmatic founder, said in a rare interview with Chinese media outlet Waves in July that the startup ""did not care"" about price wars and that achieving AGI (artificial general intelligence) was its main goal. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks. While large Chinese tech companies like Alibaba have hundreds of thousands of employees, DeepSeek operates like a research lab, staffed mainly by young graduates and doctorate students from top Chinese universities. Liang said in his July interview that he believed China's largest tech companies might not be well suited to the future of the AI industry, contrasting their high costs and top-down structures with DeepSeek's lean operation and loose management style. ""Large foundational models require continued innovation, tech giants' capabilities have their limits,"" he said.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Also read |  Microsoft investigating if DeepSeek-linked group improperly obtained OpenAI dataAlso read |  OpenAI introduces ChatGPT Gov for US government: How does it workAlso read |  DeepSeek AI: What is it, how it works and is it better than ChatGPT?

If you have an iPhone or an iPad, you will now be able to download complete seasons of your favourite shows at once. No need to download episodes individually any more.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/netflix-gets-a-big-update-adds-full-season-download-feature-on-iphone-and-ipads-2672222-2025-01-30,"Netflix has rolled out a new feature for iPhone and iPad users, allowing them to download entire seasons of their favourite shows with just one tap. This feature, previously exclusive to Android devices, is a major timesaver for iOS users who previously had to download episodes individually. The new Season Download option can be found next to the Share button on a show’s display page, making it quicker and easier to download content for offline viewing. Of course, this is particularly useful for people who want to enjoy shows or movies during commutes, flights, or trips where internet access might be unreliable. Offline viewing on Netflix was first introduced in 2016, and since then, the company has added features like Smart Downloads, which automatically replaces watched episodes with the next one in the series. The addition of season downloads for iOS devices is another step in making Netflix more accessible and convenient for its global audience. Alongside this update, Netflix also shared a list of its most downloaded seasons of all time. Topping the list are Squid Game Seasons 1 and 2, followed by Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, One Piece, and Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.  However, this new feature comes at a time when Netflix has announced price increases in the US. The premium ad-free plan now costs $24.99 per month, while the standard ad-free plan has risen to $17.99. Even the ad-supported tier has seen a hike, now priced at $7.99 per month. Subscribers on ad-free plans can store up to 100 active downloads per device, but those on ad-supported plans are limited to just 15 downloads per month.  Interestingly, the price hikes do not apply to Indian users — at least for now. Netflix continues to offer its four subscription plans in India: Mobile, Basic, Standard, and Premium. The Mobile plan, priced at Rs 149 per month, allows streaming on one device at a time in 480p resolution. The Basic plan, costing Rs 199, supports 720p resolution and one streaming device. For Rs 499, the Standard plan offers 1080p HD resolution and allows two simultaneous streams. Finally, the Premium plan, priced at Rs 649, provides 4K resolution, spatial audio, and supports up to four streaming devices at once. Additionally, content can be downloaded on up to seven devices, making it a popular choice for families. The Netflix full-season download feature on iOS devices is currently live. If you haven’t seen it for yourself, make sure to update the Netflix app by heading over to the App Store.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

The issue was first uncovered by security researcher Ramshath, who detailed the bug in a post on Medium. According to the researcher, the vulnerability allowed anyone to bypass the View Once privacy protection by navigating to the app’s storage settings. By going to Settings > Storage and Data > Manage Storage, locating the sender’s chat, and sorting media by Newest, users could still access the supposedly fleeting content. This completely defeats the feature’s promise of ensuring sensitive media disappear after being viewed once. This isn’t the first time the View Once feature has faced security challenges. Back in September last year, security researcher Tal Be’ery found a way to view and save View Once media on WhatsApp Web, even though the feature was only intended to work on the platform’s Android and iOS apps. That issue was fixed in early December. Late last week, another flaw was documented, allowing recipients of View Once media to view it indefinitely, even after it had been opened and closed within the chat. Staff at Android Police were able to replicate this internally on Thursday, January 23, but the exploit no longer works as of today, suggesting that Meta rolled out a server-side fix over the weekend. The tech giant has yet to publicly acknowledge the vulnerability. WhatsApp’s parent company, Meta, confirmed that a fix was already in the works when the researcher reported the latest issue. While the discovery didn’t qualify for a bug bounty (as Meta was already aware of the problem), the company thanked the researcher for their efforts. The latest update doesn’t just address the privacy flaw — it also introduces several new features. Users can now make calls without saving phone numbers first, and group calling capabilities have been enhanced. These additions aim to improve the overall user experience while maintaining the app’s focus on privacy and security. For iOS users, updating to the latest version is crucial to ensure that the View Once feature works as intended. The update is available through the App Store, and users are encouraged to install it immediately to protect their privacy.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

In a blog post published Wednesday, Wiz said that scans of DeepSeek's infrastructure showed that the company had accidentally left more than a million lines of data available unsecured. Those included digital software keys and chat logs that appeared to capture prompts being sent from users to the company's free AI assistant.  ""The exposure includes over a million lines of log streams containing chat history, secret keys, backend details, and other highly sensitive information. The Wiz Research team immediately and responsibly disclosed the issue to DeepSeek, which promptly secured the exposure,"" the report stated.  Wiz's chief technology officer said DeepSeek quickly secured the data after his firm alerted them. ""They took it down in less than an hour,"" Ami Luttwak said. ""But this was so simple to find we believe we're not the only ones who found it."" DeepSeek did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The company's practically overnight success following the launch of its AI assistant has thrilled China and sparked anxiety in America. The Chinese company's apparent ability to match OpenAI's capabilities at a much lower cost has posed questions over the sustainability of the business models and profit margins of US AI giants such as Nvidia and Microsoft. By Monday, it had overtaken US rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's App Store, triggering a global selloff in tech shares.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 30, 2025

On Monday, Nvidia’s stock fell by nearly 20 per cent as there were fears that DeepSeek's AI models might reduce the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs). However, during Meta’s earnings call on Wednesday, Zuckerberg reassured investors that Meta's plans to invest billions of dollars into AI over the long term remain unchanged. Meta has already planned to spend more than $60 billion in 2025, mainly on building and upgrading data centers to support its AI infrastructure. This move is seen as key to Meta's long-term strategy. When asked if DeepSeek's progress could affect Meta's AI spending, Zuckerberg said the company would keep investing in AI, seeing it as a major advantage, especially since Meta serves billions of users around the world.DeepSeek is a competitor but it is not an immediate threat Zuckerberg seemingly considers DeepSeek a new competitor in the AI space but said it’s too early to know if this will slow down the demand for GPUs. He believes that GPUs will remain important for running AI tasks like data processing. Meta’s massive user base requires strong AI infrastructure to handle the scale of its operations, and Zuckerberg is confident that investing in this area will give Meta a competitive edge. He explained, ""At this point, I would bet that the ability to build out that kind of infrastructure is going to be a major advantage for both the quality of the service and being able to serve the scale that we want to.""Llama 4: Meta’s next big AI leap which could reduce human jobs A key part of Meta’s AI strategy is the development of its next AI model, Llama 4. Zuckerberg revealed that this model will be designed to compete with top AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Llama 4 is expected to have advanced features, such as the ability to work on tasks by itself (agent capabilities) and handle multiple types of inputs (multimodal abilities). ""Llama 4 is making great progress in training. Llama 4 mini is done with pre-training and our reasoning models and larger model are looking good too,"" Zuckerberg said. “Our goal with Llama 3 was to make open-source AI models competitive with closed models, and with Llama 4, we want to lead,” Zuckerberg said. He added that Llama 4 could set new standards in the AI world and help Meta become a leader in open-source AI.  Zuckerberg recently talked about his vision for 2025, calling it a key year for AI development. He stated that by 2025, AI at Meta and other tech companies could effectively replace mid-level engineers who currently write code. This would represent a big shift in how tech companies approach software development. ""We will get to a point where all the code in our apps and the AI it generates will also be written by AI engineers instead of people engineers,"" he said. For context, Business Insider reported that mid-level software engineers at Meta currently earn salaries in the mid-six figures — a cost AI could reduce for the company by a big margin.Mark Zuckerberg aims to reach a billion users with Meta AI In addition to its larger AI goals, Meta is also focused on expanding its AI assistant, Meta AI, which Zuckerberg expects will reach over one billion users by the end of the year. Meta’s approach to AI is focused on personalisation, offering users an experience as per to their individual preferences, interests, and culture. Zuckerberg believes this personal touch is what will set Meta apart from its competitors. ""We believe that people don’t all want to use the same AI. People want their AI to be personalised to their context, interests, personality, and culture,"" he said.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 30, 2025

However, a new report from Android Headlines reveals that two new phones are on the way: the Nothing Phone 3a and the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. Interestingly, the Pro model won’t carry the ‘Plus’ tag as previously speculated, marking a slight shift in naming conventions. The Nothing Phone 3a is expected to come in two variants — one with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, and another with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage. The Phone 3a Pro, on the other hand, will be available in a single configuration with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage. Both devices will be offered in two colour options. While black will be common for both, the Phone 3a will also come in white, and the Pro model will feature a grey variant. Recent leaks have shed more light on the Phone 3a’s specifications. It is expected to feature a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset, paired with a 6.8-inch FHD+ AMOLED display and a 120Hz refresh rate. The phone will likely run on Nothing OS 2.1 based on Android 15. A 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging support is also rumoured, alongside the signature Glyph lights. In terms of cameras, the Phone 3a is tipped to sport a triple-camera setup, including a 50-megapixel primary sensor, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom, a first for any Nothing phone. A 32-megapixel front camera is expected for selfies.  An alleged image of the Nothing Phone 3a has also surfaced online, showcasing a horizontally aligned triple-camera setup with a flash positioned above it. However, since the phone is pictured inside a protective case, the Glyph design remains hidden. As with any leak, the authenticity of the source cannot be verified, so it’s wise to take this information with a healthy grain of salt until official details are revealed.

 Apart from the Nothing Phone 3a, earlier reports suggested that Nothing might launch the flagship Phone 3 alongside the Phone 3a and 3a Plus (now speculated to be Pro) on March 5. However, according to Yogesh Brar on X, the Phone 3 may not debut at the event after all. Instead, the company is expected to unveil three devices, but the third one remains a mystery. If the Nothing Phone 3 doesn’t arrive on March 5, the question arises — what could the third device be, alongside the Phone 3a and 3a Pro? For now, it’s anyone’s guess, and only time will tell.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

This time, the tech company is eliminating a ""small number of roles"" in its communications department, as part of its ongoing efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs. The move is Amazon's part of a broader strategy to cut bureaucracy and improve the company's efficiency, helping teams move faster and get closer to customers. A spokesperson for Amazon, Brad Glasser, confirmed the decision to Bloomberg and said that the company had conducted a recent review of its Communications and Corporate Responsibility organisation. Based on this, Amazon decided to make changes, including the elimination of some roles.  ""These decisions are never easy,"" Glasser stated, ""but they are necessary to help us move faster, increase ownership, and strengthen our culture while bringing our teams closer to customers. We are committed to supporting the employees affected during this transition."" The layoffs come as Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, continues his efforts to reshape the company following his appointment as CEO in 2021. Since taking over from founder Jeff Bezos, Jassy has overseen a series of job cuts and has scaled back on several ambitious projects that no longer align with Amazon’s core business. This includes thousands of job cuts across the company as part of a wider effort to tighten operations. Amazon’s largest wave of job cuts occurred in 2022, affecting 27,000 corporate roles across different departments. In the time since, the company has carried out smaller, more focused layoffs, targeting specific teams and areas that require downsizing. The communications department is the latest to be affected as Amazon continues to find ways to cut costs and operate more efficiently. In addition to layoffs, Amazon has implemented a return-to-office mandate for its corporate employees, requiring them to work from the office five days a week. Many saw this as a way to encourage voluntary resignations, although Jassy said the move was about implementing Amazon’s corporate culture.  In September, Jassy also directed executives to reorganise their business units by the end of March, focusing on reducing the number of managers relative to individual contributors. The goal is to simplify the management structure, make decision-making quicker, and ensure that teams are more agile in responding to customer needs. While the latest layoffs may raise concerns among employees, Amazon has maintained that it remains committed to helping affected workers through the transition process. Though the company hasn't specified the exact number of employees impacted, it stressed that support will be available for those losing their jobs.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 30, 2025

Union Minister of Electronics and IT, Ashwini Vaishnaw, has announced that the AI model will be ready in 10 months, marking a big milestone in the country’s journey towards being self-reliant on AI.  Speaking at the Utkarsh Odisha Conclave, Vaishnaw asserted that the groundwork for the AI model has already been laid. The framework is now ready, and the government’s focus is on building a system that caters to the unique needs of Indian users.  ""Over the last 1.5 years, our teams have been working closely with startups, researchers, professors etc.  Today, we are calling for proposals to develop our own foundational model. The model will take care of the Indian context, languages, and culture, are devoid of biases,"" Vaishnaw told reporters. India’s AI ambitions are backed by a solid infrastructure. The country has surpassed its initial target of securing 10,000 GPUs, now boasting a total of 18,600 GPUs. This advanced computing power will be critical in training the AI model. Most of the GPUs are high-performance NVIDIA H100 and H200, alongside MI325 models. For comparison, while DeepSeek AI was trained on 2,500 GPUs and ChatGPT on 25,000, India now has over 15,000 high-end GPUs, positioning itself strongly in the AI race. Vaishnaw stressed that this infrastructure will play a key role in the country’s AI mission, helping to develop models that can rival global competitors. The government has also introduced a common computing facility, which will be available to AI startups, developers, and researchers. This facility, equipped with 18,000 GPUs, will provide access to advanced computing resources, helping smaller players contribute to AI development without the heavy costs usually associated with such infrastructure. Already, 10,000 GPUs are operational, with more to come online soon. Vaishnaw noted the importance of this facility in democratising AI development. India’s AI model is currently under development, with six major developers working on it. The government expects the first versions to be ready within 4 to 10 months. The model is being designed to handle India’s vast linguistic and cultural diversity. Vaishnaw expressed confidence in the project, stating that advancements in algorithmic efficiency would enable India to produce a world-class AI model in a shorter timeframe.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 30, 2025

This decision is part of an effort to ensure that all UPI transactions comply with technical specifications and to improve the overall safety of the digital payments platform. According to a circular issued by NPCI on January 9, the new rule will require all UPI transaction IDs to be strictly alphanumeric. This means that any transaction ID containing special characters such as @, !, or # will be automatically rejected by the system. The NPCI stated that while most participants in the UPI ecosystem have already complied with the technical standards, a few continue to use non-compliant formats. To address this, the corporation has decided to enforce the rule strictly from February 1, 2025. For the millions of Indians who rely on UPI for daily transactions, this change could have some implications. If a user attempts to make a payment through an app that generates transaction IDs with special characters, the transaction will fail. For example, if your phone number is 1234567890, and you have a UPI ID linked with SBI Bank. In that case, a valid ID might look like 1234567890oksbi, while an invalid one could be 1234567890@ok-sbi. The latter, which includes special characters (@ and -), will no longer be accepted after the new rule comes into effect. To avoid transaction failure, users are advised to take a few simple steps. First, they should ensure that their UPI apps are updated to the latest version. App updates often include compliance features and security improvements, so keeping the app up-to-date is crucial. Additionally, users can check their app’s settings or announcements for any notifications regarding compliance with NPCI’s new rules. If users are unsure whether their app is compliant, they can contact the app’s customer support for clarification. It’s also recommended to stick to UPI applications downloaded from trusted sources such as Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store, as third-party apps may not always adhere to NPCI guidelines. The decision to ban special characters in UPI IDs is part of a broader effort to standardise and secure the UPI ecosystem. According to data released by NPCI, UPI has become one of the most popular digital payment systems in India, with transaction volumes hitting a record high of 16.73 billion in December 2024, an 8 per cent increase from the previous month.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

Read the full review to know more.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/hp-omnibook-ultra-flip-review-a-compact-yet-powerful-laptop-2672447-2025-01-30,"For a lot of people, HP has been a go-to name in the world of computers for as long as I can remember. They have always been good at keeping up with the times, and their latest offering — the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip — is no exception. It's sleek, it's powerful, and it's built for people who are always on the move. But let’s be real — aren't there enough premium ultrabooks on the market that promise the moon? So, does the OmniBook Ultra Flip actually stand out, or is it just another pretty face in the crowd? In this review, I am going to break it down for you. We will talk about the design, because who doesn’t love a good-looking laptop, how long the battery lasts (no sugarcoating here), and whether it is as fun and easy to use as it looks. Spoiler: there is a lot to like, but let’s dive in and see if it’s worth your hard-earned cash.Compact yet practical design, solid build The HP OmniBook Ultra Flip is a stylish laptop designed for people who need a mix of portability and flexibility. Its touchscreen and 360-degree hinge make it easy for users to transform it between a regular laptop, a tablet, and tent mode for presentations or media viewing. The touchscreen is also smooth and responsive. The design is quite practical. The physical keyboard automatically turns off in tablet mode, so you don’t accidentally press keys while holding it. The digital keyboard pops up when needed, making it convenient for tasks like web browsing or social media scrolling. However, the laptop feels a bit heavy in tablet mode, which sometimes makes extended use cumbersome. Another small issue is the auto screen rotate feature, which is always on by default. While useful at times, it gets a bit annoying when the screen shifts unexpectedly. There is no way to turn it off.

Nevertheless, the machine’s 14-inch screen strikes the perfect balance — neither too large nor too small — making it ideal for both work and travel. The metal finish gives it a premium look, and the sturdy hinge allows the lid to be opened with one hand while the laptop stays stable. HP has also taken care of small details, for example the HP logo is minimal and the tiny rubber pads on the keyboard deck help protect the laptop from scratches when used in tablet mode.One downside of the sleek design is the limited selection of ports. HP has positioned two Type-C ports at the top corners of the keyboard, which is a clever design choice. However, with only three Type-C ports and no USB-A ports, connecting older accessories, like a hard drive, becomes inconvenient means you will need an adapter.  While removing the Ethernet port makes sense to keep the laptop slim, I feel one more USB port would have been nice. On the bright side, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is great for those who prefer wired headphones for better sound quality. Overall, the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip is a well-built laptop.Keyboard experience
 


Typing on the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip is a genuinely pleasant experience. The keyboard features well-spaced keys with a comfortable feel, making it easy to get in the flow during long typing sessions. The key travel is just right — enough to give you that satisfying feedback without feeling mushy — and the soft click noise is subtle but satisfying. As someone who is picky about keyboards, I appreciate that I didn’t have to relearn my hand placement. Everything is where it should be, though, like most laptops, the arrow keys are a bit compact. One trade-off here is the lack of a numpad, so keep that in mind if you rely on one.The trackpad is another win. It’s well-sized and perfectly centred, so I never accidentally brushed it while typing and sent my cursor flying. It is responsive, detects gestures smoothly, and offers decent haptic feedback. My only small gripe is that the click could use a bit more depth, but it’s far from a dealbreaker. Add in the backlit keyboard for low-light environments, and you get a setup that is both practical and enjoyable to use. All in all, HP nailed the basics here.advertisementDisplay: Is it good?
 


The HP OmniBook Ultra Flip features a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display, which provides rich colours with good contrast, making it enjoyable for watching videos, browsing, and content creation. The display has a slightly warm tone, which many users will find easy on the eyes, especially during prolonged use. In addition to this, brightness levels are sufficient for indoor use, with a maximum brightness of 387 nits, but it struggles in outdoor settings where reflections hinder visibility.The minimal bezels around the display make the screen feel quite big, improving the overall viewing experience. Despite its compact form factor, the display allows for a good amount of content to be visible, which is especially useful for media consumption. Interestingly, the display defaults to a 120Hz refresh rate, rather than the typical 60Hz, and even supports 48Hz as an option.

The HP OmniBook Ultra Flip is a workhorse when it comes to handling everyday tasks, and it’s all thanks to its solid hardware. With an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V (Lunar Lake) processor, 32GB of speedy LPDDR5X RAM, and a spacious 1TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD, this laptop doesn’t break a sweat during routine use.

 Nevertheless, the machine’s 14-inch screen strikes the perfect balance — neither too large nor too small — making it ideal for both work and travel. The metal finish gives it a premium look, and the sturdy hinge allows the lid to be opened with one hand while the laptop stays stable. HP has also taken care of small details, for example the HP logo is minimal and the tiny rubber pads on the keyboard deck help protect the laptop from scratches when used in tablet mode.

4059ccfe-1ef8-4279-a0da-70cdd525c027,"Pixel 9a launch date and price details leaked onlineGoogle Pixel 9a launch date: Google Pixel 9a launchThe exact release date of the Google Pixel 9a has leaked online, and going by the rumours, the phone will be coming earlier than expected. Apart from this, the US pricing details of the phone have also been leaked online.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/pixel-9a-launch-date-and-price-details-leaked-online-2672438-2025-01-30,"The Google Pixel 9a has been in the headlines recently, and now, new details about its launch date, pricing, and specifications have surfaced online. According to recent leaks, the device is set to hit the market earlier than expected, with pre-orders starting on March 19 and shipping beginning on March 26. If the rumours are true, then the Pixel 9a will arrive two months earlier than past Pixel A series devices. For context, both the Pixel 7a and 8a launched in May in their respective years. According to a report by Android Headlines, in terms of pricing, the Pixel 9a will start in the US at $499 (roughly Rs 43,200) for the 128GB storage option, while the 256GB storage will cost $599 (roughly Rs 51,900). For those opting for Verizon’s mmWave model, an additional $50 will be added to the aforementioned prices. These prices are in line with the Pixel 8a’s starting price in the USA, though the higher storage option is slightly more expensive this time around.  Of course, the Pixel 9a price should be different once it launches in India. For perspective, the Google Pixel 8a launched in India for Rs 52,999 and Rs 59,999 for the 128GB and 256GB storage variants respectively. Apart from the prices, an earlier report gave us a good idea of what to expect from the Pixel 9a. One of the most talked-about features of the phone is its design. The phone will reportedly ditch the camera bar seen in previous models, opting instead for a flush back design. This change is likely due to the inclusion of a larger 5,100mAh battery, the biggest ever in a Pixel device. Despite the increased battery size, the phone should remain compact, with a 6.28-inch display featuring a peak brightness of 2,700 nits and an HDR brightness of 1,800 nits. The display is also expected to support a 120Hz refresh rate and a 240Hz touch sampling rate. Under the hood, the Pixel 9a is rumoured to be powered by Google’s Tensor G4 chipset, paired with 8GB LPDDR5X RAM. Storage options include 128GB and 256GB, both using UFS 3.1 technology. The phone will also run Android 15 out of the box and will likely come with a promise of seven years of software and security updates, making it a future-proof choice for users. As for the camera, the Pixel 9a is expected to feature a dual-camera setup, with a 48-megapixel primary sensor and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens. The front-facing camera will also use the same 13-megapixel sensor. Expect to see Google’s signature camera features, such as Night Sight, Astrophotography, and Super Res Zoom. Despite its impressive specs, the Pixel 9a might have a few limitations, similar to the Pixel 8a. Rumours suggest, for instance, that charging speeds will only support 23W in wired and 7.5W in wireless. The Pixel 9a is expected to launch in four colours: Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

2cdf69d3-9dc4-4057-94c8-ce01f481c138,"US lawmakers push for restrictions on Nvidia chips amid China's DeepSeek AI developmentsTwo US lawmakers are urging tighter export controls on Nvidia's AI chips, fearing China's growing AI capabilities. Their concerns stem from reports that a Chinese firm used these chips — currently outside the scope of U.S. export controls — extensively.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/us-lawmakers-push-for-restrictions-on-nvidia-chips-amid-chinas-deepseek-ai-developments-2672699-2025-01-31,"Two US lawmakers have called on the government to tighten restrictions on Nvidia’s AI chips, expressing concerns over China’s growing artificial intelligence capabilities. Their request follows reports that Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has relied on Nvidia’s hardware to build its latest AI models. According to a Reuters report, Republican John Moolenaar and Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, who lead the House Select Committee on China, sent a letter to National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, urging the Biden administration to consider additional export controls. The lawmakers pointed out that Nvidia’s H20 chip, which is currently not covered by US export restrictions, was allegedly used extensively by DeepSeek. “We ask that as part of this review, you consider the potential national security benefits of placing an export control on Nvidia’s H20 and chips of similar sophistication,” they wrote. The concern in Washington is that China could use AI technology for cyberattacks or military advancements. The US has already imposed strict limits on AI chip exports to China, fearing that advanced computing power could give the country an edge in AI development. The questions were raised after DeepSeek unveiled its AI model, which the company claims was developed using relatively low-cost chips while maintaining strong performance. The model’s efficiency surprised many in the tech industry, raising concerns that China might be finding ways to bypass US-imposed restrictions. Despite existing controls, Nvidia designed certain chips, like the H20, to comply with current regulations while still being exportable to China. The lawmakers argue that these rules may need to be revisited.  Another issue raised in the letter is the concern that AI systems built in China could be subject to state censorship. Users have noted that by redirecting conversations elsewhere, DeepSeek’s model avoids discussing sensitive topics, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre. The lawmakers also flagged concerns over chip shipments to Singapore, suggesting that AI hardware may be getting re-routed to China through third-party countries. They urged the administration to monitor and potentially limit such exports unless stricter enforcement measures are adopted. Nvidia has stated that its products comply with all US government regulations. The company also reaffirmed its willingness to work with the government if further changes are made to AI chip export rules. On Wednesday (January 30), Reuters reported that the Trump administration, which took office on January 20, is considering new restrictions on H20 chips.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

94eba7af-6193-47d8-ae26-6185e7c47a5c,"Google unveils Ask for Me, a new AI feature that can make calls on your behalfGoogle is currently working on a new AI feature, called Ask for me. It is trained to call local businesses to enquire and collect information, like availability and pricing.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-unveils-ask-for-me-ai-feature-that-can-make-calls-to-local-businesses-on-your-behalf-2672700-2025-01-31,"Google is testing an Ask for Me feature to boost its AI base. This AI-powered feature will help users call businesses on their behalf to enquire about availability and pricing. The feature is designed to help users gather information without the need to directly make phone calls or speak to anyone. This feature is a step-ahead of OpenAI’s Operator.   Google’s Ask for Me feature is available on both desktop and mobile, but only for users who have opted into its Search Lab experiments.  In a post on X, Google product lead Rose Yao explained that the feature is powered by Duplex, an AI tool that enables tasks like making reservations or booking appointments over the phone. Currently, Google is only experimenting with auto shops and nail salons. Yao also said, “You might hit a waitlist, since the capacity is limited during the experiment.” 
 


Google’s Ask for Me: How does it work?  If you're enrolled in Search Labs, you can access the new feature by searching for local services like ""oil change"" or ""nail salons nearby."" An ""Ask for me"" option will appear, along with a ""Get started"" button. Once clicked, you'll be asked to provide details about the service, such as “tire replacement,” “factory scheduled maintenance,” “french manicure,” “nail art,” and more. You can also specify a preferred time frame. Google's AI will then make calls to local businesses on your behalf and send you a summary of prices and availability. This launch is part of Google’s broader effort to help users save time when reaching out to businesses using AI. Last year, the company introduced the “Talk to a Live Rep” feature, which calls a business, waits on hold, and notifies you when a live representative is available, eliminating the frustrating wait for customer service. Is it a competition for OpenAI’s Operator?  OpenAI has recently rolled out its new AI tool, Operator. It aims to perform tasks on your behalf on the web. The company explains, “using its own browser, it can look at a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling.” Interestingly, this is OpenAI’s first AI agent that can independently perform tasks.  Now, both OpenAI’s Operator and Google’s Ask for Me work as a middleman and aim to minimise tasks for the users. However, the main difference is that one chats with you and works on the web, while the other calls directly.  Why is OpenAI ahead? Because the Operator is already out to use, whereas the Ask for Me is yet to come out of its experimenting phase.

The expansion includes localised English and other languages, marking a big step in Apple's global AI rollout.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-intelligence-is-soon-coming-to-india-ceo-tim-cook-confirms-2672725-2025-01-31,"Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that the company’s AI-powered suite, Apple Intelligence, will finally make its way to India starting in April, later this year. This is a big move in regard to Apple’s AI capabilities on its devices in the country, which were previously limited to a handful of features like the Clean Up tool. During Apple’s latest earnings call, Cook revealed that the rollout will include support for multiple languages, including localised English tailored for Indian users. This means iPhone, iPad, and Mac users in India will soon have access to AI-driven tools such as Writing Tools, Smart Reply, and ChatGPT integration. Cook also highlighted Apple’s growing focus on India, which has become a key market for the Cupertino-based tech giant. He shared that the company achieved record iPhone sales in the country during the December quarter, with the iPhone emerging as the top-selling model for the period. India’s position as the world’s second-largest smartphone market and third-largest for PCs and tablets makes it a critical region for Apple’s growth. To further strengthen its presence, Apple has announced plans to open four new stores in the country, adding to its existing retail footprint. The introduction of Apple Intelligence in India is part of a broader global expansion. Cook mentioned that the AI suite will also be made available in other languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Simplified Chinese. Localised English versions will also be rolled out in Singapore alongside India.  Apple’s new CFO, Kevan Parekh, also emphasised the company’s strong performance in emerging markets, citing India as a prime example. He pointed to Zomato, a leading food delivery platform in India, which has deployed thousands of Macs across its workforce to drive innovation.  For the unaware, Apple Intelligence is only eligible for the iPhone 16 series and iPhone 15 Pro models. As mentioned above, the company's AI features aren't available for Indian users right now. However, to still access the AI features on your eligible iPhones, you need to change your default regional setting to one of the languages that support Apple Intelligence. To change your settings, go to Settings > General > Language & Region and select English (US) or any language that supports Apple Intelligence as your device’s primary language. This setting configures your device to recognise the language required for Apple Intelligence.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

Authorities question its data storage practices, while security fears grow over its potential links to Chinese servers.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/deepseek-is-no-longer-available-to-download-in-italy-report-2672750-2025-01-31,"China-based AI startup DeepSeek is facing scrutiny in Europe after its chatbot app vanished from the App Store and Play Store in Italy. The removal comes just a day after Italy’s data protection authority (DPA) raised concerns over how the company collects and stores user data. The issue began when Euroconsumers, a consumer rights group, filed a complaint against DeepSeek, questioning its handling of personal data. In response, the Italian watchdog asked DeepSeek to provide details about its data storage practices and gave the company 20 days to respond. However, officials say DeepSeek’s initial reply was completely insufficient, prompting them to take immediate action by restricting the company from processing data from Italian users. The core concern is that DeepSeek’s privacy policy states that user data may be stored on servers located in China. While the company claims that it follows all applicable data protection laws, authorities worry about potential risks related to cybersecurity, privacy, and disinformation. The Italian watchdog isn’t alone in its concerns — other privacy regulators across the European Union have reminded companies that they must comply with the region’s strict AI and data protection laws. DeepSeek’s chatbot has been rising quickly in popularity, topping download charts in several countries, including the US. However, the privacy concerns surrounding the app have raised questions about how AI companies handle user data and whether their models are developed ethically. One of the concerns is that DeepSeek’s AI models may have learnt from leading US models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This practice, known as distillation, involves a newer AI model learning from an older, more established one. While OpenAI has stated that Chinese companies often try to extract insights from US-developed AI, blocking this process is difficult because it is hard to detect among millions of data requests. Security concerns around DeepSeek have also caught the attention of the US government. The US Navy has already advised its personnel against using the chatbot for work or personal use, citing ethical and security risks. Additionally, US officials have said they are assessing whether the app poses any national security threats. Despite the app’s removal from Italian stores, users who still want to access DeepSeek’s AI model can do so in other ways. Since DeepSeek has made its AI open-source, people can download and run it locally on their computers. Others can access the chatbot through platforms like Perplexity, which hosts the model on servers located outside China. Perplexity’s CEO, Aravind Srinivas, has claimed that their version of DeepSeek’s AI does not have censorship restrictions.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

While the company has kept most details under wraps, leaks and rumours have started to give us a clear idea of what to expect from this slim phone. One of the most talked-about features — which was also noticeable when the first teaser dropped after the Galaxy Unpacked event — is the dual-rear camera setup, instead of the speculated three-lens rear camera setup on the Galaxy S25 and S25+.  According to an X (formerly Twitter) user, the Galaxy S25 Edge could come with a massive 200-megapixel primary camera, paired with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens. This puts it in line with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which also features a 200-megapixel main sensor, though the Ultra steps up with a new 50-megapixel ultra-wide shooter. In comparison, the standard Galaxy S25 and S25+ feature a 50-megapixel primary camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor.

 Another highlight of the leak is the display protection. The Galaxy S25 Edge is rumoured to sport Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front, the same as the vanilla Galaxy S25. So, no Gorilla Glass Armor 2 like the Galaxy S25 Ultra model, which also means no anti-reflective properties for the Galaxy S25 Edge's display.  In terms of specs, the Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to feature a 6.7-inch flat AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. Under the hood, the phone is likely to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, ensuring top-tier performance. Samsung is reportedly aiming for a slim design, with the phone said to be just 6.4mm thick. However, this slim profile might come at the cost of battery capacity, as the S25 Edge is rumoured to pack a 3,900mAh battery. Charging speeds are expected to cap at 25W, which might feel a bit underwhelming compared to some competitors. Speaking of competition, Samsung isn’t the only one working on thin phones. Apple is rumoured to be developing an iPhone 17 Air, which could be about 6mm thick and feature a 48-megapixel primary rear camera.  The Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to launch in April 2025, with availability in 39 countries, including India. Once again, these are just rumours until Samsung confirms the details officially.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

This shift has seen major players like Microsoft, Amazon, Perplexity, and Dell integrate the DeepSeek AI into their services as they have now recognised its cost-effectiveness and high-performance output, despite earlier concerns around data privacy and censorship.advertisementDeepSeek AI: From criticism to adoptionWhen DeepSeek R1 first entered the market, it was met with strong criticism from US tech firms and government entities. While some tech companies (like Meta and OpenAI) were shocked to see DeepSeek's potential for offering top-notch performance comparable to OpenAI's ChatGPT without using much of resources and operating at lower costs, concerns were also there about data security and potential misuse by the Chinese government. Some experts drew parallels with the controversy surrounding TikTok, suggesting that DeepSeek might expose user data to the Chinese government. Furthermore, early tests of the AI model showed that it avoided politically sensitive topics, raising suspicions about censorship and control from the Chinese Communist Party. When DeepSeek R1 first entered the market, it was met with strong criticism from US tech firms and government entities. While some tech companies (like Meta and OpenAI) were shocked to see DeepSeek's potential for offering top-notch performance comparable to OpenAI's ChatGPT without using much of resources and operating at lower costs, concerns were also there about data security and potential misuse by the Chinese government.  Some experts drew parallels with the controversy surrounding TikTok, suggesting that DeepSeek might expose user data to the Chinese government. Furthermore, early tests of the AI model showed that it avoided politically sensitive topics, raising suspicions about censorship and control from the Chinese Communist Party. For example, DeepSeek’s chatbot reportedly refused to discuss events like the Tiananmen Square Massacre or the treatment of Uyghur Muslims and even took a pro-China stance on Taiwan’s independence. These issues fueled concerns in the US about adopting Chinese technology that could be influenced by government oversight. The US Navy also banned the use of DeepSeek because of data privacy concerns. Some American tech companies are now rushing to use DeepSeek R1 AI Despite these concerns, the practical advantages of DeepSeek R1 have made it hard to ignore. The model delivers a similar performance to more expensive AI models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, but at a fraction of the cost. This has prompted tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Dell to reconsider their stance. Microsoft was one of the first companies to integrate DeepSeek R1, making it available through its Azure AI Foundry and GitHub. The decision came after Microsoft conducted thorough evaluations of the model, ensuring that it met safety and security standards. The company now offers the model as part of its broader AI solutions for enterprise customers. Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, also integrated the Chinese AI DeepSeek R1 model into its Pro subscription service, alongside other top models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude-3.5. Initially, US firms, including Perplexity, raised concerns about DeepSeek's data security and censorship. However, after evaluating its cost-effective performance, Perplexity adopted a customised version of DeepSeek R1 that reduces censorship issues.  Amazon followed suit, announcing that DeepSeek R1 is now supported on Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker AI. Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, confirmed that the model’s affordability and efficiency were key reasons for its inclusion. Jassy noted that integrating DeepSeek allows businesses to build AI-driven solutions with minimal infrastructure, which has become increasingly important in the competitive AI landscape. Dell also joined the ranks, enabling DeepSeek to be used on its platforms in partnership with Hugging Face, further showing how the AI model is becoming a part of the American tech ecosystem.Why DeepSeek is being hailed as a king in the AI world One of the primary reasons for DeepSeek’s growing popularity is its ability to offer high performance while requiring fewer resources than its American counterparts. Reports suggest that DeepSeek was developed with just 2,000 GPUs and a budget of $6 million — much less than the billions often needed to develop US-based AI models. This makes it a cost-effective alternative for companies that want to implement AI without incurring substantial costs. As competition in the AI sector is increasing, US tech companies have found that partnering with or adopting DeepSeek’s AI models helps them stay competitive while keeping costs under control. Its efficiency also enables companies to offer advanced AI solutions to their customers without requiring heavy investments in infrastructure.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 31, 2025

This program is exclusive to the employees working in the Platform & Devices department. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/after-pixel-android-merger-google-offers-voluntary-exits-to-employees-2672792-2025-01-31,"After Google merged Pixel hardware and Android software teams in April 2024, the company announced a voluntary exit program. According to a 9to5Google report, Google has sent a memo to employees working in the Platforms & Devices department. The memo stated that in the voluntary exit program, whoever wants to step down from their role, can do so with a guaranteed severance. The memo was sent via SVP Rick Osterloh, as per the report.  The memo stated, ""This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year."" He added, ""There’s tremendous momentum in this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” Voluntary buyouts are sometimes a sign that layoffs could follow if too few employees accept Google's offer to leave. The voluntary exit program also follows a petition signed by over 1,250 Google workers from the US and Canada regions. According to a CNBC report, Google employees have signed an internal petition for job security. The petition highlights employees' growing concerns over job security following multiple rounds of layoffs since 2023. Many are left questioning the justification for these dismissals, particularly given the company's solid financial position. Google has been making headlines for its layoffs world-wide, but this program is not a company-wide offer. This program is available to US employees within the Platforms & Devices division, covering teams working on Android (Auto, TV, Wear OS, XR), Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest. While Google has a global workforce dedicated to these products, this announcement applies only to employees in the United States.  In December 2024, the company was in the headlines for announcing a 10 per cent job cut as part of its efficiency drive. It was reported that these lay-offs are done to streamline operations and improve efficiency. The voluntary exit program could also be part of the drive. After the merger in April, Alphabet’s Chief Financial Officer, Anat Ashkenazi, emphasised her focus on cost efficiencies across the company. During her first earnings call as CFO, she acknowledged the groundwork laid by Ruth Porat, Sundar Pichai, and the leadership team in restructuring the company’s cost base. However, she noted that there’s always room for further optimisation, stating, “Any organization can always push a little further, and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities.” These cost-cutting efforts are, in part, aimed at balancing the company’s heavy investment in AI. These changes highlight Google's efforts to streamline operations amid increasing competition, particularly from AI-driven companies like OpenAI, which are challenging its dominance in the search market.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Also read |  Google unveils Ask for Me, a new AI feature that can make calls to local businesses on your behalfAlso read |  US lawmakers push for restrictions on Nvidia chips amid China's DeepSeek AI developmentsAlso read |  Amazon fires more employees, says layoffs will help company move fasterMust Watch

According to Business Insider, employees affected by these cuts will see their healthcare benefits end immediately. In some cases, there has been no mention of severance pay, raising concerns about the company’s approach. The report mentions that at least three employees have claimed they were informed by the company that they would not receive any compensation. The termination letters state that the employees' access to Microsoft's systems and offices would be revoked immediately, and they would not be allowed to perform any further work. The letters also indicate that if these employees reapply to Microsoft in the future, their previous performance and the reason for termination will be considered. ""The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position. You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft,"" the letter stated. Sources close to the situation have revealed that this move is part of Microsoft’s more stringent performance management policy, where even senior employees at high levels are being reviewed. Despite the job cuts, Microsoft has said that many of the roles will likely be filled again, meaning there may not be a big reduction in overall headcount. As of June, Microsoft had about 228,000 full-time employees. A spokesperson for Microsoft said, ""At Microsoft, we focus on high-performing talent. We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action."" Additionally, Microsoft has been implementing layoffs across various departments, including Security, Devices, Sales, and Gaming. These layoffs, however, are separate from the performance-related job cuts.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 31, 2025

This initiative aims to promote homegrown AI solutions to meet India's unique challenges while adhering to global standards. The government wants to create generative AI models comparable to global systems like ChatGPT. Proposals are being accepted until six months from the call's announcement or until enough submissions have been selected. Evaluations will occur monthly, with reviews carried out by experts from IndiaAI for proposals submitted by the 15th of each month. The government has outlined a specific format for submissions, requiring an executive summary, project plan, team details, use case development, ethical compliance, and a financial assessment. Shortlisted candidates will be invited to present, and successful projects will receive funding. Union Minister for Electronics and IT, Ashwini Vaishnaw, revealed that India has surpassed its goal of 10,000 GPUs by setting up 18,000 GPUs as part of the Common Compute Facility. He revealed that this infrastructure would act as a foundation for developing advanced AI solutions. Speaking at the Odisha Utkarsh summit, Vaishnaw announced that India would soon have its own LLM, supported by the new computing facility. The minister explained that AI holds the potential to address major challenges in sectors like agriculture, learning disabilities, and climate change. As part of the mission, the government will engage with startups, IT companies, academic institutions, and researchers to create foundational AI models.

This move comes in the wake of Microsoft making its O1 model free for all Copilot users and the emergence of DeepSeek, which has disrupted the AI world. With o3-mini, OpenAI is allowing free-tier users access to its reasoning models for the first time, though with rate limits similar to those of GPT-4o. This is a big change in OpenAI’s strategy as it has made the advanced AI tools more accessible to a wider audience. The model, first announced during OpenAI’s ""12 Days of Ship-mas"" event in December, offers performance comparable to its predecessor - o1-mini - in areas like mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, it brings a 24 per cent increase in response speed and improved step-by-step reasoning capabilities, basically offering an overall accuracy and usability of its outputs. ""This powerful and fast model advances the boundaries of what small models can achieve, delivering exceptional STEM capabilities—with particular strength in science, math, and coding—all while maintaining the low cost and reduced latency of OpenAI o1-mini,"" the company said in its blogpost. Paid users on ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro plans will receive additional benefits, with Plus and Team users now able to send up to 150 messages per day — three times the previous limit — while Pro users, who pay $200 per month, will continue to enjoy unlimited access. Developers can integrate o3-mini through OpenAI’s API services, including the Chat Completions API, Assistants API, and Batch API. OpenAI has also introduced o3-mini-high, an advanced version optimised for coding and complex reasoning tasks, which offers greater intelligence at the cost of slightly longer processing times. A key upgrade in o3-mini is its ability to fetch real-time data from the web, providing answers with source links for increased reliability.  o3-mini is also being integrated into Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service, GitHub Copilot, and GitHub models, further extending its reach in enterprise applications. Users can access o3-mini for free within ChatGPT by selecting the ‘Reason’ feature in the chat bar, though usage limits apply. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 1, 2025

This move is expected to lower the cost of imported smartphones and accessories, including certain high-end iPhone models that are not yet manufactured in India.

While the reduction in customs duty is expected to bring down costs for manufacturers, experts remain cautious about its direct impact on retail prices. Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint Research, noted that a big price drop is unlikely. He suggested that the reduction might lead to a marginal decrease of 1-2 per cent in smartphone prices, but the extent of the benefit passed on to consumers will depend on individual manufacturers. Additionally, lower-priced smartphones, which already operate on thin profit margins, may not see any notable reduction in price. The government’s focus on electronics manufacturing extends beyond duty reductions. The budget also highlights initiatives to improve the skill set of the workforce in this sector. Experts believe that investment in upskilling programs will play a crucial role in building a high-skilled labour force, which is essential for improving local production capabilities. In the past, the government has taken similar steps to support the electronics industry. In February 2023, it eliminated the customs duty on camera lenses used in smartphones, which contributed to lowering costs for smartphone manufacturers. Despite the reduction in BCD, consumers may need to wait to see if brands decide to pass on the benefits. While imported devices and components could become cheaper, manufacturers might retain the savings to offset rising production costs. However, the move is expected to incentivise local manufacturing further and contribute to the long-term growth of India’s electronics industry.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 1, 2025

This advanced computing power is crucial for training AI models. The majority of these GPUs are high-performance NVIDIA H100 and H200 models, along with MI325 units. To put it in perspective, DeepSeek AI was trained using 2,500 GPUs, while ChatGPT leveraged 25,000. With over 15,000 top-tier GPUs, India is now firmly positioned in the global AI race. Vaishnaw emphasised that this infrastructure will be pivotal to the country’s AI mission, enabling the development of models that can compete with the best in the world. India’s AI model is currently in the works, with six major developers leading the effort. The government anticipates that the first versions will be ready within 4 to 10 months. The model is being tailored to accommodate the country’s rich linguistic and cultural diversity. Vaishnaw expressed optimism about the project, highlighting that improvements in algorithmic efficiency will allow India to develop a world-class AI model in a reduced timeframe.Deep tech fund of funds In the budget speech today, the FM also announced that the government will also explore the Deep Tech Funds of Funds. This is to catalyse the next-gen startups.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 1, 2025

The alleged zero-click attack exploited vulnerabilities, raising concerns over spyware misuse and accountability.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/whatsapp-says-there-is-new-israeli-spyware-that-can-target-phones-break-into-private-data-2673397-2025-02-01,"WhatsApp has accused Israeli spyware company Paragon Solutions of targeting nearly 100 journalists and civil society members in a recent hacking campaign, as per a report by The Guardian. WhatsApp says the attacks were carried out using sophisticated spyware known as Graphite, which is capable of infiltrating devices without requiring any interaction from the victim — a technique known as a zero-click attack. WhatsApp claims it had high confidence that around 90 users, including journalists and activists, were targeted and potentially compromised. While the messaging platform did not disclose the locations of the affected individuals, it confirmed that it had notified them of the possible breach. WhatsApp also stated that it had sent a cease and desist letter to Paragon and was exploring legal options to hold the company accountable. Paragon Solutions, which has an office in Virginia, USA, is known for its Graphite spyware, a tool comparable to the infamous Pegasus software developed by NSO Group. Once installed on a device, Graphite grants the operator complete access, including the ability to read messages sent through encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Signal. The identity of the attackers remains unclear. Like other spyware firms, Paragon sells its software to government clients, but WhatsApp said it could not determine who ordered the alleged attacks. A person close to Paragon claimed the company has 35 government customers, all of which are democratic nations. The cited source also stated that Paragon avoids doing business with countries previously accused of spyware abuse, such as Greece, Poland, Hungary, Mexico, and India. This incident comes amid growing scrutiny of the commercial spyware industry. Natalia Krapiva, a senior tech legal counsel at Access Now, noted that while Paragon has been seen as a better spyware company with fewer abuse allegations, WhatsApp’s revelations suggest otherwise. ""This is not just a question of some bad apples — these types of abuses are a feature of the commercial spyware industry,” she said. WhatsApp’s announcement follows a recent legal victory against NSO Group, another Israeli spyware maker. In December, a California judge ruled that NSO was liable for hacking 1,400 WhatsApp users in 2019, violating US hacking laws and the platform’s terms of service. NSO was added to a US commerce department blacklist in 2021 for activities deemed contrary to US national security interests. WhatsApp has not revealed how long the targets may have been under threat but confirmed that the alleged attacks were disrupted in December. The company is now working to support affected users and strengthen its defences against future breaches.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 1, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  OnePlus 13 effectively available for Rs 64,999: Who should buy it?Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/after-operator-openai-launches-its-next-ai-agent-called-deep-research-2673768-2025-02-03,"After launching Operator last week, OpenAI unveils its next AI agent —Deep Research. The agent is designed to perform detailed research using its chatbot, ChatGPT. Powered by OpenAI o3 optimised for web browsing and python analysis, deep research uses reasoning to intelligently and extensively browse text, images, and PDFs across the internet, explains OpenAI.  In the blog post, it states, “Deep research is built for people who do intensive knowledge work in areas like finance, science, policy & engineering and need thorough & reliable research.”
 


 “It's also useful for discerning shoppers looking for hyper-personalised recos on purchases that require careful research,” it adds.  OpenAI VP Engineer Srinivas Narayanan explains that this new model is a ""new way of using AI to help us on complex knowledge tasks."" He adds that the Deep Research is like asking for an expert's advice. It aims to minimise tasks and save up hours of research if done by a human.  OpenAI’s Deep Research: How to use In ChatGPT, simply select ""Deep Research"" from the message composer and enter your query. Whether you need a competitive analysis of streaming platforms or a personalised report on the best commuter bike, just let ChatGPT know what you're after. You can even attach files or spreadsheets for added context. Once you submit your request, a sidebar will appear to show the steps being taken and the sources used during the process.

OpenAI confirms that this AI agent can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the complexity of the enquiry. The user will receive a notification once the research is complete, and until then they are free to do other tasks. The final result will be delivered as a detailed report within the chat. According to the company, while Deep Research excels at providing comprehensive, well-documented answers with verified sources, GPT-4 is better suited for real-time, multimodal conversations. For complex, domain-specific enquiries that require depth and precision, deep research offers the advantage of extensive exploration and citation—perfect for producing reliable, actionable insights.
 


Explaining how this agent works, CEO Sam Altman posted an example on X (formerly Twitter). He posted that while this model is slow, it is the first AI model that can ""do such a wide variety of complex, valuable tasks."" 
 


Next, OpenAI is also planning to add embedded images, data visualisations, and other analytic features to enhance the clarity and context of the reports soon. How is it different from the Operator? The key differentiation is that while the Operator can be tasked with a wide range of repetitive browser activities, such as completing forms, ordering groceries, or even creating memes, it cannot perform in-depth research like the new AI agent. Deep research builds on the reasoning capabilities to bridge the gap, allowing it to take on the types of problems people face in work and everyday life.However, both the agents are a significant step toward the broader goal of developing AGI, which OpenAI has been pointing out for a long period. This also comes at a time when a Chinese AI model, DeepSeek gained a lot of attention for its advanced tech and cheap cost.

The laws around it are ever-changing. And people who are brave enough to get past the rules and regulations have to face heavy taxes. However, this is reportedly set to change soon. The government is rethinking its current approach to cryptocurrency trade and investment in India, according to a report by Reuters. Reportedly, this purported change is primarily because of the global shift in the approach toward cryptocurrency –– specifically in the US, where Donald Trump has been making some pro-crypto announcements. In fact, just ahead of his swearing in as the US president, Trump launched his own meme coin in the US, which eventually also led to Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $100,000. “More than one or two jurisdictions have changed their stance towards cryptocurrency in terms of usage, acceptance, and the importance of crypto assets. In that stride, we are reviewing the discussion paper once again,” Reuters reports Ajay Seth, India’s economic affairs secretary, as saying.  In the US, Trump has recently directed the establishment of a cryptocurrency working group. The proposed group is meant to suggest new digital asset regulations and aid in creating a national cryptocurrency reserve. Meanwhile, in India, regulatory bodies have been quite strict. In December 2023, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in India issued show-cause notices to 9 offshore crypto exchanges, including Binance and Kucoin, for non-compliance with local regulations. The FIU also requested the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to block these platforms’ URLs within India. In June 2024, Binance, which is the world's largest crypto exchange, faced a hefty fine of Rs 188.2 million in India. This was just a month after Binance registered with the FIU in an attempt to resume its operations in the country. The fine, according to FIU, was due to violations of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, under which virtual digital asset service providers (VDA SPs) are required to register as 'Reporting Entities' and comply with anti-money laundering protocols. In 2023, former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das also represented a critical stand against cryptocurrency in India. “Crypto should be banned, given its lack of underlying value. It’s a form of gambling, nothing more than 100 per cent speculation,” Das said at the Business Today Banking and Economy Summit. While there have been calls for a multi-regulatory framework for crypto in India, the report on the shift in the government’s stance regarding the digital currency, brings hope for traders in India. It will be interesting to see how the government now balances the external pressure from global developments and the internal squabble on regulation around cryptocurrency. Let’s hope the delay in the discussion paper on cryptocurrency, which was supposed to be released in September 2024, will only bring good news for crypto traders in the country.

The phone is anticipated to hit the market in April. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/vivo-x200-pro-mini-to-debut-in-india-launch-date-price-leaked-2673823-2025-02-03,"Vivo launched its flagship series, Vivo X200 and X200 Pro in India in December 2024. After a few months, a recent report informs that the company is planning to launch a toned-down version of the Vivo X200 Pro. The Vivo X200 Pro Mini is expected to sport similar, but a little low-key features at a much more affordable price. According to the report by SmartPrix, the device is anticipated to arrive in the country in the second quarter of 2025. The most probable guess, by the tipsters, is that the Vivo X200 Pro Mini will launch in April. But before the launch, we have a bunch of information that gives an idea of how the phone will sail through. advertisementVivo X200 Pro Mini: Specs and features (Expected)While the mini version is a new upcoming entry in India, the Chinese market received it along with the series. The Vivo X200 Pro Mini was launched in China in October 2024. The report suggests that there is a high chance that the Vivo X200 Pro Mini in India will mimic the Chinese variant. The Vivo X200 Pro Mini boasts a 6.31-inch quad-curved AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, ensuring a fluid and immersive visual experience. It is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 SoC, the same high-performance chipset found in the Vivo X200 and X200 Pro. While the mini version is a new upcoming entry in India, the Chinese market received it along with the series. The Vivo X200 Pro Mini was launched in China in October 2024.

The Vivo X200 Pro Mini boasts a 6.31-inch quad-curved AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, ensuring a fluid and immersive visual experience. It is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 SoC, the same high-performance chipset found in the Vivo X200 and X200 Pro. In India, the device is expected to be available in two memory configurations: 12GB RAM + 256GB storage and 16GB RAM + 512GB storage. Photography enthusiasts will appreciate its triple-camera setup, featuring a 50-megapixel primary sensor, 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and 50-megapixel 3x telephoto lens, while a 32-megapixel front camera handles selfies and video calls. That said, it is noteworthy that the Vivo X200 Pro has been applauded for its camera quality (read the review here), and it will be interesting to see if the toned-down version will carry forward the same.  The smartphone runs on the latest Funtouch OS 15 and comes equipped with an in-display fingerprint scanner, IP68 water and dust resistance, and Zeiss optics for superior imaging. A 5,700mAh battery supports 90W fast charging and 30W wireless charging, making it a powerhouse in the premium smartphone segment.Vivo X200 Pro Mini: India price (leaked) The rumour has it that the Vivo X200 Pro Mini will be priced a little above the X200, but lower than the X200 Pro. For perspective, the X200 was launched at a price of Rs 65,999 and the X200 Pro was launched at Rs 94,999. Looking at these figures, we can assume that the Vivo X200 Pro Mini might be priced around Rs 75,000. 
 


 While the Chinese variant of X200 Pro Mini was launched at a starting price of CNY 4,699 (approximately Rs 55,750), the Indian price will be higher. The price gap between China and India is the reason behind it. For instance, the price difference between the X200 in China and in India stood at Rs 14,300, and for the X200 Pro, the Indian variant was priced at Rs 31,199 higher than the Chinese one. Hence, we are sure that the price for Vivo X200 Pro Mini will be above Rs 66k but lower than Rs 94k.  Notably, these are mere assumptions and speculations. Hence, we advise you to take it with a pinch of salt and stay tune for the official notification.

However, the victim was later added to a Telegram group, where he ended up investing more money as he was persuaded by scammers.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/greater-noida-man-loses-rs-51-lakh-after-joining-a-telegram-group-2673869-2025-02-03,"In yet another case of online task fraud, a resident of Greater Noida ended up losing Rs 51.63 lakh in just five days. The victim first received a WhatsApp message about an easy job that promised money through simple tasks. Later, he was added to a Telegram group where scammers made him invest money for higher profits. In the end, hoping to earn more money in a short time, the victim ended up losing his own money to the scammers. According to the case reported by Hindustan Times, the case involves a 31-year-old man who lived in Sector 16B, Greater Noida West. The victim, who works at a private firm, began his ordeal on January 18 when he received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number. The sender introduced herself as Pallavi and claimed she could help him earn big profits by simply completing the online tasks she shared. Interested in the offer and hoping to earn some easy money, the victim agreed to participate. After his approval, the scammer added him to a Telegram group where he received more information related to cryptocurrency investments. Initially, the victim was asked to deposit small amounts ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 8,000 as part of the tasks. Gradually, the scammers managed to manipulate him into making larger transfers under the pretence of increasing his returns. The scammers even showed the victim a fake online portfolio displaying a profit of Rs 60 lakh, which gave him confidence in the process. However, when he attempted to withdraw the supposed profits, the fraudsters demanded additional payments, citing various charges and fees. This raised the victim’s suspicion, and after discussing the matter with a friend, he realized he had fallen victim to a scam. According to the report, in just five days, the victim made 32 transactions, transferring a total of Rs 51.63 lakh to the scammers. The victim filed a complaint with the cybercrime branch, and a case has been registered under Sections 318 (cheating) and 319 (cheating by personation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), along with relevant sections of the IT Act. Notably, this is not the first case of individual losing money to scammers after falling for fake easy-task and investment promises. In the past few years, many cases have been reported where victims shared how they lost money hoping to earn larger profits by doing online tasks. In these scams, scammers often ask targeted individuals to do tasks like liking YouTube videos, giving reviews, and so on. To gain trust, they even send small amounts of money to the the targeted individuals. However, as individuals start trusting the scammers, they then propose investment ideas like cryptocurrency wallets and ask victims to invest through fake apps they have created. Once the victim adds money and tries to withdraw it, the scammers either cut off access or even threaten the victim, demanding more money under the pretext of avoiding money laundering charges. To stay safe from such scams, it is advisable not to fall for such opportunities. If someone reaches out with offers that seem too good to be true, block and report them. Do not download any app they share, as it could be a malicious app designed to steal your sensitive data and empty your bank accounts.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 3, 2025Also Read |  Indian Railways launches new app, will offer all train services in one placeAlso Read |  iPhone inside your Mac?

Musk recently revealed that his team at DOGE is working an exhausting 120 hours a week, which is equivalent to nearly 17 hours a day, including weekends. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk took a jab at the typical government workweek, noting, ""DOGE is working 120 hours a week. Our bureaucratic opponents optimistically work 40 hours a week. That is why they are losing so fast."" He also criticised the lack of weekend work in the bureaucracy, suggesting it gives his department an edge as his team works around the clock. Musk is known for his aggressive work philosophy. When he took over Twitter in 2022, he imposed 80-hour workweeks, and now he's attempting to apply similar standards in his government role. While his approach has driven success in the tech world, it remains to be seen if the same strategy can yield results within the more rigid government structure. However, experts are divided on Musk's methods. Shannon Copeland, CEO of SIB, a cost-cutting firm, told Business Insider that Musk's focus on efficiency could help shake up the bureaucracy. ""While a 120-hour workweek isn't a practical or sustainable solution for most, the principle behind it resonates. Companies that prioritize efficiency, automation, and proactive cost management will always outperform those weighed down by bureaucracy,"" she said. However, not everyone agrees that Musk’s hard-driving approach is sustainable. Roi Ginat, CEO of Endless AI, cautioned that pushing teams too hard can lead to burnout.  ""Driving a team too hard for too long leads to fatigue and burnout. Many people simply won't function well without enough sleep, and as fatigue sets in, errors increase,"" he told BI. ""I believe that Elon's tweet is about an effort, not a new standard at DOGE."" ""My work is on my mind most of my time, and it's an important part of the deal, but great work ideas often come while I hike with my kids,"" Ginat, who works for about 85 hours a week, said.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 3, 2025

It is capable of doing pretty much any task on a users’ behalf that they would do on the web. It can book flight tickets for you, it can make dinner reservations for you, or even write code for an entire website. However, as of now, the AI agent can only be accessed by ChatGPT Pro users, and only in the US. But the availability is set to expand soon.  In a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), which was hosted by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and several other OpenAI engineers and researchers, Altman confirmed that Operator will soon be available to ChatGPT Plus users as well. Responding to the question: “How far are we from having Operator on the regular Plus plan?”, Altman answered, saying, “months”. Now, this obviously indicates that it will still be a few months before Operator is available to more ChatGPT users –– but considering that the AI agent is currently limited to a really tiny number of users which are the ChatGPT Pro subscriber who are in the US –– this still good news for people who are looking forward to try out OpenAI Operator.  There is still no timeline on when OpenAI Operator will rollout for ChatGPT Plus. The Reddit response also does not clarify if the available, when opened to Plus subscribers, will also be expanded beyond the US.  OpenAI Operator, as per OpenAI, is capable of “using its own browser, it can look at a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling.” Operator is the first AI agent by OpenAI. It essentially works as an intermediary between the user and the web.

Google Pixel 9a: Leaked specs An earlier report provided a detailed look at what to expect from the upcoming Pixel 9a. One of the most notable changes is its design—Google is reportedly moving away from the signature camera bar, opting for a sleeker, flush-back design. This shift is likely influenced by the inclusion of a massive 5,100mAh battery, the largest ever in a Pixel device. Despite the larger battery, the phone is expected to maintain a compact form factor, featuring a 6.28-inch display with a peak brightness of 2,700 nits, HDR brightness of 1,800 nits, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 240Hz touch sampling rate.  advertisement The upcoming Google Pixel 9a has been spotted on the EMVCo certification website, where it is listed under the model number GTF7P.

Under the hood, the Pixel 9a is rumoured to be powered by Google’s Tensor G4 chipset, paired with 8GB of LPDDR5X RAM. Storage options include 128GB and 256GB, both utilising UFS 3.1 technology for faster read and write speeds. The device will launch with Android 15 out of the box and is expected to receive seven years of software and security updates, ensuring long-term support for users.  On the camera front, the Pixel 9a is set to feature a dual-camera system, comprising a 48-megapixel primary sensor and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens. The front-facing camera will also use a 13MP sensor. Google's signature camera capabilities, such as Night Sight, Astrophotography, and Super Res Zoom, are likely to be included, making it a strong contender in mobile photography.   Despite its impressive specifications, the Pixel 9a may come with a few trade-offs. Reports suggest that charging speeds will be limited to 23W for wired charging and 7.5W for wireless charging, similar to its predecessor, the Pixel 8a. The smartphone is also expected to launch in four colour options: Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony.Google Pixel 9a: Expected price  The rumours indicate that the Google Pixel 9a price will start at $499 (approximately Rs 43,200) in the US for the 128GB storage variant, while the 256GB model will be priced at $599 (around Rs 51,900). While the starting price remains consistent with the Pixel 8a, the higher storage variant sees a slight increase in cost.   Pricing for the Pixel 9a in India is expected to differ. For reference, the Pixel 8a launched in India at Rs 52,999 for the 128GB model and Rs 59,999 for the 256GB variant. A similar pricing structure can be anticipated for the Pixel 9a upon its release in the country.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 3, 2025Also read |  Vivo X200 Pro Mini to debut in India: Launch date, price leakedAlso read |  Vivo V50 India price details leak, likely to cost more than Vivo V40Also read |  Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, Fold 7 storage and display specs leaked

Without any protest, Google makes the change on Google Maps. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/donald-trump-wants-gulf-of-mexico-to-be-renamed-to-gulf-of-america-google-quickly-agrees-to-make-the-change-2673945-2025-02-03,"As part of the myriad of executive orders that the new US President Donald Trump signed as he took charge of the office, was an order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, to the Gulf of America. He said last week that the name Gulf of America had a “beautiful ring”.“It’s appropriate. And Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country,” he said. A few days after that, the interior department of the Trump administration announced that the name change has officially been implemented. “As directed by the president, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially be known as the Gulf of America and North America’s highest peak will once again bear the name Mount McKinley,” said the interior department. Just a day later, Google announced –– with zero protest –– that the company will be renaming the gulf in Google Maps in the US.  Basically, Google says that once the change in name reflects in the official records in the US –– Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) –– the company will also rename the Gulf of Mexico, to the Gulf of America, for users in the US. For users in Mexico, however, it will continue to show as the Gulf of Mexico.  Are you thinking if that is the usual protocol? Can a company just change the name of a place in maps that millions of people use? Well, according to Google, the company has a “longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government [records]”.
 


 “When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too,” the company added in its post on X. 
 


 This is not the first time that Google has agreed to do something like this. Google has applied this area-based geographic naming in Japan and South Korea as well. Outside of Japan and South Korea, the body of water that borders both the countries is listed on Google Maps as the “Sea of Japan (East Sea)”. In 2012, Iran had warned Google of a legal action after the company removed the name ""Persian Gulf"" from its maps services, leaving the waterway between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula, nameless. In other regions, the water body is currently labeled as ""Persian Gulf (Arabian Gulf)"" on Google Maps.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Feb 3, 2025Tune InAlso read |  Elon Musk is making DOGE work 17 hours a dayAlso read |  Deep Research: After Operator, OpenAI unveils next-gen AI agent, Sam Altman says it is like a superpowerAlso read |  Want to build ChatGPT in India?

Amazon recently sacked some employees to save costs, and now Microsoft has started laying off employees based on their performance. The affected workers have reportedly been let go for not meeting the company’s minimum job performance standards. Here is the full story in five points.advertisementMicrosoft fires employees in fresh round of layoffs: Story in 5 points-According to Business Insider, the impacted employees have been informed that their access to Microsoft's systems and offices would be revoked immediately upon receiving their termination notices, and they would not be permitted to continue any further work.-The employees being terminated under this round of layoffs are facing a range of consequences, with some reportedly indicating that they may not receive severance pay. The cited report suggests that at least three employees confirmed they were told they would not be compensated upon their exit from the company. Additionally, their healthcare benefits were also immediately cut off, raising questions about Microsoft's approach to handling these layoffs, especially in terms of financial and post-employment support. -According to Business Insider, the impacted employees have been informed that their access to Microsoft's systems and offices would be revoked immediately upon receiving their termination notices, and they would not be permitted to continue any further work. -The employees being terminated under this round of layoffs are facing a range of consequences, with some reportedly indicating that they may not receive severance pay. The cited report suggests that at least three employees confirmed they were told they would not be compensated upon their exit from the company. Additionally, their healthcare benefits were also immediately cut off, raising questions about Microsoft's approach to handling these layoffs, especially in terms of financial and post-employment support. -The termination letters handed to the laid-off employees also make it clear that should they choose to reapply for positions at Microsoft in the future, their prior performance and the reasons for their termination will be considered. This policy could potentially hinder their chances of returning to the company. The official letters cite poor performance as the primary reason for termination. -This round of layoffs appears to be part of a more aggressive performance management strategy at Microsoft, which is said to be affecting even senior employees. Reports indicate that workers at high levels within the company are now subject to stringent performance reviews. Despite these terminations, Microsoft has reportedly suggested that many of the roles could eventually be refilled, indicating that this may not result in a big reduction of the company’s overall workforce. As of June 2024, Microsoft employed approximately 228,000 full-time workers. -The performance-based layoffs are occurring alongside a series of other layoffs that Microsoft has been implementing in various departments, including Security, Devices, Sales, and Gaming. These job cuts, however, are unrelated to the performance-based terminations. A Microsoft spokesperson commented on the situation, stating that the company is committed to nurturing talent and taking necessary actions when employees fail to meet performance expectations.

With its three folds and still a slimmer profile, the Mate XT was seen in several headlines during the launch. The Chinese company is the only OEM so far, which has released a triple-fold smartphone. That said, Samsung is also rumoured to bring a triple-fold smartphone with its next-gen foldable series.  advertisementHuawei Mate XT global launchThe Huawei Mate XT smartphone has been spotted on the TDRA certification website, listed under the model number GRL-LX9.

According to a previous report from September 2024, the Mate XT was rumoured to launch in Q1 2025. If this timeline holds, Huawei could unveil the device within the next two months. Since the Mate XT has already debuted in China, the global variant is expected to feature the same specifications as its Chinese counterpart.Huawei Mate XT: What to expect?  The Huawei Mate XT smartphone has been spotted on the TDRA certification website, listed under the model number GRL-LX9. While the listing does not provide specific details regarding its launch or availability, it does confirm that the tri-folding device is set for a global release soon.

Since the Mate XT has already debuted in China, the global variant is expected to feature the same specifications as its Chinese counterpart.Huawei Mate XT: What to expect?  The world's first dual-hinged, triple-folding smartphone offers a remarkable OLED display experience. When unfolded, it starts with a 6.4-inch screen, but the real innovation lies in its ability to expand. The display can partially unfurl to a 7.9-inch size or fully extend into a tablet-like 10.2-inch panel with a resolution of 2,232 x 3,184 pixels. Despite its large screen, the device remains incredibly slim, measuring just 3.6mm when fully opened, making it one of the thinnest smartphones available.   Powering the device is Huawei’s Kirin 9010 5G chipset, running on HarmonyOS 4.2 for a smooth and optimised experience. A 5,600mAh battery ensures long-lasting performance, with support for 66W wired and 50W wireless charging. According to Huawei, the Mate XT features the world’s thinnest smartphone battery, setting a new industry benchmark.   The camera setup is equally impressive. It includes a 50-megapixel primary sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens with 5.5x optical zoom. For selfies, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera is housed within a punch-hole cutout.   These details are based on the assumption that the global variant of the Huawei Mate XT will mirror its Chinese counterpart. For official specifications and confirmation, stay tuned for Huawei’s announcement. For perspective, the Huawei Mate XT is priced starting at CNY 19,999 (approximately Rs 2.43 lakh) for the base variant with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage, while the highest-end model costs CNY 23,999 (around Rs 2.93 lakh) in China.

These changes are aimed at providing more flexibility to users. Here are the details.Reliance Jio launches Rs 189 prepaid plan After being briefly removed, Jio has reintroduced its Rs 189 prepaid plan. Listed under the ‘affordable packs’ section, this pack offers 28 days of validity, providing users with 2GB of total data (with speeds reduced to 64kbps once the data limit is reached), unlimited voice calls to any network, and 300 SMS. Subscribers will also have access to Jio services such as JioTV, JioCinema (excluding premium content), and JioCloud storage. This plan comes in response to recent regulatory guidelines from TRAI, which require telecom operators to introduce voice and SMS-focused packs. For users who need basic connectivity at an economical price, this plan serves as a suitable option.Rs 448 Jio prepaid recharge plan revised In addition to bringing back the Rs 189 pack, Jio has made a minor price reduction to its Rs 448 data + voice plan, bringing it down to Rs 445.

This price adjustment appears to clarify distinctions between Jio’s various plans.

Musk’s enthusiasm during Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony was notably pronounced. And right now, both Musk and Trump have been publicly acknowledging their mutual admiration for one another. In an interview with Fox News, the US President said that Elon Musk is a smart guy and is doing a great job as DOGE head.  “I think Elon is doing a good job. He's a big cost-cutter”, he said. “He's doing a great job. He’s a smart guy. He's very much into cutting the budget of our federal government,” he added. Although, Trump did say that for some time the Trump administration did not agree with the budget cuts he suggests, but largely he has been doing a great job. 
 


 Meanwhile, in an X Space on DOGE & Mars, Elon Musk also shared some love for Donald Trump. “The more I’ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like him. I love the guy, he’s great.”

 At DOGE, in less than two weeks of taking over, Musk has already introduced his trademark intense work culture. DOGE, by the way, stands for the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk in a post on X has disclosed that DOGE team members are working approximately 17 hours a day, including weekends.  In the post, Musk also compared DOGE's workload with that of typical government employees, saying: ""DOGE is working 120 hours a week. Our bureaucratic opponents optimistically work 40 hours a week. That is why they are losing so fast.""  One of DOGE’s most talked about initiatives is the aim to cut down the cost of minting pennies and nickels. Musk’s team at DOGE has been tasked with looking for an initiative to cut down the cost on that by either choosing a different material for the coins or by changing the production process. 
 


 Additionally, Musk also claims that his team is shutting down payments to federal contractors. Reports suggest this could also hint at possible access to sensitive US Treasury systems.
 


 “The corruption and waste is being rooted out in real-time,” Musk posted on X. He added that his team is “rapidly shutting down these illegal payments”, referring to the Treasury department’s payments to a Lutheran charity.

While the tech giant has remained tight-lipped about its upcoming budget-friendly iPhone, rumours and speculations have been circulating online for months, hinting at a Spring 2025 launch. And if the reports hold true, the much-anticipated iPhone SE4 will bring notable upgrades in both hardware and software over the iPhone SE3, which Apple launched in 2022. According to several analysts, including Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the new iPhone SE4 will have a design overhaul, most likely inspired by the iPhone 14. Gurman even noted that Apple is clearing the inventory of its current iPhone SE to make way for the new-gen iPhone SE4, hinting at the upcoming launch on Apple’s calendar. Let's take a detailed look at everything expected from the new-gen iPhone SE4.iPhone SE4: New design and display According to rumours, one of the most significant changes expected with the iPhone SE4 is its design. Moving away from the dated look of previous SE models—including thick bezels and a home button—the SE4 is rumoured to adopt an all-screen design similar to the iPhone 14. Many leaked images of dummy models circulating online from leakers like Majin Bu suggest the iPhone SE4 will feature a notch in its bigger 6.1-inch OLED display—no Dynamic Island, as speculated by a few reports earlier. Apple is said to keep the Dynamic Island exclusive to its flagship series. Along with a notch, rumours suggest that the new budget iPhone SE4 will also bring some differences that will set it apart from the flagship iPhone 16 series. These differences will include a sharper and more angular frame, unlike the rounded edges of the iPhone 16. Apple is said to have chosen this design to be cost-effective while reusing the iPhone 14 chassis. Additionally, the OLED display in the budget iPhone will allow Apple to offer richer colours, deeper blacks, and better contrast compared to the LCD screens used in previous SE models.iPhone SE4: New chipset Under the hood, the iPhone SE4 is expected to pack Apple’s latest A18 series chip, the same processor currently powering the iPhone 16 series. This will be a big upgrade from the A15 Bionic chip of the iPhone SE3. Apple may further couple the powerful processor with 8GB of RAM, which will boost performance and also allow the device to support Apple Intelligence features. If this comes true, the iPhone SE4 will be the most affordable iPhone to offer Apple’s advanced AI capabilities.iPhone SE4: Bigger and better camera On the camera front, the SE4 is rumoured to feature an upgraded 48-megapixel main sensor—a big upgrade from the 12-megapixel camera on its predecessor. The front-facing camera is also expected to see an upgrade to 12 megapixels, offering users better quality selfies and video calls.iPhone SE4: In-house modem If Apple is really launching the iPhone SE4 next month, it will be one of the first devices to debut in 2025. Not just that, but according to reports, it will also be the first Apple device to come with Apple’s custom 5G modem. If true, this will allow the new iPhone to offer better power efficiency, improved cellular network scanning, and enhanced satellite connectivity. Additionally, the SE4 will feature USB-C for charging and data transfer, in line with Apple’s broader transition away from the Lightning port.iPhone SE4: India pricing As for the price, the iPhone SE4 is rumoured to be slightly more expensive than its predecessor, given the significant upgrades. According to rumours, it is expected to start around $470 to $500. In India, it is expected to be priced around Rs 50,000.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 3, 2025Also Read |  Greater Noida man loses Rs 51 lakh after joining a Telegram groupAlso Read |  Indian Railways launches new app, will offer all train services in one placeAlso Read |  iPhone inside your Mac?

One notable rumour is that the company may introduce a new Pro model in this series, replacing the Phone 2a Plus version. Although the company hasn't confirmed this, the teasers have started creating buzz about potential features. A fresh teaser hints that the Nothing Phone 3a could sport a camera button, similar to the one found on the iPhone 16 series. In a cryptic post on X, Nothing shared an image showing one side of the phone with volume buttons and an additional button, which could be a dedicated camera button. The tweet accompanying the image reads, ""Your second memory, one click away,"" suggesting it could be related to quick access to the camera. Brands like Oppo have also incorporated this feature in phones like the Find X8 Pro, and Apple’s designs have often inspired other smartphone makers. For instance, the alert slider on OnePlus phones was borrowed from the iPhone. If Nothing does introduce a camera button or a control feature similar to the iPhone 16 series, it wouldn’t be surprising. However, it’s also possible that this button could function as an Action button, like the one found on the iPhone 15 Pro models. The tweet leans more towards it being a camera button, but for now, Nothing has left the guessing to the audience until the official reveal. Based on previous teasers, the Nothing Phone 3a series is expected to feature a triple camera setup, an upgrade from the dual camera system seen on the Phone 2a and 2a Plus models. It’s likely that the triple camera system could be reserved for the Pro model, while the standard Phone 3a might retain a dual camera setup. Though none of this is confirmed yet, one feature we can expect is a redesigned glyph light interface on the back panel, an evolution of the LED light system seen on earlier Nothing phones.  In terms of display, the Nothing Phone 3a is tipped to come with a 6.8-inch FHD+ AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, up from the 6.7-inch display seen on the Phone 2a. Under the hood, it could pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset. For your reference, the Phone 2a is powered by a Dimensity 7200 Pro. On the camera front, the triple camera setup might include a 50MP primary sensor, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and an 8MP ultra-wide camera. The front camera could remain a 32MP shooter, similar to the previous model. The phone is also expected to pack a 5,000mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging. As of now, the specs for the Phone 3a are speculative, but if the Pro version includes a telephoto sensor while the standard model doesn’t, we might see a price increase for the Pro model compared to the Phone 2a Plus. However, this remains unconfirmed until the official launch. While we will learn more about its pricing and availability details at the launch event, we know that the devices will be sold through Flipkart. For your reference, the Nothing Phone 2a was announced at Rs 23,999, while the Nothing Phone 2a Plus was made available at Rs 27,999.

0a16b161-acf0-40f8-9aae-43e22d4a0e9f,"Trump orders creation of sovereign wealth fund that could help in TikTok US saleUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order for the creation of a sovereign wealth fund over the next year, which he says will help buy TikTok. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/trump-signs-order-to-create-sovereign-wealth-fund-says-it-could-help-facilitate-tiktok-us-sale-2674418-2025-02-04,"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ordering the creation of a sovereign wealth fund within the next year, saying it could potentially buy the short video app TikTok. If created, the sovereign wealth fund could place the US alongside numerous other countries, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, that have launched similar funds as a way to make direct investments with government dollars. The text of the executive order was sparse on details, and simply directed the Treasury and Commerce Departments to submit a plan for such a fund within 90 days, including recommendations on ""funding mechanisms, investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model."" Typically, such funds rely on a country's budget surplus to make investments, but the US operates at a deficit. Its creation also would likely require approval from Congress. ""We're going to create a lot of wealth for the fund,"" Trump told reporters. ""And I think it's about time that this country had a sovereign wealth fund."" Trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as a presidential candidate, saying it could fund ""great national endeavors"" like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports, manufacturing, and medical research. Administration officials did not say how the fund would operate or be financed, but Trump has previously said it could be funded by ""tariffs and other intelligent things."" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters the fund would be set up within the next 12 months. ""We're going to monetise the asset side of the US balance sheet for the American people,"" Bessent said. ""There'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring them out for the American people."" One approach would be to convert the US International Development Finance Corp (DFC) to function similar to a sovereign wealth fund, which the Trump administration reportedly considered in recent months, Bloomberg News reported. The DFC is a government agency that currently partners with private parties to finance projects in the developing world. Trump announced Friday he was nominating Benjamin Black to head that development agency. Black, a managing partner at investment firm Fortinbras Enterprises, is the son of Leon Black, the co-founder of asset management firm Apollo Global Management. The Biden administration also was considering establishing such a fund prior to Trump's election in November, according to The New York Times and Financial Times. But precisely how such a fund would be structured, and funded, remains unclear. Several experts said Congress would likely need to authorise new funding given the lack of an existing surplus to tap. The order directed officials to review any need for legislation. Clemence Landers, a former Treasury official who is now with the Center for Global Development, said there has been talk of repurposing the DFC but setting up such a fund would require Congress. “Obviously, you can't establish an institution by executive order and, more to the point is, you can't fund an institution by executive order,” she said.
Investors said the news came as a surprise. ""Creating a sovereign wealth fund suggests that a country has savings that will go up and can be allocated to this,"" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco in London. ""The economic rules of thumb don't add up."" There are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8 trillion in assets, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. Numerous US states, including Alaska, Texas and New Mexico also have their own wealth funds, which help fund various priorities, including education and tax relief. They frequently rely on revenue raised by natural resources, like oil or land. In another surprise twist, Trump suggested the wealth fund could buy TikTok, whose fate has been up in the air since a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban that took effect on January 19. Trump, after taking office on January 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over TikTok's purchase and would likely have a decision on the app's future in February. The popular app has about 170 million American users. ""We're going to be doing something, perhaps with TikTok, and perhaps not,"" Trump said. ""If we make the right deal, we'll do it. Otherwise, we won't...we might put that in the sovereign wealth fund.""Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Tune InAlso read |  Donald Trump wants Gulf of Mexico to be renamed to Gulf of America, Google quickly agrees to make the changeAlso read |  Elon Musk is making DOGE work 17 hours a dayAlso read |  Deep Research: After Operator, OpenAI unveils next-gen AI agent, Sam Altman says it is like a superpower

While Apple has opposed the decision, an alternative app store has approved it. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphones-are-getting-their-first-ever-native-porn-app-but-not-everyone-can-access-it-2674426-2025-02-04,"Altstore, an alternative app store for iOS, has approved listing a native porn app on iPhones and iPads.  The app, Hot Tub, has been launched in the European market. According to Altstore, the app has completed all approval hurdles, including Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). On the other hand, Apple is not happy, and neither supports this decision, saying this will hamper safety and security among users, especially kids. The Hot Tub is only available for the European market and is currently free for use. advertisementWhat is a Hot Tub app for iPhones? The Hot Tub is an aggregator that offers iOS users a way to search and play videos from a variety of adult websites, including Pornhub, Xvideos, XNXX, and XHamster. That said, these websites have always been available on the internet. Still, according to the reports, DMA has allowed the app to be listed for iPhones and iPads through alternative marketplaces in the EU. 
 


Hence, currently, only the users in Europe can use this app, but it is in the beta phase for now.

 Hence, currently, only the users in Europe can use this app, but it is in the beta phase for now.  The app description states, “The app promises a private and secure way to browse adult content, without ads or tracking. An elegant, native porn app. Thoughtfully designed, ethically made, and free to use"", according to the TechCrunch report. The app promotes itself as a native alternative to adult websites, offering a seamless experience free from ads, trackers, and intrusive pop-ups. It includes built-in search, gesture controls, and customisable settings, along with exclusive subscriber perks such as advanced search options, filtering, and access to categorised content across multiple platforms.But, what is an alternative app store, and why is Apple’s approval not needed?  Last year, the European Union took away Apple's right to be the only app store for iPhones and iPads, citing its monopoly and high commissions.  Alternative app store publishers now have the power to decide which types of apps they want to allow, including those that would typically violate Apple’s App Store Guidelines. According to Apple’s support documentation, apps on these alternative stores must still undergo a notarisation process to meet basic platform integrity standards. However, Apple cautions that these alternative stores can choose to distribute apps that include controversial content, such as pornography, drugs, alcohol, weapons, and hate speech. AltStore claims that the Hot Tub app is the first to successfully pass the notarisation process for distribution on iPhones. Despite the app’s explicit content, AltStore states they encountered no issues with getting it approved. This is likely because Apple has often cited pornography as an example of the types of apps they are now required to permit under the Digital Markets Act (DMA).Apple is against AltStore's Hot Tub porn app Apple has always been very careful with the safety and security of its users. But now, thanks to the EU’s Digital Markets Act, iPhone users have other ways to install other apps. AltStore Pal is among the first alternative markets for iPhone users. It went live in April 2024 and has grown to include utilities and apps, which were once banned by Apple, like game emulators.  And now with a porn app, Hot Tub, Apple said that it is deeply concerned about the safety risks. In a statement, reported by TechCrunch, Apple said that such apps undermine consumers' trust and confidence in its ecosystem. It said, “Contrary to the false statements made by the marketplace developer, we certainly do not approve of this app and would never offer it in our App Store. The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.” Apple also highlighted that AltStore is backed by Epic Games, the Fortnite maker that sued Apple over antitrust issues.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also read |  Donald Trump signs order to create sovereign wealth fund, says it could help facilitate TikTok US saleAlso read |  Donald Trump says Elon Musk is a smart guy and is doing a great job as DOGE headAlso read |  Donald Trump wants Gulf of Mexico to be renamed to Gulf of America, Google quickly agrees to make the changeMust Watch

According to a tipster on X (formerly Twitter), early prototypes of the Galaxy S26 Ultra are missing a visible selfie camera cutout on the display. This suggests that Samsung might be planning to introduce an under-display camera for its next flagship smartphone.

Source: @kro_roe/ X (formerly Twitter)
 If the rumour about the under-display selfie camera is true, this would be a big shift in Samsung’s design approach for its slab phones. The company has already experimented with under-display cameras in its foldable Galaxy Z Fold lineup, but the technology has often been criticised for compromising photo quality. For the Galaxy S26 Ultra, Samsung will need to improve the camera’s performance to avoid disappointing users, especially those who prioritise selfies and video calls. However, it’s important to note that these are very early prototypes, and a lot can change before the phone’s official launch. While the rumour is interesting, it’s worth taking it with a pinch of salt for now. If Samsung does move forward with this design, it would join brands like Nubia, which have already released smartphones with under-display cameras outside the Indian market. In addition to the potential under-display camera, previous rumours suggested that the S26 Ultra might actually be rebranded as the Galaxy S26 Note, reviving the beloved Note series name. The device is also expected to feature a brighter and more power-efficient display compared to its predecessor, along with a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera.  Meanwhile, the recently launched Galaxy S25 Ultra is already up for pre-orders in India and worldwide. Priced starting at Rs 1,29,999 for the 256GB storage variant, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the top-of-the-line model in the S25 series. It features a 6.9-inch AMOLED display, a titanium build, and Corning’s Gorilla Armor 2, which is touted as the most scratch-resistant glass yet. The phone is also slimmer and lighter than last year’s S24 Ultra. One of the standout features of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is its built-in S Pen. However, for what it’s worth, Bluetooth connectivity for the S Pen is no longer there, as Samsung believes that only a small percentage of its users actually use the air gestures and wireless features. Apart from this, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features an impressive camera setup. There’s a 200-megapixel primary sensor, a brand new 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 10-megapixel telephoto lens with 3X optical zoom, and a 50-megapixel periscope telephoto lens with 5X optical zoom. There’s a 5,000mAh battery under the hood, and the phone comes with 12GB RAM and storage options of up to 1TB.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Best mobile phone under Rs 60,000 in January 2025: Realme GT 7 Pro, iQOO 13 and more

Bloomberg reports that the upcoming job cuts at the American cloud-based software company will impact more than 1,000 employees. However, the affected employees will be allowed to apply for other positions internally. The report of more layoffs at Salesforce comes amid the company’s ongoing hiring efforts to bring in employees to boost the sales of its AI-driven products. Although Salesforce has not yet released an official statement regarding the new job cuts, these layoffs are likely to occur before the company starts its new fiscal year. Salesforce is likely to report its quarterly earnings on February 26, 2025. Notably, Salesforce has been announcing job cuts since the tech industry was hit by mass layoffs in 2023. Following large-scale layoffs by tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and others, Salesforce also reportedly laid off 10 percent of its total workforce—approximately 8,000 employees—in 2023. These job cuts were part of the company’s restructuring efforts to streamline operations and address a slowdown in sales. The job cuts at Salesforce continue in 2024. In January 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was laying off about 700 employees. Before entering fiscal year 2024, the company reportedly had nearly 73,000 employees. Later, in July 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Salesforce had cut around 300 additional positions. Amid these phased job cuts, the company has been actively hiring employees to support its AI division. In December 2024, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced that the company had closed more than 1,000 paid deals for its AI-powered virtual representative platform, AgentForce. However, Salesforce is not the only company continuing to shake the tech world with layoffs. In January 2025, Meta announced plans to cut around 5 percent of its workforce. These job cuts are said to target the lowest-performing employees, with plans to backfill their roles later this year. In a memo sent to employees, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said: ""I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle."" According to the memo, Meta plans to reduce its workforce by 10 percent by the end of the current performance cycle, including 5 percent in 2024. This will affect employees who have been with the company long enough to receive a performance rating. Zuckerberg added that the company will offer generous severance packages to those impacted.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also Read |  iPhone SE4 expected to arrive next month?

Previously, this tool was only available in group chats, allowing users to create events, set reminders, and coordinate appointments directly within the app. Now, with the feature rolling out to one-on-one conversations, users will have more flexibility to manage their schedules without switching to a dedicated calendar app. According to WABetaInfo, the latest beta version (25.2.10.73) of WhatsApp for iOS, has already enabled this functionality, letting users add locations or links to audio and video calls while planning events. This move by WhatsApp comes at a time when Apple is reportedly experimenting with its own event management tool. Codenamed Invites, the app is designed to help users organise meetings and in-person gatherings. While Apple’s Calendar app already supports event creation, the new app is expected to offer additional features, such as a more interactive interface and deeper integration with iCloud. According to 9to5Mac, references to the app were first spotted in the iOS 18.2 beta, and although the code was temporarily removed, it has reappeared in the iOS 18.3 beta 2, suggesting Apple is still actively developing the idea. The Invites app is said to integrate with a new iOS 18 daemon called GroupKit, which manages database models for groups of people. This integration could allow users to see a list of invitees and track who has confirmed their attendance. However, it’s unclear whether the app will be standalone or integrated into existing services like iMessage. Apple has remained tight-lipped about the project, and there’s a chance it might not make it to the final release, as the company often tests ideas that don’t always see the light of day. Meanwhile, WhatsApp is also exploring other updates, such as allowing users to open View Once media on linked devices. Currently, this feature, which lets users send photos or videos that disappear after being viewed, only works on the primary device where WhatsApp is registered. Expanding this functionality would make a lot of sense, especially for users who have WhatsApp installed on multiple devices. As of now, there’s no official word on when WhatsApp’s event scheduling feature or Apple’s Invites app will be available to the public. WhatsApp’s beta version is currently accessible to select iOS users via TestFlight, while Apple’s plans for the Invites app remain speculative.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Best mobile phone under Rs 60,000 in January 2025: Realme GT 7 Pro, iQOO 13 and more

Here is everything we expect from the new iPhone and how it will offer a different experience from the current iPhone Plus variant.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/iphone-17-air-vs-iphone-16-plus-here-is-how-apple-may-replace-the-plus-variant-for-slimmer-iphone-2674539-2025-02-04,"The 2025 iPhone lineup is expected to get a new surprise edition: a new variant of the iPhone, most likely called the iPhone 17 Air. According to industry rumours, this new iPhone will be the slimmest Apple device and will offer users the same premium iPhone experience but with a slimmer and lightweight form factor—similar to what Apple offers with its other Air variants in the iPad and MacBook lineups. However, this new edition will not be the fifth iPhone but is instead likely to replace the existing iPhone 16 Plus. Apple is reportedly not reaching the expected sales figures for its Plus variant, even with the iPhone 16 Plus, and hence, in 2025, it is expected to replace the variant altogether with the new iPhone 17 Air. According to reports by analysts like Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, this move of replacing the iPhone 16 Plus with the new iPhone 17 Air is likely to help Apple attract more customers with a sleeker design and refined features.  While Apple has neither confirmed nor hinted at this new variant, rumours and speculation are already fuelling anticipation. Let's take a detailed look at what the new iPhone 17 Air may offer and how it could provide a different experience compared to the iPhone 16 Plus.iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Design The most significant change between the current iPhone 16 Plus and its anticipated replacement, the iPhone 17 Air, lies in the design. The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to be Apple’s thinnest iPhone ever, with reports suggesting a thickness of just 5.5mm at its slimmest point. If this holds true, the design will mark a dramatic reduction compared to the iPhone 16 Plus, which measures 7.8mm thick. While being slimmer, the iPhone 17 Air is said not to compete with the Pro models as previously anticipated. The new iPhone 17 Air is also expected to feature an aluminum chassis, ditching the titanium used in the Pro models. In comparison, the iPhone 16 Plus has a larger, more traditional build—it's bigger than the standard iPhone 16 model. Notably, design is one of the selling points of the iPhone 16 Plus, as it offers the iPhone Pro Max size but with standard specifications for users wanting a bigger display. However, it seems like this strategy isn’t working for Apple, and hence the company may shift to offering a sleeker and more lightweight iPhone.iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Display On the front, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 6.55-inch display, slightly smaller than the iPhone 16 Plus’s 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR screen. Despite the size reduction, the Air will likely boast Apple’s latest and upgraded display technology. In fact, with the iPhone 17 series, Apple is rumoured to expand ProMotion technology across the entire lineup, enabling a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and improved video playback. Additionally, an always-on display feature could make its way to the Air. The iPhone 16 Plus, on the other hand, currently offers only a standard 60Hz refresh rate.iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Camera Cameras will also get a big update with the new iPhone 17 series, including the anticipated iPhone 17 Air. Unlike the iPhone 16 Plus, which houses a dual-camera setup – 48 megapixel + 12 megapixel– , the Air may feature an upgraded rear camera. However, reports suggest that to achieve a sleeker design, the iPhone 17 Air might only feature a single camera, unlike the dual-camera setup of the iPhone 16 Plus. Despite having only one camera, Apple is expected to optimise it with advanced software enhancements to ensure high-quality photography. Additionally, the front camera is set for a major upgrade across the iPhone 17 lineup, with a new 24-megapixel sensor replacing the 12-megapixel shooter on the iPhone 16 Plus. This upgrade will offer users sharper selfies and improved video call quality.iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Performance Under the hood, the iPhone 17 Air will reportedly be powered by Apple’s next-generation A19 chip, built on an advanced 3nm process. This chipset will offer better performance and energy efficiency compared to the current A18 chip found in the iPhone 16 Plus. The Air is also expected to feature 8GB of RAM, matching the iPhone 16 series but offering improved multitasking and smoother operation, especially with Apple Intelligence features.advertisementiPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: ConnectivityTo achieve a slimmer profile, Apple is rumoured to eliminate the physical SIM card slot entirely, relying solely on eSIM technology worldwide. This contrasts with the iPhone 16 Plus, which still offers a SIM card slot in many markets outside the U.S.Moreover, the Air may be amongst the first iPhones to feature Apple’s in-house 5G modem and Wi-Fi 7 support, promising faster connectivity and better power efficiency. Notably, the iPhone SE 4, which is rumoured to arrive next month, is likely to debut first with Apple’s in-house modem.iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Battery lifeApart from the larger design and display, the iPhone 16 Plus also offers a bigger battery than the standard iPhone. However, the battery might take a hit in the iPhone 17 Air. That said, Apple could offset this potential battery downgrade with improved energy efficiency from the A19 chip and display optimisations. Durability-wise, the Air will likely feature a new anti-reflective coating on its display, making it more scratch-resistant than the Ceramic Shield on current models.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also Read |  Salesforce set to cut 1000 roles, impacted employees may have option to reapply internallyAlso Read |  iPhone SE4 expected to arrive next month?

However, the battery might take a hit in the iPhone 17 Air. That said, Apple could offset this potential battery downgrade with improved energy efficiency from the A19 chip and display optimisations. Durability-wise, the Air will likely feature a new anti-reflective coating on its display, making it more scratch-resistant than the Ceramic Shield on current models.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also Read |  Salesforce set to cut 1000 roles, impacted employees may have option to reapply internallyAlso Read |  iPhone SE4 expected to arrive next month?

However, he now thinks that AGI could arrive much earlier. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/artificial-general-intelligence-could-arrive-much-earlier-than-predicted-says-softbank-ceo-masayoshi-son-2674504-2025-02-04,"The anticipation of the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been growing steadily. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that AGI is just Twitter hype, his business partner, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, has said that AGI will arrive much sooner than he predicted. Son says that as opposed to his earlier prediction, that AGI will become reality in the next two to three years, he now thinks that the tech may arrive “much earlier”, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a recent post on X, said that AGI is just Twitter hype as of this point in time. While there was a lot of chatter about AGI being deployed by OpenAI as soon as next month, Altman denied the claims, and said that the company has not even yet built AGI.  For the uninitiated, AGI can be understood as the next step to AI, where the tech system is not just performing a task like a human would do, but is also capable of thinking, learning, and adapting like humans. As opposed to AI that we understand right now, AGI is believed to have a wider horizon. It will not be limited to a particular skill, it will have flexible thinking abilities similar to that of a human mind.  Basically, AGI right now seems like the highest goal AI research companies can achieve, that is, building a machine or an AI system that is able to understand, comprehend and react to a variety of problems just like a human would.  The SoftBank CEO said this as he announced a new AI system called Cristal Intelligence in Japan, which the company has released in collaboration with OpenAI. The joint venture, called SB OpenAI Japan, is owned 50-50 by both companies and involves an investment of $3 billion in the project, which is aimed at changing the way businesses work with the help of AI agents.  SoftBank has said that with Cristal Intelligence, AI agents will “automate everyday tasks”. The company also says that it will use the new AI system at its own Arm and SoftBank Corp to “drive innovation and boost productivity across the company.” The company’s press release claims that the AI agent will allow it to “automate over 100 million workflows”.  This is the second partnership that SoftBank and OpenAI announced this month. The first was Project Stargate, which is a new AI company that involves a massive investment of $500 billion over the next four years. An initial $100 billion has already been deployed in the project. At the time of announcing Project Stargate, Sam Altman had announced that the company is aimed to help develop data centres for OpenAI in the United States.

According to a tipster on X (formerly Twitter), early prototypes of the Galaxy S26 Ultra are missing a visible selfie camera cutout on the display. This suggests that Samsung might be planning to introduce an under-display camera for its next flagship smartphone.

Source: @kro_roe/ X (formerly Twitter)
 If the rumour about the under-display selfie camera is true, this would be a big shift in Samsung’s design approach for its slab phones. The company has already experimented with under-display cameras in its foldable Galaxy Z Fold lineup, but the technology has often been criticised for compromising photo quality. For the Galaxy S26 Ultra, Samsung will need to improve the camera’s performance to avoid disappointing users, especially those who prioritise selfies and video calls. However, it’s important to note that these are very early prototypes, and a lot can change before the phone’s official launch. While the rumour is interesting, it’s worth taking it with a pinch of salt for now. If Samsung does move forward with this design, it would join brands like Nubia, which have already released smartphones with under-display cameras outside the Indian market. In addition to the potential under-display camera, previous rumours suggested that the S26 Ultra might actually be rebranded as the Galaxy S26 Note, reviving the beloved Note series name. The device is also expected to feature a brighter and more power-efficient display compared to its predecessor, along with a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera.  Meanwhile, the recently launched Galaxy S25 Ultra is already up for pre-orders in India and worldwide. Priced starting at Rs 1,29,999 for the 256GB storage variant, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the top-of-the-line model in the S25 series. It features a 6.9-inch AMOLED display, a titanium build, and Corning’s Gorilla Armor 2, which is touted as the most scratch-resistant glass yet. The phone is also slimmer and lighter than last year’s S24 Ultra. One of the standout features of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is its built-in S Pen. However, for what it’s worth, Bluetooth connectivity for the S Pen is no longer there, as Samsung believes that only a small percentage of its users actually use the air gestures and wireless features. Apart from this, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features an impressive camera setup. There’s a 200-megapixel primary sensor, a brand new 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 10-megapixel telephoto lens with 3X optical zoom, and a 50-megapixel periscope telephoto lens with 5X optical zoom. There’s a 5,000mAh battery under the hood, and the phone comes with 12GB RAM and storage options of up to 1TB.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Best mobile phone under Rs 60,000 in January 2025: Realme GT 7 Pro, iQOO 13 and more

So, with roughly the same package, which one offers better value for your money?iQOO 12: Should you buy it? While the OnePlus 13R impresses with its smooth and feature-rich OxygenOS 15 software, the iQOO 12 takes the upper hand when it comes to hardware, except for the battery. Both devices come with 1.5K resolution displays, but the iQOO 12 offers a 144Hz refresh rate, which is a big plus for gamers. On the other hand, the OnePlus 13R sticks with a 120Hz panel. In terms of memory and storage, both phones start with 12GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage, so there’s no difference there. When it comes to cameras, the iQOO 12 outshines the OnePlus 13R with its flagship-grade setup. It packs three 50-megapixel sensors — a primary camera, an ultra-wide-angle camera, and a periscope lens with 3x optical zoom. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13R offers a simpler camera configuration, and its video recording is capped at 4K at 60fps. The iQOO 12, in comparison, can also shoot videos in 8K resolution at 30fps, if needed. Battery performance is another area to consider. The OnePlus 13R comes with a larger 6,000mAh battery and supports 80W fast charging. In contrast, the iQOO 12 has a smaller 5,000mAh battery but compensates with 120W fast charging, which gets the phone charged much faster. Plus, for gamers, the iQOO 12 offers bypass charging, a feature that keeps the phone cool during long gaming sessions. In the end, choosing between the OnePlus 13R and the iQOO 12 comes down to your priorities. If you value a longer-lasting battery and a smoother software experience, the OnePlus 13R might be the better pick. However, if you’re after better hardware, especially for gaming and photography, the iQOO 12 is hard to beat — especially with the Amazon discount bringing it to the same price.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Best mobile phone under Rs 60,000 in January 2025: Realme GT 7 Pro, iQOO 13 and more

Before any official notification can come, leaks and tips have a lot to say about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy G-Fold. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-triple-fold-smartphone-tipped-to-be-named-as-galaxy-g-fold-here-is-everything-you-need-to-know-2674534-2025-02-04,"Samsung is rumoured to release its first triple-fold smartphone this year, along with its next-gen foldable series. Previously, leaks have been pointing at the upcoming features and specs without even bothering about the name. But now, a recent leak has suggested that the company might name it the Samsung Galaxy G Fold. Introducing the idea, back in 2023, the company called it a multi-fold phone, but there was no name until now. According to Lanzuk on Naver, Samsung's upcoming tri-fold smartphone will not be included in the Galaxy Z series but will instead debut as the ""Galaxy G Fold.""    The rationale behind this naming decision remains uncertain, particularly since the ""Z"" branding in Samsung's foldable lineup already seems well-suited for a tri-fold device.  Additionally, the tipster shared that the triple-screen fold is scheduled to be introduced this year but will be available to buy in January 2026. Moreover, unlike the Huawei Mate XT, the Samsung's tri-fold can fold from both sides and will supposedly have a display that measures 9.96-inches when fully unfolded, being 6.54-inches tall. While the Huawei Mate XT and Galaxy G Fold  could share a similar weight, Samsung triple-fold is expected to be thicker.  Earlier reports have also suggested that Samsung’s tri-fold smartphone will feature a G-shaped folding design, where the outer screens fold inward. This contrasts with Huawei’s Mate XT, which utilises an S- or Z-shaped mechanism that folds both inward and outward. The report indicates that Samsung’s design could offer greater durability, making the device more resilient in the long run.Samsung Galaxy G Fold: What to expect Details about Samsung’s tri-fold smartphone remain scarce, but an intriguing theory suggests it could boast a massive 12.4-inch display when fully unfolded. This would position it as a versatile alternative to both smartphones and tablets, even surpassing Huawei’s 10.2-inch Mate XT. Additionally, the device may support a partially unfolded mode, offering a 10.5-inch display for a more immersive viewing experience.   Another notable rumour hints at the absence of under-display camera technology. While this could lead to improved front-facing camera quality, it would require a hole-punch cutout on the main screen, slightly affecting the device’s sleek design. However, this trade-off may be worthwhile for better camera performance. It looks like Samsung has major plans for foldable phones this year. After the Galaxy Unpacked event (scheduled for January 22), which will unveil the Galaxy S25 series, the company will turn its focus on Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. This year, the company has two more foldables: Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and a triple-fold phone. While there is a lot of variety in 2025, production is still expected to be low.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also read |  Realme GT 7 tipped to launch soon with Snapdragon 8 Elite chipAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra tipped to get under-display selfie cameraAlso read |  Nothing Phone 3a could feature iPhone-like camera button, fresh teaser suggests

The company’s CEO Nipun Marya, in a post on X, said it will launch on March 11. iQOO has also revealed that the smartphone will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage. For perspective, some other phones that launched with that chipset in India in the last few months are the Realme GT 6, Poco F6, Honor 200 Pro, among others. iQOO has also announced that the Neo 10R will be available in an India-exclusive colour variant called the Raging Blue. Teasers shared by the company also reveal what the Raging Blue variant would look like. It carries the classic Neo series design language with a thin grey strip on the left side of the back panel, and the rest of the panel features a shade of blue. The transition between the two colours uses tiny pixel graphics –– which look quite nice, in the pictures, at least. 
 


 Teasers also show that the iQOO Neo 10R will feature the popular squoval camera module at the back. The official image shows that the phone will feature a dual camera setup with support for optical image stabilisation (OIS). There is a tiny LED flash that sits outside the camera island –– on its right. While iQOO has yet to confirm the specifications of the camera, leaks suggest that it could feature a combination for a 50-megapixel primary sensor and an 8-megapixel wide-angle sensor.  Additionally, it is also already confirmed that the iQOO Neo 10R will be available for purchase via Amazon India and iQOO’s official website. 
Besides that, leaks also suggest that the iQOO Neo 10R could sport a 1.5K OLED display with a refresh rate up to 144Hz. Fuelling the phone is expected to be a 6,400mAh battery, with support for 80W wired fast charging. Leaks also hint that the phone will come with up to 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.  As for pricing, while other Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 smartphones in the market are currently priced slightly higher, there are speculations that the iQOO Neo 10R will be priced under Rs 30,000.  The launch of the iQOO Neo 10R will most likely take place via online channels. Which means, that the phone's launch will take place iQOO's social media channels like the X, Facebook, and YouTube accounts. More information and other details about the Neo 10R should start trickling in soon.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-once-again-hints-that-he-wants-to-make-an-ai-device-2674648-2025-02-04,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has once again shared his plans to develop an AI-first device in collaboration with Jony Ive, the man who is credited to designing some of Apple’s most iconic products, including the 1998 iMac, the iPhone, and even the Apple Park campus. The latest report about OpenAI’s AI hardware comes via a report from Nikkei Asia, according to which, Altman said ""we hope to do it [develop AI hardware] in partnership"" with Jony Ive. Reportedly, he said that during his visit to Japan to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.  Here is some context: In December 2023, a report went viral that claimed that Jony Ive and his new design company called LoveFrom were working on an AI-first device”. This device was backed by OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman. A few weeks after this report came out, there were reports that a bunch of Apple executives were leaving the company, and many of them, including Tang Tan, who was heading the iPhone and Apple Watch design team, were heading to LoveFrom.  The news stirred quite a storm. There were a flurry of reports claiming that Ive, Altman and Tan are getting together to work on this purported AI hardware. And if you join the dots a bit, it even makes sense. Jony Ive has decades of experience in design, and specifically the iPhone, a device that changed the way we knew phones back in 2007. Tang Tan has his expertise in making the device look and work in a particular way. And Sam Altman, who is the face of AI, will likely add all the AI-smarts to the hardware.  As for what the AI device will be. For now, reports keep fluctuating between an AI smartphone, AI device, or simply AI hardware. There haven't been many official reports around it in a long time, so for now what we understand is that it could be an AI device –– think on the lines of the Humane AI pin or the Rabbit R1. It’s possible that this device may not even look like a smartphone, but looking at the trend and the way these AI companies want us to interact with AI tools and systems, it is quite likely that this “AI device” will still function like a phone. I imagine the device to be what comes after the smartphone. I believed instead of being a phone with a built-in personal assistant, this would be a personal assistant that functions as your primary device, and communication would just be one of the many features on it. Whatever form this “AI device” may take, one thing is for certain, that it will be centered around voice interaction –– the push for the Advanced voice mode on ChatGPT, and Sam Altman's big investment in the Humane AI pin are a big hint at that.

However, your struggles will soon be fixed and you may need to delete these apps. The Ministry of Railways has recently introduced a new Super App called 'SwaRail.' This app, developed by the Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS), offers a range of services—from booking tickets and checking PNR status to ordering food—all under one roof. Until now, Indian Railways passengers had to download and access different apps for different purposes—such as IRCTC Rail Connect for reserved tickets, UTS Mobile for unreserved tickets, and other apps for train inquiries, parcel bookings, and complaint management. However, with the new Super App SwaRail, Indian Railways has integrated all these services into one unified platform. It aims to help Indian railway travelers manage all their travel queries and services through just a single app with a simple interface.Currently under beta testing  Right now, the app is available for beta testers on both Android and iOS. Users can join the beta testing, although the beta testing limit on Android is currently full. However, according to Indian Railways, the app will soon be available for download once the beta testing is completed. But how does the app work? What does it offer? And how can you use it? Let’s take a detailed look at everything you need to know about Indian Railways’ new SwaRail app.How to use the SwaRail app Currently, the SwaRail app is in beta testing, but it will be available to the public soon. Once it’s public, you will be able to download it from the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store. After downloading, you can either register as a new user or log in with your existing Rail Connect or UTS Mobile credentials. This will also sync all your past travel details into the app. Following a few simple login steps—including setting up an MPIN and other security options—the app will open to the homepage. On the homepage, you will find various services in a simplified UI, including: Reserved tickets: Book reserved tickets easily, just like in the IRCTC Rail Connect app. Unreserved tickets: Check and book unreserved tickets. Platform tickets: Book platform tickets when dropping off your relatives or friends. Parcel and Freight enquiries: Make inquiries related to parcel and freight services within the same app. Train and PNR Status enquiries: Get real-time updates on train schedules, running status, and PNR information. Food orders on trains: Order food during your journey for a more comfortable travel experience. Rail Madad for complaint management: Register complaints and track grievance redressal through the integrated Rail Madad platform. All in all, by merging various services, the SwaRail app eliminates the hassle of juggling multiple applications. Whether you need to book tickets, check train schedules, or file complaints—everything is accessible from one dashboard.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Also Read |  iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Here is how Apple may replace the Plus variant for slimmer iPhoneAlso Read |  Salesforce set to cut 1000 roles, impacted employees may have option to reapply internallyAlso Read |  iPhone SE4 expected to arrive next month?

The X7 Pro stands out with its top-tier performance, stunning flat display, and massive battery, making it ideal for gamers and power users. Meanwhile, the standard X7 impresses with its curved screen, solid performance, and attractive price, catering to casual users. Both phones deliver excellent value, but the X7 Pro's premium features make it a better choice for those willing to stretch their budget.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/poco-x7-x7-pro-review-which-is-best-for-you-2674738-2025-02-04,"I’ve spent some time testing the Poco X7 series — the X7 and X7 Pro — and here’s my take. A quick disclaimer: the Poco X7 Pro is — without a shadow of a doubt — the better phone of the two, a sentiment I shared in my first impressions of these devices. However, this isn’t solely due to its higher price tag. The standard Poco X7 is a solid smartphone in its own right and should appeal to many within its price range. That said, the real star here — much like last year’s X6 Pro — is the Poco X7 Pro. It delivers exceptional raw performance at such an attractive price point that it could even give premium phones a good run for their money.  So, what makes the Poco X7 Pro so special? And who should consider the standard Poco X7? Let’s dive into all the details in this full review of both smartphones.Poco X7: Quick look at the specs — Display: 6.67-inch 1.5K, 120Hz refresh rate, curved AMOLED, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, in-display fingerprint sensor, 3,000 nits peak brightness — Chipset: MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra, 4nm fabrication process — RAM and storage: 8GB + 128GB (Rs 21,999), 8GB + 256GB (Rs 23,999) — Battery: 5,500mAh — Charging: 45W, charger included in the box — Software: HyperOS based on Android 14, 3 years of OS updates plus 4 years of security patches — Camera: 50-megapixel Sony LYTIA LYT-600 primary rear camera, 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera, 2-megapixel macro sensor, 20-megapixel front camera — Miscellaneous: IP68/ IP69 rating, IR blaster, dual-stereo speakers, USB type-C port (2.0)Poco X7 Pro: Quick look at the specs — Display: 6.78-inch 1.5K, 120Hz refresh rate, flat AMOLED, Gorilla Glass 7i protection, in-display fingerprint sensor, 3,200 nits peak brightness — Chipset: MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra, 4nm fabrication process — RAM and storage: 8GB + 256GB (Rs 27,999), 12GB + 256GB (Rs 29,999) — Battery: 6,550mAh — Charging: 90W, charger included in the box — Software: HyperOS based on Android 14, 3 years of OS updates plus 4 years of security patches — Camera: 50-megapixel Sony LYTIA LYT-600 primary rear camera, 2-megapixel macro sensor, 20-megapixel front camera — Miscellaneous: IP68/ IP69 rating, IR blaster, dual-stereo speakers, USB type-C port (2.0)A polarising look you can’t ignore At first glance, you might mistake the Poco X7 for the pricier model of the two. However, in reality, it’s the Poco X7 Pro that comes with the higher price tag — more on that in a moment. Both phones are available in striking green colourways, with the Poco X7 also offered in grey, while the X7 Pro comes in a stealthy black option. That said, the bold yellow colour variant for both the X7 and X7 Pro is what truly grabs attention. With a two-tone finish and prominent Poco branding, these devices are impossible to ignore. This is precisely why I call their design polarising — you might either love it or not, but there’s no denying its bold statement.  Personally, I’m a fan of the look and feel of these phones. For mid-range models, they exude a premium vibe with their dense plastic frames and vegan leather finishes on the back. Interestingly, despite being part of the same series, the Poco X7 and X7 Pro look completely different. The Poco X7 stands out with its curvy look and quadruple lens cutout (three functional), while the X7 Pro opts for a sleek boxy aesthetic and features dual rear cameras. Both devices score high on ergonomics. They are comfortable to hold, with well-placed buttons that are easy to reach. The optical fingerprint sensors on both phones are quick and reliable. Even with their large batteries — especially the X7 Pro, which packs a massive 6,550mAh battery — they manage to stay relatively light and slim.  Now, let’s revisit the price and display choices. Here’s the twist — the more affordable Poco X7 sports a curved display, while the pricier X7 Pro features a flat panel. This is unusual since curved displays are typically reserved for premium phones, giving the X7 a distinct edge in terms of aesthetics. While I personally prefer flat displays, the X7’s curve lends it a premium look and feel. Plus, it’s protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2, which Poco claims offers better drop resistance — a critical feature for curved panels. On the other hand, the X7 Pro uses Gorilla Glass 7i. Though slightly less rugged, it suits the flat design and helps manage production costs. When it comes to design, both phones deliver in their unique ways. But once you look past the aesthetics, the X7 Pro begins to reveal its true advantages over the standard X7.Gorgeous displays but with a few differences When it comes to the display, Poco has done a very good job with both the X7 and X7 Pro, but some key differences set them apart. Let’s start with the basics.  The Poco X7 comes with a 6.67-inch curved AMOLED display with a resolution of 1,220x2,712 (1.5K) pixels. This panel offers a 120Hz refresh rate. It’s HDR10 certified, supports Dolby Vision, and covers the full DCI-P3 colour gamut, ensuring vibrant colours and excellent image quality. If you’re someone who spends a lot of time watching videos or scrolling through photos, this display won’t disappoint. In fact, at this price point, it’s one of the best screens you can get. Plus, it’s a curved screen, so, it looks and feels all the way more premium than its peers. On the other hand, the Poco X7 Pro steps things up with a slightly larger 6.73-inch flat AMOLED display. It also has a 1.5K resolution while offering an impressive peak brightness of 3,200 nits. Of course, the phone’s display — or, for that matter, X7’s display as well — does become a bit reflective under the harsh sun, but, rest assured, I didn’t face any major problems regarding legibility even on the brightest of days. Like the X7, it supports HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, so compatible content on platforms like Netflix and YouTube looks sharp and detailed.  Audio is another part of the multimedia experience, and the stereo speakers on both phones complement the displays well. They deliver loud and clear sound, even at high volumes, which is solid for binge-watching or gaming without headphones.
 


 Now, the main choice lies between curved and flat displays, which is often subjective. For me, the flat panel on the Poco X7 Pro wins. It’s not about the phone’s price tag — I just find flat displays more practical. They’re easier to use, especially when it comes to avoiding accidental touches, especially while gaming. Granted, the curved edges on the X7 look premium, no doubt, but they can feel fragile and might not be everyone’s cup of tea. Overall, the displays on both the X7 and X7 Pro are excellent, each catering to slightly different preferences. If you want something that feels premium and modern, the curved screen on the X7 will impress. But if you’re like me and prefer practicality and usability over aesthetics, the flat panel on the X7 Pro is hard to beat. Again, it’s not just a better display because the phone costs more — it’s better because it’s simply more versatile and easier to live with.Performance: X7 Pro takes the lead, but X7 can also hold its own When it comes to performance, the Poco X7 Pro clearly takes the lead, and again, it’s not just because it’s the more expensive model. Packed with a 4nm MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra processor, Mali-G720 MC6 GPU, and up to 12GB LPDDR5X RAM, this phone is a powerhouse. I mean, beyond the raw hardware, this phone is truly great for its price when it comes to performance. Whether you’re juggling between apps, gaming, video-calling or recording 4K videos, the X7 Pro handles everything smoothly without breaking a sweat. The addition of a massive cooling system, a 3D IceLoop system, and Liquid Cool Technology 4.0 ensures the device stays cool even during heavy usage. Marketing jargon aside, just know that the X7 Pro is a great choice for gamers and power users who demand top-tier performance without lag.  On the other hand, the Poco X7, while not as powerful, still holds its own for everyday tasks. It’s powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra chipset paired with 8GB LPDDR4X RAM, which is good enough for streaming, browsing, and social media. However, it struggles a bit with demanding games like COD: Mobile and BGMI, showing occasional frame drops and slight touch response delays. That said, it manages heat well during gaming, staying cooler than many competitors in its range. For casual users, the X7 is a decent pick, but gamers, you know which phone you have to choose.  As for software, both phones run on Xiaomi’s HyperOS, but the X7 Pro comes with Android 15, while the X7 boots Android 14. The X7 Pro is promised three years of Android updates (up to Android 18), while the X7 gets three years of updates starting from Android 14, which feels a bit limiting, considering both phones are new then why does the standard ship with older software out-of-the-box? Otherwise, both devices come with pre-loaded apps, but thankfully, you can uninstall most of them to free up space.Sleek phones with big batteries Now, let’s talk about battery life. Obviously, the Poco X7 Pro shines here with its massive 6,550mAh Silicon carbon battery. I have been talking about this in many of my articles and videos, but still, for the unaware — this new battery tech can store more power on a single charge and last longer than traditional Li-ion batteries. With normal usage, the X7 Pro easily lasts a day and a half, and even heavy binge-watching won’t drain it before bedtime. The 90W fast charger (included in the box) juices up the phone from 0 to 50 per cent in just 30 minutes and fully charges it in a little over an hour.  The Poco X7, while not as impressive, still offers solid battery performance. Its 5,500mAh battery lasts a full day with moderate use. The 45W (charger included in the box) fast charging is decent. It takes about 50 minutes to go from 20 per cent to 100 per cent, but it’s a step-down from the 67W charging seen in the Poco X6.Cameras: On par with the competition  The Poco X7 Pro and X7 share a similar camera setup on paper, but their performance shows noticeable differences. Both phones feature a 50-megapixel Sony LYT 600 primary sensor with OIS and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, along with a 20-megapixel front camera for selfies. However, the X7 Pro’s camera tuning and capabilities give it a slight edge in certain areas. For what it’s worth, the X7 also gets a third 2-megapixel macro sensor at the rear.   Starting with daylight photography, both phones capture detailed and sharp images with decent colour accuracy. The X7 Pro, however, tends to boost colours a bit more, which can make photos look vibrant but sometimes unnatural. For instance, skies may appear more saturated than they actually are. On the other hand, the X7 does a better job with colour correction, without going overboard. HDR performance is also pretty decent on both phones, but the X7 Pro pulls ahead slightly in dynamic range and finer details. When it comes to portraits, the X7 Pro offers better edge detection in photos, thus capturing clean, well-defined subjects. However, it tends to smoothen facial details, giving selfies and portraits an artificial look. The X7, while not as strong in edge detection, delivers more natural skin tones and better colour accuracy in portraits. Both phones struggle with bokeh quality, but the X7 Pro’s colour tone can be more appealing to some users. In low-light conditions, the X7 Pro performs better, thanks to its superior HDR retention and ability to capture more details without over-smoothing. Its night mode produces balanced images with well-managed exposure, though colours can still appear slightly off. The X7, while decent in low light, tends to produce softer images with noticeable noise, even with night mode enabled. The X7 Pro’s low-light shots are sharper and more detailed. Selfies on both phones are a mixed bag. The X7 Pro smoothens facial details, which can make selfies look artificial, while the X7 maintains some level of detail but brightens skin tones unnaturally. In daylight, both phones take good-looking selfies. However, in low light, the X7 Pro’s selfies are slightly better, with less noise and better clarity. Click on any photo below to access camera samples of both the Poco X7 and X7 Pro.  Overall, the Poco X7 Pro’s camera is a step ahead, especially in low light and portrait edge detection. However, the X7 holds its own with more natural colours and better skin tones in portraits. If you’re looking for a phone with a camera that performs well in most scenarios, the X7 Pro is the better choice. But if you prefer a more balanced and natural look, the X7 is a solid option, especially for its price.Poco X7 series: Final verdict After spending a good amount of time with both the Poco X7 and X7 Pro, here’s the deal: if you’re looking for a phone that punches way above its weight, the Poco X7 Pro is the one to go for. It’s not just a slight upgrade over the X7 — it’s a proper powerhouse. From its top-tier performance and gorgeous flat display to that massive 6,550mAh battery and 90W charging, it’s a phone that feels like it should cost way more than it does. Gamers, power users, or anyone who wants a premium experience without breaking the bank? This is your phone.
 


 That said, the Poco X7 is no slouch either. It’s a solid mid-range smartphone in its own right. It has a beautiful curved display, decent performance, and a camera that holds its own in good lighting. If you’re a casual user who streams, scrolls, and occasionally uses the camera, the X7 will serve you well. Plus, it’s lighter on the wallet, which is always a win. But let’s be real — if you can stretch your budget a bit, the X7 Pro is worth the extra cash. It’s just that much better. So, who should buy what? If you’re on a tight budget and don’t need the extra oomph in performance, the Poco X7 is a great pick. But if you want the best bang for your buck and don’t mind spending a little more, the X7 Pro is the clear winner. It’s not just the better phone in this series — it’s one of the best value-for-money phones out there right now.

ed2c6b84-fcb5-43da-97a7-c78291ddc19a,Google is suddenly fine with using AI for weapons and surveillanceGoogle has quietly updated its AI guidelines dropping its pledge to not use the tech for weapons or surveillance.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-is-suddenly-fine-with-using-ai-for-weapons-and-surveillance-2675034-2025-02-05,"Google has suddenly revised its ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence (AI), removing the explicit ban on using the technology for weapons and surveillance. The update came on Tuesday via a blogpost shared by the company on the 2024 report on “Responsible AI”. This was first spotted by The Washington Post via the archived versions of the guidelines. The change in policy marks a critical shift from Google’s previous pledge to limit AI applications that could cause harm. The company had earlier committed that it will not use AI for applications that are “likely to cause overall harm”.  Google’s AI principles, which were first published in 2018, pledged against using the technology in four areas: 
-weapons
-surveillance
-applications likely to cause overall harm,
-uses violating international law and human rights.  However, with the update to the AI guidelines, these restrictions have quietly been eliminated.  Meanwhile, Google’s head of AI, Demis Hassabis, and James Manyika, SVP for technology and society, wrote in the blogpost: “We are investing more than ever in both AI research and products that benefit people and society, and in AI safety and efforts to identify and address potential risks”. “There’s a global competition for AI leadership within an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. We believe democracies should lead in AI development, guided by core values like freedom, equality, and respect for human rights,” the post further reads –– which also sounds like Google trying to convince the reader that lifting the ban on using AI for weapons and surveillance has only been done with the greater good in mind.  When Google first announced its AI principles in 2018, it was after a huge protest by Google employees against a then-ongoing Project Maven. It was a Pentagon contract that needed to use AI for drone surveillance. However, Google employees were opposed to using the tech they built for surveillance, so after pressure from the workers, Google was forced to withdraw from the project. Now, the change in policy, however, shows a renewed willingness to use AI for surveillance, once again.  Google isn’t the only company that is working with AI and is open to providing its tech to the local government. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are also deeply involved with the US defence authorities. This change also makes the increased collaboration between tech companies and national security agencies quite evident.  Just last week, after the US President Donald Trump said that he wanted to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, Google quietly agreed without any protest, and said that it has a policy to do so. As long as the change in name is reflected in official records in the US, it can make that change for Google Maps users in the US.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Also read |  Donald Trump wants Gulf of Mexico to be renamed to Gulf of America, Google quickly agrees to make the changeAlso read |  Donald Trump signs order to create sovereign wealth fund, says it could help facilitate TikTok US saleAlso read |  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman once again hints that he wants to make an AI device

253fde88-a32f-4301-933f-a7d898162d4f,"China targets Google, Nvidia and Intel as trade tensions escalateChina also announced 10 per cent tariffs on imports of US farm equipment that could impact firms. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/china-targets-google-nvidia-and-intel-as-trade-tensions-escalate-2675049-2025-02-05,"China announced a wide range of measures on Tuesday targeting US businesses including Google, farm equipment makers and the owner of fashion brand Calvin Klein, minutes after new US tariffs on Chinese goods took effect.  Beijing also slapped tariffs on US products such as coal, oil and some autos in a rapid response to the new duties on Chinese goods imposed by US President Donald Trump, escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Google was suspected of violating the country's anti-monopoly law and an investigation was initiated in accordance with the law. It did not provide further details on the investigation or on what it alleged Google had done to breach the law. Google products such as its search engine are blocked in China and its revenue from there is about 1 per cent of global sales. It still works with Chinese partners such as advertisers. In 2017, Google announced the launch of a small artificial intelligence centre in China. But the project was disbanded two years later and the firm does not conduct AI research in China, according to a blog posting.  Separately, China's Commerce Ministry said it had put PVH Corp, the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and US biotechnology firm Illumina ILMN.O on its ""unreliable entity"" list. It said the two companies took what it called ""discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises"" and ""damaged"" the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. Companies added to the blacklist can be subject to fines and a broad range of other sanctions, including a freeze on trade and revocation of work permits for foreign staff. While Google declined to comment, PVH said it was ""surprised and deeply disappointed"" by the ministry's decision, saying that the company maintains ""strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and operates in line with established industry standards and practices."" PVH added it would continue engagement with relevant authorities and look forward to a positive resolution.  Illumina did not respond to a request for comment. Shares of both PVH and Illumina were down nearly 4 per cent each in premarket US trading, while Google-parent Alphabet rose 1 per cent.  PVH had already been under scrutiny from Chinese regulators over ""improper"" conduct related to the Xinjiang region. ""These moves are warnings that China intends to harm US interests if need be, but still give China the option to back down,"" Capital Economics said in a note. ""The tariffs could be postponed or cancelled before they come into effect... The probe against Google could conclude without any penalties.""Tesla and Farm Equipment firms  China also announced 10 per cent tariffs on imports of US farm equipment that could impact firms such as Caterpillar, Deere & Co DE.Nand AGCO AGCO.N, as well as a small number of trucks and big-engine sedans shipped to China from the United States. That could apply to Elon Musk's Cybertruck, a niche offering Tesla has been promoting in China, as it awaits regulatory clearance to begin sales. China's Ministry of Industry and Information technology designated the Cybertruck as a ""passenger car"" in a posting in December that was quickly deleted. If the Cybertruck was designated as an electric truck, Tesla would face a 10 per cent tariff on any future imports from its factory in Texas. Tesla had no immediate comment.  The new tariffs on US products will start on February 10, the ministry said. The announcements made on Tuesday ramped up trade restrictions between Beijing and Washington that had been largely limited to the tech sector under the administration of former US President Joe Biden, which sought to restrict China's access to high-end semiconductors.  China said in December it had launched an investigation into Nvidia NVDA.O over a suspected violation of the country's anti-monopoly law, a probe widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washington's latest curbs on the Chinese chip sector. Intel's INTC.O products sold in China were also called for a security review late last year by an influential Chinese industry group.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Tune InMust Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-may-witness-a-price-hike-new-leak-suggests-2675115-2025-02-05,"Apple is planning to release its next-gen iPhone SE this year, after 2 years. In 2025, the company is expected to bring several improvements over its predecessor, the iPhone SE 3 (launched in 2022). For instance, the upcoming phone is rumoured to come with a big display and design change. While the design will continue to feature a single camera shooter, the display may come as 6.06- inch. This is not the only change we may encounter. According to the latest leak, Bloomberg’s Mark Zuckerberg has shared that the iPhone SE 4 may witness a price hike. advertisementiPhone SE 4: Price leak The iPhone SE 4 is expected to see a price increase compared to its 2022 predecessor, which was priced at $429 (approximately Rs 37,000). According to Mark Gurman, the price could rise to around $500 (over Rs 43,000), though this may vary depending on manufacturing location and applicable taxes.This aligns with earlier leaks, adding credibility to the speculation. A report from Korean outlet Naver, citing an unnamed Japanese carrier, suggests the iPhone SE 4 will likely be priced at $500 (around Rs 42,700) or lower, consistent with previous rumours about a $499 price point.

A report from Korean outlet Naver, citing an unnamed Japanese carrier, suggests the iPhone SE 4 will likely be priced at $500 (around Rs 42,700) or lower, consistent with previous rumours about a $499 price point. For reference, the iPhone SE 3 was launched in India in 2022 at a starting price of Rs 43,900, while its US price was $429 (approximately Rs 36,700). If Apple follows the same pricing strategy for the iPhone SE 4 (or iPhone 16e), the Indian price could increase to around Rs 49,900.iPhone SE 4: What to expect  The iPhone SE 4, also rumoured to be called the iPhone 16e, is set to bring significant upgrades, marking a departure from its predecessors. Moving away from the iPhone 8-inspired design, the new model is expected to adopt a look similar to the iPhone 14, offering a more modern and immersive experience. The device will feature a 6.06-inch OLED display, replacing the 4.7-inch LCD, delivering superior visual quality akin to Apple’s high-end models. A major design change includes the transition from the Touch ID home button to Face ID, resulting in slimmer bezels and a more contemporary appearance. The iPhone 16e will reportedly share the same screen size and edge-to-edge design as the standard iPhone 16, creating a cohesive aesthetic across Apple’s lineup. Performance-wise, the iPhone 16e is rumoured to be powered by Apple’s A18 chipset, paired with an upgraded 8GB of RAM (up from 4GB). This boost in hardware will improve multitasking and handle resource-intensive applications, including Apple’s latest advancements in AI and machine learning. With 128GB of storage as standard, the device promises an enhanced user experience while remaining affordable. In terms of photography, the iPhone 16e is expected to feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, a significant upgrade for Apple’s budget-friendly lineup. The advanced ""Fusion"" lens will enable high-quality standard shots and 2x zoom without sacrificing detail, delivering sharper and more versatile photos for users upgrading from older SE models. As a powerful yet cost-effective option, the iPhone SE 4/16e is positioned to offer premium features in a compact, budget-friendly package, bridging the gap between entry-level and flagship Apple devices.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Must Watch

Here's what to expect from the company's next-generation foldables.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-rumoured-to-get-major-upgrades-2675096-2025-02-05,"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 are expected to launch this summer — probably in August — and leaks are already revealing some key details. Both foldables are said to have made big improvements over their predecessors, including upgrades to the camera and the performance. According to Anthony on X (formerly Twitter), one of the main updates seems to be in the heat management department. Both devices — Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 — are reportedly getting larger vapour chamber cooling systems to help with heat dissipation. In addition, a smoother and more durable hinge is also in the works, which could help prevent the wear and tear that older models might experience over time.

 For those who are particularly picky about their displays, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 seems to have a notable improvement in the crease department. While it’s unlikely to completely disappear, sources suggest the foldable's display crease will become much smaller, resulting in a more seamless viewing experience. Meanwhile, the Flip 7 will retain its 2,600 nits peak brightness, the same as the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Another area where the devices will see upgrades is in the sound department. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to get new speakers. However, there is no mention yet of similar improvements to the Flip 7’s speakers, so it remains to be seen if that will be the case. The camera system of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is also said to get a massive upgrade. According to rumours, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will feature a 200-megapixel main camera, which is in line with what we have come to see on Galaxy Ultra models. It seems that Samsung is taking notes from its previous Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition (sold in select Asian regions) model, which had a larger display and a higher resolution camera. However, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still expected to have 12GB RAM, instead of the Special Edition’s 16GB. In terms of performance, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will likely feature Samsung’s Exynos 2500 chip, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. This is in line with what we've seen in previous leaks, which suggest that the Fold 7 will feature faster processing power and improved overall performance compared to its predecessor. Both foldables are expected to launch with One UI 7.1, though there’s some uncertainty about whether this will be based on Android 15 or Android 16. This is due to the early release of Android 16, which could come out before the devices officially arrive. Pricing is expected to stay the same as their predecessors.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  DeepSeek AI: What is it, how it works and is it better than ChatGPT?

The feature is available globally.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-on-whatsapp-can-now-see-your-images-and-listen-to-your-voice-messages-2675092-2025-02-05,"ChatGPT on WhatsApp has received a new update. It can now analyse images and listen to your voice messages. OpenAI launched the ChatGPT’s chatbot number for Meta’s instant messaging app in December 2024. During the launch, this chatbot allowed users to access ChatGPT and ask queries using text only. However, the chatbot on WhatsApp can now answer users’ queries made through images and voice messages or audio files. The new update for the ChatGPT chatbot on WhatsApp is available globally and was first spotted by Android Authority. According to the report, the update allows the AI chatbot on WhatsApp to read images and audio files shared by users and respond based on the queries. However, the chatbot will only reply in text messages.How to use ChatGPT on WhatsApp To use ChatGPT on WhatsApp and interact with the AI chatbot using text, images, or audio files, follow these steps: – Save the official ChatGPT chatbot number +1-800-242-8478 on your phone. –After saving the number, relaunch your WhatsApp app. – Go to your contacts and search for the saved ChatGPT number on WhatsApp. – Open the chat and start your conversation. – You can chat with the ChatGPT chatbot via text, share an image to ask questions about it, or even send voice messages. Interestingly, we even tried speaking in Hindi and asked ChatGPT to transcribe the voice message. It responded accurately in Hindi. For images, it analyzed the details and suggested more related information when prompted. For example, we asked it to detect what was in a picture, and it scanned the image and provided detailed information about the subject.  However, since the update is in its initial stages, the chatbot feels somewhat laggy. For instance, when we switched conversations, it replied to the new query but then automatically shared more details from the previous conversation. It seems like it struggles to differentiate between new and old conversations. That said, the chatbot is still simple to use, quickly scans content, and responds accurately to queries made via text, images or voice messages.  Meanwhile, the text and voice update is not the only improvement OpenAI is planning for its ChatGPT chatbot on WhatsApp. According to Android Authority, OpenAI is planning to soon allow WhatsApp users to sign into their dedicated ChatGPT accounts through WhatsApp. If true, this will make it easier for users to continue conversations and sync data from the ChatGPT app. However, it’s unclear if additional features will be introduced with this update. In other news, OpenAI recently added the ‘Deep Research’ mode to ChatGPT. This new feature allows users to initiate multi-step research on the web for more complex tasks. “Whether it's a comprehensive competitive analysis or a personalized report on the best commuter bike that meets your specific requirements, you can attach images, files, or spreadsheets to add context to your question,” says OpenAI. Notably, Deep Research is the second AI agent introduced by OpenAI following the earlier launch of Operator AI, which can go on the web and perform browser-related tasks without human intervention. According to OpenAI, the new AI agent works “using its own browser, it can look at a webpage and interact with it by typing, clicking, and scrolling.”Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Also Read |  Indian Railways launches SwaRail app: What it is, how to use and everything you need to knowAlso Read |  iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Here is how Apple may replace the Plus variant for slimmer iPhoneAlso Read |  Salesforce set to cut 1000 roles, impacted employees may have option to reapply internally

In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), Goyal announced this AI-focused job role, asking interested individuals to apply by sending an email with the subject line: ""I have a second brain."" While the details of the job role remain under wraps, the quirky requirement has garnered a lot of attention. In response to his latest post, many social media users have lauded the concept of a ""second brain,"" referring to the growing role AI plays in today’s professional environment. One user commented that AI can improve decision-making, automate tasks, and open new opportunities for professionals. Goyal responded to such comments, revealing that AI has boosted his own productivity, and he believes this technology is becoming indispensable in leadership roles. This new job posting follows a similar trend from Goyal, who has previously used social media platforms to advertise key roles at Zomato. Notably, Goyal’s prior listing for a Chief of Staff position sparked widespread debate due to its unconventional conditions — requiring candidates to pay Rs 20 lakh upfront and offering no salary for the first year. The controversial move led to mixed reactions online, with some questioning the fairness of the terms, while others praised the innovative approach. For this role, Zomato attracted over 18,000 applicants. Of these, 150 were interviewed, and 30 candidates received offers. Goyal also confirmed that 18 individuals have already joined Zomato and its group companies, including Blinkit, taking on high-impact roles. Although the salary for these roles was not officially disclosed, there were indications that it could reach up to Rs 50 lakh annually, based on the official job postings. As for the current AI job offer, Goyal hasn’t shared specific details on what the role entails or the salary structure. However, given the focus on AI and Zomato’s history of offering competitive packages for important positions, it’s expected that the compensation will be good for the right candidate.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 5, 2025

Speaking at an event attended by Union Minister for Railways and Electronics & IT, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Altman highlighted India's growing role in AI and revealed that it is OpenAI’s second-largest market globally.   His latest comments stand in contrast to his 2023 comments, where he had called India's chances of building competitive AI models ""totally hopeless."" At the time, he was responding to a question about whether a small team with a limited budget of $10 million could create a strong AI foundation model. Now, he has clarified that his earlier statement was taken out of context, saying that AI models are still expensive to train but are becoming more feasible, and India should take a leadership role in this space.   Altman’s change in perspective likely comes as India prepares to introduce its own AI model in the coming months. Minister Vaishnaw recently announced that the country is working on an indigenous AI model designed to be safe, secure, and cost-effective. The initiative is part of the larger IndiaAI mission, which aims to develop AI solutions suited for India’s specific needs, including support for multiple Indian languages.   The government has already set up a high-end computing infrastructure to support AI development. The project is starting with 10,000 GPUs, with an additional 8,693 GPUs to be added soon. This will provide affordable access to AI computing power for researchers, developers, and students. While using global AI models can cost between $2.5 and $3 per hour, India’s AI computing resources will be available for less than Rs 100 per hour after a 40 per cent government subsidy.   Altman, who recently announced OpenAI’s massive $500 billion ‘Stargate’ AI infrastructure project in the US, acknowledged that while AI development is costly, it offers a big long-term economic value. He said AI model training will continue to be expensive, but it is no longer out of reach for countries like India.   Vaishnaw, meanwhile, compared India’s AI ambitions to its achievements in space technology, such as the Chandrayaan mission. He asserted that just as India made remarkable progress in space exploration, it could achieve similar success in AI development. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 5, 2025

The victim was threatened with a legal case and asked to pay money to save himself and his family.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/retired-govt-employee-loses-rs-35-lakh-after-call-from-fake-anti-corruption-bureau-officer-2675124-2025-02-05,"India is currently battling with the growing menace of cyber frauds. Each day, we are witnessing new cases where victims share their ordeal of losing money. While initially these cases felt a bit harmless—at least in terms that only financial damage was done—lately, scammers are even harassing the targeted individuals and extorting money from them by posing as CBI or other high-ranking officials. In the latest case, a retired government official from Vijayawada ended up losing Rs 35 lakh after getting calls from individuals posing as officials from the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). According to the case reported by the Times of India, the victim is a retired Mandal Educational Officer (MEO) from Kottapeta. His ordeal started when he received a phone call from individuals claiming to be ACB officers. The callers falsely alleged that legal cases had been registered against his wife and two sons. When the victim sought more details, the fraudsters refused to share any, claiming the information was confidential and would only be disclosed after the case was officially registered. To appear convincing, the scammers even made a video call, adding to the victim’s fear and confusion. As the victim asked for more details around the case and ways to come out clean from the charges, the scammers initially demanded Rs 1 lakh to supposedly prevent legal action. When the victim informed the scammers that he couldn’t arrange that amount immediately, the scammers abruptly ended the call. This made the victim panic, and he dialed the scammers back, agreeing to meet their demands and send money. Fearing for his family’s safety, the victim reportedly transferred Rs 50,000 to the bank account provided by the fraudsters. After receiving the first payment, the scammers did not stop and started escalating their threats. They even warned the victim that the case was severe enough to warrant the seizure of his properties. And to help him with the case, the scammers then demanded Rs 50 lakh, leaving the victim overwhelmed with anxiety. Desperate to protect his family, he agreed to transfer the money in smaller installments over the next ten days. To meet the demands, the victim even contacted his son. He borrowed Rs 2 lakh from his son to meet their demands, eventually sending a total of Rs 35 lakh through multiple transactions. It was when the son questioned his father—given that the father never asked for large sums and the sudden reason for needing money—that the victim shared the details. Upon learning about the case, the son rushed and filed a complaint with the local police. A case has been registered under relevant cybercrime laws, and an investigation is currently underway to trace the fraudsters. While the case seems to be a new trick of fraudsters to threaten people and extort money, the trick is similar to the ongoing fake parcel scam where scammers call people about an illegal parcel detained in their name. Later, in the name of removing legal action, they demand money. In these cases, they even ask the victim to be under ""digital arrest"" and not to share anything with anyone. To stay safe from such scams, remember that no official body will threaten you about serious cases on call and demand money. If you get such calls, hang up and report them to the cyber cell. If you have doubts, you can go to the nearest police station to get more details. Most importantly, never share any sensitive information online, including OTPs, banking details, and more. Remember that vigilance is the only safety measure that can save you from growing cyber frauds.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Also Read |  ChatGPT on WhatsApp can now see your images and listen to your voice messagesAlso Read |  Indian Railways launches SwaRail app: What it is, how to use and everything you need to knowAlso Read |  iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Here is how Apple may replace the Plus variant for slimmer iPhone

0684c28f-f616-4baf-8fcc-a7b85d762976,"Apple Invites app for iPhones is cool and an organised way to plan a partyApple has launched a new app called Invites for iPhones. If you are a social butterfly, and you are already a part of the Apple ecosystem, you are going to love it. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/apple-invites-app-for-iphones-is-cool-and-an-organised-way-to-plan-events-2675125-2025-02-05,"We’ve been hearing about Apple working on an invitation app for a few days now. Honestly, it didn’t catch my attention at first — I assumed it would just be another app for sending event reminders. But when Apple officially launched and rolled out the app last night, I downloaded it to confirm my assumptions. I was pleasantly surprised. The app is intuitive, fun, and a cool way to create invites. If you search for Apple Invites on the App Store, you will see that the app is available to download for free. The app weighs about 58MB, and it is available in Hindi, English and 31 other languages. Just make sure that you check that Apple is listed as the app developer, just in case some dupe Invites apps also show up on the App Store.  Apple Invites is currently only available on iOS, but it lets iPhone users share the invite with both iOS and Android users.  Now, to the fun part –– using Apple Invites.  Once you have downloaded the app, you don’t require any logins. If you are looking to create an invitation, the app pretty much takes you through the process itself. So I am not going to delve much into that. But what I want to talk about is the level of customisation that the app offers. Apple Invites not only lets you add a background –– you can choose between some Apple backgrounds or use your own pictures from the Photos app –– add an event title, date, time and location, but what I thought was cool is that you can create a shared album for an event, so that everyone you invite to an event, can post their images all in one place. You don’t have to go around asking people for pictures later on.  (If you organise events or parties often, you know how hard it is to find time to click pictures. After the party, you’re usually left chasing people to share photos — and they take forever to do it. It’s always a hassle. I got married three months ago, and my friends still haven’t shared all the pictures they took at my wedding.) The Invites app also lets you create a playlist or use an existing one to attach to the invite. The playlist can be like a little feeler you put out before the party. Ahead of the event, people understand exactly the vibe you are going for. 

 



Getting started on the app is easy and does not require any log-ins
Tiny little thoughtful features in the app Additionally, just how reminders work, you can choose if you want the invite reminder to be an all-day thing, or if you want to set an end-time to it. You can also pick a start and end date and time for the event reminder.  There are other little customisations as well. You can choose from four different typefaces. You can preview the invite before sending it out, so you know what the final look of the invite will be like.

 



You have a bunch of little customisation options on the app
Works for both iOS and Android users You can share the invite via Messages (to both Android and iOS users) or Email. Or you can simply copy the link and share it with whoever you want, on whichever platform. Android users will be able to access the invite via a web version of the app on iCloud. Another feature on the app that will really help you in organising an event better is an option to Approve Guests, so that you can send out a public link for guests to RSVP. When they respond to the invite by tapping on “Going”, they will appear in your guest list in the app. You can create multiple invites on the app at one time. You can see them all on the main screen of the app. You can see your upcoming events, past events, drafts of invites that you have saved, the events that you are hosting, and also the events that you are attending.  Also, once you have created an invitation and sent it out, you can also send notes to all the invitees. You can also send a separate calendar invite of the event to your guests. After creating an invitation, you can always go back and edit the details. And if you are really proud of an invitation you created, you can also duplicate it, so that you can just make some changes and re-use the same thing again.  I love the amount of detailing in the app. It also lets you pick additional guests, which is basically giving invitees to get +1s. You can choose to allow up to +5 guests per invite.  

 



Here is how the Invites link looks like on an Android phone
advertisementWhy is it an app we didn’t know we needed?Until now, the easiest way to do all this –– create invites, create a shared album, have a pre-party playlist, get RSVPs, etc –– was to create a WhatsApp group and just dump all that information in one place. That way is inconvenient, but we have all been doing that for years with/without cribbing. And if I am being very honest, I also didn’t think there could be a better alternative. Until last night, I didn’t even know I needed an app like Invites, and now I can’t stop thinking about how, if Apple had launched this app a few months earlier, I could have used it for my wedding invites. That said, there are some limitations to the app. The app works perfectly if you are completely part of the Apple ecosystem, and so are all the people around you. It would be rare that that would be the case. So, when you share the invite with Android users, you are able to share the link to the invite as usual, and they can view the basic date, time, background image of the invite as well. However, to respond to the invite or to join the event, they will need to create an Apple account. advertisementTo be fair, iOS users also need to log in to the same iCloud Invite web app if they don’t have the Apple Invites app on their device. But all Apple users would have an Apple account, so it’s much less of a hassle for them. Overall, I think Apple Invites as a stand-up app. It is intuitive and makes creating invites very easy. If you are an iOS user, I totally recommend you use it for the next big or small event that you are hosting.

Representatives for India's finance ministry, ChatGPT-parent OpenAI and DeepSeek did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Three finance ministry officials said the note was genuine and the note was issued internally this week. Reuters could not immediately confirm whether similar directives have been issued for other Indian ministries. OpenAI is facing heat in India due to a high-profile copyright infringement battle with the country's top media houses, and has said in court filings that it does not have its servers in the country and Indian courts should not hear the matter.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Also Read |  Retired govt employee loses Rs 35 lakh after call from fake anti-corruption bureau officerAlso Read |  ChatGPT on WhatsApp can now see your images and listen to your voice messagesAlso Read |  Indian Railways launches SwaRail app: What it is, how to use and everything you need to know

Here is why these countries blocked this Chinese AI platform.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/3-countries-have-already-banned-deepseek-ai-here-is-why-2675299-2025-02-05,"DeepSeek AI, a rapidly growing Chinese artificial intelligence startup, has come under scrutiny as three countries — Australia, Italy, and Taiwan — have taken measures to ban its services. Here is why these countries blocked DeepSeek AI, which is more popular in comparison to OpenAI's ChatGPT.  Australia recently made headlines by becoming one of the first countries to ban DeepSeek AI from all government systems and devices, according to a report by Bloomberg. The country’s Home Affairs Minister, Tony Burke, announced the decision, highlighting that a national intelligence assessment found the AI platform to pose an unacceptable security risk. Effective immediately, all DeepSeek products and services will be removed from Australian government infrastructure.  While this ban does not apply to personal devices, Burke urged Australians to be cautious about their online data usage and to protect their digital privacy. DeepSeek, which was founded just 20 months ago in China, gained massive attention earlier this year with the launch of its AI chatbot app. It claims to simulate human-like reasoning. The app's popularity skyrocketed quickly, but concerns about data security also emerged soon. The platform’s privacy policy states that all user data is stored in servers located in China, raising fears that the information could be accessed by Chinese authorities under local laws that mandate data sharing with intelligence agencies. Italy followed suit, with its privacy regulator ordering a block on DeepSeek’s services to protect consumer data. The Italian government’s decision came amid increasing concerns about how the app collects and handles personal information. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has also requested more details from DeepSeek, seeking clarity on its data protection policies. In Taiwan, the government has taken a strict stance, banning DeepSeek AI from use across all public sector organisations. Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs expressed concerns about the risk of cross-border data transmission and information leaks. The ban extends to public schools, state-owned enterprises, and critical infrastructure. In addition to government actions, private companies have also begun distancing themselves from DeepSeek. In the US, several federal agencies have instructed employees not to use the app, while hundreds of companies have reportedly requested cybersecurity firms to block access to the platform.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 5, 2025

This restructure comes on the heels of scheduled job cuts next week, which will apparently target low performers in the organisation. According to a report by The Information, in this shake-up in the organisation, Messenger chief Loredana Crisan will move to Meta's generative AI (genAI) team, while Tom Allison, who is currently heading Facebook, will reportedly oversee some additional responsibilities in the Messenger team. As per the report, the restructuring isn’t just taking place in the Facebook and Messenger teams, but also at Meta’s generative AI team. The Information reports that the lead engineers at Meta’s genAI department, which includes Ryan Cairns and Ning Li will also be assigned new roles in Meta. It seems like the reshuffle is aimed at reiterating the company’s AI-first focus.  The news about the internal reshuffle comes just weeks after an internal memo from the company’s Director of People Development Growth Programmes revealed Meta’s plans to achieve 10 per cent non-regrettable attrition by the end of this fiscal year. For the uninitiated, non-regrettable attrition basically refers to employees in the company who Meta thinks can be fired without any negative impact on the company’s objective or overall performance.  According to the purported memo, Meta employees with low assessment ratings –– which includes both those who did not meet expectations and the ones who met some expectations –– will be laid off. In fact, according to the report, even some employees who are rated to have met most of the expectations may also face job cuts.  The news of the restructuring and job cuts comes after the company laid off 5 per cent of its workforce last year. In 2025, Meta is expected to make another 5 per cent job cuts.  If you noticed in the news article that while reports suggest that Meta plans to lay off another 5 per cent of its employees this year, the top executives are only being reassigned to new responsibilities. This could possibly be because of what Meta CEO Mark Zuckeberg recently said. ""We have really ambitious goals, so we need to manage our workforce in a way that ensures we have the strongest talent working here and can move faster in managing our low performers,"" he said. The layoffs and reshuffle are part of Meta’s strategy to boost efficiency within the organisation, which, as per the company’s recent announcements, also includes pulling back on diversity and inclusivity initiatives. In an effort to increase organisational efficiency, Meta recently also announced that it is pausing its third-party fact-checking programme.  Silver lining: Meta says it will start re-hiring for the 10 per cent roles that will be eliminated in 2025, soon.

86fded1f-424e-4627-9488-36e59dbb9ac8,"MacBook users beware, new malware posing as Google Chrome update can steal your dataComputer virus and malware often pose as legitimate piece of code and regular apps to hoodwink their victims. The latest in the series is a malware called Ferret is stealing data from MacBook users. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/macbook-users-beware-new-malware-posing-as-google-chrome-update-can-steal-your-data-2675275-2025-02-05,"MacBook users beware — there is a new threat in town and it is called Ferret. Researchers at SentinelLabs have flagged a new malware targeting MacBook users. This new Malware family is named Ferret and is said to be linked to North Korean hackers and cyber criminals. The latest Ferret malware, which is basically an evolution of the existing one, poses as a Chrome software update file. With its code spoofed to look like legitimate Google Chrome code, the Ferret bypasses security apps and scanning.  Researchers hint that Ferret gains entry into a MacBook once a user is hoodwinked into downloading a piece of app. This often happens through fake job interviews or similar other online interactions. During the interaction the person giving the interview is asked to download a piece of code — for example a “Chrome update” or a “zoom update”. As soon as the code is downloaded, the latest version of Ferret is installed on the system and it can in the background collect and steal all user data.  Apple is apparently aware of the Ferret threat. Reports note that MacBooks come with Apple’s XProtect feature. This feature has been recently updated to deal with Ferret so if you have not run an update on your MacBook system software, this might be a good time to do so.  According to reports, the Ferret malware family was first detected in December. It was identified as part of the North Korean Contagious Interview campaign, in which cyber criminals and hackers lure people through fake job interviews and con them into installing the Ferret. How does malware affect MacOS systems?  Researchers explains that once the users install the malware into their system, the malware starts executing several malicious activities. This includes  1- Disguise itself as legitimate software: Researchers note that they have found this malware runs a harmful shell script to install persistent programs disguised as Google Chrome updateZoom-related services. These agents ensure that the malware runs every time the user starts the system.  2- Data theft: While running in the system, the malware collects sensitive data and then sends it out using Dropbox.Stay safe While the Ferret family is in news, it is not the only computer virus and malware out in the open. But one thing that is common to almost all such malicious apps is that they rely on a user mistake to get into the system. And this mistake is user installing something on their computer because someone manipulated them into doing it.  In other words, one of the best way to stay safe online is never to click on a link some stranger has sent you, or never to download something that someone wants to you download even during job interviews or during IT troubleshooting.

5e211a33-ced5-4e8f-8fdc-b464188df089,"OpenAI announces major rebrand: Unveils new logo, typeface and colour paletteOpenAI has finally unveiled its first major rebrand, with a similar but new logo, a new typeface, and colour palette. This change aims to create a more organic and more human brand identity, according to the company. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-announces-major-rebrand-unveils-new-logo-typeface-and-colour-palette-2675241-2025-02-05,"OpenAI has recently unveiled a comprehensive rebranding initiative, introducing a refreshed logo, a new custom typeface named OpenAI Sans, and an updated colour palette. The redesigned logo retains the essence of the previous design but features subtle enhancements, such as a slightly enlarged central space and more streamlined, fluid lines. This effort was spearheaded by OpenAI's internal design team, aiming to create a more ""organic and more human"" brand identity, according to the Wallpaper report.  The Wallpaper interviewed OpenAI designer Moeller, who explained all the changes in detail. He noted that this change is a part of a rebranding effort.Refreshed logo  Designed to balance geometric precision with a warm, approachable feel, the typeface is now featured in OpenAI’s official wordmark. Notably, the ""O"" in the logo has a perfectly round exterior, while its interior is intentionally imperfect, adding a subtle human touch to counteract an overly mechanical appearance.  At the heart of OpenAI’s new visual identity is “the point”, a black circle symbolising the cursor, the starting point of ChatGPT’s responses, and the foundation of the brand’s design language. This simple yet powerful motif shapes the letterforms, grid, and spacing throughout the identity. The report further explains how this point is the foundation. “It became an essential element, naturally emerging from the visual language of research papers, graphs, and diagrams,"" it stated. New typeface  The Wallpaper also spoke to another designer, Shannon Jager stated, ""OpenAI Sans is a love letter to typography."" For the new typeface, OpenAI partnered with ABC Dinamo with a vision to seamlessly integrate ‘the point’ into the letterforms. Through close collaboration, this vision took shape, culminating in the creation of OpenAI Sans.

 OpenAI is still working as it expands the typeface to include global scripts and a monospaced version, ultimately replacing the six or seven different typefaces previously used across its products. The designers say that this way OpenAI can create a more cohesive and unified typographic identity. 
 


Different colour palette The new visual identity is complemented by a refined colour palette, anchored in shades of grey and blue that evoke horizons, open skies, and vast spaces, enhanced by bold primary contrast colours for added depth and clarity, according to the report.  A key element of the rebrand is the Emotive Point, a pulsing disc set against a watercolour-inspired backdrop of swirling blue abstract forms. Designed as an interactive visual cue for AI engagement, Moeller explains that it is intentionally ""non-human"", devoid of any distinct features or emotions, reinforcing the AI’s neutrality. When asked whether AI-powered tools like ChatGPT played a role in the design process, Moeller clarified that the team only used AI to assist in calculating type weights. OpenAI’s designers emphasised that their approach blends human expertise with AI-driven insights, collaborating with top professionals in typography, photography, motion, and spatial design. By integrating AI tools like DALL·E, ChatGPT, and Sora as creative partners, OpenAI aims to craft a brand identity that is not just cutting-edge—but deeply human.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Also read |  Don't use AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, Indian Finance Ministry tells its employeesAlso read |  After calling India's AI efforts hopeless, Sam Altman now says India should be a leader in AIAlso read |  ChatGPT on WhatsApp can now see your images and listen to your voice messagesMust Watch

However, with a simple tweak in settings, you can restore lockscreen notification cards for a more familiar experience.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/cant-see-notifications-on-your-samsung-phone-anymore-here-is-how-to-get-them-back-2675225-2025-02-05,"Have you pre-ordered the spanking new Galaxy S25? Or did you recently upgrade to OneUI 7 on an eligible phone, such as the Galaxy S24? Did you notice something strange? Where I’m trying to get at here is that, as part of my job and the privilege of being a reviewer who gets to test new devices, I recently made the switch to the Samsung Galaxy S25 and instantly noticed something odd. After using it for a couple of days, I realised that while my phone’s notification drawer was full of notification cards, the phone’s lockscreen displayed none of them. In fact, the moment I first realised this, I thought I had encountered a bug in OneUI 7. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case. Over the years of using smartphones — whether Android or iOS — one thing that has remained constant is lockscreen notifications. The cards that appear on the lockscreen signal that an app has received a notification that needs to be checked, or you can swipe to ignore it. The point is, the notification cards tell us that something is there. However, for some reason, this basic functionality is disabled by default in OneUI 7. Fortunately, you can easily enable lockscreen notification cards by heading over to Settings, something I did in an instant after my sudden realisation. But what about the average consumer? They could easily think that something’s wrong with their phone. By default, if you receive a notification on a Samsung phone (probably the Galaxy S24, as the Galaxy S25 hasn’t yet started seeding to the public) running OneUI 7 — and if you miss the message tone or vibration — there’s a high chance you’ll miss the notification. I know I did. I also understand that while the app icons in the notification drawer (on the lockscreen) do signal that a notification has arrived, a basic notification card is, without a doubt, better. So, if you’ve also faced this issue where your notification cards aren’t appearing on your Samsung phone running OneUI 7, here’s how you can get them back. Just follow these steps:
Head to Settings, scroll down a bit and tap Notifications.
Tap the second option, Lock screen notifications.
From the three available options: Dot, Icons (the default one), and Cards, select the last one.
Also, make sure to select Hide Content below, so your phone’s lockscreen displays a notification card but not its content. This is especially useful when it comes to personal messages on WhatsApp.
 Well, that’s all. This simple yet strange — not exactly an — issue in OneUI 7, regarding the notification cards on the lockscreen, will be solved.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Also read |  iQOO 13 is available under Rs 40,000, but is it worth buying?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  DeepSeek AI: What is it, how it works and is it better than ChatGPT?

The tech giant has reportedly begun mass production of the M5 chip, with a South Korean media report suggesting that these new devices might arrive as early as late 2025. However, the MacBook Air M5 model could take a little longer than that to debut. Here is everything to know. The leak, originating from ET News, claims that Apple commenced the packaging process for the M5 chip last month, hinting that the company is well into the production phase. Packaging is one of the final steps in semiconductor manufacturing, following the fabrication of the chips. Taiwan's ASE Group has reportedly started mass production for the base model of the M5, with other manufacturers like Amkor and China's JCET expected to join soon. The M5 chip is said to be manufactured using TSMC’s advanced 3-nanometer technology, which offers notable improvements in efficiency and performance compared to previous chips. However, Apple has reportedly opted to skip the more advanced 2nm process for now, likely due to cost considerations. However, the high-end M5 Pro, M5 Max, and M5 Ultra chips are still expected to offer big performance boosts through innovative design technologies. But, how will this happen? It is being reported that the 3D chip-stacking process, also known as System on Integrated Chip (SoIC) technology, will allow Apple to improve thermal management and reduce power leakage in the higher versions of the M5 chip, a move aimed at boosting both battery life and performance. While the base model of the M5 is in production, the high-end variants will reportedly follow soon as Apple ramps up its production facilities. Interestingly, MacRumors suggests that the first device to be powered by the M5 chip might not be a MacBook at all, but rather a new iPad Pro, slated for release in late 2025 or early 2026. The MacBook Pro is expected to follow in late 2025, while the MacBook Air with M5 variants could debut by early 2026. There's also speculation about an upgraded version of Apple’s Vision Pro headset integrating the M5 chip, possibly launching in 2026. As of now, Apple has not officially confirmed these developments. But with mass production already underway, the company could be preparing for the next-gen Mac devices which will be powered by the M5 chip.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 5, 2025

While most of the love and attention is being garnered by the Galaxy S25 Ultra, we need to remember that two other phones have also been released alongside the Ultra model — the Galaxy S25+ and the vanilla Galaxy S25. Now, the standard Galaxy S25 is a one-of-a-kind phone in today’s day and age. If you’re looking for a top-tier compact flagship smartphone — with all due respect to the Xiaomi 14 — the only popular option out there is a Galaxy S device. Of course, you can always buy a standard iPhone, like the iPhone 15 or 16. But if you specifically want an Android flagship — again — Samsung’s vanilla Galaxy S is your best bet. Case in point, the recently released Galaxy S25 and its predecessor, the Galaxy S24. With both phones available at different price points, if you have to choose between the S24 and S25, which one should you go for? Should you save your cash and buy the Galaxy S24, or should you go all in and get the Galaxy S25? We try to help you make the decision.Galaxy S25 vs Galaxy S24: Price difference For the sake of keeping things equal, we are going to compare the 256GB storage options of both phones, since the Galaxy S25 is only available in 256GB and 512GB storage variants. Of course, people content with a 128GB storage phone can always buy it; the Galaxy S24 is available with that option. However, it’s high time that 256GB storage becomes the standard base storage in all high-end phones. And anyway, 128GB storage doesn’t cut it any more, as the need for more is always there. With that said, when it comes to price — the Galaxy S24 is currently listed at Rs 70,999 on Samsung’s official website, while the Galaxy S25 is listed at Rs 80,999. With an HDFC Bank card, you can get a flat Rs 10,000 instant discount, bringing the effective price of both phones down to Rs 60,999 and Rs 70,999, respectively. So, with a Rs 10,000 price difference between the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25, which one should you buy?Galaxy S25 vs Galaxy S24: What’s the Difference? The obvious reason for choosing the Galaxy S24 over the S25 is the price. If you don’t care about the latest and greatest and want to save some cash, go with the Galaxy S24 — you won’t be disappointed. But the question is — for the extra Rs 10,000, what does the Galaxy S25 bring to the table? Here are the upgrades. Subtle design changes Alright, this might not be a big change to justify the price difference, but probably the easiest way to tell apart the Galaxy S25 from the older model is the new available colours. The Navy and Icy Blue shades, especially the latter (which I have received as my review unit), look great. Apart from that, the Galaxy S25 sports blacked-out rear camera rings and slimmer bezels on the front, but that’s about it. The Galaxy S25 still has Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection, which is great, though Gorilla Armor 2 glass would’ve raised the bar. That said, the Galaxy S25 is now 7.2mm thick versus the S24’s 7.6mm thickness. While the 0.4mm difference might not seem like much, after experiencing both phones, I can say that the Galaxy S25 offers a much better grip over the already comfortable and ergonomic Galaxy S24. 12GB RAM as standard This should have been a long time coming, and it’s good that Samsung is finally offering 12GB RAM on its vanilla Galaxy S25. In fact, 12GB RAM is standard across the Galaxy S25 series. Now, the Galaxy S24 is only available in 8GB RAM options. The difference between 8GB RAM and 12GB RAM on a phone comes down to multitasking, gaming, and long-term performance. 8GB RAM is good for everyday use like social media, browsing, and casual gaming, but it may reload apps if too many run in the background. 12GB RAM handles heavy multitasking better, keeps more apps open, and improves gaming performance by reducing stutters and reloads. It also helps with smoother UI, faster camera processing, and future-proofing. If you use your phone casually, 8GB RAM is enough, but if you multitask a lot, game heavily, or want a phone that stays fast for years, 12GB RAM is a better choice. Snapdragon 8 Elite + larger vapour chamber cooling Probably the biggest upgrade on the Galaxy S25 is the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which is not only a giant leap over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 but an even bigger leap over the Exynos 2400, inside the Galaxy S24. Pair that with a 15 per cent bigger vapour chamber cooling system, and the Galaxy S25 becomes a performance monster. While I didn’t have any major issues during my time with the Galaxy S24 regarding overheating — apart from the fact that the phone got pretty hot when connected to Android Auto — those sorts of issues are sorted with the S25. Everything flies on this phone with fast performance, buttery smooth animations, and almost no lag or frame drops, even while gaming. The battery is still 4,000mAh, but this time around, I can at least use the phone for a full day before it discharges, which was not the case with the S24. Of course, a bigger battery or maybe a silicon-carbon battery would’ve helped, but for now, the chipset’s efficiency and optimisation are definitely doing the work here. More camera features Finally, the camera — which, again, one can argue has the same hardware as last year’s model. But having used the S24 last year and using the S25 now, I can assure you that the performance has definitely improved, primarily because of the superior ISP. Photos in various lighting conditions — despite having the same hardware — now appear more detailed, and the colour tone, especially human skin tones, is also closer to accurate. Apart from this, features such as smoother lens switching while recording videos and the new zoom slider are great, thanks to the next-generation Pro-Visual Engine. The Expert RAW mode also gets a few settings that may appeal to professionals, including two exposure monitoring controls, a couple of ND filter strengths, and a virtual aperture meter to adjust the depth of blur in real time.Galaxy S25 vs Galaxy S24: Which One to Buy? The decision between the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S24 ultimately boils down to your priorities and budget. You should choose the Galaxy S25 if you want the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which offers a solid performance boost over the Galaxy S24’s Exynos 2400. The 12GB RAM as standard ensures better multitasking, smoother gaming, and future-proofing. The improved cooling system, refined design, and improved camera features (thanks to the superior ISP and Pro-Visual Engine) make the Galaxy S25 a more capable and polished device. However, if you’re on a budget and don’t necessarily need the latest specs, the Galaxy S24 still offers a great experience with its 8GB RAM, capable Exynos 2400, and the same camera hardware as the S25. It’s a reliable choice for everyday use, casual gaming, and social media browsing. Plus, with the HDFC Bank card discount, the effective price of Rs 60,999 makes it a more (relatively) affordable option without compromising too much on performance. Overall, the Galaxy S25 is the better phone, no doubt, but the Galaxy S24 is no slouch either. If the Rs 10,000 price difference isn’t a dealbreaker for you, the S25’s upgrades in performance, RAM, and camera refinements make it the more future-proof and premium choice. However, if you’re looking to save money and still want a top-tier Android flagship, the Galaxy S24 is an excellent value-for-money option that won’t disappoint.

For a very long time, the threat of the licensing agreement between Qualcomm and Arm being terminated has been the key point of contention. Amon revealed this while speaking to analysts during a conference call. He said that Arm had withdrawn the October 2024 notice of breach and currently has no plans to terminate the licensing agreement with Qualcomm.  ""Arm recently notified us that it was withdrawing its October 22, 2024 notice of breach, and indicated that it has no current plan to terminate the Qualcomm architecture license agreement,"" Amon said, according to a report by Reuters. advertisementWhat was the Qualcomm vs Arm legal battle about?Arm’s threat to end the licensing agreement with Qualcomm is rooted in a disagreement over the technology behind Qualcomm’s custom computer chips. Qualcomm has for a long time been working with Arm for its architecture for chip design. However, the company has also been working on its own custom computer chips in order to reduce its dependency on Arm. That’s where Nuvia comes in. But to understand this, we will have to rewind to 2021. That is when Qualcomm acquired Nuvia. That is also when the legal tensions between Qualcomm and Arm began. Nuvia was founded by former Apple engineers and Qualcomm bought the company –– with the plans of making custom PC chips in mind –– for $1.4 billion. However, this made Arm unhappy. The company said that Qualcomm using Nuvia’s design violated their licensing agreement. Arm wanted Qualcomm to destroy all Nuvia technology that was developed under a previously terminated license. Qualcomm did not agree with Arm’s suggestion and claimed that Nuvia’s technology was within the bounds of its agreement with Arm.advertisement Arm’s threat to end the licensing agreement with Qualcomm is rooted in a disagreement over the technology behind Qualcomm’s custom computer chips.

Last year in December, a jury ruled in favour of Qualcomm –– they came to a decision that Qualcomm’s computer chips were properly licensed under its agreement with Arm. However, the jury could not reach a unanimous decision, and Arm filed a motion for a new trial. Is the legal battle over now? For now, Arm’s decision to withdraw the threat to end the licensing agreement would for sure bring some relief to Qualcomm. However, is the legal battle over? We can’t say. Looking at how long and intense this legal battle has been, this only seems like a temporary de-escalation of the matter.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/after-meta-google-scraps-diversity-based-hiring-programme-2675556-2025-02-06,"Alphabet's Google is scrapping its goal to hire more employees from under-represented groups and is reviewing some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, joining a slew of U.S. businesses scaling back diversity initiatives. ""In 2020, we set aspirational hiring goals and focused on growing our offices outside California and New York to improve representation,"" Fiona Cicconi, Alphabet's chief people officer, said in an email to staff on Wednesday, a copy which was reviewed by Reuters. ""...but in the future we will no longer have aspirational goals."" Google had for years been among the most vocal companies pushing for more inclusive policies in the wake of protests against the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans in 2020. In 2020, CEO Sundar Pichai set a goal to have 30 per cent more of its leaders from underrepresented groups by 2025. At the time, about 96 per cent of Google's US leaders were white or Asian, and 73 per cent globally were men. In 2021, it began to evaluate executive performance on team diversity and inclusion after a prominent leader of artificial intelligence research said the company abruptly fired her after she criticised its diversity efforts. Google's chief diversity officer Melonie Parker said in a 2024 interview with BBC that the company had hit 60 per cent of its five-year goals. On Wednesday, an Alphabet spokesperson said the company did not have updated figures regarding Pichai's goals. Alphabet's annual filing with the US SEC on Wednesday showed it omitted a line saying it was ""committed to making diversity, equity and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve."" That statement appeared in annual reports from 2021 to 2024. The spokesperson said the line was removed to reflect its review of DEI programs. ""This is a real attack on gains that workers have made in the tech industry through movements fighting against racism, gender and LGBTQ discrimination, going all the way back to the civil rights movement. This is part of a troubling right-wing, anti-worker trend developing within tech companies that AWU (Alphabet Workers Union) is committed to fighting against,"" said Parul Koul, a software engineer and the union's president, in a statement.Federal Contractor  Google, which sells cloud computing and other services to the US government, also said it was reviewing policy changes by President Donald Trump aimed at curbing DEI in the government and among federal contractors. ""Because we are a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes to our programs required to comply with recent court decisions and US Executive Orders on this topic,"" Cicconi said in the email. The company will maintain internal employee groups such as ""Trans at Google,"" ""Black Googler Network"" and the ""Disability Alliance,"" which the company has said inform decisions around products and policies. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Wednesday about the memo. Facebook parent Meta Platforms said in January in an internal memo it was ending its DEI programs, including those for hiring, training and picking suppliers. Amazon also said it was ""winding down outdated programs and materials"" related to representation and inclusion, in a memo to its employees, seen by Reuters. Conservative groups, fortified by a 2023 US Supreme Court ruling that invalidated affirmative action in university admissions, have condemned DEI programs and have threatened litigation against companies implementing them.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Also read |  Google rolls out new flagship AI model with thinking capabilitiesAlso read |  Meta is reportedly merging Facebook and Messenger teams ahead of layoffs next weekAlso read |  After calling India's AI efforts hopeless, Sam Altman now says India should be a leader in AITrending Reel

This SDK, dubbed SparkCat, is designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet recovery phrases using OCR technology.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/a-new-crypto-stealing-malware-is-targeting-iphones-and-android-smartphones-2675550-2025-02-06,"A new cybersecurity threat is targeting users of both Android and iOS devices. According to a Kaspersky report, a malicious software development kit (SDK) has been spotted embedded in several apps available on Google Play and the Apple App Store. This SDK, dubbed SparkCat, is designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet recovery phrases using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. The campaign has already affected hundreds of thousands of users, with over 242,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play Store alone. The malicious SDK operates differently on Android and iOS devices. On Android, it uses a Java component called Spark, which serves as an analytics module. This component retrieves encrypted configuration files from GitLab, which contain commands and updates for the malware. On iOS, the framework goes by various names, such as Gzip, googleappsdk, or stat, and uses a Rust-based networking module called im_net_sys to communicate with C2 servers. The primary function of this malware is to scan images on a user’s device for cryptocurrency wallet recovery phrases. These phrases, often stored as screenshots or photos, are used to restore access to cryptocurrency wallets. The malware uses Google ML Kit OCR to extract text from images, targeting specific keywords in multiple languages, including Latin, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. Once it identifies a recovery phrase, the stolen data is sent to the attackers’ servers, allowing them to access the victim’s cryptocurrency funds without needing a password. Kaspersky’s investigation revealed that the malware is region-specific, with different keywords and targeting strategies for areas like Europe and Asia. However, the researchers caution that the apps could still function outside their intended regions, posing a risk to a broader audience. So far, 18 Android apps and 10 iOS apps have been identified as infected. You can find the list of affected apps in Kaspersky's report here. One notable example is the Android app — ChatAi — which had been downloaded more than 50,000 times before being removed from the Google Play Store. However, many of the other infected apps remain available on both platforms, which is still a matter of concern. If you suspect you’ve installed any of the malware-infected apps, you must uninstall them immediately. According to experts, it is also recommended to install a reputable mobile antivirus tool to scan your device for any lingering traces of the malware. In severe cases, a factory reset may be necessary to ensure complete removal.  Self-hosted, offline password managers with vault features can also provide an additional layer of security.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

Meanwhile, China has responded to this by launching an antitrust probe into Apple's App Store policies.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/new-import-tariffs-could-make-apple-products-more-expensive-in-us-2675582-2025-02-06,"Apple fans in the US might soon have to dig deeper into their pockets as the company faces a new 10 per cent tariff on products imported from China. The tariff, imposed by the Donald Trump-led US government, applies to all goods arriving from China and could lead to price hikes for iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple devices. While Apple has been working to diversify its supply chain, a large portion of its products are still assembled in China, leaving the company vulnerable to these new trade policies. As per the tariff, which came into effect earlier this week, Apple now has to pay an additional 10 per cent on the cost of bringing its products into the US. This extra expense could either be absorbed by the company, cutting into its profit margins, or passed on to consumers through higher prices. Historically, Apple has taken a mixed approach, sometimes absorbing costs and other times raising prices. However, with the current uncertainty surrounding trade policies, the company may hold off on making any immediate decisions. Apple has been making efforts to reduce its reliance on China by expanding production in countries like India. Recently, the company began manufacturing iPhone Pro models in India, a shift from its earlier strategy of only producing non-Pro models there. Additionally, Apple is preparing to manufacture the iPhone 17 series in India, taking advantage of the country’s decision to remove import fees on key smartphone components. Despite these moves, only about 25 per cent of Apple’s production is expected to shift to India by the end of this year, meaning the majority of its devices will still be subject to the new tariffs. The timing of the tariff implementation could work in Apple’s favour, at least temporarily. The first quarter of the year is typically a slower period for Apple, following the holiday rush when new iPhones drive sales. This lull might give the company some breathing room to assess the situation before making any pricing changes. However, if the tariffs remain in place, Apple will eventually have to decide whether to raise prices or take a hit on its profits. Meanwhile, China has responded to the US tariffs by announcing potential antitrust investigations into Apple and Google. The investigation into Apple will mainly focus on its App Store’s 30 per cent commission on in-app purchases. Led by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), the probe will also examine Apple’s restrictions on third-party payment systems and alternative app stores. Chinese tech companies like Tencent and ByteDance argue that these policies hurt local competition and limit consumer choices.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

""We’re optimistic that within five years we’ll see real-world applications that are possible only on quantum computers,"" founder and lead of Google Quantum AI Hartmut Neven said in a statement. Real-world applications Google has discussed are related to materials science - applications such as building superior batteries for electric cars - creating new drugs and potentially new energy alternatives. Google's prediction arrives amid wider uncertainty about when such a breakthrough will occur. Predictions from investors and experts range from several years to at least two decades. For decades, scientists have been discussing quantum computing, which promises to deliver machines that are thousands of times more powerful than traditional computers. Traditional computers process information one number at a time, whereas quantum computers use ""qubits"" that can represent several numbers at once. Governments and businesses have kept a close eye on quantum computing's potential to disrupt modern cybersecurity and other fields such as finance and healthcare. Quantum computing resembles artificial intelligence in some ways. AI before ChatGPT's launch in 2022 was understood mostly by scientists. Scientists had been quietly producing breakthroughs to accelerate the field but there was no firm understanding of when AI would be commercially useful.Two decades out Nvidia's Jensen Huang has said that quantum computing is much farther away than five years. At an analyst event at the CES trade show in Las Vegas in January, Huang predicted practical uses for quantum computers are about 20 years away. ""If you kind of said 15 years... that'd probably be on the early side,"" Huang said, ""If you said 30, it's probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it."" Huang's comments ripped about $8 billion in market value from a handful of quantum computing stocks. The sector was given a boost in December when Google announced it had cracked a key challenge in the field with its new chips. Google has been working on its quantum computing program since 2012 and has designed and built several quantum chips. By using quantum processors, Google said it had managed to solve a computing problem in minutes that would take a classical computer more time than the history of the universe.
Google's quantum computing scientists announced another step on the path to real world applications within five years on Wednesday. In a paper published in the scientific journal Nature, the scientists said they had discovered a new approach to quantum simulation, which is a step on the path to achieving Google's objective.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-may-turn-iphone-into-a-super-remote-control-that-can-manage-all-electronic-devices-2675617-2025-02-06,"Apple keeps its employees busy churning new ideas and possible innovations across its ecosystem. In fact, the Cupertino giant not only brainstorms ideas but also rushes to get the patent as soon as something comes to the table. That’s the reason that, as of December 2024, Apple has reportedly filed 95,500 patents globally, including 78,104 active patents. Following Apple’s continued work on innovation, the company is now seemingly planning to make a new device that could be an all-in-one remote control. This control could manage a variety of electronic devices—or possibly give the iPhone all these superpowers. One of Apple’s newly granted patents, titled ""Controlling Electronic Devices Based On Wireless Ranging,"" first reported by Apple Insider, suggests that Apple is working on a new technology that could allow users to control everything from TVs and smart home appliances to vehicles and gaming consoles—all with a simple wave of their device. And this device could be the iPhone or the iPad. Controlling devices with an iPhone is not new. Right now, Apple has integrated remote-control functionality into its ecosystem, from Apple TV’s remote app to the ability to unlock and start cars with Apple Car Key. However, in these controls, users need to manually select on the iPhone what they want to control and how. Apple argues that this can lead to ""frustrating user interactions, which can degrade the user experience."" However, the proposed system in the patent suggests that the tech would possibly allow an iPhone or iPad—referred to in the patent as a ""wireless communication device""—to automatically detect the user's intent and control the correct device. The new patent suggests a more seamless connection, allowing users to simply point their device in the direction of an electronic appliance, and the wireless controller would recognize what the user intends to control.How will the wireless controlling work? In its patent, Apple explains that in this wireless controlling system, the device—let’s say an iPhone—will detect when a user wants to control a device and determine which one is being targeted. This could involve factors such as proximity, orientation, and possibly even gesture-based commands. “For example,” the patent explains, “a user may no longer need to open or unlock the wireless communication device (e.g., by providing a passcode or a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint) in order to control the object... By facilitating control of the object from a distance, this user-interface technique may eliminate the need for a user to be in physical contact with a user interface on or associated with the object,” Apple explains. Now, let’s not forget that this is still just a patent, and a lot of times, Apple files patents and never actually uses them. However, if this technology comes to life, it could significantly enhance how users interact with their devices. In the smart home space, an iPhone could serve as a universal remote, adjusting lighting, thermostats, or even kitchen appliances with a simple wave.

While the majority of users reported issues with the app, a few suffered trouble logging-in. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-was-down-for-the-second-time-this-year-globally-2675590-2025-02-06,"OpenAI's ChatGPT has recently faced a global outage across the world, according to the Downdetector website. The company has also acknowledged and stated that its products, including ChatGPT, Sora and API were facing increased errors. The surge in errors has been reported since 9.19 AM on Wednesday morning. OpenAI has recently updated on its Status page that the issue has been resolved as well.

 Over 26,000 users worldwide have reported issues with ChatGPT, according to Downdetector. Complaints began surging around 9:19 AM and continued to rise as more users encountered problems.   Approximately 92 per cent of the reports were related to ChatGPT app itself, while 7 per cent experienced website errors, and 1 per cent faced API issues. 
 


 The cause of the outage remains unknown, and the company is actively investigating the issue. A fix has already been implemented, leading to partial recovery, but efforts are still underway to fully resolve the problem. This isn't the first time ChatGPT has suffered issues. OpenAI previously acknowledged a similar outage. Last time, in January, both the ChatGPT app and the website version faced issues. During the outage, users were facing ""Bad Gateway Error"", while trying to work with ChatGPT. According to the reports, this error occurred as the company was trying to launch its first AI agent Operator. 

And just like always, as soon as the issues arrived, users took to X (formerly Twitter), sharing memes and reactions. OpenAI AI agents One of the reasons why outages are rising is that OpenAI is working for its AI agents more rigorously now, especially after the DeepSeek launch. The company has recently launched two of its AI agents: the Operator and the Deep Research. While the Operator can be tasked with a wide range of repetitive browser activities, such as completing forms, ordering groceries, or even creating memes, it cannot perform in-depth research like the new AI agent. On the other hand, Deep Research builds on the reasoning capabilities to bridge the gap, allowing it to take on the types of problems people face in work and everyday life. Both the agents are a significant step toward the broader goal of developing AGI, which OpenAI has been pointing out for a long period.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Also read |  New import tariffs could make Apple products more expensive in USAlso read |  Google aims to launch quantum computing applications in the next five yearsAlso read |  After Meta, Google scraps diversity-based hiring programme

318ef10e-aa19-4c80-825a-6431826ee676,"Boult BassBox X625 review: All about the bass, no treble If you are looking for a home theater system with good bass, you should definitely check out Boult's BassBox X625. Priced at Rs 39,999, it offers clear and loud sound with thumping bass. But if you want more than just good bass, this may not be an ideal option for you. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/boult-bassbox-x625-review-all-about-the-bass-no-treble-2675645-2025-02-06,"Bass Weight  Design Build quality  Remote Boult has lately been launching one audio device after the other in the market –– and we are not complaining. India Today Tech we reviewed the BassBox 180 soundbar, and the Retro Amp X60 speaker, and we loved both the products. Not just because we are vocal for local, but also because of the quality and pricing Boult’s products offer. And that’s true for the latest Boult device I have tested as well –– the Boult BassBox X625. It is a home theatre system. It offers a powerful bass that makes you feel like you are sitting in a movie theatre.  I have been testing the Boult BassBox X625 for a month. I connected it with my TV, a tablet, and my phone, and tried out different genres of movies and music, and my experience with it has largely been positive –– though not perfect. While I absolutely loved the bass it offers, the overall sound profile seems a bit lacking. There are also a few other flaws in the device, which I believe keep it from being an ideal home theater device.Boult BassBox X625: A quick look at its specs The Boult BassBox X625 is a 5.1-channel home theater system that delivers an audio output of 625 watts. It features a dedicated Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for better sound quality and comes with a wired subwoofer to produce deep, thumping bass. The system also offers multiple EQ modes, including Movie, Music, and News, allowing you to customise the audio experience based on your preferences. It is compatible with all Bluetooth devices and supports various connectivity options such as Bluetooth v5.3, AUX, USB, Optical, and HDMI (ARC). Additionally, it comes with a remote for better control and supports both wall mounting and tabletop placement.Boult BassBox X625: Design  The Boult BassBox X625 is a multi-device speaker system. Surprisingly, despite its size, it is lightweight and easy to set up. It took me just about 10 minutes to unbox and connect it to my TV. The design is simple yet elegant. It features a classic black finish that leans towards minimal aesthetics. The soundbar has controls on the top. The speakers are small and sport a clean look with a speaker grill and the Boult logo. The subwoofer box is also neatly designed. It can easily blend into a modern decor.  However, while the product looks nice, I found the build quality lacking. The woofers and the sound bar have a glossy surface on one end, which is visually appealing, but it feels somewhat cheap. I found that it is also quite prone to scratches and smudges. 
 


Boult BassBox X625: Performance Right at the start of this review, I mentioned that the Boult BassBox X625 delivers impressive bass. If you're searching for a home theater system that lets you feel the intensity of action scenes — like the rumble of trains, the gallop of horses, the crash of thunder, or the bang of gunfire — this one is a great choice in the sub-Rs 40,000 budget.I placed the subwoofer on the floor, and while watching an action movie, the vibrations were palpable. In fact, when I cranked up the bass, it even caused the windows to rattle.That said, I wish the overall sound quality were better. While the audio is clear, it lacks depth, and the treble isn’t sharp enough. When listening to melodies with high pitch, the speakers muffle the vocals, even with the bass turned down. The sound could have been clearer and more balanced.Another issue I faced was with the home theatre’s remote. It’s not very responsive, and it’s worse if you're sitting slightly far from the unit –– even at a distance of just 3 to 4 feet. It was honestly quite irksome that I had to move really close to the unit every time I needed to change any controls. 
 


advertisementHowever, if I look at the overall experience, I really liked the connectivity options, especially the Bluetooth connectivity, which is quick, easy, and allows you to connect multiple devices, not just the TV.Boult BassBox X625: Should you buy it? I have been using the BassBox X625 for weeks, and during my testing, I found the device to be more or less good. Its design is sleek, lightweight, and the bass is undoubtedly its standout feature. However, the overall sound quality is just decent. Priced around Rs 40,000, the BassBox X625 isn't exactly affordable. Whether it's a good buy depends on your priorities. If you're after a relatively budget-friendly speaker system that fits well with your decor, is easy to set up, and delivers excellent bass, BassBox X625 could be a good choice. However, if balanced sound quality is a priority, you may want to explore other alternatives.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Also Read |  Apple may turn iPhone into a super remote control that can manage all electronic devicesAlso Read |  Indian Railways launches SwaRail app: What it is, how to use and everything you need to knowAlso Read |  iPhone 17 Air vs iPhone 16 Plus: Here is how Apple may replace the Plus variant for slimmer iPhone

The company has listed a hiring alert for several manufacturing roles, and most of these are based out of the company’s California facility. The job listing was brought to everyone’s attention by @SawyerMerritt on X, which was then also retweeted by Elon Musk. The same is also listed on Tesla’s career page on the website.  The job listing makes one thing clear and that is that Tesla is actively looking to hire. The listings include openings for positions such as Manufacturing Engineering Technician, Production Supervisor, and Process Engineer, all of which are focused on Optimus. 
 


 Another LinkedIn post from a senior sourcer at Tesla, Karissa Thein, also hints at the mass hiring at the company. She wrote in the post: “My team is turning Tesla Bot into a reality! We're building Tesla Bot in our Fremont Factory in California, and we're looking for engineers up for the challenge of getting this product ramped up for high volume production.”

 The huge number of hirings possibly means that Tesla is working towards boosting production of the Optimus, especially considering the job postings focus on manufacturing roles.   The Optimus or the Tesla bot was first unveiled in 2021 at Tesla’s AI Day event. Since the launch, Musk has been positioning it as one of the key products in the company’s future. “I believe this will be the most significant product ever created,” Musk said at the Tesla AI event 2024.  Tesla, since the humanoid’s launch, has been demonstrating various iterations of the Teslabot, showcasing its ability to walk, carry objects, and hold conversations with humans around it. Tesla has been taking advantage of its expertise in self-driving technology to improve Optimus. Last time when Musk showcased the humanoid robots, which was in October 2024, he said that the Tesla bot can now do anything you can think of. In fact, Musk also described the capabilities of the humanoid robots as virtually limitless. The Optimus can now walk your dog, babysit, mow the lawn, and even serve drinks. Musk has said that we can expect the robot to be available commercially very soon, and the mass production seems to be a step in that direction. He had also estimated the price of the bot to range between $20,000 and $30,000.  Last month, Elon Musk put out another call for hiring software engineers for his Everything app. He made a call for hardcore software engineers to join his ambitious project, and said he doesn’t care about the degree or the absence of one, all he cares about is a solid code. Musk posted on X: “We don’t care where you went to school or even whether you went to school or what 'big name' company you worked at. Just show us your code"", he says.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Also read |  Elon Musk is hiring for software engineer role, says there is no need for a degreeAlso read |  Elon Musk says Tesla humanoid Optimus can now do anything that you can think ofAlso read |  Elon Musk unveils Tesla's Optimus Gen 2 Robot, it can boil eggs, dance, and moreMust Watch

Users will no longer be required to sign up to use the feature. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-search-now-available-to-all-make-search-great-again-jokes-openai-ceo-sam-altman-2675773-2025-02-06,"OpenAI has announced that the ChatGPT search feature is now available for all on chatgpt.com. To use the feature, users no longer need to sign in. Until now, to access the feature, when users opened chatgpt.com, they needed to sign up via either a Google, Apple or a Microsoft account. However, the company has now eliminated that step in the process of using the feature. Responding to the announcement posted by OpenAI on X, the company’s CEO Sam Altman jokingly wrote: “make search great again”.  OpenAI launched the ChatGPT search feature in November last year. However, it was then limited to only paid users. But at the time of writing the story, the feature was available to everyone, including the ones using the unpaid version. We checked both the web and the mobile app, and the search feature was available in the standard ChatGPT version. 
 


 The ChatGPT search feature was first tested as SearchGPT. However, in November 2024, OpenAI launched it as a feature called Search. OpenAI describes it as a tool to get fast, timely answers to queries shared on ChatGPT, which are supported with links to relevant web sources. Until now, for some queries that needed a web search, users still needed to switch to Google or some other browser for information. ChatGPT on its own has limitations to the dataset it has, and may not always be accurate –– the app also warns about it.  But with the search feature, based on the query you ask, ChatGPT will search the web for you, or you can choose to use the search feature by clicking the web icon that shows just below the text box. ""This [ChatGPT search] blends the benefits of a natural language interface with the value of up-to-date sports scores, news, stock quotes, and more,"" said OpenAI about the feature at the time of launch. With this the probability of accuracy of information increased. You should still always verify it on your end though. This is also why the ChatGPT search feature was seen as a direct competitor to Google at the time of launch –– especially with the news of Google working on its own AI search tool.

According to reports, till date, over 10,800 employees have already been affected, with more job cuts expected throughout the year.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/tech-layoffs-2025-meta-microsoft-salesforce-continue-job-cuts-amid-restructuring-efforts-2675812-2025-02-06,"The year 2022 ended with the quakes of mass layoffs, which continued their tremors in 2023 and even 2024. However, uncertainties and job cuts are showing no signs of slowing down, even in the new year, 2025. Though not as big as the mass layoffs, these short-phase layoffs continue to bring uncertainties this year as well. As the year started, major companies including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, and Google announced more downsizing, citing restructuring efforts and performance optimisation—all while expanding roles in artificial intelligence.  According to layoffs.fyi, 42 tech companies have laid off around 10,833 employees so far, with more job cuts expected throughout the year.Microsoft announced performance-based layoffs Microsoft became one of the first major companies to announce layoffs this year. The company confirmed job cuts across multiple divisions, with the security division reportedly being among those affected. Microsoft stated that these layoffs primarily targeted employees who did not meet performance expectations.  However, despite the global restructuring, Puneet Chandok, Microsoft’s India and South Asia head, reassured that the company’s India operations would remain unaffected by these job cuts.Meta aims to cut 3,600 jobs  Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also announced plans to lay off approximately 3,600 employees. This count represents about 5 percent of its workforce adding to the earlier 5 per cent job cuts the company announced in December 2024.  According to Bloomberg, CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in an internal memo explained these job cuts as a part of “raising the bar on performance management” and expediting the removal of low-performing employees. He stated that the layoffs come as Meta navigates what he described as an “intense year” of restructuring and operational shifts.Amazon also announces job cuts Amazon is also among the tech giants continuing its streak of layoffs, which began in 2022. The company recently announced job cuts within its communications and sustainability divisions. Although the exact number of affected employees is still not revealed.   According to an internal memo obtained by CNBC, Amazon’s leadership justified these recent layoffs as an effort to eliminate narrowly defined roles and unnecessary organisational layers. Notably, over the past three years, Amazon has cut around 27,000 jobs, with restructuring efforts still underway.Salesforce to cut over 1,000 jobs Most recently, Salesforce has also joined the list of tech companies downsizing their workforce in 2025. According to Bloomberg, the company plans to eliminate over 1,000 positions as part of an ongoing restructuring initiative. However, these layoffs come amid Salesforce’s plans to hire more employees to support its expansion into AI-driven products. The report also suggests that laid-off employees will likely be given the opportunity to apply for other internal roles.Google also pushing voluntary exits for employees While Google has not announced direct job cuts, it has introduced a voluntary exit program for employees in its Platforms & Devices division. This division is responsible for key products such as Android, Pixel, Chrome, Nest, and Fitbit.  Senior Vice President Rick Osterloh announced the program via an internal memo, offering U.S.-based employees severance packages if they choose to leave.

The company is reportedly working on finalising the compensation revisions based on performance reviews and recommendations from its delivery units.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/infosys-is-said-to-release-annual-salary-hike-offers-at-the-end-of-march-2675806-2025-02-06,"Infosys, one of India's leading IT services companies, is said to release annual salary hike letters to its employees by the end of March. People familiar with the matter told Economic Times, the company is currently working on finalising the compensation revisions based on performance reviews and recommendations from its delivery units. Shaji Mathew, Chief Human Resources Officer at Infosys, recently addressed employees during a town hall meeting at the Bengaluru campus. He shared that employees at Job Level 5 (JL5) and below will receive their salary hikes effective from January 1. Those at Job Level 6 (JL6) and higher will have their revised salaries kick in from April 1. Mathew also indicated that performance ratings have already been communicated to employees, and these evaluations will play a crucial role in determining the percentage of individual salary hikes. However, he did not specify details regarding the overall appraisal cycle period. Last year, Infosys did not issue compensation letters in June for hikes starting in April, a practice followed in previous years. The company’s last salary revision occurred in November 2023 after a salary freeze during FY22 to conserve cash. The appraisal cycle restarted in October 2023, with salary revision letters issued in December for that cycle. This new announcement aligns with previous comments made by Infosys CFO Jayesh Sanghrajka during the company’s earnings call last month. Sanghrajka had mentioned that employees in India could expect a salary increase of 6-8 percent, while those overseas would see more modest hikes in line with earlier trends. He added that higher performers could expect more significant increments. The company is likely to implement the salary hikes in two phases — one from January 1 and another from April 1. Senior-level employees in the JL6 category and above will see their salary increases linked to Infosys' revenue performance.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 6, 2025

Expected to launch in March, it could rival Apple's iPhone 17 design with its horizontal bar-shaped camera module.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oneplus-13-mini-camera-details-leaked-ahead-of-rumoured-march-launch-2675799-2025-02-06,"OnePlus industrial designer, Lao Haoran, recently announced on Weibo that the company is planning a major overhaul for its phones in 2025. Following this, rumours have started hinting that OnePlus is working on compact high-end phones powered by MediaTek and Qualcomm chips. The Qualcomm chip in question is said to be the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the phone it will power could be called the OnePlus 13 Mini. This phone is reportedly launching soon, and fresh leaks about its camera and other hardware specs have started appearing online.

Source: Digital Chat Station
 According to Digital Chat Station, the OnePlus 13 Mini will feature a dual-camera setup, contradicting earlier rumours of a triple-camera system. The rear camera module — expected to come in a horizontal bar-shaped island — is said to include a 50-megapixel primary sensor and a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. The OnePlus 13 Mini is expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. This puts it in direct competition with other compact flagships, such as the Galaxy S25 and even the Vivo X200 Pro, which is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 processor. As for the display, the phone is rumoured to sport a 6.31-inch LTPO OLED panel with a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. The flat screen is expected to feature ultraslim bezels, offering an immersive viewing experience. Additionally, the device is expected to feature an optical in-display fingerprint sensor. As mentioned earlier, design-wise, the OnePlus 13 Mini is going to be a big departure from its predecessors. Lao Haoran has confirmed that the company is working on a major design overhaul for its 2025 lineup. The 13 Mini is likely to showcase this new direction, with a focus on being a compact flagship phone, rather than the usual large phones the company is typically known for. Now, it’s not like OnePlus hasn’t attempted a compact phone before — case in point, the OnePlus X — but it’s been a while since that phone launched, and it will be interesting to see what the 13 Mini brings to the table in 2025. Reports suggest it will feature a metal frame and a glass back. Apart from this, battery details remain under wraps, but the phone is expected to support wireless charging, a feature that has become a staple of flagship devices. The OnePlus 13 Mini is rumoured to launch as early as March. However, it’s still unclear whether the device will be available globally or limited to specific markets.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

Here are the details.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sonos-fires-200-employees-says-company-wants-to-focus-on-smaller-teams-2675862-2025-02-06,"Sonos, a well-known audio technology company, has reportedly laid off 200 employees as part of a company-wide restructuring effort, The Verge reports. This move comes as Sonos wants to reduce layers of management and focus on smaller, more efficient teams to improve decision-making and streamline collaboration. The announcement was made by interim CEO Tom Conrad in a communication with employees, highlighting the need for the company to become more agile in the face of ongoing challenges. Conrad reportedly asserted that Sonos had become entangled in complex organisational structures, making collaboration more difficult than necessary. ""One thing I’ve observed first-hand is that we’ve become mired in too many layers that have made collaboration and decision-making harder than it needs to be,"" he stated in his message to the employees.  The layoffs are part of Sonos' plan to reorganise its workforce into more compact, focused teams, ensuring that the company is better equipped to prioritise essential projects moving forward. This round of layoffs is bigger than the earlier reduction in August, when the company eliminated around 100 jobs. Sonos has faced various challenges, including declining demand for its products and setbacks from last year's controversial mobile app update. The app rollout was poorly received due to technical issues, leading to dissatisfaction among users. The impact of this event was big enough that it contributed to the departure of former CEO Patrick Spence last month. As Sonos prepares to release its upcoming quarterly earnings report, this wave of job cuts has raised concerns about the company’s immediate outlook. However, Conrad has committed to addressing past missteps, particularly focusing on improving the mobile app experience. In addition to the layoffs, Sonos plans to restructure its product teams, dividing them into dedicated groups for hardware, software, design, and operations, rather than organising around individual product categories. While the company faces difficult times, its recent successes, such as the Arc Ultra soundbar, provide some optimism. Sonos is also preparing to launch a new high-end streaming device, expected to include advanced features like an HDMI switch. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 6, 2025

And anyone who uses it will be fined and imprisoned for it. This was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. According to the report, some US senators are pushing a bill to ban the Chinese AI chatbot from government devices. The bill reportedly reads that it will “prohibit United States persons from advancing artificial intelligence capabilities within the People’s Republic of China, and for other persons”. Another report by The Independent reveals that according to the bill, when it comes to effect, if anyone (who this law applies to) is found using DeepSeek, they may face a fine of up to $1 million, which is around Rs 6.5 crores. Violators may also have to face prison for up to 20 years. The Independent report also suggests that the bill proposes the ban extending beyond just government devices. Because the report mentions that, as per the bill, businesses found using DeepSeek AI may get fined up to $100 million, which is more than Rs 8 billion.  The bill was reportedly proposed by Republican senator Josh Hawley. The reason for the proposed ban is the same as the one behind TikTok’s ban in the US –– the app sending data of Americans to the Chinese government. Hawley has raised questions about the “security, privacy, and ethics” offered in the DeepSeek AI app.  Interestingly, this would not even make the US the first country to ban DeepSeek, if it does. Italy has already banned the Chinese AI chatbot stating privacy reasons. Even in the US, Texas has banned DeepSeek already. Additionally, Taiwan has also banned the AI chatbot, and Australia is also on its way to do so. Meanwhile, the union minister of information technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw said that DeepSeek will soon be hosted on Indian servers in order to address privacy concerns. Experts have raised serious concerns about DeepSeek, particularly regarding data security and potential information transfer to China.
Last week, DeepSeek got a lot of attention from around the world. Even though the AI chatbot was launched in 2023, it was only after the release of its R1 model, which took place in the last week of January 2025, that the Chinese AI chatbot really caught everyone’s attention. But why did it get so popular suddenly? Amid the US-China trade war, and the US blocking exports of AI chips to China, DeepSeek is an AI chatbot that does everything that ChatGPT does but it was built at a fraction of the cost. What is DeepSeek AI? DeepSeek AI was founded by Liang Wenfeng in May 2023. It has recently gained a lot of attention thanks to its latest large language models — DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1, of which the V3 is a general-purpose model, whereas the R1 model specialises in reasoning tasks.  Both models are standout for delivering great results while using fewer resources than competitors. DeepSeek also follows the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which is basically aimed at increasing efficiency by only activating the portion of parameters at one time. DeepSeek AI chatbot, as per the company, also gets better as it interacts more with a human. However, that is true for most AI models as well.

Thanks to a detailed writeup in Chinese, sourced from zwz, and its translation shared by Jukanlosreve on X (formerly Twitter), we might have a clearer picture of what Apple’s first foldable device could look like, its features, and its potential release timeline. While Apple has remained tight-lipped about its foldable plans, this leak provides an interesting glimpse into what could be one of the most — if not the most — innovative smartphone launches of the decade. The foldable iPhone is said to feature a large folding mechanism on the left rear side, with a folded thickness of 9.2 mm and a single-side thickness of 4.6 mm. The internal screen is expected to be massive, comparable to two 6.1-inch phones folded together, resulting in a total screen size of over 12 inches. This suggests that Apple is aiming for a tablet-like experience when the device is unfolded, which could make it a versatile tool for both productivity and entertainment.  One of the most critical components of any foldable device is the hinge, and Apple seems to be taking a unique approach. The hinge design is entirely Apple’s own, with an assembled cost of approximately $110. Key suppliers for the hinge components include Amphenol and Taiwan’s Xinyiheng, while Lingyi is involved in the internal components. The midframe, made of aluminium, is priced at $80 to $90 and is being developed exclusively by Foxconn’s Fulin division. During mass production, secondary suppliers like LanSi and BYD Electronics are expected to join the process. The display technology for the foldable iPhone is said to be exclusively developed by Samsung, which is no surprise given Samsung’s expertise in foldable screens. The device will reportedly use UTG (ultra-thin glass) Blue, which is currently priced at around $90 to $100. The screen support frame is still under consideration, with options like titanium alloy, stainless steel, or carbon fibre being explored. Lingyi, a key supplier, has already provided samples, but the final decision is yet to be made. The leak also sheds light on the camera and battery technology. The front camera will reportedly use Meta Lens ultra-thin technology, with lenses supplied by Largan, Sunwoo, and Lantega. The rear camera will feature a hybrid glass-plastic structure for both the primary and ultra-wide lenses. As for the battery, the foldable iPhone is expected to use two stainless steel-cased batteries with a combined capacity of around 5000mAh. These batteries will reportedly feature 3D-stacked cells, exclusively developed by ATL. According to the leak, Apple plans to launch the foldable iPhone in the fall of 2026, followed by a foldable iPad or MacBook in 2027. Foxconn, Apple’s long-time manufacturing partner, is reportedly handling the exclusive NPI (New Product Introduction) process, with mass production expected to begin by late 2025 or early 2026. This timeline indicates that Apple is in no hurry to jump the gun and the company will instead take its sweet time to perfect the design and functionality of its foldable devices. Initial sales estimates suggest that Apple could sell 8 to 10 million units in 2026, with that number doubling to 20 million units in 2027. Foxconn will reportedly be the sole manufacturer in 2026, but Luxshare is expected to join the production process in 2027.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

Now, the model will show you the insights of how it has deduced the answer. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-updates-the-way-o3-mini-communicates-will-support-transparent-reasoning-and-chain-of-thought-display-2676119-2025-02-07,"OpenAI rolled out its flagship AI models, o3 and o3-mini, a week ago. For the first time, OpenAI grants free-tier users access to its reasoning models through o3-Mini, though with rate limits comparable to GPT-4o. This marks a significant shift in OpenAI’s strategy, making advanced AI tools more accessible to a broader audience. It also comes at a time when DeepSeek attracted several headlines for its advanced performance and low-price rates. In order to make it even better, OpenAI has recently updated the way o3-mini communicates and responds. In the new design, the model will showcase its chain of thought before concluding its answer. advertisementOpenAI o3-mini updated OpenAI has announced an update to the o3-mini model that enhances transparency for both free and paid users by displaying a refined ""chain of thought,"" revealing more of the model’s reasoning process behind its answers. Premium subscribers using o3-Mini in the ""high reasoning"" mode will also benefit from this improved insight, according to the company.In the preview, posted by OpenAI, it was previewed that now the model not only answers, but also shares insights into its thought process. Here, to answer a simple question, ""how is today not a Friday"", o3-mini gave it thought before answering. Not just that, the displayed chain of thought shows that this AI model understands when the user is being humourous and just wants a fun answer. It also predicts the feelings of the user, based on the question they ask. For instance, it says, ""seems like a humourous remark. May be they're feeling like the week is almost over, even though it's not!""

The o3-mini's chain of thought and conclusion gives us an idea that it is an AI model which can be witty but also gives logic to the answer. Additionally, when OpenAI released the model, it highlighted that a major enhancement in o3-Mini is its capability to retrieve real-time data from the web, delivering answers with source links for greater reliability. The preview also showed that the model took only 6 seconds to to think about the question and then respond. Moreover, o3-Mini is also being integrated into Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service, GitHub Copilot, and GitHub models, expanding its presence in enterprise applications. Free-tier users can access O3-Mini within ChatGPT by selecting the ‘Reason’ feature in the chat bar, though with usage limits.OpenAI o3-mini VS DeepSeek R1 modelDeepSeek’s R1 model, like OpenAI’s O3-Mini, is designed for advanced reasoning.

Instead, users receive condensed summaries of the reasoning process, though these summaries have occasionally contained errors, according to a TechCrunch report.  ""OpenAI still isn’t showing o3-mini’s full reasoning steps, but the company said it found a balance: o3-mini can think freely and then organise its thoughts into more detailed summaries,"" an OpenAI spokesperson spoke to TechCrunch.

b471e2a1-49ff-4464-9b19-66b07807338e,Google introduces digital watermarks for AI-edited photos using Magic EditorGoogle Photos will now add a SynthID watermark to the images edited using the Magic Editor. It aims to promote transparency and make it easier for people to identify AI manipulation.  ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-introduces-digital-watermarks-for-ai-edited-photos-using-magic-editor-2676161-2025-02-07,"As the AI-world is catching up, it leaves a very thin line between reality and artificially generated content. This is especially true for the images created using AI. To combat this, Google has been watermarking AI-created, but now it has recently announced that it will also watermark the images edited using AI. The company will use SynthID, which was also seen in the Imagen tool, to mark images edited with generative AI using Reimagine in Magic Editor. This step aims to help people identify AI-generated content quickly and easily. 
 


advertisementGoogle Photos to use SynthIDSynthID technology is available to Vertex AI customers using Google's text-to-image models, Imagen 3 and Imagen 2, which generate high-quality images across diverse artistic styles. Additionally, SynthID is applied to image outputs on ImageFX and has been integrated into Veo, our most advanced video generation model. Veo is currently accessible to select creators on VideoFX.
 


It can also scan a single image, or the individual frames of a video to detect digital watermarking. Google says, ""We’ve designed it so it doesn’t compromise image or video quality, and allows the watermark to remain detectable — even after modifications like cropping, adding filters, changing colours, changing frame rates and saving with various lossy compression schemes.""advertisement SynthID technology is available to Vertex AI customers using Google's text-to-image models, Imagen 3 and Imagen 2, which generate high-quality images across diverse artistic styles.

Google says, ""We’ve designed it so it doesn’t compromise image or video quality, and allows the watermark to remain detectable — even after modifications like cropping, adding filters, changing colours, changing frame rates and saving with various lossy compression schemes."" The company explains that in some cases, edits made using Reimagine may be too small for SynthID to label and detect — like if you change the colour of a small flower in the background of an image. To learn more, you can use ""About this image,"" which shows if a SynthID watermark is present as well as an image’s metadata. 
 


 For perspective, released in 2024, Reimagine uses generative AI to modify digital photos, much like other Magic Editor tools designed for on-device enhancements. However, its advanced capabilities enable more extensive edits, further blurring the line between traditional photography and AI-generated imagery.  As AI-generated images grow increasingly realistic, digital advocates are calling for a standardised method to help the public differentiate between authentic and synthetic photos. One widely suggested solution is digital watermarking, which can be embedded in a file without modifying the image itself. This said, while it is a step toward responsible AI, the watermarking alone is not enough. This feature rollout is part of a broader initiative to enhance transparency in AI-powered editing within Google Photos.

The victim received several calls from fraudsters posing as law enforcement officers. The scammers tricked him into believing he was involved in a money laundering case. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/mumbai-man-loses-rs-11-lakh-after-getting-call-about-illegal-parcel-2676159-2025-02-07,"A 28-year-old corporate employee from Worli became one of the latest victims of an illegal parcel scam. The victim received calls from unknown individuals who introduced themselves as law enforcement officials. They informed him about an illegal parcel confiscated in his name and convinced him that he was involved in a money laundering case. Through threats and persistent calls, the scammers managed to dupe the victim of Rs 11 lakh. The ordeal reportedly began when the victim received a call from a woman claiming to be from the Mumbai Post Office. The callers alleged that a package addressed to him had been flagged for containing six passports, multiple ATM cards, a laptop, and 150 grams of MDMA. When the victim denied any connection to the parcel, the scammer transferred his call to another individual who introduced himself as a cybercrime officer for further questioning, as reported by The Times of India. During the conversations, the scammers impersonated officials from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED), and Mumbai Cyber Crime to escalate the case and pressure the victim. To make the scheme more convincing, they even video-called the victim, showing a man dressed in a police uniform who claimed to be a senior officer and warned that he was implicated in a high-profile money laundering case. Additionally, the scammers sent three forged letters bearing fake seals and case details, making the victim believe he was under investigation. Another fraudster, identifying himself as IPS officer Bal Singh Rajput, instructed him to transfer funds to an “escrow account” for verification. Fearing legal trouble, the victim fell for the trap and started following the scammers’ instructions. He prematurely liquidated a Fixed Deposit (FD) worth Rs 5 lakh at Canara Bank and transferred the funds as directed. Subsequently, he sent Rs 99,000 to a Bandhan Bank account and another Rs 10 lakh to a Federal Bank account. However, after transferring Rs 11 lakh, the victim tried calling the alleged officers back, but none of them answered. Realising he had been deceived, the victim blocked the fraudsters' numbers and reported the incident to the Cyber Helpline (1930) and Mumbai Police. Notably, this is not a new form of cyber fraud, where individuals receive calls from fake police officials about an illegal parcel and end up sending large sums of money to scammers in an attempt to clear their name. In the past few months, many individuals have lost lakhs and crores to this scam. The Government of India has been actively issuing safety advisories, warning people about such scams and urging them to stay vigilant. Yet, scammers continue to find ways to trick and threaten individuals into giving them money. To protect yourself from such scams, remember:
No legitimate agency will demand bank details or fund transfers over a call or message.
If you receive such a call, hang up immediately.
If you think the call might be genuine, always cross-check suspicious claims by contacting the relevant department through official channels.
Never disclose bank details, passwords, or OTPs to unknown callers.
If something seems suspicious, block and report the caller.

While the company has not confirmed an official launch date, multiple leaks suggest what to expect. According to tipster Debayan Roy on X (formerly Twitter), the Galaxy F16 is likely to be priced under Rs. 15,000 in India. For comparison, the Galaxy A16 5G, launched in October 2024, started at Rs. 18,999 for the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant. This suggests the Galaxy F16 could bring similar specs at a more competitive price.

 



Source: Debayan Roy/ X (formerly Twitter)
 The Galaxy F16 is expected to feature a 6.7-inch full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. It will likely be powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset, built on a 6nm process. The phone is tipped to come with 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM, which should provide decent performance for everyday tasks and light gaming.  In terms of cameras, the Galaxy F16 is rumoured to feature a triple rear camera setup, headlined by a 50-megapixel primary sensor. It is also expected to include a 5-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera, though details about the third sensor remain unclear. For selfies, the phone might sport a 13-megapixel front-facing camera. Battery life is another area where the Galaxy F16 could shine. It is said to pack a 5,000mAh battery — the same capacity as the Galaxy A16 — which should easily last a full day on a single charge. Additionally, the phone is expected to support dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz), for fast and stable internet connectivity. You see, we keep mentioning the Galaxy A16 throughout the article because, interestingly, the Galaxy F16 is rumoured to be a rebranded version of the A16, which was launched last year in October. This strategy isn’t new for Samsung, as the company has often released slightly modified versions of existing models under different series to cater to varying markets and price segments. Flipkart has already teased the arrival of a new Galaxy F-series phone in India, and all signs point to it being the Galaxy F16. The device has also appeared on the Samsung India website with the model number SM-E166P/DS, further hinting at an imminent launch.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

This affects certain users with Android 12 and later. Here is what you can do to protect your data. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/govt-issues-high-risk-warning-for-android-12-android-13-android-14-and-android-15-users-what-you-need-to-do-2676182-2025-02-07,"The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiTy) has issued a warning for Android users, citing multiple vulnerabilities that are being reported. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), working with the ministry, reported that the Android 12 and later software have been affected. The warning claims that these users could face a high-severity cyberattack. The government agency shares that these multiple vulnerabilities on Android are due to flaws in the framework but, there could also be faults in the chipset components.  It states, ""Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Android which could be exploited by an attacker to obtain sensitive information, gain elevated privileges, execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service (DoS) conditions on the targeted system.""  This warning is among the most severe of security issues. The agency explains that the severity assessment is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would possibly have on an affected device.   Hence, CERT advises Android 12, Android 13, Android 14, and Android 15 users to update their devices to prevent any attack. How to prevent such cyberattacks Keeping your software up to date is a crucial step in protecting your devices from potential vulnerabilities, but there are additional measures you can take to enhance security.   Regularly check for updates and enable automatic updates whenever possible to safeguard against newly discovered threats. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unverified apps, as these can serve as entry points for malicious attacks. Always install apps from the official App Store to reduce risk.   Strengthen your security by using unique, robust passwords for your Apple ID and other accounts. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an extra layer of protection. Additionally, periodically review and manage app permissions to ensure they have only the necessary access to your data.   Stay vigilant against phishing attempts that may try to steal your personal information or credentials. If you receive unexpected prompts requesting sensitive details, always verify the source before providing any information.   By implementing these precautions, you can significantly enhance your device’s security and minimise the risk of falling victim to cyber threats.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Also read |  Top DOGE engineer in Elon Musk team leaves after racist comments, wanted hate normalised against IndiansAlso read |  Google introduces digital watermarks for AI-edited photos using Magic EditorAlso read |  Mumbai man loses Rs 11 lakh after getting call about illegal parcelMust Watch

He, of course, faced a lot of backlash after his old posts on X resurfaced and caused a global outrage. But this has also led to the Elon Musk initiative coming under scrutiny once again. Elez has also worked as a software engineer at Musk’s X and SpaceX. The news about his resignation was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which highlighted the myriad of controversial posts that he had made online. The posts, now deleted, had statements particularly racist against Indians, such as “Normalise Indian hate”. There was another that read that Indians in the US on H-1B visas are “going back don’t worry guys”. He has also made other controversial comments, like “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.” Another one from September 2024 read: “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.” Elez was part of the US Treasury Department and was one of two temporary members of DOGE — an initiative aimed at improving government efficiency by cutting costs and eliminating fraud –– who were posted there. The White House was notified about his post, after which Elez resigned from his post. The 25-year-old, due to his position at the Treasury, is believed to have access to highly sensitive financial data, including systems that process trillions of dollars in payments annually. The former DOGE engineer has also advocated for rescinding the Civil Rights Act in a post.“I just want a eugenic immigration policy, is that too much to ask?” 
These resurfaced posts prompted calls for his immediate removal from DOGE, which is an official government service. While all of these posts were removed from his account, screenshots of them are still circulating on the internet. And as people on the internet raised their voices against his racist opinions, which is especially troubling for someone in government services, questions were also raised about the level of access he had at the Treasury Department. The issue of access to government data has been an issue from the beginning, anyway. Several lawmakers have pointed out in the past that private-sector individuals should not be able to access sensitive public data.  According to reports, a US judge has now limited DOGE members’ access to the Treasury’s payment systems and says they will only be granted “ready-only” access.

A new report by Canalys reveals that Apple managed to capture 42.3 percent of the entire tablet market in the fourth quarter of 2024. During this quarter, the Cupertino giant shipped an estimated 16.9 million iPads, growing from 14.8 million units in Q4 2023. According to the report, Apple’s iPads are continually becoming the preferred tablet option for users, both for personal and professional use. With powerful hardware, seamless software integration, and long-term software support, iPads across the ecosystem are managing to offer users reliable machines with powerful hardware while offering options across several price points.   While Apple has been getting attention from users every year, in 2024 specifically the reason for the rise in iPad popularity is said to be the arrival of new gen models. The M4 iPad Pro, featuring the M4 chip, and the refreshed iPad Mini with the A17 Pro chip reportedly contributed significantly to Apple’s continued growth. Meanwhile, the budget iPad Air also received a boost in sales with the M2 chip, making it a preferred choice for users looking for a balanced machine with powerful hardware while keeping the budget in place. While Apple is leading the charts in sales, its Android competitor, Samsung, is reportedly following behind. However, the gap between the first and second positions in the race is significant. Samsung shipped only 7 million tablets in Q4 2024. This count, however, translates to a 17.8 percent market share, which is less than half of Apple’s. Following Samsung, other brands, including Lenovo, Huawei, and Xiaomi, are also growing, but the difference in market share remains significant.

At the event, the company will launch its Vivo V50 series, which will most likely include two smartphones, the Vivo V50 and the Vivo V50 Pro. Ahead of the launch event, Vivo has shared a bunch of teasers about the V50 series. One thing is common in all these teasers, and that’s the “so pro” detail. This clearly hints at improvements to the smartphones’ cameras. Vivo’s V-series has always been a camera-centric series, so expect the same with the V50 series as well. The V-series has also been using Zeiss lenses for a long time.  In the teasers shared by Vivo, the company has shown a part-view of the front and back panel of the new smartphones. This has confirmed some camera and design details. For instance, we now know that the Vivo V50 series continues to use Zeiss lenses for the cameras. We also know that the smartphone will feature a dual-camera system, which will be housed inside a small round module, under which is a slight design extension that sports a small LED ring for flash. 
 


 The teasers also confirm what we already know: the smartphones will feature the volume rocker and the power button on the right edge of the phone. Also, the images show that the Vivo V50 series sports slightly rounded edges, which seems like it would have a very nice and soft in-hand feel. The display also looks almost flat with just a slight curve at the end. If our estimate is right then the display will be able to offer the best of both worlds: a flat display and a curved one.  Finally, the phone shown in the teaser image sports a beautiful wine colour, which is quite unusual. Vivo, in the teaser, has also revealed that the Vivo V50 series will come with AI features.  While we are still waiting on many details about the devices, we will know all official information only on the day of launch, which is Monday, February 17. The pricing of the phone will also be known on that day. But to get a perspective on what kind of pricing we can expect from the Vivo V50 series, if we look at last year’s Vivo V40 series, which were priced in India at a starting price of Rs 34,999, we could expect similar pricing this year. As for the purported Vivo V50 Pro, expect that to be priced under Rs 50,000.

328b268a-b0d3-49f2-9a8b-5bf7f666c778,"Tinder is using AI to make online dating creep-proofAhead of Internet Safety Day on February 11, Tinder talks about how it's using AI to keep the creeps at the bay. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/tinder-is-using-ai-to-make-online-dating-creep-proof-2676328-2025-02-07,"I have been using online dating apps for a few years, and honestly, if you’re a girl on these platforms, it’s almost impossible to avoid inappropriate messages. The experience is largely the same across all apps. Unfortunately, Tinder has an especially bad reputation in this regard — and for good reason. Maybe it is because Tinder is far more popular than most dating apps — so much so that the name itself has become synonymous with online dating –– that you end up encountering inappropriate messages on Tinder than on other platforms. Ahead of Internet Safety Day on February 11, Tinder is collaborating with the Centre for Social Research (CSR) to create a safer online dating experience. Today, Tinder has released its Dating Safety Guide in four Indian regional languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, and Bengali. “For Safer Internet Day, we’re launching the Tinder Dating Safety Guide in multiple languages, empowering young daters in India with essential tools and tips,” says Dr Yoel Roth, Vice President of Trust and Safety at Match Group. “Partnering with the Center for Social Research, we’re raising awareness of practical steps people can take for safer dating, reinforcing our commitment to stronger safety standards across our platforms and communities, and industry,” he added.  But the problems with dating apps are much bigger than just inappropriate texts. With AI tools becoming more easily accessible, the platform is now having to deal with deep fakes, and related frauds and scams. Dr Roth says that even though research has identified that currently a very small proportion of accounts are using AI to create deep fakes, even if it’s a small number, the company wants to deal with it like it’s a big threat. Tinder Dating Safety Guide  Dr Roth shared a list of threats and how Tinder has turned its way to combat such risks. The first and foremost challenge (and the oldest) is the content and interaction. The inappropriate messages have been my personal fear on Tinder. In addition to the existing techniques like photo verification, option to unmatch and block contacts, Tinder has also released a handful of new AI-powered features.  – Are you sure: Using Tinder, I have always wondered if there could have been a way to just people using inappropriate words or something related. And guess what, this feature actually prompts the sender to re-read his/her text before sending. Essentially, “Are you sure” feature is powered by AI that identifies bad or creepy messages and informs users to rethink it. While it cannot hold the user back from sending it, it definitely helps in some parts.  – Does it bother you: Even after the Are You Sure prompt, if the sender decides to send the text anyway, the receiver has always had an option to report or unmatch the person. Now renamed as “Does it bother you”, the feature helps space out the users who you think are bothering you. But these are just the first degree threats. The severity increases when the users move-out of Tinder and meet face-to-face. The increased number of adversities and several Crime Petrol episodes later, all of us have realised how meeting a Tinder match can go into a different direction. And so has Tinder. And that’s where the new Share my date feature comes in.  – Share my date: Tinder has rolled out a feature that lets you share details about your upcoming dates with trusted contacts like friends and family, including the location, date, time, and a photo of their match. This feature essentially acts as a safety tool by letting others know where you will be and who you are meeting up with. And it does not stop here. If by any chance, things go wrong, Tinder has a global law enforcement and legal investigation team that work with the local prosecution. Citing this, Dr Roth shared that during the meet-up, one of the most prominent cases is the restaurant scam.  He explains how the users work in-collaboration with the restaurants and use Tinder to scam people. Basically, these users cheat on their victims by making them believe that it is a real date, but in fact they were working for the restaurant. On the date, they order in large proportion and leave the bill of their victim. In this case, the legal team can help even if this scam has been reported after the culprit has been unmatched.  Dr Roth says that if reported on time, it can not only help the victim but also the future targets. He claims that Tinder has technology to remove “44 fake accounts per minute”. Now, even after such advanced tech, users’ steps matter the most. It is of utmost importance how the user is handling the platform. And to make it better, Tinder is providing a course on how to approach in a healthy way.  – Let’s Talk Consent: The Dating Safety Guide teaches why consent is key to making dating experiences better, whether online or in person. Basically, this guide is to make you a better person and teach you how to treat others with respect (the basic stuff). Let’s Talk Consent is a course that is available on Coursera by Tinder and Yuvaa NGO. Published By: Published On: Feb 7, 2025Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

It may also come with free Google service subscriptions for early buyers.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/pixel-9a-price-leaked-ahead-of-march-launch-2676297-2025-02-07,"Google will reportedly launch its next smartphone, the Pixel 9a, in March. Reports suggest that the handset will arrive in Europe and the US on the same day, March 19, with sales beginning a week later on March 26. According to a report from Dealabs, the Pixel 9a will start at EUR 549 (roughly Rs. 50,000) in Europe for the 128GB model, while the 256GB version will cost EUR 649 (roughly Rs. 58,000). In the UK, the phone is expected to be priced at GBP 499 (roughly Rs. 54,000) for 128GB and GBP 599 (roughly Rs. 65,000) for 256GB. According to an earlier report by Android Headlines, the US pricing of the Pixel 9a is tipped to start at $499 (roughly Rs 43,200) for the 128GB storage option, while the 256GB storage will cost $599 (roughly Rs 51,900). For those opting for Verizon’s mmWave model, an additional $50 will be added to the aforementioned prices. These prices are in line with the Pixel 8a’s starting price in the USA, though the higher storage option is slightly more expensive this time around. Of course, the Pixel 9a price should be different once it launches in India. For perspective, the Google Pixel 8a launched in India for Rs 52,999 and Rs 59,999 for the 128GB and 256GB storage variants respectively. The Pixel 9a is expected to be powered by Google’s Tensor G4 processor, the same chip found in the flagship Pixel 9 series. Along with 8GB LPDDR5X RAM, it is likely to offer 256GB of internal storage. A Titan M2 security chip is also rumoured to be included for added protection. The device is said to feature a 6.3-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and Gorilla Glass 3 protection. On the camera front, the Pixel 9a is tipped to sport a 48-megapixel primary sensor and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera. Battery life could also see an upgrade, with reports suggesting a 5,100mAh battery that supports 23W wired charging and 7.5W wireless charging. The phone is also expected to come with an IP68 rating, meaning better dust and water resistance than previous Pixel A-series models. The 128GB model is tipped to launch in four colours — Iris, Obsidian, Peony, and Porcelain — while the 256GB variant will only be available in Iris and Obsidian. In an interesting move, Google might bundle free service subscriptions with the Pixel 9a, similar to what it offers with its flagship models. Buyers may get Fitbit Premium for six months along with YouTube Premium and Google One (100GB cloud storage) for three months.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

The reason for this is the overall package of powerful hardware and a solid performance that OnePlus is offering with its flagship smartphones. But the series is not completed yet. Whispers suggest that OnePlus is planning to launch a new mini variant, and this speculated that the OnePlus 13 Mini could become a compelling option for users seeking high-end features in a smaller form factor. OnePlus industrial designer Lao Haoran, in his recent post on Weibo, announced that the year 2025 will be a major overhaul for its phones. Following his announcement, rumours flooded the internet, suggesting that OnePlus is developing a new mini variant—OnePlus 13 Mini. This new variant is expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite with 7 cores—the same chipset that fuels the flagship OnePlus 13. This also hints that the OnePlus 13 Mini—though a relatively smaller device in size, as suggested by its name—will not compromise on power and will be equally capable as the flagship variants, while rivaling compact flagships like the Galaxy S25.  Along with a powerful display, the OnePlus 13 Mini is also speculated to feature a 6.31-inch LTPO OLED panel with a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Design-wise, the OnePlus 13 Mini is likely to be the first to embody OnePlus’s new design philosophy, featuring a glass back and a metal frame for a premium look and feel. The flat screen design, combined with ultra-slim bezels, is expected to offer an immersive viewing experience to users despite its compact form factor. For security, the display is also said to include an optical in-display fingerprint scanner. In addition to its compact design, powerful processor, and immersive display, the OnePlus 13 Mini is also said to offer equally capable photography features. Initially, leaks suggested that the OnePlus 13 Mini would come with a triple-camera setup. However, fresh reports from tipster Digital Chat Station suggest that the phone will instead feature a dual-camera system. This dual-camera setup in the OnePlus 13 Mini will reportedly include a 50-megapixel primary sensor and a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. The rear camera module is expected to be arranged vertically in a bar-shaped design, giving the phone a distinctive aesthetic. Under the hood, while the battery capacity remains under wraps, the phone is expected to support wireless charging.OnePlus 13 mini India and global availability Although rumors suggest the OnePlus 13 Mini is expected to launch in China next month, it remains unclear whether the device will be made available in global markets. While some reports suggest it will be exclusive to the Chinese market, the global release is also highly anticipated.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Also Read |  iPad is leading tablet market with over 42% market share, sees impressive annual growthAlso Read |  Mumbai man loses Rs 11 lakh after getting call about illegal parcelAlso Read |  Tech Layoffs 2025: Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce continue job cuts amid restructuring efforts

3a2d9b27-f5e7-418b-bc21-2e3ce2364e12,What is zero-click hack that can can compromise your WhatsApp accountWhatsApp recently revealed that nearly 90 of its users across more than two dozen countries have been targeted by hackers using zero click hack. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/what-is-zero-click-hack-that-can-can-compromise-your-whatsapp-account-2676461-2025-02-07,"We are living in a digital age and spending hours juggling between apps and platforms to get our personal and professional work done. However, with our growing presence in digital spaces, the threat is also increasing. We are seeing scams, hacking attempts, and whatnot. To stay safe, netizens are always advised not to click on suspicious links, open suspicious files, or download anything that looks fishy. But what if we tell you there's a new hacking scheme where attackers steal credentials without even asking the target victim to click a link or download a file? Well, this is called a Zero-Click Hack. WhatsApp recently revealed to Reuters that nearly 90 users across more than two dozen countries have been targeted by hackers using advanced spyware developed by the Israeli company Paragon Solutions. This spyware allowed attackers to access the target system's information without needing any clicks from the victim. In fact, the spyware targeted all sorts of individuals, including journalists and members of civil society. According to WhatsApp, the company has sent Paragon a cease-and-desist letter following the hack. ""We will continue to protect people's ability to communicate privately,"" said the Meta-owned company in a statement to Reuters. But how is this even possible—being attacked by malware without clicking any links or downloading anything malicious? What exactly is Zero-Click Hack? As the name suggests, a zero-click hack is a sophisticated cyberattack that allows hackers to infiltrate a user's device without any interaction from the target. Unlike traditional phishing attempts that require users to click malicious links or download infected files, zero-click attacks exploit software vulnerabilities to gain access stealthily. hackers reportedly exploited weaknesses in messaging apps, email clients, or multimedia processing functions. They sent malicious electronic documents that compromised devices without requiring users to open or interact with them. In WhatsApp’s case the hackers exploited the messaging app’s vulnerabilities.  This sneaky method makes zero-click attacks particularly dangerous and difficult to detect. These attacks are sometimes referred to as zero-click exploits, interaction-less attacks, or fully remote attacks.How Zero-Click attacks work When targeted individuals receive these malicious files, the device’s operating system or application unwittingly processes them, giving hackers access to sensitive data, including messages, calls, photos, and even the microphone and camera. The hackers then easily steal all the required data from the infected system. How to stay safe WhatsApp has assured users that it successfully disrupted the hacking effort and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Paragon Solutions. The company reaffirmed its commitment to protecting user privacy. However, it is still important to remain aware and vigilant about growing threats online and follow necessary security precautions across apps and platforms. While zero-click attacks are difficult for individuals to prevent, here are a few safety tips to reduce the risk: – Always keep your apps updated. New updates not only bring new features but also fix bugs and vulnerabilities.  – Also enable automatic updates to ensure security patches are installed as soon as they are available. – Stay vigilant for signs of device compromise, such as sudden battery drainage, unexpected app behavior, or strange messages from unknown users. – If you suspect your device has been compromised, report it to the Cyber Cell immediately.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Also Read |  OnePlus 13 mini arriving next month?

According to the latest teasers, the phone's inner display will feature a nearly invisible crease, which is a big claim from the company.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oppo-find-n5-aka-oneplus-open-2-teased-in-new-images-2676962-2025-02-08,"Oppo is expected to launch the Find N5, aka the OnePlus Open 2, in a couple of weeks, and the teasers keep coming. According to Oppo’s Chief Product Officer, Pete Lau, the Find N5 will feature a nearly invisible crease — a big claim, considering we are talking about a foldable phone. That said, Lau might not be wrong after all, as early images suggest the crease — while still there — appears much less noticeable compared to the previous generation. The OnePlus Open 2, expected to be a rebranded version of the Oppo Find N5 for global markets, will likely share the same advancements. The first OnePlus Open already had one of the least visible creases among foldable phones, but this time, Oppo seems to be pushing things even further. A recently shared image of the Find N5 places it side by side with what appears to be the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6, highlighting the difference in the visibility of the creases. Beyond the crease, another major takeaway is the device’s ultra-thin profile. Oppo’s executives have repeatedly emphasised that the Find N5 will be the world’s slimmest foldable. If the leaks are accurate, the Find N5 — and by extension, the OnePlus Open 2 — could take the title from the Honor Magic V3, which currently measures 4.35mm when unfolded and 9.2mm when folded. The new Oppo foldable is rumoured to be even slimmer, coming in at around 4mm when unfolded. However, the design isn’t changing too much. Based on leaked images, the Find N5 will retain the relatively thick bezels of its predecessor. The selfie camera is expected to stay in the top-right corner of the inner display. Another notable design choice is the circular camera module, which resembles that of the Oppo Find X8 Pro and the original OnePlus Open. Hasselblad branding remains a key feature, and a periscope telephoto lens is expected as part of the camera setup. Oppo has also made changes to the placement of microphones and speakers, which could hint at improved audio quality. Meanwhile, leaks suggest the Find N5 might use a titanium frame, making it lighter without compromising strength. Under the hood, the OnePlus Open 2 is expected to come with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a 6,000mAh battery, and support for satellite communication. Wireless charging is another rumoured addition, a feature that was missing from the first OnePlus Open. Expected colour options include black, white, and possibly more. With the Find N5’s official debut expected around February 19 or 20, it won’t be long before we see if Oppo’s claims hold up in real-world use. If the crease really is as minimal as the teasers suggest and the ultra-thin design delivers on its promises, the Find N5 and OnePlus Open 2 could set new standards for foldables in 2025.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 8, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

Ahead of the expected launch, several details about the device have leaked. Here is everything we know about the fourth-generation iPhone SE, so far.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-to-launch-this-week-india-price-specs-key-features-and-all-we-know-so-far-2677399-2025-02-10,"After the iPhone 17 Air, if there is another iPhone generating a similar level of anticipation, then it’s not the 2025 Apple flagships, but the iPhone SE 4. Apple fans have been waiting a long time for the tech giant to update the iPhone SE, but this has taken a while. However, there have been so many rumours and leaks along the way, that the anticipation for the upcoming iPhone SE 4 has only grown. Especially with the kind of upgrades that have been rumoured, including a shift to FaceID (finally!), an OLED panel, an iPhone 14-like design, and the fact that it is believed to be the most affordable iPhone to feature Apple Intelligence. Affordable being the operative word here. Apple has yet to confirm anything about the iPhone SE 4’s launch timeline, but there was a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman last week that suggested that the affordable iPhone SE 4 could launch as soon as this week. We still don’t have a single date yet. The report also suggests that the new iPhone will become available for purchase by the end of this month. That said, unlike the usual Apple fanfare, this is not expected to be a grand event. Instead, like Apple launched the iPads quietly with just a press release, the iPhone SE 4 may also see a soft launch. iPhone SE 4: Key features expected One of the biggest changes expected with the iPhone SE 4 is its design. When you think of the iPhone SE-series, you think of that tiny iPhone with thick bezels, and a TouchID home button at the bottom of the screen. However, this year, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to get a major design overhaul. The iPhone SE 4 is believed to look like the iPhone 14. It is also expected to replace TouchID in favour of FaceID.  Some iPhone SE 4 images have also leaked in the past, which show that the iPhone could come with a single-camera setup, which will imitate the typical SE design. However, the camera is also expected to get a big upgrade, but we will come to that in a minute.  The iPhone SE 4 is also expected to leave behind the round edges design. Instead, it will have a more boxy design with rounded edges. The power button on the phone is expected to remain on the right side, just like the iPhone 14. Coming to the camera upgrade we mentioned, the iPhone SE 4 is believed to get a substantial upgrade in that department. The iPhone rear camera is expected to be bumped up to a 48-megapixel sensor from the iPhone SE 3’s 12-megapixel camera. On the front, the iPhone SE 4 is said to sport a 24-megapixel camera. The iPhone SE 4 will reportedly also get a much-needed upgrade in the display department. Improving from the LCD screen in the iPhone SE 3, the iPhone SE 4 is rumoured to feature an OLED display. The display is also going to get bigger, apparently. The iPhone SE 3 had a 4.7-inch display, but the iPhone SE 4 is said to sport a 6.1-inch OLED screen, with support for 60Hz refresh rate.  Rumours are mixed on the dynamic island. Some reports suggest that, like the Pro variant of the iPhone 14 series, the iPhone SE 4 will also feature a dynamic island. However, many reports suggest there would be no dynamic island. However, we believe the dynamic island could be a possibility, considering the iPhone SE 4 is expected to pack the powered A18 chip, which we saw in the iPhone 16 series last year. The affordable iPhone is also expected to come with 8GB RAM. With the new A18 chip, the iPhone SE 4 is also believed to feature Apple Intelligence, which is another expected highlight of the purported phone, considering this would make it the most affordable iPhone to feature Apple Intelligence.iPhone SE 4: Expected price in India Pricing remains a critical part of the iPhone SE 4’s appeal. Some reports suggest that the iPhone SE 4 will be priced starting at $499, which is about Rs 44,000. Which is pretty much the same as the launch price of the iPhone SE 3 in India that debuted at Rs 43,900. However, the smartphone later saw a price hike to Rs 49,900 due to increased taxes.

Meanwhile, it will also accelerate the hiring of machine learning engineers. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-plans-to-layoff-5-per-cent-of-employees-starting-today-2677398-2025-02-10,"Facebook’s parent company, Meta Platforms, is set to initiate company-wide layoffs this week. Reuters has reported that the company will send notices to employees starting at 5AM PST, starting today. According to the internal memos obtained by Reuters, Mark Zuckerberg's company will also accelerate the hiring of machine learning engineers, simultaneously. It also states that the layoffs will affect most countries, including the US.  That said, employees in Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands will be exempt from these layoffs due to local labor regulations. In contrast, employees in more than a dozen other countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa will receive their notifications between February 11 and February 18.   Meta previously confirmed that it planned to cut approximately 5 per cent of its workforce, targeting ""lowest performers,"" with some positions being refilled. In the memo, the company referred to the cuts as “performance terminations,” a term first reported by The Information.    Unlike previous rounds of company-wide layoffs, Meta has decided to keep its offices open on Monday and will not issue any further details on the decisions, according to a memo from Meta’s Head of People, Janelle Gale.  Meanwhile, in a separate memo posted on Friday, Peng Fan, Meta’s VP of Engineering for Monetization, urged employees to assist in an expedited hiring process for machine learning engineers and other “business-critical” engineering positions. This accelerated hiring push is scheduled to take place between February 11 and March 13.   The wave of job cuts extends beyond Meta, impacting several major tech companies in 2025. Google implemented a voluntary exit program for employees in its US Platforms and Devices division, affecting teams within Android and Pixel. The company, just like Meta, sent a memo to its team, stating, ""This comes after we brought two large organisations together last year."" It added, ""There’s tremendous momentum in this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” Microsoft has also ramped up performance-based layoffs, reportedly dismissing underperforming employees, in some cases without severance. The terminated employees under this round of layoffs were facing a range of consequences, with some reportedly indicating that they might not have received severance pay. According to the reports, at least three employees confirmed that they were told they would not be compensated upon their exit from the company. Additionally, their healthcare benefits were also immediately cut off, raising questions about Microsoft's approach to handling these layoffs, especially in terms of financial and post-employment support. Amazon has eliminated approximately 200 positions in its fashion and fitness divisions as it refocuses priorities within its North America Stores team. The move is Amazon's part of a broader strategy to cut bureaucracy and improve the company's efficiency, helping teams move faster and get closer to customers.

These concerns intensified after it was discovered that a database containing sensitive user information was left exposed without authentication.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/deepseek-r1-recent-findings-reveal-multiple-security-flaws-in-ios-app-2677442-2025-02-10,"DeepSeek is once again facing scrutiny — this time over multiple security vulnerabilities that could put users’ privacy at risk. According to a report by mobile security firm NowSecure, DeepSeek R1 — DeepSeek’s iOS app — has several flaws, including the disabling of key security protections and the use of outdated encryption methods. These concerns intensified after it was discovered that a database containing sensitive user information — including chat logs and secret keys — was left exposed without authentication. This meant anyone could access the data without needing credentials, raising concerns over how the company was handling private user information.  One of the major issues highlighted in the report is the app’s failure to use Apple’s built-in App Transport Security (ATS), a system designed to ensure that personal data is transmitted securely over encrypted channels. Instead, DeepSeek has completely disabled this protection, allowing unencrypted data to be sent over the internet. According to NowSecure, “The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS), which is an iOS platform level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels. Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet.” Additionally, even when data is encrypted, the app relies on the outdated Triple DES (3DES) encryption algorithm, which is widely considered insecure. ""The encryption algorithm chosen for this part of the application leverages a known broken encryption algorithm (3DES) which makes it a poor choice to protect the confidentiality of data,"" the report states. Experts warn that even seemingly harmless user data, when collected over time, can be used to identify individuals. ""While none of this data taken separately is highly risky, the aggregation of many data points over time quickly leads to easily identifying individuals,"" the report explains. A recent example of this was the data breach of Gravy Analytics, where information collected from various apps was used to de-anonymise users on a large scale. This raises serious questions about how DeepSeek handles data security, particularly since much of the collected information could be cross-referenced with data from other apps. ""Bear in mind that not only are 10’s of data points collected in the DeepSeek iOS app but related data is collected from millions of apps and can be easily purchased, combined and then correlated to quickly de-anonymize users,"" the report warns. Given the scope of these security flaws, NowSecure is urging businesses, government agencies, and individuals to reconsider using the app until significant improvements are made.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-pixel-9a-release-date-leaked-india-price-specs-and-more-2677427-2025-02-10,"Google is all set to launch its next-gen 'a' series phone-- the Google Pixel 9a. After launching its predecessor, Pixel 8a, in May 2024, the company is expected to bring several upgrades with the new entry. For instance, the Pixel 9a is to arrive with Google's Tensor G4 chip, and a 48-megapixel primary camera. According to the latest leak, the release date and the sale date are also out, but only for the Europe and US markets for now. advertisementGoogle Pixel 9a: Launch date The Google Pixel 9a is expected to launch on March 19 and might go live on sale on Match 26, 2025. These dates are true for both the US and European markets. But what about India? Based on the previous releases, like Pixel 8a and Pixel 9, the phones debuted at the same time across the globe, including in India and the US. This indicates that the Google Pixel 9a might also follow the same. Hence, the Indian market could witness the Google Pixel 9a launch on March 19.

This indicates that the Google Pixel 9a might also follow the same.  Hence, the Indian market could witness the Google Pixel 9a launch on March 19.  Google Pixel 9a: India price (expected) According to previous reports, the Google Pixel 9a will be priced at $499 (approximately Rs 43,100) in the US for the 128GB variant, while the 256GB model will cost $599 (around Rs 51,800). The base model maintains the same price as its predecessor, the Pixel 8a, but the higher storage variant sees a $40 (roughly Rs 3,400) increase.    In India, the Pixel 8a debuted at Rs 52,999 for the base model and Rs 59,999 for the 256GB version. If Google follows a similar pricing strategy, the Pixel 9a is expected to start at Rs 52,999, with the 256GB model potentially reaching Rs 64,000. This would result in a price gap of over Rs 10,000 between the two storage options.Google Pixel 9a: What to expect  The Google Pixel 9a is expected to be powered by the Tensor G4 chipset, the same processor used in the flagship Pixel 9 series. It will likely feature 8GB of LPDDR5X RAM and offer up to 256GB of internal storage. Security enhancements may include the Titan M2 chip for added protection.   The device is rumoured to sport a 6.3-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 3. Tipster Evan Blass recently leaked an image labelled “9a,” showcasing the front profile of the mid-range Pixel. The design appears to share similarities with the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, including rounded corners and what seems to be a slightly larger front-facing camera. Antenna lines are also visible along the frame.

 For photography, the Pixel 9a is expected to house a 48-megapixel primary camera alongside a 13-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. Battery life could see an improvement, with reports hinting at a 5,100mAh battery that supports 23W wired charging and 7.5W wireless charging. Additionally, the phone is likely to come with an IP68 rating, offering better dust and water resistance compared to previous Pixel A-series models.   Colour options for the 128GB variant may include Iris, Obsidian, Peony, and Porcelain, while the 256GB model is expected to be available only in Iris and Obsidian.   In a noteworthy move, Google might bundle complimentary service subscriptions with the Pixel 9a, similar to its flagship offerings. Buyers could receive six months of Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium and Google One (100GB cloud storage).Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Also read |  Latest leaked live photos of Oppo Find N5 aka OnePlus Open 2 reveal new detailsAlso read |  iPhone SE 4 to launch this week?

With its rumoured launch date set for around February 20, more leaks have surfaced online, giving us a closer look at what to expect from the device. In the latest update, live photos of the phone have been making the rounds on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, revealing key aspects of its design, build, and overall aesthetics.

 One of the standout features in the leaked images is the phone’s impressively thin profile. Oppo has been heavily teasing this aspect, and the photos confirm that the Find N5 could indeed be one of the slimmest foldables on the market. The brushed metal frame looks quite premium, while the overall design appears sleek. The images also give us a clear look at the phone’s buttons, including the alert slider, so we guess, no iPhone 16-like Action button.  The retail box has also been spotted in some of the leaks, alongside what appears to be an official case for the device. The case snaps onto the back of the phone and covers the hinge area neatly.

advertisement As for the display, the crease — a common concern with foldable phones — seems to be less noticeable compared to previous models. While it’s still visible at certain angles, Oppo’s claims of a nearly invisible crease appear to hold some weight. Early comparisons with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 suggest that the Find N5 might have an edge in this department.

 Under the hood, the Oppo Find N5 aka the OnePlus Open 2 is rumoured to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. This is likely to be paired with a 6,000mAh battery, which should provide plenty of juice for all-day use. Additionally, wireless charging and satellite communication support are said to be part of the package, addressing two notable omissions from the first-generation OnePlus Open. The camera setup is expected to feature a circular module that resembles the design seen on the Oppo Find X8 Pro and the original OnePlus Open. Hasselblad branding could still be present. Additionally, a periscope telephoto lens is also expected. Colour options are likely to include classic choices like black and white, with the possibility of additional variants. The use of a titanium frame, as suggested by leaks, could make the device lighter without sacrificing durability.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

The company has announced that it will unveil the phone on February 20 at 4.00 PM GMT (9.30 PM IST). Oppo has also unveiled that this launch is not only limited to China's borders, but it will be a global launch. The global event is scheduled to take place in Singapore. Ahead of the launch, the company has shared a glimpse of its upcoming phone. It also claims that the Oppo Find N5 is the slimmest foldable phone so far.
 


 Before we dive deeper into the details, let's find out whether it will also arrive in India?Oppo Find N5 launch: Will it come to India?  Oppo has announced its global event to unveil the upcoming Oppo Find N5 on February 20. While it says global, there is no trace of this teaser on the Oppo India website. This suggests that while the Oppo Find N5 will launch in countries apart from China, it is not to launch in India. 
 


 But nothing to worry about. Based on the previous trends, the Oppo Find N5 is expected to be rebranded as the OnePlus Open 2 and will be launched in India. Latest reports suggest that the OnePlus Open 2 will launch by the second half of 2025. Oppo Find N5 aka OnePlus Open 2: What to expect Oppo’s Chief Product Officer, Pete Lau, has previously claimed that the upcoming Find N5 will feature an almost imperceptible crease—an impressive feat for a foldable phone. While some may be skeptical, early images suggest that the crease, though still present, is significantly less noticeable than in previous models.   The OnePlus Open 2, expected to be a rebranded global version of the Oppo Find N5, will likely incorporate the same design improvements. The first-generation OnePlus Open already had one of the least visible creases among foldable phones, but Oppo appears to be refining this aspect even further. A recently surfaced image places the Find N5 alongside what seems to be the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, clearly illustrating the difference in crease visibility.    Beyond the crease, another standout feature is the Find N5’s exceptionally slim design. Oppo executives have consistently emphasised that it will be the world’s thinnest foldable. If leaks hold true, the Find N5—and consequently, the OnePlus Open 2—could surpass the Honor Magic V3, which currently holds the title at 4.35mm when unfolded and 9.2mm when folded. Reports suggest that Oppo’s new foldable could be even slimmer, measuring approximately 4mm when unfolded.   Despite these refinements, the overall design remains largely unchanged. Official images indicate that the Find N5 will retain its relatively thick bezels, while the inner display’s selfie camera is expected to remain in the top-right corner. The device will also feature a circular camera module, similar to the Oppo Find X8 Pro and the original OnePlus Open, with Hasselblad branding still present. A periscope telephoto lens is also rumoured to be part of the camera system.   Oppo has reportedly adjusted the positioning of microphones and speakers, hinting at improved audio performance. Additionally, leaks suggest the Find N5 might feature a titanium frame, reducing weight while maintaining durability.   Under the hood, the OnePlus Open 2 is expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, accompanied by a massive 6,000mAh battery and support for satellite communication. Another potential upgrade is wireless charging, a feature absent in the first OnePlus Open. The device is rumoured to launch in black, white, and possibly additional colour options.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Also read |  Google Pixel 9a release date leaked: India price, specs and moreAlso read |  iPhone SE 4 to launch this week?

Altman also expressed concerns about the balance of power between capital and labour, suggesting that early intervention might be needed to prevent inequalities. He floated the idea of giving people access to more AI resources, though he acknowledged it could sound unconventional.Meta recently confirmed plans to replace mid-level engineers with AI Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg just recently announced that AI at Meta and other tech companies will effectively replace mid-level engineers who currently write code this year. This would likely change how tech companies approach software development. ""We will get to a point where all the code in our apps and the AI it generates will also be written by AI engineers instead of people engineers,"" he said. For context, a report recently claimed that mid-level software engineers at Meta currently earn salaries in the mid-six figures — a cost AI could significantly reduce.Google is already using AI to generate codes Just a few months back, Google CEO Sundar Pichai also announced that over 25 per cent of all new code at Google is now generated by AI, with human engineers stepping in for final reviews.  While all the big tech companies are assuring that this won't impact humans, only time will tell whether human jobs will be reduced because of AI. The companies are already firing thousands of employees in the name of cost-saving or performance issues. If AI successfully manages to take the place of humans, the companies won't likely take a lot of time to replace them with virtual AI models. But, of course, this might only affect the people who do mid-level engineering jobs. All these AI developments suggest that it might be time for humans to upskill themselves to remain employed at big tech companies.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 10, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/amazon-and-microsoft-reportedly-eye-tiktok-acquisition-elon-musk-says-not-interested-2677520-2025-02-10,"The uncertainty over TikTok’s future in the US is looming. Meanwhile, a somewhat battle has intensified with tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle showing interest in acquiring the company’s US operations. This comes after the US president, Donald Trump, while extending the TikTok ban in the US, said he would like TikTok’s US operations to remain under American control. And the way to do that is that the company’s operation in India is acquired by another US tech company. To foolproof the plan, Trump also signed an executive order this month to create a sovereign wealth fund that is aimed to facilitate the purchase of TikTok. According to reports, Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle have privately explored ways to either acquire TikTok or take over its US operations, but that’s not the option TikTok is looking for apparently. TikTok is reportedly looking for an alternative option that would avoid an outright sale of its US operations. Reportedly, TikTok is talking about a plan to protect American data –– which is the key contention in this case –– through an independent US-based entity. TikTok CEO reportedly met with senior White House officials last week to suggest a plan to form a joint venture with US investors, that could be headquartered in the US, to oversee data security. This way, the company would have management that is based out of the US, and its board of directors would primarily be Americans. With the whole sovereign fund involved, it is still unclear if the US government would also be an investor. Meanwhile, US vice president JD Vance is now in charge of overseeing negotiations, making use of his background in venture capital and ties to Silicon Valley, to help find a solution to the TikTok problem.Elon Musk says he has no interest in acquiring TikTok Ever since the talk of the TikTok ban and Trump’s solution of keeping its operations in the US began, there have been rumours that Elon Musk will eventually buy the platform. However, recently speaking at a virtual summit, Musk dismissed rumours that China was willing to sell TikTok to him. This came after reports in January suggested that officials in China were discussing the possibility of offloading TikTok to Musk as a means of avoiding a US ban. ByteDance, however, has repeatedly denied these reports. A company spokesperson called these reports “pure fiction.”  The Trump administration is doing everything to keep TikTok in the US while addressing the national security concern. As soon as Donald Trump took over as the new US president, one of the first things he did was to extend the TikTok US ban by 75 days. Originally set to take effect in January, the deadline for the ban has now been extended to April 2025.

But now, the upcoming flagships might do away with it. A new report indicates that the next-gen OnePlus flagships will do away with the toggle bar and bring a button for these tasks. The rumour has it that this button will function just like the iPhone's action button. A tipster, Digital Chat Station on Weibo has stated that the three-stage button (the toggle bar) will be replaced on the next flagship phone. This could debut in March, which could mean the OnePlus 14. 
 


advertisementOnePlus to launch iPhone-like action buttonThe upcoming OnePlus button is expected to be multi-functional, allowing users to customise it for various tasks. Similarly, Apple's Action Button on the iPhone 16 can be remapped beyond its default settings. Originally introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro models as a replacement for the traditional ring-silent switch, the Action Button enables users to toggle between silent, vibrate, and ring modes, activate Do Not Disturb and Focus modes, launch the camera or flashlight, trigger Shazam, and access favourite shortcuts in Control Center.  Following the same philosophy, OnePlus seems to be moving toward a more versatile approach with its new button. While longtime fans of the classic three-position alert slider may be disappointed, just like iPhone users were. But a customisable button could prove more practical for a broader audience.advertisement The upcoming OnePlus button is expected to be multi-functional, allowing users to customise it for various tasks.

Notably, this isn’t the first time OnePlus has moved away from its signature mute switch. The OnePlus 10T also lacked the alert slider, with the company justifying its removal as a necessary engineering trade-off to accommodate faster charging, a larger battery, and an improved antenna system. It remains to be seen what rationale OnePlus will provide for this latest change. That said, the OnePlus Open 2 is most likely to come with a slider. According to previous trends, the recently announced Oppo Find N5 will be rebranded as OnePlus Open 2. And the latest official images of the Oppo foldable show that the phone has a toggle bar.  On that note, Oppo Find N5 is confirmed to be unveiled on February 20. The company claims that the foldable will be the slimmest foldable so far. Apart from the launch date and a video, the company is yet to reveal more information. But the rumours and leaks have got us covered. Read all about the upcoming Oppo Find N5 here.

The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it sent an official notice to government agencies last week urging them to take security precautions over the artificial intelligence app. ""Unlike other generative AI services, it has been confirmed that chat records are transferable as it includes a function to collect keyboard input patterns that can identify individuals and communicate with Chinese companies' servers such as volceapplog.com,"" the NIS said in a statement issued on Sunday. Some government ministries in South Korea have blocked access to the app citing security concerns, joining Australia and Taiwan in warning about or placing restrictions on DeepSeek. The NIS said DeepSeek gives advertisers unlimited access to user data and stores South Korean users' data in Chinese servers. Under Chinese law, the Chinese government would be able to access such information when requested, the agency added. DeepSeek also provided different answers to potentially sensitive questions in different languages, the NIS noted. It cited one such question as asking for the origin of kimchi - a spicy, fermented dish that is a staple in South Korea. When asked about it in Korean, the app said kimchi is a Korean dish, the NIS said. Asked the same question in Chinese, it said the dish originated from China, it said. DeepSeek's responses were corroborated by Reuters. The origin of kimchi has at times been a source of contention between South Koreans and Chinese social media users in recent years. DeepSeek has also been accused of censoring responses to political questions such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, which prompt the app to suggest changing the subject: ""Let's talk about something else."" DeepSeek did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. When asked about moves by South Korean government departments to block DeepSeek, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told a briefing on February 6 that the Chinese government attached great importance to data privacy and security and protected it in accordance with the law. The spokesperson also said Beijing would never ask any company or individual to collect or store data in breach of laws.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Feb 10, 2025

479bcb0e-40ed-4b95-9b87-eed7fa80d797,What is satellite connectivity on smartphones that Airtel and Jio are working onSeveral smartphones and telecom providers are working to provide satellite connectivity. This feature aims to provide better connections even in remote areas. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/explained-what-is-satellite-connectivity-on-smartphones-that-airtel-and-jio-are-working-on-2677632-2025-02-10,"Satellite connectivity on smartphones is a hot topic these days. It started with iPhone 14 in 2022 when Apple introduced satellite communication to phones. Since then, companies have been trying to work around it. But what is this feature, and how does it work? The satellite connectivity feature is designed to enable users to contact emergency services via SOS messages, even in locations without cellular coverage. While brands like Google and Samsung have also adopted the technology, it remains a niche offering, limited to specific regions and a handful of smartphone models. Let's look at it in detail. advertisementWhat is satellite connectivity and how does it work? First things first, mobile satellite connectivity is not the same as using a satellite phone, also known as a satphone. While satphones rely entirely on satellites to make calls and send messages, they are bulkier, more expensive, and designed for people travelling to extremely remote areas where traditional networks don’t work.  In India, BSNL is among the satphones sellers. However, smartphones are solely dependent on cellular networks. But with satellite connectivity, a regular smartphone will also work as a satphone. This means that it can easily connect users to a satellite network in emergencies when there’s no cellular coverage.

In India, BSNL is among the satphones sellers.  However, smartphones are solely dependent on cellular networks. But with satellite connectivity, a regular smartphone will also work as a satphone. This means that it can easily connect users to a satellite network in emergencies when there’s no cellular coverage.  Currently, most satellite connectivity features on smartphones are limited to SOS messaging. However, in the near future, two-way messaging is expected to become available, and eventually, internet data transmission may also be possible. While satellite connectivity is yet to come, when it does, smartphones will not depend on ground-based cell towers. It will directly connect to a network of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to transmit data.Satellite connectivity in India In India, telecom giants Airtel and Jio are actively working to introduce satellite-based services. Airtel has joined forces with OneWeb, while Jio has partnered with SES. However, the rollout faces challenges due to an ongoing debate over satellite spectrum allocation. Companies like Starlink support administrative allocation for quicker deployment, whereas Airtel and Jio advocate for an auction-based system to promote fair competition. But US is a step ahead. After launching satellite connectivity in beta phase, T-mobile in collaboration with Elon Musk’s Starlink is set to release the Satellite texting feature for all. But, according to a Bloomberg report, it comes at a cost. It has been confirmed that T-mobiles and Elon Musk’s Starlink will soon launch a satellite texting feature for everyone, but at a price. The program is available only in the US for now, unlike Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in multiple countries.  The report states that starting in July, direct-to-cell Starlink service will be free for T-Mobile's priciest Go5G Next plan, and $15 per month for everyone else. On AT&T and Verizon, however, it'll be pricier, $20 per month per line. Smartphones with satellite connectivity in India  While the telecom companies are working for satellite connectivity, it is also important to know which smartphones have this feature and which are also in progress.  Apple introduced satellite connectivity with the iPhone 14 series and later models through a partnership with US-based satellite provider Globalstar. This feature allows iPhones to connect with emergency services using specialised antennas.   Similarly, Google launched the Satellite SOS feature on the Pixel 9 series last year in collaboration with Skylo. The Pixel 9 series supports satellite connectivity thanks to Samsung’s Exynos 5400 modem.   Samsung has also been working on satellite technology. While the Galaxy S24 series includes the same Exynos 5400 modem as the Pixel 9, it does not yet support satellite communication. However, the newly released Galaxy S25 series is built with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X80 5G modem inside the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, making it capable of supporting the feature. Reports suggest Samsung may soon enable a satellite-based SOS function on these devices.  That said, it all boils down to users and is it really needed? For now, satellite connectivity seems like an attractive option-- and for good reasons. This feature will be a great help, especially in remote areas. It looks like this is not only an achievement in the tech area, but for safety purposes as well.

While this tech won’t be part of the upcoming AirPods Pro 3 expected later this year, it could arrive as early as 2027. But why would Apple want to put cameras on a pair of wireless earbuds? There seem to be two main reasons: AI-driven features and better spatial audio integration. Apple recently introduced Visual Intelligence with the iPhone 16 lineup. This feature helps users interact with their surroundings in new ways, such as identifying objects, reading event flyers, and adding information to apps. The idea is that AirPods with cameras could take this even further. Gurman suggests that Apple wants to use small cameras in AirPods to analyse the environment and provide information to users. Instead of pulling out your iPhone to ask Siri about something, you could simply ask your AirPods while wearing them. This could bring a new level of convenience for hands-free interactions, whether you’re looking for directions, identifying landmarks, or even getting real-time translations. While this might sound like smart glasses without the glasses, Apple reportedly sees it as a way to improve everyday usability while keeping the technology discreet. For users who aren’t ready to wear augmented reality glasses like Meta’s Ray-Bans or Apple’s own Vision Pro, this could be a middle-ground solution. Well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also weighed in on the AirPods camera rumour but from a different angle. He suggests the cameras could improve Apple’s spatial audio technology, particularly when paired with Vision Pro and other future AR/VR devices. The idea is that the cameras could track a user’s head movements and adjust the sound accordingly. If you turn your head while watching something on Vision Pro, the sound could shift to emphasise audio from that direction, making the experience more immersive.  Ming-Chi Kuo also speculates that these cameras could allow users to control their devices with in-air gestures. Imagine adjusting the volume or switching songs just by moving your hands — no need to tap your AirPods or use Siri. If Apple does go ahead with this concept, it won’t be anytime soon. Bloomberg reports that the earliest we might see AirPods with cameras would be in 2027, possibly alongside AirPods Pro 4. Apple is also reportedly working on a set of smart glasses to rival Meta’s, which could launch around the same time.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

While Samsung has teased the design of the device, it has kept the feature details under wraps.

The camera setup, which closely resembles the S25 Ultra’s system with its 200-megapixel main sensor and 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens, suggests that the Edge model might offer a superior camera experience compared to both the standard S25 and S25+. However, it may lack the telephoto lens found on the S25 Ultra, positioning the Edge as a middle ground between affordability and premium features. One of the key factors setting the Edge apart is its potential use of tandem OLED display technology. This tech, previously seen on Apple's iPad Pro, eliminates the need for a backlight, allowing for a thinner profile while still offering a bright, expansive display. With Samsung incorporating this innovation into the Edge, it is reportedly able to achieve a slim 6.4mm profile, making it the thinnest smartphone on the market. However, the company is not expected to price it lower than the standard Galaxy S25 model. The leaks also suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge will share the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset as the other S25 models, so you can expect gaming and performance benchmarks to remain similar across the series. However, the Edge’s slimmer form factor, large tandem OLED display tech, and S25 Ultra-like rear camera setup might give it an edge over the S25+ model.  The Galaxy S25 Edge is rumoured to have a smaller 3,900 battery than its counterparts, which might affect its longevity compared to the standard and Plus models. However, whether Samsung will use advanced silicon-carbon battery tech for better power retention is still unknown. For your reference, the S25 has a 4,000mAh battery, the S25+ features a 4,900mAh unit and S25 Ultra offers a 5,000mAh battery.Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: How much it may cost in India? Samsung could place the Galaxy S25 Edge as a potential bridge between the S25+ and S25 Ultra, offering consumers a premium option without the Ultra’s higher price tag. With the standard Galaxy S25 priced at Rs 80,999, the Plus model at Rs 99,999, and the Ultra starting at Rs 1,29,999, the Edge might fit comfortably in this lineup. While these leaks paint an exciting picture, nothing has been officially confirmed. Hence, users are advised to take the details with a pinch of salt.

However, despite the long wait, rumours suggest, the upgrade might be minimal.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ipad-11-said-to-receive-minor-upgrades-2677646-2025-02-10,"Apple’s entry-level iPad hasn’t seen an update since October 2022, when the company introduced the 10th-generation model. After a gap of nearly two and a half years, Apple is finally expected to unveil its successor, the iPad 11, in the coming months. However, despite the long wait, rumours suggest, the upgrade might be minimal, with the biggest change being an internal chip refresh. The biggest upgrade for the iPad 11 will likely be its processor. Reports suggest Apple will move from the A14 Bionic chip, which powered the iPad 10, to the A17 Pro chip. This is the same chip found in the iPhone 15 Pro and should provide a noticeable performance boost. The A17 Pro is expected to be about 40 per cent faster in terms of CPU performance compared to the A14, which should result in smoother multitasking, gaming, and overall responsiveness. Additionally, Apple is said to be doubling the RAM from 4GB to 8GB. This upgrade should improve app performance, allowing more applications to remain open in the background. With this hardware improvement, the iPad 11 is also expected to support Apple Intelligence, Apple’s suite of AI-driven features that includes Genmoji, Image Playground, and an improved Siri. While some reports claim the A17 Pro chip is a certainty for the iPad 11, a conflicting leak suggests otherwise. An anonymous source on X (formerly Twitter) had earlier claimed the iPad 11 may instead feature an A16 chip with 6GB RAM. If true, this would mean the new model wouldn't meet Apple’s minimum requirements for Apple Intelligence, as Apple currently restricts AI features to devices running at least an A17 Pro chip with 8GB of RAM. It is possible that Apple could offer two different models at different price points — one with an A16 chip for budget-conscious buyers and another with an A17 Pro chip for those who want AI capabilities. Apple has yet to confirm any details, so this remains speculation for now. Beyond the processor, there aren’t many expected changes. Apple may update connectivity by adding Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, but otherwise, the design is likely to remain the same. The base storage could also be increased from 64GB to 128GB, which would be a welcome change given the growing size of apps and media files. Another wildcard feature could be Stage Manager, which Apple introduced in iPadOS 16 but has so far only been available on iPads with M1 chips or newer. If the iPad 11 gets an A17 Pro with 8GB RAM, it might finally be able to support this feature, but there’s no confirmation yet. The iPad 10 launched at $449 (Rs 44,900 in India) but received a price cut to $349 (Rs 34,900 in India) in mid-2024. If Apple sticks to the same pricing structure, the iPad 11 could offer good value for those looking for a reliable tablet without spending too much. Apple is expected to announce the iPad 11 in March or April 2025, but official details are still under wraps.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

Nothing Phone 3a series: What to expect  Nothing Phone 3a: The Nothing Phone 3a is expected to bring major upgrades, featuring a 6.8-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate—the largest screen on a Nothing phone so far. It will reportedly be powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset, moving away from the MediaTek Dimensity processor used in the Phone 2a, and will run Nothing OS 3.1, based on Android 15.   A recent design leak suggests that the Phone 3a might introduce a new pill-shaped triple-camera system. The leaked image shows the device covered in a hard case, likely to keep its design under wraps until the official launch. However, it still reveals Nothing’s first triple-camera setup, arranged horizontally with an LED flash placed above. Interestingly, a recent teaser from Nothing shows a similar camera module but in a vertical layout instead.

 According to Android Headlines, both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro will be available in two colours. Both models will come in Black, though it’s unclear if they’ll have the exact same shade. Additionally, the Nothing Phone 3a 5G will be offered in White, while the Pro variant will come in Gray.   Leaks suggest a big camera upgrade, with the Phone 3a expected to feature a 50-megapixel primary sensor and a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom—the first time Nothing has included a telephoto lens. However, this might come at the cost of the ultra-wide sensor, which is rumoured to be downgraded to 8-megapixel. For selfies, a 32-megapixel front camera will be placed in a hole-punch cutout, similar to previous models.   The battery is expected to remain at 5,000mAh with 45W wired charging, just like the Phone 2a. Other features include NFC support and Nothing’s signature Glyph lighting.   Nothing Phone 3a Pro: Instead of a ""Plus"" model, Nothing is reportedly introducing a ""Pro"" variant in the Phone 3a series. However, details about the Pro version remain limited. Leaks suggest it will be available in a single 12GB RAM + 256GB storage option.   Since this information is based on leaks and rumours, it’s best to take it with caution.

Pre-reservation for the smartphone is already live in China.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/xiaomi-15-ultra-may-launch-this-month-release-date-india-price-specs-and-all-we-may-already-know-2677638-2025-02-10,"Xiaomi launched the Xiaomi 15 and Xiaomi 15 Pro smartphones in China in October 2024. They were the first smartphones in the world to feature the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. And now, the company is getting ready to launch its most premium phone in the series –– the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. Just like its predecessor, the phone’s camera will be its primary focus. We tested the Xiaomi 14 Ultra last year, and we found it to be the best Android flagship phone of 2024.  Xiaomi 15 Ultra is rumoured to launch as early as the end of February. A big reason to believe so is because pre-reservations for the smartphone in China have begun. Another hint at a possible sooner launch of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra comes from GSMArena, which has shared a leaked promotional poster of the phone, according to which, it could launch on February 26. As is the tradition, if the release date is right, on February 26, Xiaomi will first launch the Xiaomi 15 Ultra in China, and then it will eventually bring it to the global and Indian market in the following month.  Earlier, there were reports that the phone would launch in March 2025. Last year, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra was launched in India in March. Which means, if the phone is launched in China this month, we can expect it to launch in India in March this year too.  The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is expected to feature some significant upgrades over its predecessor. For instance, leaks suggest that it will sport a quad-camera setup, including a 50-megapixel primary sensor, a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto sensor — possibly similar to what we’ve seen on the Vivo X200 Pro — and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide lens. Additionally, the main sensor is rumoured to be a 1-inch unit with an f/1.63 aperture, promising improved low-light performance. Besides that, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, just like the Xiaomi 15 and Xiaomi 15 Pro, is pretty much confirmed to feature the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The smartphone is expected to feature up to 16GB RAM and 1TB storage. Further, reports suggest that the Xiaomi 15 Ultra will likely feature a 2K quad-curved panel. The phone is rumoured to support 90W wired and wireless charging, and will sport a battery capacity of 5,000mAh, the same as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is also believed to come with an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and improved durability, with potential IP68 and IP69 certifications for water and dust resistance.Xiaomi 15 Ultra: Expected price in India  Xiaomi has yet to disclose anything about the Xiaomi 15 Ultra’s launch yet, so of course nothing about the pricing is official. However, if we look at the price of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, which was launched in India at Rs 99,999 for the 16GB RAM and 512GB storage variant, we get a good hint at how the 15 Ultra could possibly be priced. Assuming the device is going to feature improvements in terms of storage, display, and camera, we believe a slight increase in price should be expected.

However, it seems that the watch is only coming to the US market this time as the teaser for the third-generation OnePlus watch is not published on the OnePlus India website.  As the company hasn't officially confirmed its plans to skip OnePlus Watch 3's India launch, the chances of it coming to this market still remain high. OnePlus is probably planning to unveil its new watch later, something which only time will tell. The official launch is slated for February 18. As for what the OnePlus Watch 3 will bring to the table, it will come with a refreshed design, longer battery life, and continued support for Google's Wear OS.

But, Altman rejected the proposal, saying ""no thank you"". ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-offers-97-billion-to-buy-openai-sam-altman-rejects-it-and-mocks-him-saying-we-will-buy-x-for-9-2678008-2025-02-11,"Elon Musk, after previously suing OpenAI, has now made an attempt to purchase the company. Recent reports reveal that Musk, along with a group of investors, approached CEO Sam Altman with an offer to buy out OpenAI for $97 billion. However, Altman declined the offer, responding with a firm, ""no thank you.” According to the Wall Street Journal report, Musk and his investment group have officially proposed to OpenAI’s board to take control of the company and return it to its nonprofit origins.  Marc Toberoff, Musk’s lawyer, stated, ""If Sam Altman and the current board want OpenAI to become a fully for-profit company, it’s important that the charity is fairly compensated for losing control of such groundbreaking technology."" In response, Altman rejected the offer in a post on Musk’s social media platform, X, saying, ""No thanks, but we’d be willing to buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you’re interested."" This was a playful reference to Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter, now X, in 2022.
 


 Musk proposed this offer after suing OpenAI two times in 2024. The first time, in July 2024, he accused the company of acting in a way that diverged from its founding principles, particularly its shift toward a more commercialised, profit-driven structure. Musk felt this shift put OpenAI's work at risk of being controlled by corporate interests rather than focusing on the broader benefits for humanity. This legal battle highlighted tensions between Musk’s vision for AI as an open, nonprofit endeavour and OpenAI’s pursuit of growth and profitability. In August 2024, Musk again filed a new lawsuit and accused OpenAI of racing to develop powerful “artificial general intelligence” technology to “maximize profits.” Musk also accused the company of engaging in racketeering. Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI stems from a growing conflict between him and the company he helped found. Musk was one of the initial backers of OpenAI, a nonprofit organisation focused on artificial intelligence. However, over time, he became increasingly unhappy with the direction the company was taking, especially after it shifted to a ""capped-profit"" model, which he felt compromised its original mission. Musk has also expressed concerns about OpenAI's leadership and its potential influence over AI technology.mbedded entity widgetPublished By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Must Watch

Ahead of the launch, a bunch of official images of the phone have surfaced on social media giving us a good idea about what the OnePlus Open 2 would look like. 
",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oppo-find-n5-official-images-are-out-revealing-what-the-oneplus-open-2-will-look-like-2678039-2025-02-11,"Oppo has confirmed that the Oppo Find N5 foldable smartphone will be launched globally on February 20 in Singapore. Ahead of the launch, a lot of reviewers are sharing images of the Find N5 they have been testing, along with official teasers that Oppo has put out. But Oppo never brings the Find N-series to India, so why should you care about this? Well, there is a very good reason why. The next-generation OnePlus foldable phone, which will likely be called the OnePlus Open 2, is expected to closely resemble the Oppo Find N5. Go back and compare the OnePlus Open and the Oppo Find N3, if you will.  For the uninitiated, OnePlus and Oppo have shared design and engineering efforts, as they both operate under BBK Electronics. The primary difference you see between the two is in the software and branding.  
 


 Coming back to the images. Oppo has been teasing the Oppo Find N5 as the thinnest foldable smartphone in the world, and the images are proof enough to believe that. The current title of the slimmest foldable is held by the Honor Magic V3, which measures 4.35mm when unfolded and 9.2mm when folded. Reports suggest that the Find N5 could measure 4mm when unfolded. We have been seeing all the teasers and images of the phone, and it looks a lot like last year’s Oppo Find N3 aka the OnePlus Open. It has the same round camera module, and the device continues to feature Hasselblad cameras. The design seems to be largely unchanged over the last generation foldable.

Additionally, official images also reveal that the Oppo Find N5 will continue to feature those slightly thicker bezels that we also saw on the OnePlus Open. The selfie camera's positioning on the phone will also remain unchanged –– it will be placed on top-right corner on the inner display.Meanwhile, there have also been reports speculating about the specifications of the phone. The Oppo Find N5 and the OnePlus Open 2 are believed to feature the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The new foldables are expected to get a big upgrade in terms of battery though. From the OnePlus Open’s 4,800mAh battery, the OnePlus Open 2 may sport a massive 6,000mAh battery. If true, that is especially impressive considering it’s a foldable phone, and at that it carries claims of being the slimmest foldable in the world. The Oppo Find N5 aka OnePlus Open 2 will also support satellite communication. The new foldable will also fix one big hiccup of the OnePlus Open –– the lack of wireless charging support.

This is a significant improvement over its predecessor, Galaxy S25, with 4000mAh. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s26-battery-details-tipped-might-launch-with-monster-capacity-2678052-2025-02-11,"After the launch of the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung is planning major upgrades for the upcoming flagship series. The Galaxy S26 series is expected to be announced next year, but the rumours and leaks are making the rounds. For instance, based on the rumours, S26 is anticipated to feature an under-display camera for its next flagship smartphone and a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera. Now, the latest leak indicates that the next-gen phones are to bring a ""monster battery"". It states that the Galaxy S26 could pack 6000mAh to 7000mAh battery. advertisementSamsung Galaxy S26 battery specsA new report from FNNews suggests that Samsung plans to use silicon carbon batteries in the Galaxy S26. This new technology could allow for a much larger battery—around 6,000 mAh to 7,000 mAh—without increasing the phone’s size. Several well-known leakers support the idea that future Galaxy S models will have higher battery capacities.  Silicon carbon batteries store more energy in the same space compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. By adjusting the graphite-to-silicon ratio, they offer greater capacity. We’ve already seen this technology in phones like the Honor Magic 7 Pro, which successfully incorporated a silicon carbon battery. If implemented correctly, this upgrade could be a major improvement.

If this holds true then Samsung Galaxy S26 is up for major improvement, especially for its battery. Currently, the company has launched its Galaxy S25 series with battery specs ranging from 4000mAh to 5000mAh. The Galaxy S25 (base variant) packs a 4000mAh battery, S25+ has 4900mAh and S25 Ultra has 5000mAh. But a jump in this segment would be a much appreciated and welcome move.

Samsung Galaxy S26 specs leak  The Samsung Galaxy S25 series just launched less than a month ago, and yet the next-gen models are already making headlines. The Galaxy S26 series has seen several leaks and rumours. Apart from the latest battery leak, the display and camera specs has also been speculated.  A tipster on X (formerly Twitter) claims that early prototypes of the Galaxy S26 Ultra don’t have a visible selfie camera cutout. This hints that Samsung may be planning to introduce an under-display camera for its next flagship.   If true, this would mark a major design shift for Samsung’s standard smartphones. The company has tested under-display cameras in its foldable Galaxy Z Fold series, but the technology has faced criticism for reduced photo quality. To make this work on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, Samsung will need to improve image performance to meet the expectations of users who rely on selfies and video calls. Another rumour claims that the upcoming phones will use a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera with a 1/1.5-inch sensor.  For comparison, the Vivo X200 Pro (read the review here) already boasts a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto camera with a slightly larger 1/1.4-inch sensor. If Samsung moves forward with this plan, the Galaxy S26 Ultra—possibly rebranded as the S26 Note—could see a major boost in zoom capabilities.   The Samsung Galaxy S25 features a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main sensor, a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide camera with a 120-degree field of view, and a 10-megapixel f/2.4 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. On the front, it has a 12-megapixel f/2.2 selfie camera.  
These specs remain unchanged from last year, but while Samsung hasn’t upgraded the camera hardware, it has enhanced the editing tools and AI-powered features to improve the overall photography experience. But, as rumoured, if the upcoming phones enhance the camera specs as well, it might be up for a significant improvement.

If budget isn’t a concern, and you’re looking for Apple’s top-tier smartphone, the iPhone 16 Pro is an excellent choice. One of its standout features is the new Camera Control button, though it’s more of an added convenience than a game-changing feature. The phone’s display has grown slightly, now measuring 6.3 inches compared to the 6.1-inch screen on the iPhone 15 Pro. The bezels have also been slimmed down, making for a more immersive viewing experience. The screen still features 120Hz ProMotion, an always-on display, and a minimum brightness of 1 nit, making it easy on the eyes in low-light settings. When it comes to performance, the iPhone 16 Pro is among the best, easily outperforming Android flagships running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. It handles demanding games like Genshin Impact at 60fps on high settings without stuttering, something many Android phones still struggle with. The device is powered by Apple’s A18 Pro chip, built on a second-generation 3nm process. Apple claims the new 6-core GPU is 20 per cent faster than the A17 Pro and includes enhanced machine learning, faster USB 3 speeds, and ProRes video recording support. Battery life has also seen a slight improvement, easily lasting a full day with moderate use. Apple has also improved the camera setup on the iPhone 16 Pro. While the standard iPhone 16 offers decent photography, the Pro version takes it a step further with a triple-camera system. The main 48-megapixel sensor now features second-generation quad-pixel technology, reducing shutter lag for high-resolution ProRAW and HEIF images. The 48-megapixel ultra-wide camera now comes with autofocus, and the 12-megapixel periscope telephoto lens offers 5x optical zoom at a 120mm focal length, something missing from last year’s iPhone 15 Pro. For video enthusiasts, the iPhone 16 Pro supports 4K video recording at 120fps, delivering sharp visuals, natural colours, and crisp audio quality. The iPhone 16 Pro brings solid improvements in performance, display, and camera technology.

dded2c77-054d-407b-8857-290a75490f95,OpenAI said to be making its own AI chip: What does this mean?OpenAI is reportedly in the final stages of designing its first in-house AI processor and is expected to send it for fabrication in the coming months.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-said-to-be-making-its-own-ai-chip-what-does-this-mean-2678045-2025-02-11,"OpenAI is reportedly developing its own AI chip to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. The company is in the final stages of designing its first in-house AI processor and is expected to send it for fabrication in the coming months. TSMC has been named as the manufacturing partner, with mass production planned for 2026. Currently, Nvidia is the undisputed leader in this field, whose chips currently hold about 80 per cent market share in AI computing. While Nvidia remains the go-to supplier for AI processors, tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google have been investing heavily in alternatives to lessen dependence on a single supplier.advertisementWhy is OpenAI making its own chip?Building a custom AI chip could give OpenAI better control over its hardware and software integration, ultimately optimising performance for its own AI models. Right now, Nvidia’s chips are the backbone of many AI projects, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but securing these chips has become increasingly expensive and competitive.By designing its own processor, OpenAI can fine-tune its hardware to match its needs while also having better negotiating power with Nvidia and other suppliers. However, this isn’t a small undertaking. Industry estimates suggest that a single version of a new chip can cost around $500 million, with additional costs for software and infrastructure doubling that figure. Building a custom AI chip could give OpenAI better control over its hardware and software integration, ultimately optimising performance for its own AI models. Right now, Nvidia’s chips are the backbone of many AI projects, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but securing these chips has become increasingly expensive and competitive. By designing its own processor, OpenAI can fine-tune its hardware to match its needs while also having better negotiating power with Nvidia and other suppliers. However, this isn’t a small undertaking. Industry estimates suggest that a single version of a new chip can cost around $500 million, with additional costs for software and infrastructure doubling that figure. Although OpenAI is pushing forward with its custom chip plans, there’s no guarantee of success. The first batch of chips, known as tape-out, could face issues, requiring redesigns and additional time before a fully functional chip is ready for large-scale use. Typically, the process from design finalisation to manufacturing takes about six months, but OpenAI could pay extra to speed up production. OpenAI’s chip will initially have a limited role, primarily focused on running AI models rather than training them. The company, however, has ambitions to develop more advanced processors in the future. TSMC is said to be using its 3-nanometre process technology to manufacture OpenAI’s chip. The design will reportedly include high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and a systolic array architecture, similar to what Nvidia uses in its chips.What does this mean? If OpenAI successfully creates its own chip, it will have more control over how it processes data for AI training and won’t have to rely as much on Nvidia. Apple, for example, currently uses Amazon chips to train its Apple Intelligence models but is also said to be working with Broadcom to develop its own AI chip. Other big companies like Meta and Microsoft are investing billions in AI technology. Meanwhile, a Chinese startup called DeepSeek has recently shown that powerful AI models can be built using fewer computer chips.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

Prime minister Narendra Modi is co-chair at the event, and it is being hosted by French president Emmanuel Macron. The event will also be attended by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also spoke on day 1 of the event, talking about how “AI will be the most profound shift of our lifetime”. Speaking at the event, Pichai said that AI has surpassed even the transition to personal computing or mobile. “AI will do more to democratise access to information than the internet itself,” he said. Pichai also highlighted the rapid progress in AI development. He gave an example of how the cost of processing AI tokens has dropped by 97 per cent in just 18 months making AI tools more accessible.  Pichai had to discuss Gemini, of course. But before that, he spoke about the Transformer architecture, which is believed to be a breakthrough from Google, and Pichai says it serves as the foundation for today’s generative AI models.  The Google CEO also spoke in detail about Gemini 2.0 and its ability to think and process text, images, video, audio, and code all at once. And with these tools is how Pichai thinks AI is able to create new experiences for users. He mentioned tools like NotebookLM, which allow users to transform dense documents into engaging audio overviews. Pichai also mentioned how AI is helping humans beyond just productivity tools. He talked about using AI for research discoveries, referencing AlphaFold, a project that helped Google DeepMind achieve breakthrough in predicting protein structures, that has in turn helped in cancer research, vaccine development, and enzyme engineering. He also spoke about quantum computing, which a Google engineer recently said would get real-world applications in the next five years. However, despite all the benefits that Pichai counted, he warns that AI needs to be dealt with caution. He urged global leaders to invest in AI education, infrastructure, and regulation while ensuring the technology remains ethical and accessible.  Pichai’s speech at the Paris AI Summit comes on the heels of a recent announcement by the company that ended its pledge to never use AI technology for weapons and surveillance. This was part of an update in the Responsible AI 2024 report. The new policy is a drastic shift from the company’s earlier commitment to not use AI for applications that are “likely to cause overall harm”.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Also read |  Elon Musk offers $97 billion to buy OpenAI, Sam Altman rejects it and mocks him saying we will buy X for $9BAlso read |  OpenAI said to be making its own AI chip: What does this mean?

Musk openly calling him a scammer isn't surprising because the latest comment comes amid his ongoing criticism of the AI company he helped co-found. The controversy began after Musk shared a video from Altman’s testimony at a US Senate hearing in May 2023. In the clip, Altman states that he holds no equity in OpenAI and is committed to its mission out of goodwill, not personal financial gain. Musk, however, took issue with this, posting the clip on X (formerly Twitter) with the caption “Scam Altman,” suggesting that Altman was not being truthful about his role and interests in the company. This public jab is the latest in a series of attacks Musk has aimed at OpenAI and its leadership. Recently, Musk made headlines by leading a group of investors in a $97.4 billion bid to take over OpenAI’s nonprofit arm, according to The Wall Street Journal. Musk has been critical of OpenAI’s shift from its original nonprofit structure, accusing the company of prioritising profits and aligning too closely with corporate interests, particularly Microsoft. Altman, however, showed little interest in Musk’s takeover attempt and even reportedly mocked Musk by suggesting he could buy X for $9.74 billion instead. This sarcastic response seemed to trigger Musk's latest outburst on social media, where the tech mogul has frequently voiced his frustrations. The tension between Musk and Altman dates back to when Musk left OpenAI in 2018 after disagreements over the company’s direction. Under Altman’s leadership, OpenAI transitioned to a hybrid structure, allowing for-profit investments that enabled breakthroughs like the development of AI models such as ChatGPT. While this strategy attracted big funding, including from Microsoft, it has drawn Musk’s ire, with the billionaire accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission of ethical AI development. In response to Musk's latest attack, Altman has reportedly reassured OpenAI employees that the company’s structure protects it from external takeovers and that OpenAI’s growing success likely drives Musk’s actions.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 11, 2025

Meanwhile, he also urged global leaders to invest in AI education, infrastructure, and regulation while ensuring the tech remains ethical and accessible.  Later today, PM Narendra Modi and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are also expected to speak at the event. Modi arrived in Paris this morning and received a warm welcome from French president Emmanuel Macron.  The AI Action Summit is happening against the backdrop of the recent popularity of Chinese startup DeepSeek as it launched its latest model called R1 that competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The DeepSeek R1 model gained popularity for using a fraction of the cost of ChatGPT’s development while being able to be just as capable.  At the event, Modi will also be addressing the India-France CEO Forum alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. The AI Action Summit is a global conference and it is currently in its third edition. The summit was held at Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom for the first time in November 2023 which focused on the foundational aspects of AI governance and ethics.

This update comes after an executive order signed by former US President Donald Trump, which led to the formal change by the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), a US government database responsible for place names. Users in the United States now see the Gulf of America on Google Maps, while users in Mexico continue to see the Gulf of Mexico. For the rest of the world, both names appear side by side. Google says this follows its long-standing practice of displaying location names based on official government data, which varies by region.  The decision has drawn mixed reactions, with many questioning the need for the name change. The Gulf has historically been shared by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba, and is a critical hub for economic activities such as shipping, fishing, and energy production. Despite this, the US administration at the time argued that renaming the Gulf would better reflect America's influence over the waters. Google Maps' naming updates are determined by users' locations, based on factors such as their device settings, SIM card information, and network. On the desktop, the displayed name is tied to search settings or device location. While Google has swiftly implemented the change, other mapping services, such as Apple Maps and MapQuest, have yet to follow suit. Apple Maps, for instance, still redirects searches for the Gulf of America to the Gulf of Mexico. Google-owned Waze, meanwhile, displays both names but does not recognise Gulf of America as a standalone search term. The renaming also came with an unexpected addition: an official Gulf of America Day, designated as February 9 — the same day Donald Trump signed the executive order initiating the change. Supporters of the move see it as a patriotic rebranding, while critics argue it is unnecessary and politically motivated. While the renaming remains a US government decision, Google Maps’ update is what has made it immediately visible to millions of users.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

However, the link was malicious and allowed hackers to take control of her phone.  ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/woman-loses-over-rs-2-lakh-after-clicking-job-interview-link-in-sms-2678092-2025-02-11,"In yet another case of cyber fraud, a 38-year-old woman from Mangaluru ended up losing more than Rs 2 lakh to scammers. While it is a case of online fraud, it is not the usual fake parcel, digital arrest, or work-from-home scams that we have been seeing a lot lately. Instead, in this case, the scammers employed a new tactic and lured the victim with a malicious link sent through SMS. According to the case reported by Deccan Herald, the victim, Vasudha Gopalakrishna Shenoy, works as a manager at a bank branch in Belthangady. Her ordeal started when she received a text message on her mobile phone containing a link to a website named ""interviewshine.co.in."" Thinking it to be an advertisement for a legitimate job opportunity, she clicked on the link, unaware that it was malicious. Shortly after clicking, the victim noticed that her Gmail account and Amazon app were compromised. Through these apps, the scammers also gained access to other sensitive information, including her credit card details, and began making unauthorised transactions. Over the next few hours of her apps being compromised, the victim received multiple messages on her phone notifying her of transactions totalling Rs 2,19,500. The amount was deducted from her bank cards, Amazon cards, and credit cards. Realising she had been scammed, she immediately filed a complaint with the authorities. A case has been registered at the CEN Station under Section 66(D) of the IT Act and Sections 318(2) and 318(4) of the BNS Act. While online scams are becoming rampant in India, this particular incident highlights how scammers are using new and more sophisticated ways to trick people. In this particular case, the link attached to the SMS was likely linked to malware, and as soon as the victim clicked on it, the malware infected her phone and allowed the scammers to gain unauthorised access to her apps and bank accounts.How to stay safe To stay safe from such scams: — Never click on unknown links from unknown individuals. — If a message seems legitimate or you are interested, always verify its authenticity before clicking on any links. — Particularly, if you receive a job offer or interview link from an unknown source, cross-check with the company’s official website or contact them directly. — Be cautious of unsolicited messages containing links, especially those claiming to offer jobs, prizes, or urgent actions. You can also hover over the link to see the actual URL, and avoid clicking if it looks suspicious. — Add two-factor authentication on apps whenever possible. This may include a regular password along with Face ID or another security method. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for scammers to gain access. – If you think you have clicked on such links, keep a close eye on your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions. Report any suspicious activity to your bank immediately.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Also Read |  Elon Musk offers $97 billion to buy OpenAI, Sam Altman rejects it and mocks him saying we will buy X for $9BAlso Read |  Samsung Galaxy S26 battery details tipped, might launch with monster capacityAlso Read |  AI will be the most profound shift of our lifetimes, says Sundar Pichai at Paris AI Summit

The foldable smartphone is expected to be rebranded as the OnePlus Open 2 globally, although there are no official details on this yet. Ahead of the launch, the company has confirmed some key details, including the design, chipset, battery, and a possible DeepSeek-R1 AI integration for the Find N5. Going by the official press materials shared by Oppo on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, the Find N5 will be the world’s first foldable phone powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Unlike the standard version, Oppo is using a special 7-core edition of the chip, internally known as SM8750-3-AB. This version features a 2+5 core setup, with two high-performance cores running at 4.32GHz and five efficiency cores at 3.53GHz.  Another major upgrade comes in the form of battery capacity. The Find N5 packs a 5,600mAh battery, making it the largest battery in an Oppo foldable yet. This is a 17 per cent increase in battery capacity from the 4,800mAh unit in its predecessor, the Find N3. However, despite the bigger battery, Oppo has managed to keep the phone’s design slim, measuring around 9.2mm when folded. The phone’s official teaser page also confirms a titanium build, unlike the Find N3’s aluminium frame. So, along with being the slimmest foldable ever, there’s a big chance it might be the lightest foldable ever too. According to lab tests, the Oppo Find N5 can record 1080p videos in extreme cold (-15°C) for up to 4.2 hours, while other foldables typically last 3.2 hours under the same conditions. In real-world use, Oppo claims it can provide up to 24 hours of video streaming and nearly 18.5 hours of online meetings. Probably the biggest addition to the Oppo Find N5 — again, as per the official press material — could be the integration of the DeepSeek-R1 AI model. This AI, introduced in early 2025, could power the Xiaobu assistant, allowing users to perform various tasks with a single phrase. For global markets, Oppo could take a different approach. The Find N5’s international version, aka the OnePlus Open 2, will reportedly integrate Google Gemini instead of DeepSeek-R1. Reports also suggest that the OnePlus Open 2 will be sold in international markets like India, the US, and Europe. That said, just like in the case of the Oppo Find N3 and OnePlus Open, the Find N5 and the Open 2 will share the same core specifications, including the chipset, battery, and AI capabilities.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

And there are reasons to be this amped up about the launch. The SE-series by Apple is known for its affordable price tag. So that’s the first big reason. And what makes it one of the most anticipated launches of 2025 are the upgrades that are rumoured, including an iPhone 14-like design, an OLED panel, Face ID and the fact that it is tipped to be the most affordable iPhone to offer Apple Intelligence. Now, while there is no official information yet, recent reports indicate that the iPhone SE 4 could launch as soon as today.  Without giving out the exact date, last week, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that the iPhone SE 4 could launch this week, along with the PowerBeats Pro 2. He also highlighted that Apple might not be interested in hosting an event and will launch the iPhone SE 4 with just a press release, as it does for its iPads.

iPhone SE 4: Expected specs and features  Before we deep dive into the details, the previous narrative around the phone was that Apple might get away with ""SE"" altogether. Instead, it might rebrand it as the iPhone 16e. Now, the iPhone SE 4 or iPhone 16e is set for a major makeover, moving away from its classic small design with thick bezels and a Touch ID home button. This time, it’s expected to look more like the iPhone 14, swapping Touch ID for Face ID.

advertisement Another exciting upgrade is the display. Instead of the older LCD screen, the iPhone SE 4 is rumoured to feature a larger 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, a big step up from the 4.7-inch screen on its predecessor.   Leaked images suggest the phone will keep the SE series’ signature single-camera setup, but with a big upgrade. The rear camera is rumoured to jump from 12-megapixel to 48-megapixel, while the front camera could get a boost to 24-megapixel.

 Apple is also making changes to the body, ditching the rounded edges for a boxier design similar to recent iPhones. The power button will likely remain on the right side, just like on the iPhone 14.   There’s some debate about whether it will include the Dynamic Island feature, but it could be possible since the iPhone SE 4 is expected to run on Apple’s A18 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 16 series. The phone is also said to come with 8GB of RAM and support Apple Intelligence, making it the most affordable iPhone with AI-powered features.iPhone SE 4: India price (Speculation) Pricing is a key factor in the iPhone SE 4’s appeal. Reports suggest it could start at $499 (around Rs 44,000), similar to the launch price of the iPhone SE 3 in India, which was Rs 43,900. However, the SE 3 later saw a price increase to Rs 49,900 due to higher taxes, so the final pricing of the SE 4 could also be affected by market conditions.

An elderly man from Florida is extremely grateful for Apple’s voice assistant, which saved his life as he was fighting for survival alone in his house for around two days after experiencing a stroke. Siri helped him connect with his daughter, who then called 911 and ensured emergency services reached his location during those critical hours. Siri assisted 70-year-old Daniel Vallaire from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, in connecting with his daughter via a voice prompt. According to local news outlet WSVN, Vallaire experienced a stroke and fell onto the bathroom floor. He was unable to move and tried to crawl to another room. Reportedly, he spent 48 hours lying on the bathroom floor. However, after mustering the courage to crawl into the living room, Vallaire reached near his phone and prompted Siri to call his daughter, who then contacted emergency services. “I said, ‘Siri, call Victoria Vallaire,’ and she did. If I [only] had a landline, there’s no way I would have been able to get to it,” Vallaire told WSVN. “If this had happened without [Siri], I wouldn’t be here,” he added. Apple has integrated Siri across all its products, allowing users to activate the voice assistant with a simple command: “Hey Siri.” The company recently also updated the command, enabling users to activate Siri by simply saying “Hey.” Users can also change the settings by going to Settings > Siri or Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri, then tapping Siri or Hey Siri. To make Siri more conversational, Apple has also introduced a revamped version of Siri. The new Siri was announced with the launch of iOS 18 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. This new Siri includes a fresh look, improved conversational capabilities, and even the ability to use ChatGPT to access information based on the user’s prompts. According to Apple, the new Siri has better conversational capabilities and can maintain the context of the user’s previous requests. Additionally, conversations with Siri are said to be more natural and personal. Meanwhile, apart from Siri, Apple has dedicated health and emergency tools like fall detection and AFib detection to help users in emergencies. With the fall detection feature on the Apple Watch, the device sends emergency notifications and connects with emergency services via the Emergency SOS via satellite system as soon as it detects fall of the users.  On the other hand, the irregular rhythm notification feature on the Apple Watch alerts users whenever the device detects a heartbeat irregularity that might suggest atrial fibrillation (AFib).Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Also Read |  Woman loses over Rs 2 lakh after clicking job interview link in SMSAlso Read |  Elon Musk offers $97 billion to buy OpenAI, Sam Altman rejects it and mocks him saying we will buy X for $9BAlso Read |  Samsung Galaxy S26 battery details tipped, might launch with monster capacity

The layoffs, part of the company's latest restructuring efforts, have sparked confusion and frustration among the affected employees. According to a report by Business Insider, a number of employees revealed that despite receiving mid-year ratings of ""At or Above Expectations"" in 2024, they found themselves included in the layoffs. These employees, who wished to remain anonymous, said their ratings had unexpectedly been downgraded to ""Meets Most"" in the year-end reviews, putting them at risk of termination. Meta had previously informed its managers to cut around 5 per cent of the company’s lowest-performing workers. However, internal documents showed that the directive allowed managers to include higher-rated employees if they couldn’t meet their targets by only laying off lower-rated staff. This information, which was not shared with the broader set of employees, left many blindsided. ""When I received the email I was surprised by it mostly because I have a very solid performance history and no indicators of the last six months of performance problems,"" one affected employee told BI. Another employee echoed this sentiment, saying they had been given no indication from their manager that their job was in jeopardy because the worker got good performance feedback. ""The hardest part is Meta publicly stating they're cutting low performers, so it feels like we have the scarlet letter on our backs,"" another employee told BI. ""People need to know we're not underperformers."" ""I would certainly challenge Meta's narrative about cutting only low performers,"" another employee said. ""I have a really, really difficult time believing I was a low performer based on past feedback I was given by my manager."" A laid-off employee who got ""Exceed Expectations"" rating asserted that he was surprised to see his performance review feedback was changed to ""Meets Most"" rating.  Meta’s review process for 2024 began in December, but many employees have yet to learn their final ratings. Some workers who had consistently received strong feedback over the years suddenly found themselves downgraded, which made them eligible for the cuts. One worker expressed frustration, saying they had been meeting expectations for years, only to be marked down without explanation during this recent review cycle. The layoffs are part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's efforts to streamline Meta's workforce as the company focuses on its investments in artificial intelligence and virtual reality. While Meta aims to hire more machine learning engineers, it plans to continue trimming what it considers its lowest performers. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 11, 2025

The prime minister addressed AI’s “most feared disruption”, which is job loss. However, he believes that AI will not lead to loss of jobs. “History has shown that work does not disappear due to technology, it’s nature changes. New types of jobs are created,” said Modi at the Paris AI Summit. “We need to invest in skilling and reskilling our people for an AI-driven future,” he adds. Modi also addressed the many biases that AI carries due to the dataset it is trained on. “While the positive potential of AI is absolutely amazing, there are many biases that we need to think carefully about,” he said. “We must build quality datasets free from biases. We must democratise technology and create people-centric applications,” he suggests. Talking about the transformative potential that AI has, Modi said ""AI is already reshaping our polity, economy, security, and society. AI is writing the code for humanity in this century, but it is very different from other technology milestones in human history."" He mentioned the scale and speed at which AI is advancing and the need for global effort to govern the technology. ""There is also a deep interdependence across borders. Therefore, there is a need for collective global effort to establish governance and standards that uphold our shared values, address risks, and build trust,"" he said. The prime minister also underlined the positive impact of AI including that in healthcare, education, and agriculture. ""AI can help transform millions of lives by improving health, education, agriculture, and so much more. It can help create a world in which the journey to sustainable development goals becomes easier and faster,"" he said. To achieve this, he suggests a people-centric approach, saying, ""We must pull together resources and talent. We must develop an open-source system that enhances trust and transparency. We must democratise technology and create people-centric applications."" Modi also addressed the issue of cybersecurity, disinformation, and the threat of deepfakes due to AI. ""We must address concerns related to cybersecurity, disinformation, and deepfakes,"" he said, reiterating the need for better security measures and ethical AI deployment. The PM also addressed the environmental impact of AI, acknowledging its high energy consumption and the need for sustainable solutions. ""There is no doubt that the high energy intensity of AI needs to be looked into. This will require green power to fuel its future,"" he said. He pointed out the International Solar Alliance between India and France, as an example of how nations can work together to integrate AI with renewable energy sources. ""As we advance our partnership to AI, it is a natural progression from sustainability to innovation to shape a smarter and responsible future."" Modi concluded his address by talking about India's success in building digital public infrastructure at scale. ""India has successfully built a digital public infrastructure for over 1.4 billion people at a very low cost. It is built around an open and accessible network.""

These robots are integrated with human workers to perform various tasks such as moving packages, sorting items, and creating customised packaging. Here is everything you need to know.When did Amazon start using robots for tasks? The journey of Amazon’s robotics division began in 2012 with the acquisition of Kiva Systems for $775 million. The early robots, designed by Kiva, primarily followed barcode markers on the warehouse floor to navigate and transport items. However, over a decade later, Amazon’s robotics have evolved with technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, resulting in more advanced robots like Proteus, a fully autonomous system that moves seamlessly alongside workers. Proteus, which was introduced in 2022 at the Nashville fulfillment center, is reportedly capable of navigating obstacles and transporting packages without needing to be confined to specific areas of the warehouse.advertisementWhy is Amazon using 7 lakh robots to perform tasks?The report says that this expansion in robotics has been done to help Amazon increase delivery speeds while reducing operational costs. Tye Brady, Amazon’s Chief Technologist for Robotics, stated that the company’s advancements in robotics contribute to faster deliveries and potentially save the company billions annually. By 2030, the company could be saving as much as $10 billion per year, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley.Amazon claims to have generated more jobs in AI after opting for robotics The report says that this expansion in robotics has been done to help Amazon increase delivery speeds while reducing operational costs. Tye Brady, Amazon’s Chief Technologist for Robotics, stated that the company’s advancements in robotics contribute to faster deliveries and potentially save the company billions annually. By 2030, the company could be saving as much as $10 billion per year, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley.Amazon claims to have generated more jobs in AI after opting for robotics In addition to improving operational efficiency, the integration of robotics has led Amazon to create more jobs in fields like AI and machine learning. The company has also taken steps to improve its robotics capabilities by investing in startups. For instance, Amazon brought on board three founders from the robotics startup Covariant and licensed some of its foundation models. Additionally, the company launched the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund in 2022, which reportedly provides investments to companies involved in emerging technologies. This has led to partnerships with firms like Agility Robotics, whose two-legged robot Digit is now being tested in Amazon’s fulfilment centers.Amazon's premium robots can manage over 200 million items Among Amazon’s more premium robots is Sparrow, a robotic arm introduced in 2023 at the Texas fulfilment center. Unlike earlier models that were limited to handling large packages, Sparrow can pick individual items from containers using AI and computer vision. This advanced system is capable of recognising and managing over 200 million unique items, boosting efficiency in sorting and storing products. Other robots, such as Hercules and Titan, are designed to lift heavy pods of items in Amazon’s warehouses. Hercules, introduced in 2017, can carry pods weighing up to 1,250 pounds, while Titan, which debuted the same year, can handle loads twice as heavy. Robots like Pegasus and Xanthus play a crucial role in sorting packages, with Xanthus being noted for its versatility and reduced production costs.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 11, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-brings-instagram-teen-accounts-in-india-with-supervision-tools-for-parents-2678279-2025-02-11,"Meta is expanding Instagram Teen Accounts to India. This new service of Instagram will be offering more built-in safety measures, privacy protections, and even parental supervision tools to create a safer experience for teenagers online. The features will be available for users under the age of 16. However, some features will also extend to users under 18, depending on the region and specific features. According to Meta, the new Instagram for Teens addresses several concerns about the digital interaction of teens on the internet, including threats like bullying, harmful content, and so on. “Instagram’s new Teen Accounts address these concerns by automatically placing all teens in the highest safety settings, empowering them with better tools to navigate the digital world securely,” says Meta.Features of Instagram Teen Accounts Instagram Teen Accounts will offer the following features to protect teens online. Additionally, it will also restrict teen users from making changes to settings and will require parental approval. Private Accounts: When an Instagram account is under a Teen account, Meta will keep the account private by default for users under 16. This will require users to approve any new follow request and view who is requesting to connect and who can view their content. Messaging Restrictions: Instagram for Teens accounts will only receive messages from individuals they follow or are already connected with. This is further aimed at reducing the risk of unsolicited or potentially harmful messages or DMs online. Sensitive Content Control: Instagram will automatically place teens in the most restrictive setting concerning sensitive content. This will limit the exposure of content to teens and shield them from explicit content, depictions of physical altercations, or promotions of cosmetic procedures in areas like Explore and Reels. Limited Interactions: Additionally, Teen accounts will only be tagged or mentioned by people they follow. The Teen accounts will also have an anti-bullying feature, under which Hidden Words is enabled by default to filter out offensive language in comments and direct message requests. Time Management Tools: The Teen account will also alert users about their internet usage. It will prompt notifications and remind them to exit the app after 60 minutes of daily usage. Additionally,  Teen accounts will also have a Sleep Mode enabled from 10 PM to 7 AM, muting notifications and automatically replying to direct messages during these hours.Supervision tools for parents While there will be privacy restrictions for teens, Instagram for Teens, especially for those under 16 years, will require parental approval to make settings less restrictive. Parents can also enable supervision for older teens (16+) at any time. Soon, parents will also have the ability to directly adjust these settings for more protection. Additionally, more parental supervision features will include: Monitoring recent conversations – Parents will be able to see a list of people their teen has messaged in the past seven days—but without reading message content, maintaining the privacy of the teen. Setting daily time limits – Parents will also be able to set limits. Once the set time limit is reached, the teen will no longer be able to access Instagram.

The Pro 2 is a pair of premium earbuds with features like active heart-rate tracking through ears and a price tag of Rs 29,900.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-launched-in-india-brings-heart-rate-monitoring-through-ears-to-users-2678411-2025-02-11,"Among the athletes, those with active lifestyle and fitness enthusiasts, Powerbeats is a familiar name. Now, Beats is launching the PowerBeats Pro 2 in India. The Pro 2, which will go on open sale in India from February 13, are premium earbuds aimed at fitness enthusiasts. But unlike other premium earbuds, the Pro 2 comes with a truly unique feature — a heart rate sensor which allows each bud to monitor and report heart rate during a workout. Apart from the new feature-set, the Pro 2 buds also come with a redesigned ear hook and significant upgrades to sound, battery life, and call performance. Another noteworthy improvement is Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), complete with the Transparency mode.  Beats, which is an Apple company, is in a way marrying the Apple AirPods Pro 2 with the specific requirements that athletes or fitness enthusiasts have from their earbuds. It also, in some ways, feels like the next-generation AirPods Pro 3.  Beats said that the Powerbeats Pro 2 can be ordered today from Apple India website. It will go on open sale in a couple of days in four colours — Jet Black, Quick Sand, Hyper Purple, and Electric Orange. In India, the Powerbeats Pro 2 has been priced at Rs 29,900.  “Powerbeats Pro 2 is the most impressive product in Beats’ history — developed to withstand intense training sessions and equipped with our most innovative technology and powerful sound,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Music, Sports, and Beats. “Now with Heart Rate Monitoring for workouts, Active Noise Cancellation, and Transparency mode, Powerbeats Pro 2 sets a new standard in audio for fitness.” To offer its heart-rate monitoring the Pro 2 uses LED optical sensors, which are housed in each bud. These sensors pulse over 100 times per second to measure blood flow, and the data is fine-tuned into heartbeats and then is shared with a compatible app. Like other Apple products, the Powerbeats Pro 2 also works best when paired with an iPhone or other Apple products. Inside it uses the Apple-designed H2 and it offers up to 45 hours of battery life with the charging case. Talking of case, it too has received some significant upgrades. It can now charge the buds faster — 5 minutes of charging equals roughly 90 minute of playback time —  despite the case being 35 per cent smaller. The Powerbeats Pro 2 case is also the first Beats case to support wireless charging.  Beats on Tuesday also launched the “Listen to Your Heart” campaign to coincide with the arrival of the Powerbeats Pro 2. The campaign brings together LeBron James, Lionel Messi, and Shohei Ohtani as each of them incorporates the Powerbeats Pro 2 in their fitness routine.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Feb 11, 2025

The I/O developer conference 2025 is set to take place starting May 20, 2025. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-announces-dates-for-io-2025-event-what-to-expect-2678568-2025-02-12,"Mark your calendars for the next big event by Google – the I/O developer conference 2025. The company has recently announced that the event will be a 2-day show, starting May 20 to May 21, 2025. Announcing the dates, Google stated, in this event “you’ll learn more about Google’s newest products, technologies and innovations in AI.” The event will be “open to everyone online” and will feature “livestreamed keynotes and sessions,” as stated in the FAQ. Similar to previous years, there will also be an in-person part held at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. 
 


 The announcement note highlights that the I/O 2025 will begin with a main keynote by CEO Sundar Pichai at 10 AM PT (10.30 PM IST). After that, there will be a developer keynote and on-demand technical sessions. This year, Google will be “streaming developer product keynotes live from Shoreline across both days.” It states, “We’ll start day one with keynotes, followed by breakout sessions, workshops, demos, networking opportunities and more continuing on day two.” Google I/O developer conference 2025: What to expect  There will be plenty of announcements about Gemini, other AI updates, and more details on Android 16. The I/O homepage features a “Start building today” section highlighting the Gemini open model, Google AI Studio, and NotebookLM. In a developer-focused announcement, Google specifically mentions “Android, AI, web, cloud, and more.”  Google will make the official agenda and session list available closer to I/O 2025. Online registration begins today and is free. It states, “Registration for Google I/O 2025 enables you to stay up to date with the schedule and content along with relevant developer news via email. As a registrant, you can also build a profile in the Google Developer Program to get the most out of the digital experience by viewing content that’s relevant to you.”  The last Google I/O started on May 14, 2024, and was filled with numerous announcements, including new Gemini AI features and models, the Project Astra AI assistant, the Veo generative AI video model, and a major AI-driven update for Google Search. While the 2023 I/O also featured plenty of AI news, it was also the event where Google introduced the Pixel Fold, Pixel Tablet, and Pixel 7A.  Now, in 2025, it will be fun to watch what Google has in its bag of innovations. It is also noteworthy that the Google event will overlap with the Microsoft’s Built conference, starting May 19 to May 20. While Microsoft could reveal Copilot Plus updates, Google is expected to showcase much more. Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Feb 12, 2025Must Watch

However, the estimates have proved to be a bit off and it looks like there is a little delay in the launch. Mark Gurman, a popular Apple analyst, who had initially predicted that the iPhone SE 4 will launch this week, has revised his prediction and says the launch may now take place next week. Although, he does say, “new iPhone SE is still imminent”. The iPhone SE 4 “should be announced by next week, when the company is holding product briefings,” he says.  Interestingly, as per the latest update from the Apple analyst, the next few days will be quite busy for Apple. According to Gurman, there is going to be a “small announcement” tomorrow. He has not mentioned what the announcement will be about. Gurman also predicts that there is going to be some Apple Vision Pro-related announcement this Friday. “For Friday, Apple Vision Pro reps are reaching out to press about an announcement to come,” he writes.  Additionally, he also claims that the M4 MacBook Air, which is another Apple device with a lot of anticipation around it, will launch in the next few weeks. “M4 MacBook Air within weeks,” Gurman predicts.

 If Gurman’s predictions are true, there is a lot to expect from Apple in the coming few weeks. Apple kicked off the purported series of launches with the launch of Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 on Tuesday. The earbuds are aimed at athletes and have a standout feature, which is a heart rate sensor that allows each of the buds to monitor and report heart rate during a workout. The earbuds also feature Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) with the Transparency mode. The Powerbeats Pro 2 is priced at Rs 29,900.Apple iPhone SE 4: What to expect The upcoming iPhone SE 4 is set to get a major design overhaul –– it is expected to move away from its traditional small form factor and adopt an iPhone 14-like design. The affordable iPhone is also believed to replace the Touch ID home button with FaceID, and get a bigger 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate instead of the previous 4.7-inch LCD screen. The iPhone SE 2025 is also believed to bring some big camera improvements with an upgrade to a 48-megapixel rear camera from the 12-megapixel one in iPhone SE 3. The front camera could see a boost to a 24-megapixel sensor.   The general design of the iPhone is expected to resemble the recent iPhones, instead of the rounded edge-design that felt like an iPod. The jury is still out on whether the phone will feature a Dynamic Island but many rumours suggest that the phone will run on Apple A18 chip with 8GB RAM and support Apple Intelligence.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Feb 12, 2025Also read |  Elon Musk offers $97 billion to buy OpenAI, Sam Altman rejects it and mocks him saying we will buy X for $9BAlso read |  Google announces dates for I/O 2025 event: What to expectAlso read |  36 previously banned Chinese apps make a comeback in IndiaMust Watch

Some have changed ownership, while others remain largely the same.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/36-previously-banned-chinese-apps-make-a-comeback-in-india-2678593-2025-02-12,"Back in 2020, India banned about 267 Chinese apps, citing security risks and concerns over data privacy. This move came in response to the rising border tensions between India and China following the Galwan Valley clash. Fast-forward to 2025 and many of these apps have made a comeback, either in their original form or disguised under different names. Currently, at least 36 of the previously banned apps are now available for download on the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store. Some of these have retained their original identity, while others have undergone minor tweaks in branding, logo, or ownership details. These apps belong to various categories, including gaming, shopping, entertainment, file sharing, and content creation. As reported by India Today, among the returning apps to Indian app stores, file-sharing service Xender, streaming platforms MangoTV and Youku, shopping app Taobao, and dating app Tantan stand out. While MangoTV remains unchanged, the others have undergone minor modifications. For instance, Xender is now listed on Apple’s App Store as Xender: File Share, Share Music, though it is still unavailable on the Google Play Store. Similarly, Taobao now appears as Mobile Taobao, while Tantan has been rebranded as TanTan - Asian Dating App. Interestingly, while some of these apps continue to be run by their original Chinese developers, others have taken different routes to re-enter the Indian market. Shein, the popular fashion retailer, made a return via a licensing deal with Reliance. The Indian government has confirmed that all user data related to Shein will now be stored within India, ensuring its Chinese parent company has no access. Despite the bans, clone versions of many apps continue to surface. In some cases, the original developers have simply rebranded their apps with minor changes, keeping the core functionality intact. PUBG Mobile, for example, was banned in 2020 but returned in 2021 as Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) under South Korea's Krafton. However, even this version faced another ban in 2022, only to be reinstated in 2023 after meeting security and compliance standards. The presence of these apps highlights how difficult it is to enforce an absolute ban. While the government can restrict access to certain applications, alternative versions, clones, and similar services often reappear under different names. Some of the returning apps now list ownership from India, Singapore, Vietnam, South Korea, Seychelles, Japan, and Bangladesh, making it even harder to track their origins.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 12, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

These shades are very much in line with what we have already seen in the Pixel 9 series.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/pixel-9a-renders-leaked-colours-design-specs-and-more-2678630-2025-02-12,"In the latest update, alleged renders of the Google Pixel 9a have leaked online, showcasing the phone’s design in all its expected colours. For those unfamiliar, the Pixel 9a is expected to be announced on March 19, followed by a release on March 26. Interestingly, if Google sticks to the rumoured March 19 release date, the Pixel 9a will arrive two months earlier than previous Pixel A-series devices. For context, both the Pixel 7a and 8a were launched in May during their respective years at Google I/O. We are still a month away from the rumoured launch, and if it doesn’t happen then, it is expected to take place during Google I/O 2025, scheduled for May 20-21. As mentioned in previous reports by Android Headlines, the Google Pixel 9a is expected to be released in four colours: Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony. In the latest leak, alleged official renders of all the colours have surfaced online. These shades are very much in line with what we have already seen in the Pixel 9 series. Additionally, the renders suggest that Google may finally move away from the bar-style camera island on Pixel phones, opting instead for a flush design.Google Pixel 9a: Expected price, specs and features According to various reports, in terms of pricing, the Pixel 9a will start in the US at $499 (roughly Rs 43,300) for the 128GB storage option, while the 256GB storage will cost $599 (roughly Rs 52,000). For those choosing Verizon’s mmWave version, an extra $50 will be added to these prices. These figures align with the Pixel 8a’s starting price in the US, though the higher storage option is slightly more expensive this time around. Of course, the Pixel 9a’s price will likely differ when it launches in India. For context, the Google Pixel 8a was launched in India at Rs 52,999 and Rs 59,999 for the 128GB and 256GB storage variants, respectively.

 As seen in the leaked renders, the Pixel 9a is rumoured to move away from the bar-style camera island seen in previous models, instead adopting a flush back design. This change is likely due to the inclusion of a larger 5,100mAh battery, the biggest ever in a Pixel device. Despite the increased battery size, the phone is expected to remain compact, featuring a 6.28-inch display with a peak brightness of 2,700 nits and an HDR brightness of 1,800 nits. The display is also tipped to support a 120Hz refresh rate and a 240Hz touch sampling rate. Under the hood, the Pixel 9a is rumoured to be powered by Google’s Tensor G4 chipset, paired with 8GB of LPDDR5X RAM. Storage options will include 128GB and 256GB, both utilising UFS 3.1 technology. The phone will run Android 15 out of the box and is expected to come with a promise of seven years of software and security updates. On the camera front, the Pixel 9a is expected to feature a dual-camera setup, including a 48-megapixel primary sensor and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens. The front-facing camera will also use the same 13-megapixel sensor. Google’s signature camera features, such as Night Sight, Astrophotography, and Super Res Zoom, are expected to make an appearance. Despite its impressive specs, the Pixel 9a might have a few limitations, similar to the Pixel 8a. For instance, rumours suggest that charging speeds will be capped at 23W for wired charging and 7.5W for wireless charging.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Feb 12, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, X7 Pro review: Which is best for you?Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Can't see notifications on your Samsung phone anymore?

This comes after the US President Donald Trump signed an exclusive order on his first day in office. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/after-google-apple-maps-renames-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america-2678618-2025-02-12,"Following the US President's orders, Apple has also changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. This comes a day after Google followed orders and renamed the large water body. For perspective, the name ""The Gulf of Mexico"" has been in use for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. But not any more, as the newly appointed US President Donald thinks, ""The Gulf of America has a nice ring to it"". He liked this idea so much that he signed an exclusive order to rename the water body on his first day at the office. After the official order, the US government updated its official map to reflect the new name. While Google followed suit by making the change in its Google Maps app earlier this week, Apple Maps has also done the same.  So far, Apple and Google have revised the names, but Microsoft's Bing is yet to do so. According to a report, published by CNET, Microsoft is planning for this change soon. It states that Microsoft is updating Bing Maps to align with the Geographic Names Information System's nomenclature in the United States, which includes renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America within US territory. While this nomenclature update is limited to the US, Google Maps shows the new name side by side for the rest of the world. If you search for the Gulf of Mexico, Google Maps will show you the water body named as is but has the Gulf of America written in bracket with it. Meanwhile, Apple Maps has only applied this change in the US and shows the old name in other countries.

advertisement The decision has sparked mixed reactions, with many questioning the necessity of the name change. Historically, the Gulf has been shared by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba, serving as a vital hub for shipping, fishing, and energy production. However, the US administration at the time defended the renaming, stating that it better reflects America’s influence over the waters. Mexico has also condemned the move, asserting that the US cannot unilaterally rename a body of water shared by both nations.  Republican lawmakers have praised Google for complying with Trump’s order while criticising Apple for not immediately following suit. US Representative Greg Steube even took to Facebook on Tuesday, stating that Apple is “still lost at sea.”  But now that Apple has changed the name, the focus will be on the Microsoft.
