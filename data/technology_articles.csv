But, the 1800-ChatGPT feature is free for only 15 minutes. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-is-now-available-on-call-but-here-is-the-catch-2652073-2024-12-19,"OpenAI is offering users a new way to interact with its popular chatbot through a dedicated phone line: 1-800-CHATGPT. By dialing the US number (1-800-242-8478) or messaging via WhatsApp, users can now easily access the AI assistant through familiar communication channels. OpenAI announced the feature on Wednesday, emphasising that it provides a convenient and affordable way to explore ChatGPT. Initially, users will receive 15 minutes of free usage per month.
 


advertisement1800-ChatGPT: How does it work? Calls to the 1-800 number does not require an account, although OpenAI mentioned in a livestream that it is working on integrating WhatsApp messages with individual ChatGPT credentials for a more personalised experience. The tool was developed by the OpenAI team in just a few weeks, according to a company representative during the livestream. And the company has clearly stated that the phone calls will not be used to train the chatbot.
 


OpenAI views this new feature as a key step in making AI more accessible to newcomers, offering a simplified version of ChatGPT compared to its web-based platform. It provides an affordable way for users to experience technology through familiar channels. However, the company advises existing users who need more advanced features, higher usage limits, and personalisation options to continue using their regular ChatGPT accounts via traditional methods. The feature is currently exclusive for US users. 
 


Interestingly, Google launched a similar service in 2007 called GOOG-411, which provided free voice-based directory assistance. The service was discontinued in 2010 without an official explanation, but some speculate it was shut down once Google had collected enough voice data to improve its speech recognition technology. ChatGPT search can now be your default search engine In a similar development, ChatGPT Search will now be accessible to all users with an account on OpenAI's mobile apps and website. By offering an AI-driven alternative to traditional search engines, OpenAI aims to redefine the search experience, positioning itself as a formidable competitor to Google and other established players in the space. The integration of advanced natural language processing tools promises to enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results, making ChatGPT Search an appealing option for users looking for more than just a list of links. mbedded entity widgetmbedded entity mbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetPublished By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Trending Reel

In a recent post on Weibo, Instant Digital shared that their source confirmed the iPhone 17 Pro’s three-camera setup will remain in the triangular arrangement, even though the back of the phone will look different from earlier models. This directly challenges other recent reports coming out from China that claimed the new design would feature a horizontal bar or an elongated oval-shaped module. Apple’s triangular camera layout first appeared on the iPhone 11 Pro and was a big shift from the traditional vertical designs seen on earlier iPhones. The move to this layout wasn’t just about looks; it allowed Apple to fit in a third camera, which introduced the Ultra Wide lens, along with improved sensors and better overall performance. Since then, this triangular camera design has stuck around, shaping the look of every iPhone model up to the current iPhone 16 Pro. However, while the triangular layout might not be going away, the iPhone 17 Pro's design could still bring some big changes. According to Wayne Ma of The Information, the back of the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max may feature a new rectangular camera bump made out of aluminium instead of the usual 3D glass. The bottom half of the phone will reportedly remain glass to support wireless charging. If this is true, it would mark a big departure from Apple's traditional design choices. As mentioned above, Instant Digital has a mixed record when it comes to Apple leaks, but they’ve been right about some big details in the past. For example, they correctly predicted the 2023 launch of the Yellow iPhone 14, the frosted glass design of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and even the spatial video feature on the iPhone 15 Pro. They’ve also nailed details about the Apple Watch Series 9 and future iPads. While they’ve got things wrong before, their track record makes their insights worth paying attention to. So, while it seems clear that the iPhone 17 Pro’s design is changing, the exact details remain uncertain. For now, fans of the triangular camera layout can probably rest easy — or at least until Apple officially unveils the device. As with all rumours, it’s best to stay sceptical but curious.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

This flagship lineup will include the high-end OnePlus 13, the mid-range OnePlus 13R, and the new OnePlus Buds Pro 3 earbuds. Since the OnePlus 13 has already launched in the China market, ahead of the launch, we have a pretty good idea about what we can expect from the smartphone. There could be some little tweaks here and there, but we already know a lot about the OnePlus 13. Let’s dive into it.advertisementOnePlus 13: Specs and Features  DisplayThe OnePlus 13 features a 6.82-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and QHD+ resolution. It offers a peak brightness of 4,500 nits. There are also 2 standout upgrades to the OnePlus 13 over its predecessor. It includes:

- Dynamic local high refresh rate: The screen adjusts its refresh rate intelligently, conserving battery during less intensive tasks and ramping up for smoother performance during actions like scrolling.   Performance and battery Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The phone also packs a large 6,000mAh battery, a notable upgrade from the 5,400mAh unit in its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. OnePlus claims the battery can last nearly two days on a single charge.   For charging, the device supports 100W wired and 50W wireless charging, along with a new magnetic wireless charging feature via compatible cases. Camera specifications

While the 50-megapixel LYT-808 primary sensor remains unchanged, the telephoto and ultrawide cameras on the OnePlus 13 now feature 50-megapixel sensors as well.  The Hasselblad camera system also supports 4K/60fps Dolby Vision video recording. Build and other features

OnePlus 13’s durability gets a boost with IP68 and IP69 ratings. This means that the device is protected against dust and high-pressure water jets. Additional features include:  
- Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor: Allows unlocking the device even with wet hands.  
- Enhanced vibration motor: Designed for an immersive gaming experience.  OnePlus 13R and OnePlus Buds Pro 3 The OnePlus 13R will also be launching alongside the OnePlus 13 on January 7. The R-series by OnePlus caters to a more budget-friendly yet premium smartphone experience. While details about its specifications are scarce, it is expected to share some design and performance elements with the flagship model, albeit with scaled-down features. There are also rumours that the OnePlus Ace 5, which is scheduled to launch in China next week, will be rebranded as OnePlus 13R in India. Additionally, OnePlus will also be bringing the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 to the Indian market at the same event. These earbuds, already available in India, are likely to introduce a new variant with added features.OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R price and availability   While OnePlus hasn’t officially disclosed the pricing for the OnePlus 13, it is expected to stay under Rs 70,000, considering the OnePlus 12 was launched in India at Rs 64,999. The mid-range OnePlus 13R will likely offer a more affordable alternative. All devices will be available across major online and offline platforms post-launch.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

Here is everything we know about Nothing's next flagship phone, so far. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/nothing-phone-3-to-launch-next-year-price-specs-features-and-all-we-know-so-far-2652377-2024-12-19,"The Nothing Phone 3 has been delayed quite a bit. It was supposed to be launched earlier this year. It was then rumoured to be delayed by a few months, and then the company CEO Carl Pei clarified that we shouldn’t expect the Nothing flagship until 2025. All this delay was largely credited to an artificial intelligence (AI) integration that the company was working on. They said they wanted to get it right and not rush it. Fair point. However, we are now just days away from 2025, and the excitement for the Nothing Phone 3 is building once again.  Nothing has been fairly quiet about the Nothing Phone 3, but considering all the AI that has been teased for the phone, and that it is going to be the company’s next big flagship, there have been several reports that give us some idea what to expect from the phone.  The Nothing Phone 3 is expected to come with a bunch of new features, including an iPhone-like Action Button, and a 6.5-inch display, according to leaks. The Nothing Phone 3 is also expected to be accompanied by a Pro version –– the Nothing Phone 3 Pro –– which is believed to sport a larger 6.7-inch screen. The Action Button, inspired by a similar feature on the iPhone, is expected to offer customisable controls, enabling users to launch apps, switch settings, or create personalised shortcuts. This new feature underscores Nothing’s focus on user-centric innovations, and contemporary design trends.  While the Nothing Phone 2 uses a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset on a more premiumly-priced phone, the Phone 3 is anticipated to feature a more mid-range chipset, like the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 or MediaTek Dimensity 9200+. Which also gives us context about the possible pricing of the phone. The Nothing Phone 1 debuted in India at a starting price of Rs 32,999, while the Phone 2 missed the ball with a slightly higher price tag, where its base variant was priced starting Rs 44,999. The potential shift back to a mid-range offering could make the Phone 3 more accessible to a broader audience, while the Pro variant could cater to users seeking higher-end specifications. As per rumours, there is also going to be a third phone –– likely called the Nothing Phone 3a –– but rumours about it are still scarce. But the rumour does sound likely, considering Nothing launched the Nothing Phone 2a in India just earlier this year. You can also read our review of the Nothing Phone 2a.

According to the authorities, the company offered vague or insufficient information. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/netflix-fined-rs-423-crore-for-not-being-transparent-about-how-they-were-using-user-data-2652354-2024-12-19,"The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) has imposed a €4.75 million (Rs 42.35 crore) fine on Netflix for failing to adequately inform its customers about how their personal data was used between 2018 and 2020. The fine follows an investigation that began in 2019, revealing that the streaming giant did not meet the requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The DPA's investigation found that Netflix’s privacy policy lacked clarity, particularly in explaining how the company handled customer data. According to the authorities, the streaming service did not provide enough information in its privacy statement regarding the use and collection of personal data. Moreover, when customers enquired about the specifics of the data collected by Netflix, they were not given sufficient details. This lack of transparency constitutes a violation of the GDPR, which mandates that businesses must be clear about how personal information is handled and must respond appropriately when customers request data information.Netflix has objected to the fine The Dutch regulator emphasised that these shortcomings in Netflix’s data protection practices occurred between 2018 and 2020. The fine is a result of Netflix’s failure to meet its obligations under EU privacy laws during that period. In response to the fine, Netflix stated that it had been fully cooperative with the DPA throughout the investigation and had made significant improvements to its privacy policies. The company acknowledged that it had updated its privacy statement to offer greater transparency regarding how customer data is collected and used. Additionally, Netflix stressed that these changes were made proactively, long before the fine was issued. A spokesperson for Netflix informed Reuters, “Since the investigation began over five years ago, we have worked closely with the Dutch Data Protection Authority and continuously evolved our privacy information to provide greater clarity for our members. We have objected to this decision.”DPA against Netflix In a statement to another news agency, AFP, DPA chairman Aleid Wolfsen said: “A company like that, with a turnover of billions and millions of customers worldwide, has to explain properly to its customers how it handles their personal data. That must be crystal clear. Especially if the customer asks about this. And that was not in order.”  The data protection authority also noted that Netflix offered vague or insufficient information in various aspects. The regulator pointed out that Netflix was not clear about the purposes for collecting personal data, the sharing of data with third parties, the duration of data retention, and the security measures in place for data transfers outside of Europe. While Netflix has improved its transparency and compliance with GDPR regulations, the fine underscores the growing scrutiny of companies' handling of personal data, especially as data privacy continues to be a key issue in the digital age. This penalty marks a significant move by European regulators, who have been increasingly vigilant in enforcing GDPR rules against companies operating within the EU. The fine serves as a reminder that businesses must remain diligent in protecting personal data and providing customers with clear and comprehensive privacy policies.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  EU asks Apple to make more changes to the way iOS worksAlso read |  Apple has reportedly cancelled plans to launch an iPhone hardware subscription serviceAlso read |  Elon Musk says stop using hashtags on X because you don't need them and they look uglyMust Watch

This update is now gradually making its way to Nothing Phone 2 and Phone 2a users. If you own one of these devices, you may not see the update immediately as it’s being released in stages, so some users might have to wait several days or even weeks before it shows up. The company has mentioned that the rollout process could take until the end of the year to reach every device. To check if the update is available for your Nothing smartphone, you can manually look for it by heading to Settings > System Update. If it’s not there yet, don’t worry — it should arrive on your phone soon. The Nothing OS 3.0 stable update brings a lot of exciting features that aim to make the user experience smoother and more personal. One of the standout additions is the new Nothing Gallery app. It’s designed to help you find photos more easily with improved search options. You can also make quick edits to your pictures using simple tools like filters, markup, and smart suggestions. The lock screen has also been given a fresh look. You can now customise it to make it feel more like your own. One cool feature is the ability to add Shared Widgets to the lock screen, which lets you stay connected with friends and family. There’s also a Countdown Widget, so you can keep track of important events right from your lock screen. Another handy addition is the Smart Drawer, which uses AI to automatically organise your apps into folders. This can save you time by making it easier to find what you need. Other updates include revamped Quick Settings for faster access to controls, an improved Pop-up View for multitasking, and new system fonts that are cleaner and easier to read. While Nothing has revealed a lot of these features, they’ve hinted at other performance and visual improvements that haven’t been detailed yet. For those using other Nothing devices, there’s good news too. The update will roll out to the Nothing Phone 1, Nothing Phone 2a Plus, and CMF Phone 1 in early 2025.

The lineup includes the OnePlus Ace 5, which is expected to debut in India as the OnePlus 13R on January 7, 2025. While the Ace 5 Pro will also be unveiled in the series, the focus for Indian fans remains on the Ace 5, which will succeed the popular 12R model. This also puts the rumours to rest that suggested that OnePlus could be working on a ""mini"" smartphone, which was expected to launch as part of the Ace 5 series.  The OnePlus Ace 5 features an impressive set of features, making it an exciting device for gaming enthusiasts and power users alike. It is expected to come with a 6.78-inch BOE X2 8T LTPO display, offering a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Under the hood, the Ace 5 will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. But according to official China teasers, OnePlus is taking it up a notch by optimising the chip with its in-house “Fengchi Game Core” (translated from Chinese via Google Translate) technology. According to the company, this fine-tuning pushes the SoC’s performance to a level comparable to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.5, providing a smoother gaming experience with better power efficiency and heat management. In fact, the company claims the phone can maintain a steady 120fps frame rate even after five hours of heavy gaming. In terms of memory and storage, the OnePlus Ace 5 is expected to offer up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. A massive 6,000mAh battery is also rumoured, which should keep the phone going all day long. Charging won’t be an issue either, as the Ace 5 supports 100W fast-wired charging. For photos and videos, there could be a triple-camera setup on the back. The phone is expected to feature a 50-megapixel primary camera with OIS, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 2-megapixel macro lens. On the front, there will likely be a 16-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. The OnePlus Ace 5 will run on ColorOS 15 based on Android 15. However, the Indian version of the phone, i.e. the OnePlus 13R, is expected to boot OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15. Other features include an IR blaster along with the classic alert slider that many OnePlus fans love.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The rumour indicates that Apple plans to include the SE 4 in the iPhone 16 lineup and, might call it the iPhone 16e. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-may-be-called-the-iphone-16e-launch-timeline-price-and-all-we-know-2652121-2024-12-19,"A recent leak suggests that Apple might rebrand the upcoming toned-down version, iPhone SE 4, as the iPhone 16e. The speculations are that the phone could debut in March 2025. The Weibo tipster Fixed focus digital posted that the company may be dropping the SE branding altogether, and instead, it will add the SE 4 to the iPhone 16 line-up. The rumour has it that the phone is expected to carry several iPhone 16 features, including camera and display specs. If this holds to be true, the iPhone 16e makes a lot of sense. Let's delve deeper into the details of the upcoming iPhone 16e. advertisementiPhone SE 4 rebranding as iPhone 16e: What to expect It looks like the iPhone SE 4 or 16e is shaping up to be a significant upgrade compared to its predecessors. The shift from the iPhone 8-inspired design to one more in line with the iPhone XR or iPhone 12 will provide a more modern and immersive user experience. The larger 6.06-inch OLED display, compared to the previous 4.7-inch LCD, will enhance the overall viewing quality, making it more comparable to the high-end iPhones. The move away from the Touch ID home button in favour of Face ID is another major change, modernising the device further by slimming down the bezels. This will make the phone more in line with Apple's design language in their latest models. Additionally, the Weibo tipster also reveals that the iPhone 16e will have the same screen size as the standard iPhone 16 and will feature a full-screen design.

Additionally, the Weibo tipster also reveals that the iPhone 16e will have the same screen size as the standard iPhone 16 and will feature a full-screen design. With the rumoured A18 chipset, the 16e will have a substantial performance boost, bringing it closer to the iPhone 16 series in terms of processing power. The increase to 8GB of RAM (up from 4GB) is especially notable, offering better multitasking capabilities and support for more demanding apps, including Apple's latest AI and machine learning features. Combined with 128GB of storage, this represents a substantial upgrade in terms of performance and user experience. This update suggests that the iPhone 16e will be positioned as a more affordable but still powerful alternative for users who want the latest hardware in a more compact and budget-friendly package. The inclusion of a 48-megapixel rear camera in the iPhone 16e would be a major upgrade, aligning it with the capabilities of the iPhone 16. If the SE 4 or 16e indeed adopts the same camera setup, it would mark a significant leap for Apple’s budget-friendly lineup, offering a similar level of photography performance to the higher-end models. The 48-megapixel ""Fusion"" lens, as seen in the iPhone 16, allows for both high-quality standard and 2x zoom photos without sacrificing detail, which would be a notable feature for the 16e. This camera system could enable much sharper, more versatile photography, especially for users who are upgrading from older SE models that have more basic camera setups. Additionally, the 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera would improve selfies and video calls, further enhancing the device's overall imaging capabilities. This front camera is likely to bring improved depth-sensing and portrait mode features, thanks to its advanced technology. iPhone 16e or SE 4: India price (Expected) Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has revealed that Apple will begin mass production of the fourth-generation iPhone SE in December. The company plans to manufacture approximately 8.6 million units of the new model during the first quarter of 2025, with a possible launch in March or April, according to Kuo's recent blog post.  Leaks indicate that the iPhone SE 4 will be priced between $499 and $549, reflecting an increase from the iPhone SE 3’s starting price of $429. In India, where the SE 3 was launched at Rs 43,900, the iPhone 16e or SE 4 is expected to be priced between Rs 51,000 and Rs 56,000.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  iPhone 17 Pro design details leaked online, will Apple make changes to it?Also read |  Apple has reportedly cancelled plans to launch an iPhone hardware subscription serviceAlso read |  EU asks Apple to make more changes to the way iOS worksMust Watch

The JioTag Go is designed to help users track their belongings, such as keys, wallets, luggage, and more. It features Bluetooth v5.3 connectivity, and is powered by a CR2032 battery, which promises up to one year of usage.   When within Bluetooth range, users can activate the Play Sound option via the Find My Device app, prompting the tracker to emit a beeping noise for easy identification. If the tracker is outside Bluetooth range, the app uses the Find My Device network to show its last known location on a map, along with navigation assistance to reach the spot.   The compact device measures 38.2 x 38.2 x 7.2mm and weighs just 9g. However, the JioTag Go is only compatible with Android smartphones running Android 9 or later, excluding iPhone users.  Jio’s tracker evolution The JioTag Go is Reliance Jio's second foray into Bluetooth trackers this year. In July, the company launched the JioTag Air, which is compatible with Apple’s Find My network and supports both iPhones (iOS 14 and later) and Android devices. With these two trackers, Jio has strategically catered to users of both major ecosystems, broadening its market appeal.  JioTag Go: How it stacks up against Apple AirTag At Rs 1,499, the JioTag Go is significantly more affordable than Apple’s AirTag, which is priced at Rs 3,490 in India. While the AirTag offers advanced features like ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for precision tracking and seamless integration with Apple devices, the JioTag Go stands out as a cost-effective solution for Android users with reliable Bluetooth tracking and Find My Device network support.

This law aims to stop large tech companies from using their power unfairly. However, the European Union (EU) now wants Apple to do even more. The EU is asking Apple to make iOS work better with other platforms and to share features and technologies that are currently exclusive to Apple. According to Bloomberg, the European Commission released a document on Wednesday as part of its antitrust investigation into Apple. In the document, the EU lists specific changes it wants Apple to make. For example, it asks Apple to allow users to easily connect devices like smartwatches and headphones from other brands with iPhones. Right now, it’s often easier to use Apple accessories like AirPods and Apple Watches. The EU also wants Apple to let third-party apps work fully in the background. Currently, only Apple’s first-party apps can do this. The document also mentions that features like AirPlay and AirDrop should be open to devices that aren’t made by Apple. The EU has set a deadline of January 9, 2025, to review this case. If Apple doesn’t comply, the EU could start a formal investigation. This could lead to Apple paying fines of up to 10 per cent of its global annual revenue. That’s a huge amount of money for the company. Apple has responded by pushing back against the EU’s demands. In an online document, Apple argued that the DMA rules could harm user privacy and security. The company said it’s being unfairly targeted and claimed that opening up its technologies would make iPhones less safe. Apple also pointed out that companies like Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) have been asking for access to sensitive iOS features. Apple argues that if it grants all of Meta’s requests, it could allow apps like Facebook to track users’ calls, messages, and activities. The company said it has deliberately chosen not to collect this kind of data to protect its users. Meanwhile, Meta says it needs access to Apple’s features to improve products like Ray-Ban smart glasses and Meta Quest headsets. Apple counters by saying its current system already allows these devices to work with iPhones without any special permissions. This isn’t just an EU issue. In Brazil, regulators are also pushing Apple to open up its ecosystem. Apple is fighting that decision but might have to allow sideloading there as well. As the January 2025 deadline approaches, Apple’s next steps will be closely watched by regulators, developers, and users worldwide.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

However, reports suggest that Apple is no longer working on the project. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-has-reportedly-cancelled-plans-to-launch-its-iphone-hardware-subscription-service-2652085-2024-12-19,"Apple has reportedly stopped developing its much-anticipated iPhone hardware subscription service, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Initially unveiled in early 2022, the program was designed to offer users an alternative way to access Apple’s flagship devices by paying a recurring fee, enabling subscribers to receive a new iPhone each year. Despite its promising concept, the project has faced multiple delays and is now officially discontinued.   The service, which was part of Apple’s growing subscription ecosystem, was delayed due to technical challenges, including software bugs, and regulatory concerns. Originally slated for launch the same year, it was announced, which was 2022, the project has since been deprioritised, with team resources reportedly redirected to other initiatives within the company.   This decision comes on the heels of Apple’s discontinuation of Apple Pay Later , a feature that allowed users to split payments into instalments. Despite its recent launch, Apple Pay Later was shuttered after a brief run, signalling a potential shift in Apple’s approach to financial services tied to its hardware ecosystem.  Alternative payment options remain  While the hardware subscription service will not move forward, Apple continues to offer various payment plans for customers seeking flexibility in purchasing its devices. The iPhone Upgrade Program allows users to finance a new iPhone and AppleCare+ coverage over 24 months. Subscribers can upgrade to a new iPhone after making payments equivalent to 12 months.   For those with an Apple Card, Apple Card Monthly Installments provide another way to spread out the cost of new Apple products, including iPhones, over time. These options remain part of Apple’s strategy to make its devices accessible while maintaining customer loyalty.   The iPhone hardware subscription service represented a bold move to solidify Apple’s dominance in the smartphone market. By tying customers to a recurring payment model, the company could have ensured a steady revenue stream and reinforced user retention. However, the challenges of launching such a service in an increasingly scrutinized regulatory landscape may have outweighed its potential benefits.   Apple’s focus now appears to lean more heavily on its suite of digital subscription services, such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple One bundles. These offerings have proven successful in building a recurring revenue model while complementing the company’s hardware business.   Despite this strategic shift, Apple’s existing payment plans provide consumers with flexible alternatives, ensuring that its devices remain within reach for a broad audience. However, the shelving of the hardware subscription service may leave some wondering what could have been for the Cupertino tech giant.

Until now, it might have been the case that its devices were not powerful enough for AAA games. Now they are, and Apple might do well to create a new Apple TV that can challenge Xbox and PlayStation in gaming. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/talking-points/story/apple-needs-to-make-apple-tv-that-can-run-aaa-games-challenge-xbox-and-playstation-2651840-2024-12-18,"Technology journalists who keep a close eye on Apple know one thing with certainty every time they cover the company's call analysts after its quarterly results. They know that Gene Munster, an analyst, would ask Apple when the company is releasing its television. Munster has done that for years, quarter after quarter. But so far no television from Apple has appeared. Now, there are reports again that an Apple TV — the actual big-screen television and not the streaming box that Apple already sells — is in work again. Possibly, we will see an Apple television come out of the company's labs and factories in a few months, or more likely in a few years. But I believe that instead of a television it should create a different Apple TV.  A different Apple TV, which is more than a streaming box, is now such a low-hanging fruit that it would be almost a sacrilege on the part of Apple to not do it. All the ingredients are there for Apple to create an Apple TV that is not only a streaming box but is also a gaming console similar to the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.  Look at it from this angle: for a device like the Xbox Series X or the PlayStation 5 Pro, there are three essential components. One, is the chipset that gives these consoles the ability to run games. Two, the gaming ecosystem and availability of games people would want to play. And three, people willing to buy it. Apple already, I believe, has two of these components. The M4 is powerful enough In terms of hardware, Apple is already at the level of the latest Xbox and Playstation. The Xbox Series X has a chip made by AMD. It has a performance of around 12 Tflops. The PlayStation 5 Pro, which is a slightly beefed up variant of PS5, also has a chip made by AMD and that chip performs at around 16 Tflops. These numbers are in line with what the M4 Pro and the M4 Max, the latest Apple chips, can offer through their graphics units. The numbers for Apple chips range from 8 Tflops to 17 Tflops depending on the variant but it is safe to say that if Apple wants to have a chip that is equivalent to the chips in the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X  it can do so tomorrow just by tuning and binning one of the M4s. 

 



M4 Max is already as powerful as chipsets in the latest Xbox and PlayStation 5.
 In fact, Apple has chips that are significantly faster. The Ultra variant of the M3 has a graphics core that is already over 20 Tflops. And some variants of the M4 Ultra, which is bound to come out in 2025, are likely to be close to 30 Tflops, offering almost double the horsepower that PlayStation or Xbox can manage.  Apple has also, by putting these chips in the MacBook Pro and Mac Mini, demonstrated that they can go into small boxes without requiring elaborate cooling. In other words, except the economics that I am not privy to, nothing is stopping Apple from putting one of these ultra-fast M series chips in Apple TV and then turning that into a gaming console.  The third part of the equation — consumers — too I believe are there. According to some research firms, there are around 34 million Apple TVs in use in the US in 2024. Even if we are a little more conservative in estimates, it is safe to say that there would easily be around 55-60 million active Apple TVs worldwide, which is not a small number for a device that is not ""essential"" like an iPhone or Mac. In fact, Apple rarely promotes Apple TV and so far has been happy keeping it almost like a side project, updating it every two or three years. If this small box, apart from performing its streaming and entertainment duties, can also help people play AAA games, I am certain that it would find more favour among consumers. AAA games needed The tricky for Apple, however, is the second component: the availability of AAA games. But this too, I believe, can be solved by a more robust Apple TV. In recent years it has become important for Apple to crack the AAA games puzzle. The company is trying — hence Hideo Kojima at last year's WWDC in Cupertino — but so far the games haven't appeared. Nowadays whenever I am reviewing something with the M series chipset in it, I find that it is missing AAA games that hold it back. Something like a MacBook Pro M4 is an incredibly powerful laptop, but for a lot of regular consumers, it is an overkill. Less than stellar availability of top games is keeping a lot of consumers away from the MacBook Pro. A lot of people want to work and play. And not just work on their Rs 2 lakh laptop. Unless they are editing videos, or doing programming or running simulations, they don't need the power that chips like M4 Pro or the M4 Max offer.  An incredible list of AAA games — think the latest Call of Duty — will make Apple computers even more attractive than they are. And an Apple TV, which has a robust graphics chip, might entice more game developers to come to Apple camp and create games for it.  In a way — but not entirely because I think matters of business, Apple's cut in purchase and the entire cost-benefit ratio are also there — the lack of AAA games on Apple platforms could be a chicken and egg problem for game developers. What comes first? Games or the devices that can play them? Previously, Apple didn't have chipsets that could be used for serious gaming, and while it could always use a graphics chip by AMD or Nvidia to make its platform more gaming-friendly, probably the math never worked out. Now, however, Apple has an opportunity to do so.  Personally, in my drawing room under the TV I will love a device that can be a do-it-all box. Apple, I believe, has an opportunity to create one such box. The company can potentially call it Apple TV Pro. The price, obviously, will go up because such a box would also need a bigger chip and associated gaming hardware such as more storage. But if it competes with Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 Pro, which are priced above Rs 50,000, I am not sure if consumers would mind a reasonable hike in price.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

Priced at Rs 3,499, these outdoor speakers look cool and sound great. More details on it in this review by India Today Tech. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/xiaomi-sound-outdoor-speaker-review-affordable-price-great-sound-cool-design-2651719-2024-12-18,"Xiaomi recently launched a range of mid-budget devices in India, including the Redmi Note 14 series, Redmi Buds 6, and Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. We have reviewed the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ and the Redmi Buds 6. We have also been testing the Xiaomi speakers and it is such a fun device. At Rs 3,499, the speaker looks good, they are portable, they sound great, and of course, they are priced very well. Yes, the speaker has some issues, but they are smaller things that aren't ignorable –– for most people. Let’s get into the details. advertisementXiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: The good thingsThe Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is a total green flag at this price segment. It is equipped with a 30W driver with dual subwoofer. Weighing 597g, the device is light and easily portable. The speaker is enveloped with a grille structure that helps grip the device easily. Additionally, it has an in-built loop to make it easier to carry. By the looks of it, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor design is similar to the Sony ULT Field 1, which is priced at Rs 16,990. The Xiaomi speaker is cylindrical and sleek –– a design that quickly catches the eye. We received the black variant, but it is also available in blue and red.

 



The Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker’s body has a running grille pattern with its branding etched on the face.
While other colours feature a monochromatic pattern, this one has an orange strap in contrast. The strap runs along the back of the device like a spine and sports three buttons: power, Bluetooth and linking. All these buttons require a long press to function. For instance, you have to long press the power button for 3 seconds to switch the speakers on or off. It goes the same for Bluetooth settings as well. There are three additional buttons placed on the mesh of the speakers that are dedicated for play/pause, increasing and decreasing volume. The buttons are clicky and offer good haptic feedback. 

 



The connect button can only be used with multiple Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. Long press the connect button on the strap for 3s on each speaker, and all speakers will pair automatically playing the same content. The Type-C charging port is also placed on the strap.
For durability, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor comes with IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Overall, Xiaomi's latest speaker offers a solid, well-built design that stands out in both form and function. advertisementBut this is not its best part. The best part is its “big speaker energy”. For its size and price, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is capable of filling small to medium-sized rooms pretty well. It delivers a clear and consistent sound quality. The bass delivers a strong punch without overshadowing the mids and highs, maintaining a well-balanced sound profile. This ensures that the audio output remains clear and detailed across different frequencies and a wide range of music genres. 
 


At a price of Rs 3,499, it is equipped with dual large subwoofer radiators on both the sides for a fuller and richer bass sound. Whether you're listening to bass-heavy tracks or more vocal-centric tunes, the sound is dynamic and full, with no one element dominating.The speaker is also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, offering stable connections. It is super easy to connect to the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker. Additionally, the speaker includes a 3.5mm audio jack, providing the flexibility for wired connections, further enhancing its versatility. advertisementComing to the battery life, this speaker does a good job. With a full charge and volume set between 80-90 percent, the speaker offers up to 10 hours of playback, making it ideal for most scenarios such as parties, day outings, or even an entire workday. I took the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker to a party and it played music for 4 hours non-stop. In that time, its battery dropped only 20 per cent. 
 


Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: Things that could be betterAs we mentioned above, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is great, but it has a few drawbacks. The speakers are missing LED indicators. Sure, it isn’t a critical feature, but it definitely adds more functionality to the design. And since we are talking about what could be, some RGB lights on it would be a cool addition. And no, at its price, expecting RGB lights isn’t outrageous. Boat Stone Spinx Pro sports dynamic RGB lights, and the speaker is priced at Rs 2,499. advertisementA subjectively bigger flaw in the speaker is that it only connects via Bluetooth. There are no AUX or other connectivity options.  Xiaomi Sound Outdoor: Should you buy it? For fear of repeating ourselves a third time, Xiaomi Sound Outdoor isn't perfect, but its list of Pros is definitely longer than the Cons. The speaker has great design and sound quality, a solid battery life, and it’s water-resistant. With all that, at Rs 3,499, the speaker comes highly recommended from our side.

The strap runs along the back of the device like a spine and sports three buttons: power, Bluetooth and linking. All these buttons require a long press to function. For instance, you have to long press the power button for 3 seconds to switch the speakers on or off. It goes the same for Bluetooth settings as well. There are three additional buttons placed on the mesh of the speakers that are dedicated for play/pause, increasing and decreasing volume. The buttons are clicky and offer good haptic feedback. 

 



The connect button can only be used with multiple Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. Long press the connect button on the strap for 3s on each speaker, and all speakers will pair automatically playing the same content. The Type-C charging port is also placed on the strap.

 For durability, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor comes with IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Overall, Xiaomi's latest speaker offers a solid, well-built design that stands out in both form and function.  But this is not its best part. The best part is its “big speaker energy”.  For its size and price, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is capable of filling small to medium-sized rooms pretty well. It delivers a clear and consistent sound quality. The bass delivers a strong punch without overshadowing the mids and highs, maintaining a well-balanced sound profile. This ensures that the audio output remains clear and detailed across different frequencies and a wide range of music genres. 
 


 At a price of Rs 3,499, it is equipped with dual large subwoofer radiators on both the sides for a fuller and richer bass sound. Whether you're listening to bass-heavy tracks or more vocal-centric tunes, the sound is dynamic and full, with no one element dominating. The speaker is also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, offering stable connections. It is super easy to connect to the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker. Additionally, the speaker includes a 3.5mm audio jack, providing the flexibility for wired connections, further enhancing its versatility.  Coming to the battery life, this speaker does a good job. With a full charge and volume set between 80-90 percent, the speaker offers up to 10 hours of playback, making it ideal for most scenarios such as parties, day outings, or even an entire workday. I took the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker to a party and it played music for 4 hours non-stop. In that time, its battery dropped only 20 per cent. 
 


Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: Things that could be better As we mentioned above, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is great, but it has a few drawbacks.  The speakers are missing LED indicators. Sure, it isn’t a critical feature, but it definitely adds more functionality to the design. And since we are talking about what could be, some RGB lights on it would be a cool addition. And no, at its price, expecting RGB lights isn’t outrageous. Boat Stone Spinx Pro sports dynamic RGB lights, and the speaker is priced at Rs 2,499.  A subjectively bigger flaw in the speaker is that it only connects via Bluetooth. There are no AUX or other connectivity options.  Xiaomi Sound Outdoor: Should you buy it?  For fear of repeating ourselves a third time, Xiaomi Sound Outdoor isn't perfect, but its list of Pros is definitely longer than the Cons. The speaker has great design and sound quality, a solid battery life, and it’s water-resistant. With all that, at Rs 3,499, the speaker comes highly recommended from our side.

One of the rising concerns is the increasing number of QR code scams, which are catching people off-guard. Scammers are tricking users into scanning fraudulent QR codes, leading to the loss of large sums of money in seconds. Here is how QR code scams work and how you can protect yourself from them.advertisementHow do QR code scams work?QR codes are typically seen as a quick and easy way to make payments, but they have become a tool for scammers. In a QR code scam, the victim is presented with a fake or malicious QR code, often in places where trust is assumed, such as local shops, delivery services, or social media platforms. A scammer generates a QR code that appears to be linked to a legitimate transaction but instead triggers a money transfer to the scammer’s account. The victim scans the code, thinking they are paying for a product or service, but unknowingly authorises a transfer of funds to the scammer. A QR code could also include a fake APK link, which can ask you to download a malicious app or software to gain access to your bank details and other personal data. In some cases, this automatically downloads onto your device once you click on the fake URL present in the QR codes.

Do this to avoid QR code scams in online payments When making a UPI payment, it is better to transfer money directly to the recipient's verified UPI ID or mobile number instead of relying on QR codes, especially if you are unsure of the source. Scammers often exploit the trust people place in QR codes to disguise fraudulent transactions. Be cautious of scanning QR codes in unfamiliar locations or businesses that seem suspicious. Scammers can easily place fake QR codes in public places like restaurants, kiosks, or markets. Always ensure that the QR code belongs to a legitimate and trusted merchant before proceeding with the payment. For additional safety, consider creating a separate bank account that you link solely to your UPI platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe, or Paytm. Keep only a minimal amount (e.g., Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000) in this account. Even if a scam occurs, this measure limits the amount of money you can lose. This approach adds an extra layer of protection to your main savings account, ensuring larger amounts remain untouched in case of fraud. If you receive any suspicious payment requests or links, be sure to cross-check the URL or payment details. Fraudulent links often contain minor spelling errors or unusual domain names that differ from official websites. Taking a moment to verify can save you from falling into a scam.

Recently, there have been multiple incidents of scams involving QR codes, including a case where a police officer lost Rs 2.3 lakh after scanning a fraudulent QR code at a bakery. Now, a new scam involving DHL package delivery has surfaced, causing concerns among citizens who are receiving suspicious notifications. A DHL package delivery notice has been circulating on WhatsApp and X (previously Twitter), warning people not to scan the QR code printed on the paper. The message reads, ""New scam. They will leave this at the door. Do not scan the QR code.""  According to people who have received this poster, this notice is being delivered to their doorstep, which includes a QR code and a prompt to ""re-arrange your delivery now by following 3 simple steps."" The first step asks recipients to scan the QR code to visit the DHL website, followed by entering their DHL Waybill number to choose delivery options.  However, DHL has cleared up the confusion. The company's official DHL Express India account on X (formerly Twitter) responded to a tweet about the so-called scam, clarifying that this notice is legitimate. While this may not be a scam, it is important to remember that QR code scams are the easiest way for scammers to dupe people because these codes could include a malicious link, which a user can click and lose big money in any other scam. ""The paper in the shared image is a legitimate Customer Notification document issued by DHL Express and is commonly referred to as a Not Home (NH) card,"" DHL stated, explaining that the notice is from DHL Singapore and is not a scam. While the paper notice is authentic, a separate scam involving a fake DHL SMS is also making rounds. The fraudulent text message claims, ""Your package is currently processing at our facility. For the most up-to-date information on import charges, please visit our website: http://dhlhub.com.""   The URL in the SMS is not an official DHL link, suggesting that this is a scam aimed at deceiving users into clicking on a malicious link. To protect themselves, users are advised to be cautious when interacting with QR codes, links, and messages from unknown sources. Checking for minor details such as incorrect URLs, poorly written English, or unusual fonts can help identify a scam. It is always safer to verify the legitimacy of such messages directly through official channels or customer service to avoid falling victim to these schemes.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

For anyone looking to get a stylish, feature-packed phone without burning a hole in their pocket, this one might just be worth your consideration. Poco has always focused on delivering speed, power, and value, and this phone seems to stick to that winning formula. Here's a quick look at the 4 reasons why you should consider buying the Poco M7 Pro and one reason you might want to think twice.advertisementPoco M7 Pro 5G: 4 reasons to buyA stunning 120Hz displayThe Poco M7 Pro 5G comes with a 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED display that is not only smooth, thanks to its 120Hz refresh rate, but also incredibly bright for a phone in the sub-Rs 15,000 price segment. With a peak brightness of 2,100 nits, Poco claims this to be one of the brightest displays in its price segment. That means you can comfortably use the phone outdoors in bright sunlight without any issues (though I’ll have to wait for a sunny day to test it myself!). Rest assured, the colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and the overall experience is top-notch for streaming, gaming, and everyday use.

Rest assured, the colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and the overall experience is top-notch for streaming, gaming, and everyday use. Sleek and lightweight design Poco has nailed the design with this phone. The M7 Pro feels great to hold, thanks to its lightweight build and slim profile. It doesn’t have a glass back like its predecessor, but the plastic back with a pastel two-tone finish still looks gorgeous. The Lavender shade, in particular, stands out without being flashy. It’s a phone you’d enjoy carrying around. It feels comfortable, easy to handle, and doesn’t weigh you down like some bulky devices in this range. Reliable performance and battery life Under the hood, the Poco M7 Pro 5G packs the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra processor, which delivers good performance for daily tasks. Whether you’re scrolling through social media, messaging, or running basic apps, the phone runs smoothly. It also has up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which ensures multitasking is hassle-free. On the battery front, Poco has included a 5110mAh battery that easily lasts over a day with moderate usage. The icing on the cake is the 45W fast charging support, and yes, the charger is included in the box! 50MP camera with OIS Cameras are often a deciding factor when buying a phone, and Poco delivers well here. The M7 Pro has a 50MP Sony LYTIA LYT-600 primary camera with OIS (optical image stabilisation), which is a rare feature in this price range. This means steadier photos and videos, especially in low-light conditions. There’s also a 2MP macro camera for close-up shots and a 20MP selfie camera that does a decent job for video calls and selfies.Poco M7 Pro 5G: 1 reason to skip Limited software support Now, here’s the catch — while the Poco M7 Pro 5G runs on Android 14 with HyperOS, Poco is only promising two years of OS updates along with four years of security patches. That means the phone will get main OS updates only up to Android 16. In a world where brands like Samsung offer longer update cycles even on budget phones, this feels like a missed opportunity. To make matters worse, the phone doesn’t come with Android 15 out of the box, which would have been a nice touch for a brand-new device.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

They can mislead people into clicking on videos, only to find content that doesn't match their expectations.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/new-youtube-rules-in-india-as-platform-bans-videos-with-clickbait-titles-2652709-2024-12-20,"YouTube is stepping up its fight against misleading content, especially in India. The platform recently announced that it will be cracking down on videos with misleading titles and thumbnails, often called ""egregious clickbait."" This is part of YouTube's ongoing effort to ensure viewers have a trustworthy experience when they visit the platform, particularly for news and current events. What does this mean for creators? Essentially, YouTube plans to increase enforcement against videos whose title or thumbnail promises something the actual video does not deliver. For instance, a video titled ""The President Has Resigned!"" might attract attention. However, if the video itself doesn't discuss such a resignation, it would fall under the category of ""egregious clickbait."" Similarly, a thumbnail that claims ""Top Political News"" but features no real news would also be flagged. Clickbait titles and thumbnails have long been a frustration for YouTube viewers. They can mislead people into clicking on videos, only to find content that doesn't match their expectations. This not only wastes time but also erodes trust in the platform. YouTube says that this issue becomes even more serious when it involves breaking news or current events, as people often rely on the platform to get timely and accurate information during important moments. To address this, YouTube will start rolling out stricter measures in India over the coming months. The company explained that this gradual rollout will give creators time to adapt to the new rules. Initially, YouTube will focus on removing videos that violate the new policy without issuing strikes against creators' channels. The goal is to educate creators and help them adjust their content to align with the updated guidelines. One of the reasons for starting this enforcement in India is the high volume of news and current events-related content uploaded by Indian creators. As YouTube's user base in India continues to grow, the platform wants to ensure that viewers are not being misled by sensational or dishonest titles and thumbnails. The new policy will prioritise recent uploads, meaning older videos that violate the rules may not be the immediate focus of enforcement. However, creators are encouraged to review their existing content and make the necessary adjustments to avoid future issues. YouTube is also planning to offer educational resources to help creators understand what qualifies as ""egregious clickbait"" and how to stay compliant with the platform's policies. For viewers, this is a welcome move. Misleading titles and thumbnails often leave people feeling tricked or frustrated. By enforcing these new rules, YouTube hopes to create a better experience for its users, where they can trust the videos they click on to deliver the content they were promised. As these changes are rolled out, it will be interesting to see how creators in India respond and adapt to the new guidelines.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

 The teaser gave us a glimpse of how the AI preserves details, even during rapid movements. For instance, when Mosseri moved his arms or face, the edited elements like his outfit and added objects remained impressively intact. But as polished as these previews look, we've seen similarly dazzling demos from competitors like OpenAI’s Sora, which when released, didn’t fully meet expectations.

The Movie Gen AI model was unveiled in October. At the time of launch, the company had said that the AI model aims to “preserve human identity and motion”. While the timeline for its wider availability remains unclear, Instagram’s Adam Mosseri says it will roll out sometime next year. The feature enters a competitive space, going head-to-head with other AI video tools like Adobe’s Firefly, which is already making waves with beta text-to-video editing in Premiere Pro.When is the big launch? Adman Mosseri revealed in his Instagram announcement that the AI tool is expected to roll out in 2025. The exact timeline for the launch has not been revealed. We are hoping the tool will start rolling out soon because if the final product lives up to its teaser, creators could soon edit videos with unprecedented ease, making Instagram a more dynamic playground for creativity.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Trending Reel

With online scams becoming more frequent, this initiative is a step toward ensuring safer digital transactions for everyone. Shield offers a comprehensive protection plan that safeguards users from fraud, phishing attempts, and unauthorised transactions, even if the user loses their phone. What makes Shield appealing is its accessibility and affordability. For the first 30 days, users can enjoy the service for free. After the trial period, it costs just Rs 19 per month, which is a small price to pay for peace of mind. The plan provides coverage of up to Rs 5,000 against fraudulent activities. Getting started with Shield is easy. The service is available on the BharatPe app, which can be downloaded on both Android and iOS devices. Users can activate Shield directly from the app’s homepage by clicking on the relevant banner. However, first-time users must make a payment of at least Rs 1 to any contact or business to activate the feature. If a user faces a fraudulent situation, registering a claim is also straightforward. BharatPe has partnered with OneAssist to streamline the process. Users can either download the OneAssist app or call their toll-free number, 1800-123-3330, to report the incident. However, there’s a crucial requirement — users must report the fraud within 10 days of it happening to be eligible for a claim. Depending on the situation, certain documents may need to be submitted, such as a UPI transaction statement, a copy of the police report or FIR, a claim form, and proof of blocking the UPI account. Additional documents might be required, depending on the nature of the fraud. In today’s world, where digital payments have become a part of daily life, initiatives like Shield are a much-needed safety net. While this service provides valuable protection, users must still stay vigilant. Avoid clicking on unknown links, downloading apps from unverified sources, or sharing sensitive payment information with strangers. BharatPe’s Shield is a timely and thoughtful addition to the digital payment ecosystem. With an increasing number of people like you and me relying on UPI for everything from grocery shopping to bill payments, having a safety net like Shield is reassuring. While it can’t eliminate the risk entirely, it’s a practical step toward making digital transactions safer for everyone.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

A live image of the Oppo Reno 13 has surfaced, showcasing a deep blue or purple colour that looks nothing short of stunning. This new shade, which isn’t available in China, is likely aimed at grabbing attention in India, where unique colour options often create a buzz amongst buyers. The leaked image shows the Reno 13 with its signature triple-camera setup labelled “AI” and a ring-shaped flashlight positioned next to the lenses. What makes this design stand out is how the camera bump seamlessly blends with the phone’s glass back, giving it a premium, unified look. The edges of the phone feature visible antenna bands, hinting at a metal frame. Another interesting detail is the subtle glow around the camera setup, which adds to the phone's charm.

It's somewhat of a crackdown, but not as harsh as Netflix’s rule for piggybackers. Essentially, Amazon says that starting January 2025, Amazon Prime subscribers will only be able to login to 5 devices per account, of which only two devices can be televisions. Which means, you can only be running your Prime video account on two TVs simultaneously, the minute you login to a third, you will be prompted to log out of your other devices.  “As part of your Prime membership, you and your household are entitled to enjoy Prime Video on up to five devices. Starting January 2025, we are updating our usage terms in India to include up to two TVs as part of your five devices entitlement. You can manage your devices on your Settings page or buy another Prime membership to watch Prime Video on more devices,” Amazon’s new policy note reads. Currently, the Prime subscribers are allowed to be logged into 10 devices at a time. As for the devices, these include phones, laptops, tablets, and TVs. The account will be supported on all devices as usual, however, at one time, Prime subscribers will only be able to access Prime Video on 5 devices, which includes 2 TVs.  Amazon’s new policy also states that you can “remove, and replace, up to 2 existing devices in any 30 day period”. Basically, if you have devices registered to your account (example, for streaming or using Amazon services), you are allowed to deregister or delete up to two devices from your account within a 30-day period. You can also replace or add 2 new devices to your account in place of the ones you removed during the same 30-day window. Essentially, you can manage or swap out two devices every 30 days. This likely aims to limit frequent changes, ensuring better control over device registration and account security. Amazon Prime membership plans in India start at Rs 299 per month, Rs 599 for a quarterly subscription, and Rs 1499 for an annual membership. Additional options include the Annual Prime Lite plan priced at Rs 799 and the Prime Shopping Edition available for Rs 399 per year. After the policy change, which will be applicable in January 2025, membership benefits for Prime Video will include unlimited ad-free streaming and access on up to five devices, with support for up to two TVs.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  YouTube says it will remove videos in India that have clickbait titles and thumbnailsAlso read |  Instagram teases AI video editing tool that will change backgrounds, outfits with a simple text promptAlso read |  Nvidia's most affordable Gen AI supercomputer, Jetson Orin Nano, is here: What is it and how it works

This time, the company plans to cut 10 per cent of the managerial roles. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-layoffs-ceo-sundar-pichai-announces-10-per-cent-job-cuts-says-it-is-to-boost-efficiency-2652915-2024-12-20,"In a significant development at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai has announced a reduction of 10 per cent in management and vice president-level roles. The decision is part of a broader organisational restructuring aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and aligning resources with the company's strategic priorities. According to a report by Business Insider, this move underscores Google's commitment to streamlining its workforce amid ongoing economic challenges.   According to two individuals familiar with the matter, Pichai stated that Google has implemented changes over the past few years to streamline operations and improve efficiency, as per the report. It also stated that Pichai highlighted a 10 per cent reduction in managerial, director, and vice president roles as part of these efforts. The recent changes emphasise Google’s ongoing efforts to optimise its operations in response to growing competition, especially from AI-focused companies like OpenAI, which are posing a challenge to its leadership in the search market. During the same meeting, Pichai discussed the evolution of Google’s corporate culture, recognising the need to reassess the company’s defining value of “Googleyness.” This cultural transformation is designed to better align with the demands of today’s business environment and respond to competitive pressures, particularly those arising from the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. The changes underscore Google’s dedication to cultivating a culture that promotes agility and innovation in an ever-evolving industry. The restructuring comes on the heels of broader cost-cutting measures implemented by major tech companies over the past year. Google, despite its robust market position and strong revenue streams, is not immune to the economic headwinds facing the tech industry. Rising inflation, slowing ad revenues, and global uncertainties have prompted the company to reassess its workforce and operational strategies.   Google’s restructuring follows a trend seen among other tech giants. Amazon, for example, has focused on reducing middle management layers under CEO Andy Jassy, with an emphasis on empowering individual contributors and speeding up decision-making. These approaches, widely adopted across the tech sector, are intended to foster innovation and enable companies to adapt more rapidly to technological progress. This is not the first time Google has resorted to layoffs in recent months. Google has been focused on improving efficiency for over two years. In September 2022, Pichai set a goal for the company to become 20 per cent more efficient. The following January, this initiative led to a historic round of layoffs, resulting in the elimination of 12,000 jobs. As Google implements these changes, the tech giant is also exploring ways to optimise its operations further, including investments in automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity.

This new sharing option bridges the gap between creating and connecting, allowing users to quickly show off their creations or collaborate on ideas. While these updates are rolling out across all platforms, mobile users will need to wait a little longer to access the redesigned homepage. Despite this slight delay, the improved features are already making a big impact for desktop users, with many appreciating the speed and convenience the latest updates bring.  If you’re curious about trying AI-powered image creation, these updates make Bing Image Creator much easier to use. Whether you’re playing around with AI art for fun, working on a project, or just seeing what it can do, these changes help make the process quicker and less complicated.

This new integration allows users to chat with ChatGPT directly through WhatsApp, without needing to open a separate app or website. If you’re wondering how to get started, the process is simple and user-friendly. OpenAI has made it very easy for anyone to connect with ChatGPT on WhatsApp. All it takes is a few quick steps, and you’re ready to chat. To begin, you’ll need to scan a QR code attached in the image below. This QR code is also available on OpenAI’s official website.   Once you scan it, you’ll be redirected to WhatsApp, where you can start chatting with ChatGPT. It’s important to make sure you’re interacting with the official ChatGPT account. How can you check? The official account will have a blue verification badge next to its name, and the phone number will be 1-800-242-8478. These details confirm that you’re chatting with the real ChatGPT and not a fake account. Once you’ve verified these details, you can start typing your messages and enjoy the experience. Using ChatGPT on WhatsApp is as straightforward as chatting with a friend. You simply type your questions or requests, and the chatbot responds almost instantly. Whether you’re looking for answers to specific questions, help with writing, or general information, ChatGPT is there to assist you. The convenience of having this powerful AI tool in a platform you already use daily is a game-changer for many users. However, there are some limitations to keep in mind. Currently, you can’t link your paid ChatGPT Plus account to WhatsApp. The integration is free for everyone to use, but there are daily limits on the number of messages you can send. If you hit these limits, you’ll receive a notification letting you know. For those who need more extensive use or access to additional features, the ChatGPT app or website remains an option. It’s also worth noting that the version of ChatGPT available on WhatsApp is powered by the GPT-4o mini model. This ensures efficient and accurate interactions, but it’s slightly scaled down compared to the full GPT-4 model available through OpenAI’s other platforms. Despite this, the chatbot is more than capable of handling a wide range of queries and tasks.

At the heart of this conflict lies Qualcomm's strategy to reduce its reliance on Arm’s technology, with the potential for billions in savings if successful. However, the case also holds major implications for Qualcomm’s future in the laptop market, its relationship with Arm, and the broader chip ecosystem that relies heavily on Arm’s architecture.advertisementThe Case: Qualcomm’s Nuvia acquisitionIn 2021, Qualcomm acquired Nuvia, a chip startup founded by former Apple engineers, for a substantial $1.4 billion. The acquisition was part of Qualcomm's strategy to challenge Intel and reduce its dependence on Arm, which has long provided the foundation for Qualcomm's chip designs. Qualcomm believed that by acquiring Nuvia, it could create custom chip designs more optimised for mobile and computing devices, particularly in the competitive laptop market.However, Arm, which licenses the architecture for most mobile and computing chips, objected to Qualcomm’s use of Nuvia’s designs, claiming that Qualcomm’s acquisition of the startup violated their licensing agreement. The core of the dispute hinges on whether Nuvia's technology is sufficiently independent of Arm’s architecture or if it is derivative, and therefore subject to Arm's licensing terms. Arm is arguing that Qualcomm should destroy all Nuvia technology developed under a license that it terminated, which Qualcomm disputes.

The core of the dispute hinges on whether Nuvia's technology is sufficiently independent of Arm’s architecture or if it is derivative, and therefore subject to Arm's licensing terms. Arm is arguing that Qualcomm should destroy all Nuvia technology developed under a license that it terminated, which Qualcomm disputes. According to industry analyst Prakash Sangam, who is covering the trial on grounds, the case currently focuses on three key questions that must be resolved unanimously by the jury: 1. Whether Nuvia breached section 15.1(a) of Nuvia's Agreement with Arm (ALA) — a provision relating to the protection of Arm's confidential information after the agreement’s termination.
2. Whether Qualcomm itself has breached this provision — despite the fact that Qualcomm was never a party to the Nuvia ALA, Arm claims that since Qualcomm benefits from the technology, it should be held liable.
3. Whether Qualcomm’s products are covered under Qualcomm’s own license with Arm — Qualcomm’s counterclaim aims to protect itself from any future legal actions regarding the use of Nuvia’s technology. At the heart of this battle is the potential for Qualcomm to save significant sums on royalty payments to Arm — estimated at $1.4 billion annually — by moving away from Arm’s designs. This savings would come from Qualcomm’s reliance on Nuvia’s custom computing cores, developed by a team that previously worked on Apple’s iconic chip designs.There is also a Qualcomm vs Apple angle here  Apple's custom silicon is a major player in this legal battle. With the introduction of the M1 and M2 chips, Apple transformed its entire product lineup, leaving traditional chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm scrambling to keep up. Which is why, Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia is a huge driving force behind the company’s ambition to challenge Apple’s dominance in the laptop and mobile chip markets. This also forced Qualcomm to enter the PC chip market so it could counter Apple's investments in its own custom silicon.  The acquisition of Nuvia and the use of its technology could allow Qualcomm to create chips tailored for Windows devices, offering an alternative to Intel’s x86 architecture and Apple’s ARM-based silicon. Qualcomm's CEO, Cristiano Amon, testified that this move was essential for Qualcomm to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving market, and the $1.4 billion savings projected from moving away from Arm royalties would be critical in funding this push. Basically, if Qulcomm succeeds in defending its use of Nuvia's tech, it could create a more diverse and competitive market for PC chips, giving Microsoft an alternative to Apple’s tight ecosystem. However, if Arm prevails, Qualcomm may be forced to abandon its plans to use Nuvia’s designs, which would further cement Apple’s dominance in the chip market.The larger picture: Implications in the global chip market The outcome of the Qualcomm vs Arm battle could have significant ripple effects across the chip industry. Arm’s architecture is the foundation for billions of devices, from smartphones to servers, and any shift in the relationship between Qualcomm and Arm could alter the dynamics of the entire market. Qualcomm’s efforts to develop its own computing cores could open the door for other companies to follow suit, reducing their reliance on Arm and potentially leading to more competition in chip design. At the same time, if Qualcomm is forced to comply with Arm’s demands and destroy Nuvia’s technology, it could create a precedent that limits the ability of chipmakers to innovate independently of their licensing agreements.  But what’s most interesting here is that the Qualcomm vs Arm battle is not just about one company's acquisition of a startup — it’s a fight for the future of chip design, with profound implications for the competition between Apple, Qualcomm, and other major players in the tech industry. We don’t know what direction this trial will take, but the outcome could (re)shape the global chip market and the devices that we use.

This new feature lets users get real-time assistance directly within their favourite apps, enhancing productivity and workflow.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-for-macos-now-compatible-with-apple-notes-and-other-apps-2653472-2024-12-21,"OpenAI has introduced a new update for the ChatGPT app on macOS. On Thursday, the company announced that its popular AI chatbot now works with several note-taking and coding applications. This new feature, described by OpenAI as agentic, allows ChatGPT to access on-screen information in these supported apps and assist users with their queries in real time. Currently, this feature is available only to paid subscribers of ChatGPT, including those on the Plus, Pro, Teams, Enterprise, and Edu plans. However, OpenAI has reassured users on the free tier and Windows users that they won’t be left behind for long. The update will roll out to them sometime next year.  OpenAI revealed this update as part of its 12-day shipping event, where the company has been releasing new features and improvements for its platforms daily. The announcement was made on day 11 through a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Kevin Weil, the Chief Product Officer at OpenAI, shared additional details about the feature, emphasising that ChatGPT can now work with approximately 30 macOS apps. The supported ones include Apple Notes, BBEdit, VSCode Insiders, Notion, Quip, and more specialised coding apps like MatLab, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.  So, whether you’re jotting down ideas in a note-taking app or debugging code in a developer tool, ChatGPT can now assist without users needing to switch between applications. Here’s how it works — once the feature is activated, users can open any supported app and use the shortcut Option + Space. This opens a compact ChatGPT window that appears over the app. The AI can then see the same information the user sees on the screen. From there, users can interact with ChatGPT by typing queries or using the Advanced Voice Mode. For example, if a user highlights a specific section of text or code in the app, they can ask ChatGPT for help by using natural language commands like “how can I improve this?” or “what does this code do?” The chatbot understands the context and responds accordingly. This makes it easier for users to get real-time feedback or explanations without disrupting their workflow. While OpenAI calls this feature “agentic,” the technology behind it is more vision-based. ChatGPT doesn’t actually interact with the apps themselves — it can’t write new text, edit code, or make changes to any existing content. Its role is purely advisory, based on what it sees on the screen. Privacy has been a top concern for OpenAI with this update. Users will have full control over when and which apps ChatGPT can access. OpenAI has also assured users that the data collected during these interactions will be handled just like any other data in their conversation history.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The news comes from the French website iPhoneSoft.fr, which cites a source within Apple. If true, this means Apple won’t be dropping support for any iPhone models for the second year in a row. This would be great news for anyone still holding onto older devices, as iOS 18 already supports many models. Based on the report, iOS 19 will be compatible with the following iPhones: — iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max
— iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max
— iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max
— iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max
— iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max
— iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max
— iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max
— iPhone SE (2nd generation and later) The oldest iPhones on this list are the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max, first released in September 2018. While it’s exciting to see these models still being supported, it’s worth mentioning that some of the newer iOS 19 features may not be available on older devices due to hardware limitations.  Apple’s decision to maintain compatibility for older iPhones could be seen as part of a larger trend. iOS 18 didn’t drop support for any models either, sticking to the same list as iOS 17, which had removed the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X from the lineup. This move might make it easier for users to hold onto their devices longer without feeling left behind. However, there is slightly less good news for iPad users. The same report claims that iPadOS 19 will drop support for the iPad 7, which was released in 2019. However, all other iPads that can run iPadOS 18 will reportedly be compatible with the new update. For those eagerly waiting to try iOS 19, the first public beta is expected to roll out during Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2025. The final version of iOS 19 will likely be released in September 2025, in line with Apple’s usual schedule. Not much is known yet about the features iOS 19 will bring, but one exciting rumour is that Siri will become more conversational, similar to ChatGPT, in a later iOS 19.4 update, which could arrive around March 2026.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Slated for a potential release by late 2025, the device could change the way we use home security devices. As per Gurman, the smart doorbell would function similarly to Face ID on iPhones, unlocking the door automatically when it recognises you or other residents. Like other Apple devices, it is expected to feature the Secure Enclave chip, which processes and stores biometric data independently from the main hardware, ensuring better privacy.   Mark Gurman suggests the doorbell could be compatible with existing third-party HomeKit smart locks, offering flexibility for Apple users already invested in the ecosystem. Alternatively, Apple may collaborate with a smart lock manufacturer to deliver a comprehensive system at launch. The device will likely leverage Apple’s in-house “Proxima” chip, a hybrid Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology rumoured to power next-generation HomePod Mini and Apple TV products.   This ambitious smart doorbell project is part of a larger effort by Apple to expand its smart home ecosystem under the umbrella of Apple Intelligence. Beyond the doorbell, the company is also working on a range of innovative smart home products. These include a new smart home hub with a 6-inch display for controlling devices, FaceTime calls, and video playback. Additionally, Apple is reportedly developing a security camera to complement the hub, further integrating privacy-focused features into its offerings.   While the Face ID-equipped doorbell aims to rival established players like Amazon’s Ring, it also raises potential security concerns. Critics point out that any malfunction or exploitation of the system could lead to significant risks, such as unauthorised access to homes. Apple, however, has a strong track record of prioritising user privacy, which could give it an edge in this space.   The doorbell camera remains in early development stages, meaning its final features and release date are still uncertain. If successful, this device could bring a new level of convenience and security to Apple users while seamlessly integrating with the company’s broader ecosystem.   Apple’s vision for the smart home doesn’t stop at doorbells.

According to the Wall Street Journal, there are two reasons for it: lack of quality data and financial demands. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openais-next-flagship-model-is-running-late-researchers-blame-low-quality-data-2653924-2024-12-23,"OpenAI’s highly anticipated GPT 5 model, which was expected to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, is reportedly behind schedule and incurring significant development costs. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the AI powerhouse is grappling with the dual challenges of advancing its technology and managing its financial demands. The delay in GPT 5’s release has sparked speculation across the tech industry, given OpenAI’s track record of timely launches for its language models. The report suggests that the complexity of training and scaling large language models (LLMs) like GPT 5 is one of the primary reasons for the setback. These models require enormous computational resources, specialised hardware, and vast datasets, all contributing to spiralling expenses. To recap, the GPT 4 model was released in March 2023 and since then, OpenAI has been working on its next flagship level model, GPT 5.  The Wall Street Journal highlights that OpenAI’s goals for GPT 5 include improving reasoning capabilities, enhancing factual accuracy, and addressing biases. However, meeting these objectives has proven to be more challenging than initially anticipated. And it also includes details about the 18-month development of GPT-5, code-named Orion.GPT 4: Reasons why it is running late A key challenge for Orion lies in data scarcity. OpenAI researchers have determined that the public internet no longer offers the high-quality, diverse datasets required for the model's advancement. To tackle this issue, the company has begun generating synthetic data, enlisting software engineers, mathematicians, and theoretical physicists to produce original content.  Another reason is on the financial side as OpenAI’s expenditures have been a growing concern. Training GPT 4 reportedly costs tens of millions of dollars, and industry analysts estimate that GPT 5’s development could surpass these figures significantly, the report stated. The company has been exploring ways to offset these costs, including partnerships, subscription models for its products, and new investment rounds. Microsoft, a key investor, has played a vital role in supporting OpenAI’s infrastructure through Azure cloud services, but even with such backing, the financial strain remains substantial. Despite these challenges, OpenAI is still pushing forward with its plans to redefine AI capabilities. Experts believe that the delay could ultimately benefit the company by allowing more rigorous testing and refinement of the model, ensuring it meets user expectations and industry standards. The delay in GPT 5’s release also reflects broader trends in the AI industry, where companies are facing mounting pressure to deliver advancements while addressing ethical, technical, and financial challenges. As the tech world eagerly awaits GPT 5, OpenAI’s ability to overcome these hurdles will likely determine its future leadership in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. While a few previous reports have pointed out that the GPT 5 will be out by December 2024, the launch date of the flagship model is still under wrap.

The discontinuation of support means that WhatsApp will no longer provide updates, bug fixes, or security patches for affected devices.  The decision impacts several devices, including some models from prominent brands like Samsung, LG, and Sony, that were released over a decade ago. Users are encouraged to upgrade to devices running newer Android versions to continue accessing WhatsApp services. Here is the full list of Android phones that will not be able to access WhatsApp in a few days. 
Samsung: Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy Ace 3, Galaxy S4 Mini
Motorola: Moto G (1st Gen), Razr HD, Moto E 2014
HTC: One X, One X+, Desire 500, Desire 601
LG: Optimus G, Nexus 4, G2 Mini, L90
Sony: Xperia Z, Xperia SP, Xperia T, Xperia V
 This is not the first time Meta has ended support for older operating systems. The company periodically reviews its minimum requirements for Android and iOS to ensure the app remains compatible with current security standards and features. In recent years, similar moves have been made to phase out older iOS devices and earlier Android versions.  WhatsApp will end support for these iPhones WhatsApp has announced that it will stop supporting older iOS versions starting in 2025. From May 5 onwards, devices running iOS versions earlier than 15.1 will no longer be able to access the app, including through older beta versions on TestFlight. While WhatsApp currently supports iOS 12 and above, the upcoming changes will require iOS 15.1 as the minimum version for continued functionality. To give users time to adapt, WhatsApp is providing a five-month notice period, allowing them to update their devices or explore other options if their hardware cannot support the latest iOS versions.   This update will mainly affect users of older iPhones, specifically the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which are limited to iOS 12.5.7. These models, released over a decade ago, represent a small segment of WhatsApp’s user base. For users with newer iPhones still running older software, upgrading to iOS 15.1 or higher will ensure uninterrupted access to WhatsApp.   The changes will impact both the standard WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business, as both rely on the same system requirements. With this move, WhatsApp aims to enhance performance, security, and compatibility for users on modern devices.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Qualcomm has won the battle against Arm: Here is what it means for the future of laptops and phonesAlso read |  OpenAI's next flagship model is running late, researchers blame low quality dataAlso read |  WhatsApp will soon end support for iPhone 6, iPhone 5s and more: All details hereTrending Reel

Qualcomm says the results affirmed its right to innovate, however, Arm has vowed to seek a new trial.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/qualcomm-has-finally-won-the-battle-against-arm-here-is-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-laptops-and-phones-2653946-2024-12-23,"Qualcomm's central processors are properly licenced under an agreement with Arm Holdings, a jury found in a trial in US federal court that removed some, but not all, uncertainty around the mobile chipmaker's expansion into the laptop market. A week of courtroom arguments and deliberations ended in a mistrial after the jury failed to resolve one of three questions put before it in the trial between the two chip giants. Qualcomm said the result affirmed its right to innovate, but Arm vowed to seek a new trial. Arm's shares were down 1.8 per cent in extended trading after the news, and Qualcomm's opens new tab shares were up 1.8 per cent. The outcome means the case could be tried again in the future - something Arm vowed to pursue in a statement following the verdict. Judge Maryellen Noreika, who presided over the case in US federal court in Delaware, encouraged Arm and Qualcomm to mediate their dispute. ""I don't think either side had a clear victory or would have had a clear victory if this case is tried again,"" Noreika told the parties. After more than nine hours of deliberations over two days, the eight-person jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on the question of whether startup Nuvia breached the terms of its license with Arm. But the jury found that Qualcomm - which purchased Nuvia for $1.4 billion in 2021 - did not breach that licence. The jury also found that Qualcomm's chips, created using Nuvia technology and central to Qualcomm's push into the personal computer market, are properly licenced under its own agreement with Arm, clearing the way for Qualcomm to continue selling them. ""The jury has vindicated Qualcomm's right to innovate and affirmed that all the Qualcomm products at issue in the case are protected by Qualcomm's contract with Arm,"" Qualcomm said in a statement. An Arm spokesperson said the company was ""disappointed"" that the jury was unable to ""reach consensus"" about the company's claims and said from the outset the goal has been to protect the company's intellectual property. For now, the outcome paves the way for Qualcomm to continue to push what it calls the ""AI PC"" in laptop chips that are aimed at handling tasks such as chatbots and image generators. That is a market where Nvidia, opens new tab, Advanced Micro Devices, and MediaTek are also planning to make Arm-based processors. ""My biggest worry was what happens to the future roadmap if they (Qualcomm) no longer have access to Nuvia (computing) cores,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. ""At this point, that risk is a lot closer to being off the table."" The dispute between Arm and Qualcomm centred on what royalty rate Qualcomm should pay for each chip. Nuvia was set to pay higher rates than Qualcomm before Qualcomm bought the startup firm and wove its technology into chips under its own license with Arm at lower royalty rates. Ben Bajarin, chief executive of tech consulting firm Creative Strategies, said that Arm's current growth projections have not depended on reaping higher rates from Qualcomm as Arm chips enter the PC market. ""They haven't factored in, via their quarterly (earnings) calls, a win,"" Bajarin said. ""So none of this changes their economic upside. It's really just a matter of contractual argument."" However, the trial's outcome leaves open the question of where Arm's technology begins and ends. Arm licenses its computing architecture to firms but also sells designs for computing cores as off-the-shelf products. Some of Arm's more sophisticated customers, such as Apple, Qualcomm and Nuvia, licence Arm's architectures but develop their own custom cores. During the trial this week, Arm's attorneys insisted its architecture license terms with Nuvia gave it rights to demand the destruction of Nuvia's custom core designs. ""This does have ramifications for the entire industry,"" Jim McGregor of Tirias Research said in an interview. ""Whether you're using a standard Arm core, or developing your own Arm core, it has been the rock of everything from electric toothbrushes to satellites.""Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  OpenAI's next flagship model is running late, researchers blame low quality dataAlso read |  Forget keys, Face ID may soon lock and unlock your house doors: Apple exploring smart doorbellsAlso read |  Next-gen AirPods Pro could sport health features like heart rate and temperature monitoring

The company has yet to reveal the exact date of launch, but it has confirmed that it will take place in January 2025. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oppo-reno-13-series-confirmed-to-launch-in-india-next-month-design-details-revealed-2654010-2024-12-23,"The next round of flagship smartphones are ready to roll. Oppo has confirmed the launch of its flagship series –– the Reno 13 series 5G. As with this year’s Reno 12 series, we expect the Reno 13 series to also include two smartphones, the Reno 13 5G and Reno 13 Pro 5G. Oppo has yet to confirm the exact date of launch, however, the company has revealed that the launch in India will take place in January 2025. This was confirmed in a post shared by the company on X.  Oppo has also revealed in the teaser that the Reno 13 series 5G will feature an aluminium frame, and a sculpted rear-panel, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for protection. The post says, the Reno 13 series will use “aerospace-grade aluminium Frames, One-Piece Sculpted Glass Backs, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for unrivalled elegance and durability”.
 


 Additionally, the image accompanied by the teaser post also confirms that the Reno 13 series will sport a triple camera setup, and a flat display. If we look at last year’s Reno 12 series, the Reno 13 series’ camera setup has been slightly redesigned. Based on the image, the phone will have three cameras, of which two will be aligned vertically, with the third placed on the right to make a triangle. The image also shows an LED flash inside the camera house, which will likely be a ring light, looking at the camera design trends lately.  The teasers from Oppo only reveal so much for now. However, the Reno 13 series has already been launched in the China market, which gives us a bit of an idea about what to expect from the smartphones. In China, the Reno 13 series boasts a 6.59-inch flat AMOLED display with a sharp resolution of 2760x1256 pixels and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, ensuring vibrant visuals and fluid performance. It’s powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8350 chipset, an upgrade over its predecessor with an enhanced GPU for improved gaming experiences and faster app loading times. Backing this power is a robust 5,600mAh battery that supports 80W fast wired charging, promising quick top-ups and long-lasting usage.   Camera performance has always been a strong suit for the Reno series, and the Reno 13 continues the tradition. It features a 50-megapixel primary sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) for sharp and stable shots, paired with an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens for expansive captures. On the front, there’s a 50-megapixel selfie camera, ensuring stunning self-portraits and video calls.   Running on ColorOS 15, based on Android 15, the Reno 13 offers a refined software experience with the latest features and optimisations. Durability is another standout feature, with the device boasting IP66, IP68, and IP69 certifications, making it resistant to dust and capable of withstanding various water exposure scenarios.   As for pricing, the Reno 13 series starts at CNY 2,699 (approximately Rs 31,400) in China. While official India pricing hasn’t been confirmed, the Reno 12 launched at Rs 32,999 in the country, hinting that the Reno 13 could be priced similarly when it debuts in India.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Oppo Reno 12 Pro review: It makes premium AI experience more accessibleAlso read |  OPPO Reno 13 live image leak reveals exclusive blue colour for India

In short, the iPhone 15 Pro offers great value for money, especially for those looking to experience the iPhone Pro series without spending extra on the latest model.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Apple, Google, OnePlus, Samsung, Oppo, and several other tech giants will follow their usual routine of unveiling their ""best phone ever."" However, a few devices always manage to stand out from the crowd. While other notable devices may grab our attention next year, based on what we know so far, two smartphones scheduled for launch in 2025 are already generating significant interest. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim and Apple iPhone 17 Air are both already among the most exciting phones of 2025.  Why is that? It’s all in the name. Samsung and Apple are once again moving back to a more compact design with these phones –– well, sort of. While the iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to be just 6.25mm thick, and is touted as Apple sleekest iPhone ever, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to be just 6mm in thickness. For perspective, the Galaxy S24 is 7.6mm thick. There is, of course, more to the phones than their dimensions.  Let’s have a look at what you can expect from the two of the most exciting phones of 2025. What to expect from Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim According to multiple tipsters, Samsung’s ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Slim will launch in Q2 2025. While this brings the phone’s launch timeline around the same time as the annual iPhone launch –– where we can expect the iPhone 17 Air to launch –– it deviates from the traditional January debut of the Galaxy S series. Reports, however, suggest that Samsung will align the S25 Slim's release with the Galaxy A and FE lineups. Design and form factor As the name suggests, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is sleek. In fact, it will likely be Samsung's slimmest smartphone yet. To put that into perspective, it’s significantly thinner than the 7.6mm Galaxy S24 and even slimmer than the anticipated 6.25mm iPhone 17 Air.  Battery and performance Besides its design, one of the standout features of the S25 Slim is its 4,700 to 5,000mAh battery*, an impressive feat for a device this thin. Reports suggest Samsung might be leveraging advanced silicon-carbon anode battery technology, similar to what we've seen in the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro. This would ensure long-lasting performance without compromising the phone’s slim design. Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to pack the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.  Display and camera capabilities The Galaxy S25 Slim is tipped to feature a 6.66-inch display, placing it in the same league as the Galaxy S24+ in terms of screen size. On the photography front, the device could sport a 200-megapixel HP5 primary camera, accompanied by a 50-megapixel ultrawide lens, and a 50-megapixel 3.5x telephoto snapper.What to expect from the iPhone 17 Air   The iPhone 17 Air is slated for a potential September 2025 launch. As a successor to the iPhone 16 Plus, this device is expected to deliver premium features with a refreshed design, all while maintaining a competitive price point. Based on current trends, the iPhone 17 Air could start around Rs 85,000, positioning it slightly below the iPhone 16 Pro, which is priced starting Rs 1,19,900 in India.  Design and display   Apple is rumoured to introduce a titanium frame in the iPhone 17 Air, a feature that promises to enhance both durability and weight reduction. The phone is likely to sport a 6.6-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, delivering vibrant colours, deep contrasts, and an immersive viewing experience. In a much-anticipated upgrade, the device might finally adopt a 120Hz refresh rate. Performance and efficiency   At the heart of the iPhone 17 Air will be Apple’s new A19 chip, which is expected to deliver notable gains in performance and energy efficiency, making multitasking, gaming, and graphics-heavy applications a breeze. Enhanced machine learning capabilities could further improve features like photography, augmented reality (AR), and on-device intelligence. Camera enhancements   Photography enthusiasts can look forward to significant upgrades, including a 48-megapixel primary sensor for sharper and more detailed photos. On the front, a 24-megapixel selfie camera is rumoured. As we inch closer to the anticipated Q2 2025 launch for both the smartphones, more details about the Galaxy S25 Slim and the iPhone 17 Air are likely to emerge. While it seems like the two devices could set a new standard for slim smartphones, it will also be fascinating to see how the two will fare against each other.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai geek out over Google's new quantum chip WillowAlso read |  Why has the Indian government issued a notice to Wikipedia?

It delivers up to 50 TOPS NPU with premium features. At Rs 1,49,990, the laptop has some great specs and features, but is it worth it? Let's find out in this review by India Today Tech. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/asus-zenbook-s16-review-powerful-lightweight-and-gets-most-things-right-2654079-2024-12-23,"The Asus ZenBook S16 debuts as the company's first CoPilot+ PC featuring an AMD Ryzen AI processor. The device retains a similar design as its predecessor, the ZenBook S14, but it takes a significant leap when it comes to specs and features. Powered by AMD's newly launched Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, the ZenBook S16 aims to deliver a boost in AI performance and daily tasks. Priced at Rs 1,49,900, the Asus ZenBook S16 comes with a 3k OLED display, an ultra-thin profile and a powerful chipset, but is it worth it? Let’s find out in this review. 
 


advertisementAsus ZenBook S16: The best partsThe Asus ZenBook S16 carries a similar design language as the ZenBook S14. The laptop features an innovative Ceraluminum –– a blend of aluminium and ceramic –– finish on its lid. This material gives the laptop a premium, matte look that is both visually appealing and durable. It stands out for its lightweight design, weighing just 1.5kg, which makes it highly portable and ideal for users who are always on the move. I have been using the laptop as my primary work device for 2 weeks. This means that I carry it everywhere with me, including to work, where I travel in a Metro. It even accompanied me during a recent work trip to Bangalore. Whether it was daily travel or a longer flight to another city I took, the device always felt comfortably portable. 
 


Another highlight of the Zenbook S16’s build is its ultra-thin lid. Despite being just a couple of millimetres in thickness, it feels sturdy. It is also supported by a good hinge mechanism that allows you to easily open the lid with just one hand. The keyboard is also well-designed with decent spacing between the keys. Moreover, the keys offer snappy feedback. While the keys make a clicky sound, it is not too loud. Nothing compared to a mechanical keyboard, at least. 
 


Additionally, the ergonomic pad, just below the keyboard, is now bigger than ever. According to Asus, the ZenBook S16’s mouse pad is 40 per cent larger than its predecessor. The Asus ZenBook S16 is a 10 on 10 when it comes to the design. It is light but sturdy, stylish but functional, and is quite portable.

The experience is just as good when it comes to the laptop’s display. The Asus ZenBook S16 features a huge 16-inch 3k OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The display is a visual treat, offering vivid and crisp colours. With a brightness of 400nits (peaking at 500nits in HDR mode), the display looks attractive when indoors. The huge display makes multitasking very easy. Even after splitting the screen into two, it did not feel cluttered. Furthermore, binge watching Christmas movies has been a delight on this laptop. But that is not it. The speakers make it a complete entertainment box. The audio system is impressive in the ZenBook S16. It features 6 built-in speakers. Despite the laptop’s compact size, the sound quality is surprisingly good. It can produce a clear and full sound, with a bit of bass. 
 


The user-friendly nature peaks with its touch display. I generally use a mouse while working on a laptop but the smooth touch makes it easier to use. The touch interface offers a seamless and intuitive navigation experience, making tasks like web browsing, file management, and creative projects easy. With 120Hz refresh rate, the touch screen is quick to respond and simplifies interactions. 
 


advertisementComing to the performance, the laptop is a cool combination of style and functionality. It features a geometric grille design with over 3,500 CNC-machined cooling vents.

For a device that sports a powerful AMD Ryzen AI chipset –– which is apparently able to offer three times the processing power of previous AMD laptop processors –– it does not heat up easily.

The ZenBook S16 has been a wonderful machine so far. It runs all tasks smoothly and does not complain. Over the period of 2 weeks, it did not give me a hard time, even when I opened over 10 tabs and was working on two browsers simultaneously. Asus claims the ZenBook S16 can achieve a peak of 50 tops (trillion operations per second) in neural processing power. As a number that’s impressive, but what does it mean in real life? Before we explain that, here are some more numbers we got when we did our own benchmark test for the laptop. advertisementThe Zenbook S16 scored 12,305 on Geekbench (multicore score) and 503 on Cinebench. The AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor gives a tough competition to the Apple’s M3 chip, going by the benchmark scores. But big, powerful processors also mean big battery consumption. Asus claims that the ZenBook S16’s 78 Whr battery can easily last a day. After testing the device, we can say Asus’ claim stands true. I used the ZenBook S16 for 6 hours straight after charging it to 100 per cent. For context, my daily tasks include using Google Docs, opening several tabs, switching between work and Apple Music, watching YouTube videos, scrolling X posts and more. And after all of it, the laptop still had 30 per cent battery left.
 


advertisementIt is true that while performing heavy tasks the battery will drain faster, but for me one 100 per cent charge was good to get me through my entire work day.That said, as we mentioned before, the Zenbook S16 is impressive in many departments, but it’s surely not perfect. Let’s look at some of the drawback of the device.Asus ZenBook S16: Drawbacks The ZenBook S16 not only carries ZenBook S14’s design language, it has also inherited some of its flaws. The lack of fingerprint sensor makes the login process a bit tardy. The Asus ZenBook S16 is equipped with a face-lock biometric tech and I found it hard to work with. On paper, a face-lock makes more sense for a laptop. Ideally, it should unlock as soon as you sit in front of the screen. But the ZenBook S16’s biometric is unpredictable. Sometimes, it unlocks within a few seconds, but many-a-times, I found myself adjusting my face and still ending up typing the password.Another issue I encountered, despite loving the display, the glossy finish causes significant reflection in bright environments. Throughout the testing period, I found myself constantly adjusting the screen to improve visibility, especially when working outdoors. 
 


Additionally, the glossy surface is also highly prone to smudges and fingerprints. As someone who enjoyed the touch screen feature, this drawback hindered the overall viewing experience. The third issue I encountered was noticeable lag when the laptop was charging. The ZenBook S16 supports Type-C charging, and while the battery performance is commendable, plugging in the charger causes a significant delay, with the screen briefly blacking out for a few seconds. This interruption was quite noticeable during use.Verdict: Should you buy the Asus ZenBook S16? If you are looking for a laptop with great performance skills, stylish and good battery backup, the Asus ZenBook S16 is a solid choice. While it has its demerits, the list of Pros is much longer. At Rs 1,49,900, the laptop is on the expensive side, but also delivers all premium specs and features. It offers top-notch performance, giving a tough competition to Apple’s M3 MacBook Air.

 The user-friendly nature peaks with its touch display. I generally use a mouse while working on a laptop but the smooth touch makes it easier to use. The touch interface offers a seamless and intuitive navigation experience, making tasks like web browsing, file management, and creative projects easy. With 120Hz refresh rate, the touch screen is quick to respond and simplifies interactions.

Here is what we know about it Xiaomi 15 Ultra has recently been listed on the BIS certification website, which suggests that the smartphone may soon be launched in the Indian market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/xiaomi-15-ultra-launching-in-india-soon-here-is-what-we-know-about-it-2654440-2024-12-24,"Soon after the Xiaomi 15 was listed on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification website in November, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has now been spotted on the same certification website. A listing on the BIS website usually means that the company is now just going through the process of getting all the approval for a phone, before launching it in the market. Interestingly, unlike the Xiaomi 15, which has already been launched (along with the Xiaomi 15 Pro) in the market, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has yet to be unveiled even in the China market. For the uninitiated, Xiaomi phones usually always launch in its home market in China first.  Coming back to the Xiaomi 15 Ultra listing that has surfaced on the BIS certification website. The handset, identified by the model number 25010PN30I, reportedly received approval on December 20, hinting at its imminent arrival in India.   While the BIS listing does not explicitly confirm the device’s name, earlier reports from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) associate this model number with the Indian variant of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. The global version of the device is expected to carry a similar model number, with the final letter changed to ‘G.’  Xiaomi 15 Ultra: What to expect The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is rumored to feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. This aligns with Xiaomi’s tradition of equipping its Ultra-series devices with cutting-edge hardware. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is also expected to feature 90W wired charging, and a 2K quad-curved display. On the camera front, it is expected to boast a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto sensor with a large aperture, alongside a 1-inch main sensor with an f/1.63 aperture.   The device might also come with IP68 and IP69 certifications, providing protection against water and dust. Wireless charging is anticipated to be part of its feature set, while the battery capacity is likely to remain unchanged from its predecessor, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra –– which was a 5,000mAh battery.Xiaomi 15 Ultra: India price expected Although Xiaomi has yet to announce an official launch date, the appearance of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra on BIS suggests that the Indian debut might not be far off. If we consider past trends, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra made its global debut in February 2024 at Mobile World Congress Barcelona, followed by its Indian release in March 2024. The device was priced at Rs. 99,999 for the single 16GB RAM and 512GB storage variant.

The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16 per cent jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalisation. The latest rally in Apple shares reflects ""investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades,"" said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a ""hold"" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800 per cent over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase ""low- to mid-single digits"" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. ""Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's ""top pick"" heading into 2025.  The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. ""I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today,"" said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if US President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10 per cent on goods coming from China. ""We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018,"" Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. ""Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action ""could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology."" ""Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

This design integrates key components like the CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) into a single chip. Apple has improved performance and power efficiency across its devices by combining these components and tuning them in tandem. However, a recent report by well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests a major shift with the upcoming M5 Pro chip. Apple might step away from its fully integrated SoC design and instead adopt a new approach that separates the CPU and GPU. This change is reportedly being made for two key reasons — better performance and improved production yields. By separating the CPU and GPU, Apple can take advantage of TSMC’s latest chip-packaging technology, known as SoIC-mH (System-on-Integrated-Chips-Molding-Horizontal). This advanced method of packaging chipsets is said to significantly improve thermal performance, which means the chip can run at full power for longer periods without overheating. Additionally, the SoIC-mH process reportedly reduces manufacturing defects, resulting in higher-quality chips and fewer production losses. According to Kuo, this new design will not only be used in the M5 Pro but also the M5 Max and M5 Ultra variants. These high-end chips will be built on TSMC’s N3P node, an advanced chip-manufacturing process. Mass production timelines suggest the base M5 chip will roll out in the first half of 2025, followed by the M5 Pro and M5 Max later that year, and the M5 Ultra in 2026. Interestingly, the report also ties this development to Apple’s plans for artificial intelligence (AI). The M5 Pro chip is expected to power Apple Intelligence servers, part of the company’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC) infrastructure. These servers are designed for AI inferencing, a critical function for processing AI-driven tasks. Once these high-end chips are ready, Apple plans to ramp up its AI infrastructure, furthering its ambitions in the AI space. This potential shift in design is a significant departure from Apple’s usual approach. While Apple hasn’t confirmed these plans, the rumoured changes show that the company wants to adapt and innovate with time. It also highlights the growing complexity of balancing performance, efficiency, and production challenges in the tech industry.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Now, all eyes are on the company’s second generation foldable phone, the OnePlus Open 2. For a while now, there were rumours suggesting that the Open 2 will be launching by the first quarter of 2025. However, the launch timeline seems to have been revised. Latest reports suggest that the OnePlus Open 2 will now only launch by the second half of 2025. Of course, an early release would have been great, but OnePlus has traditionally done its big launches in August, and maybe that’s the timeline it is going to stick to in 2025.  As to what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2, the foldable is expected to be a rebranded Oppo Find N5. Now, to just get things in perspective, the Find N5 will obviously be launched before the OnePlus Open 2. But we don’t know when the Find N5 will launch. However, Oppo’s product manager, Zhou Yibao, confirmed in a social media interaction with a user that it will launch before the Find X8 Ultra. There is no official launch date for the latter either, but it is rumoured to be released in Q1 2025. Some reports also suggest that the Oppo Find N5 could be released in February next year.  There have also been several leaks around the Oppo Find N5 aka the OnePlus Open 2. From what the reports suggest so far, the OnePlus Open 2 is expected to feature the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Which could be a big leap over the OnePlus Open, which sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset.  The OnePlus Open 2 is also rumored to feature foldable displays with 2K+ resolution. The foldable phone is also believed to come with a 50-megapixel triple-lens setup, possibly featuring a circular periscope telephoto lens, building on the 3x optical zoom offered by its forerunner. The Open 2 might also support 3-stage wireless charging, complementing their large form factors. In terms of design, the foldable phone may adopt a slimmer, lighter frame with a choice of plain leather and glass materials for a refined aesthetic.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Oppo Find X8 Ultra battery and camera specs surface in latest leakAlso read |  Apple approaches historic $4 trillion valuation, it is now also ahead of Nvidia and MicrosoftAlso read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

 While the battery capacity of the Oppo Find X8 Ultra is certainly impressive, the real excitement lies in the camera specifications. As per Digital Chat Station, the Find X8 Ultra is expected to feature a 50MP Sony IMX906 periscope zoom camera with 3X optical zoom. Alongside it, there will be another 50MP Sony IMX882 periscope zoom camera, offering 6X optical zoom. This dual periscope setup is a big upgrade from its predecessor, the Find X7 Ultra. Rumours also suggest that the Find X8 Ultra will sport a 50MP primary camera with a 1-inch Sony LYTIA LYT-900 sensor. This is also a step up from the Find X7 Ultra, which used a slightly smaller sensor for its main camera. Additionally, the new model is said to have a 50MP ultra-wide camera, though it’s unclear whether it will use the same 1/1.95-inch Sony LYTIA LYT-600 sensor as the Find X7 Ultra or a new sensor altogether. While these specs look promising, it’s unclear if the Oppo Find X8 Ultra will launch in India. The Find X8 and Find X8 Pro have made their way to the Indian market, but the Find X7 Ultra never did. If Oppo decides to skip India again with the Ultra model, it could disappoint fans who are excited about the high-end flagship smartphone.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Another intriguing part of the rumour is that the Dutch company BE Semiconductor will be supplying the technology for the aperture blades—the mechanical components that will allow the aperture to change size. This technology will make it possible for the iPhone 18 Pro's camera to adapt its light intake for different shooting conditions. While this feature was also rumoured for the iPhone 17 models previously, it seems Apple will reserve it for the iPhone 18 Pro, which is expected to debut in September 2026. Whether or not Apple will also upgrade the iPhone 18 Pro’s sensor size is still unclear, but such an enhancement could pave the way for even more natural and dynamic bokeh effects in photos. As the story of the iPhone’s camera capabilities continues to evolve, the addition of variable aperture stands out as one of the most exciting rumours to date, promising a new level of control and creativity for iPhone photographers. Since the iPhone 18 series is speculated to come in 2026, there are still several months to go before the launch. Hence, we advise you to take this information with a pinch of salt. The exact details will be released during the launch. Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

The upcoming model follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, the Galaxy M15 5G, with some notable design and feature upgrades. While the M16 is still part of the budget M series, it brings a few fresh touches to its design, along with improvements under the hood. Leaked renders of the Samsung Galaxy M16 5G indicate a few design changes over the last generation model. The M16 will be available in three new colours — a dark grey, a minty green reminiscent of the Galaxy S23 FE green colour, and a light pink shade reminiscent of the iPhone 13 Mini pink shade. As seen in the renders, the rear panel of the phone — while expected to be plastic — gets a new glass-like reflective finish, replacing the textured finish seen on the M15. One of the most noticeable updates is the redesigned rear camera island. The camera setup has been modified, with the bottommost sensor separated from the other two lenses, which gives the phone a slightly more distinct look. The rear flash is still placed separately next to the lenses, staying true to the M-series design. When we look at the front of the phone, we can see that the Galaxy M16 5G keeps the familiar Infinity-U cutout for the front camera, just like the M15. However, the thick chin on the bottom still suggests that the M16 is targeting the budget segment. While the design may not be as sleek as some high-end models, the M16 offers a modern feel thanks to its flatter sides with metallic finish and rounded corners. However, the frame will likely be plastic, just like the back of the phone. The power button and volume rocker are placed on the right side, with a SIM card slot on the left side. 

Source: Android Headlines
 On the inside, the Samsung Galaxy M16 5G brings a performance boost. According to a recent Geekbench listing, the phone will run on a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 SoC. This chipset includes two powerful Cortex A76 cores, clocked at 2.4 GHz, and six efficiency-focused Cortex A55 cores at 2 GHz. The M16 also features the Arm Mali-G57 MC2 GPU, which promises improved graphical performance compared to the Dimensity 6100+ chip in the M15. Samsung will likely ship the M16 with Android 14, and the phone will come with 8GB of RAM. In terms of performance, the M16 scored 552 in the single-core CPU test and 1,611 in the multi-core test. The Samsung Galaxy M16 5G appears to be a rebranded version of the Galaxy A16 5G, a mid-range device in Samsung’s A-series lineup. This similarity in specifications suggests that the M16 will be targeting budget-conscious buyers who want good performance without the high price tag. Samsung has already listed the device on India’s BIS website, confirming that it will be launched in the country. If it follows the same timeline as the M15, we can expect the Galaxy M16 5G to hit the shelves in early 2025.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

With this addition, WhatsApp users can quickly capture a document using their device’s camera without needing external scanning tools or apps. The rollout is happening gradually, with more users expected to gain access over the coming weeks, as confirmed by the latest WhatsApp changelog, reported by WABetaInfo.advertisementWhatsApp scanning: How to use This innovation is a significant leap for WhatsApp, particularly for those who need to share documents quickly while on the go.

Moreover, the quality of the scan is optimised for clarity and readability, ensuring that the scanned documents are presented in a professional manner. This makes the feature ideal for both personal and business-related needs, whether for sharing receipts, contracts, or notes. WABetaInfo first reported this feature as part of the WhatsApp iOS 24.25.80 update, and the company has continued to refine and expand access to the feature. By including it in the app’s document-sharing menu, WhatsApp is positioning itself as a comprehensive platform for communication and document exchange, further streamlining the user experience. As this feature continues to roll out, more users will benefit from the convenience it offers, saving time and reducing the need for third-party applications.WhatsApp withdraws support for these iPhones WhatsApp has announced that it will discontinue support for older iOS versions starting in 2025. Beginning May 5, devices running iOS versions earlier than 15.1 will no longer have access to the app, including older beta versions available on TestFlight. Currently compatible with iOS 12 and later, WhatsApp will soon require iOS 15.1 as the minimum version for continued use. To help users prepare, the company is offering a five-month notice period, allowing time to update devices or explore alternatives if their hardware cannot support the newer iOS versions. This update will primarily affect older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which are limited to iOS 12.5.7. These models, released over 10 years ago, account for a small portion of WhatsApp’s user base. Users with newer iPhones running outdated software can maintain access by upgrading to iOS 15.1 or later.

While the date is yet to be made official by the company, another report claims to reveal the day the new smartphones will hit the shelves. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-is-expected-to-go-on-sale-on-this-date-2654555-2024-12-24,"Samsung is set to launch its flagship smartphones in 2025. The launch date has yet to be made official by the company, but there have been several reports that suggest that the launch will take place on January 22. Now, as we wait for Samsung to confirm the launch date, another leak suggests that the Galaxy S25 series will launch in Samsung’s home market, South Korea, on February 7, 2025. This would be two weeks after the rumoured Galaxy Unpacked event. This timeline aligns with Samsung’s typical two-week pre-order period for new Galaxy devices.
 


 Pre-orders for the Galaxy S25 in South Korea are reportedly set to run from January 24 to February 3, 2025, with deliveries and in-store availability starting on February 7. For international markets, including the US, pre-order dates are expected to be similar, possibly starting around January 22 or 23 and closing in early February. For context, Samsung followed a similar schedule for the Galaxy S24, which was announced on January 17, 2024, with pre-orders opening immediately and the phone hitting shelves by January 31. Traditionally, the flagship Galaxy series is launched the same day as the global release takes place, which is generally around the first week of February. The leaked timeline seems to be in line with it, making it seem credible.  The latest leak also confirms that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will come with 16GB RAM, but this will be exclusive to the 512GB and 1TB storage variants. The base 256GB model will feature 12GB RAM instead. Meanwhile, the standard Galaxy S25 and S25+ are rumoured to offer 12GB RAM as a default, a noticeable improvement over the Galaxy S24, which only came with 8GB RAM in its base configuration. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to include four smartphones: the Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Slim, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, the Galaxy S25 Slim –– Samsung’s slimmest phone ever, with a waistline of about 6mm –– is believed to only be showcased at the event. Its availability is rumoured to be scheduled for sometime in the second half of 2025.  Along with the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung is also expected to unveil the next-generation Galaxy Ring at the Galaxy Unpacked event next month. The ring is also expected to be made available a few months after the official launch.

The rumour has it that the OnePlus 13 in India will mimic the Chinese variant, launched in October 2024. In this article, let's look at what the OnePlus 13 is expected to bring. OnePlus 13: Expected India price While official pricing is yet to be announced, rumours suggest that the OnePlus 13 could be priced starting at Rs 59,999 for the base variant, with higher configurations costing more.

The smartphone is expected to go on sale by mid-January through both online platforms and offline retail stores in India.OnePlus 13: Specs and features According to leaks and early reports, the OnePlus 13 is expected to feature a refined design with slimmer bezels and a sturdier build.

Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 is confirmed to be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, promising top-tier performance and energy efficiency.  OnePlus has consistently focused on improving its camera technology, and the OnePlus 13 appears to be no exception. The smartphone is rumoured to sport a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, a name synonymous with premium photography. The primary sensor could be a 50-megapixel LYT-808 with optical image stabilisation (OIS), accompanied by telephoto and ultrawide lenses, both of which now feature 50-megapixel sensors. This setup is expected to deliver exceptional photography and videography capabilities, including 4K video recording and advanced night mode. On the front, the device may house a 32-megapixel selfie camera with AI enhancements for sharper and more vibrant portraits. The OnePlus 13 is confirmed to pack a 6,000mAh battery, supporting 100W fast wired charging and 50W wireless charging. Reverse wireless charging is also rumoured to be included, allowing users to charge accessories like earbuds. With cutting-edge technology and premium features, the OnePlus 13 is poised to be a strong contender in the flagship smartphone segment.

However, the M4-powered MacBook Air is yet to make its debut. So far, there is no official communication from Apple regarding when the M4 MacBook Air will be launched. However, according to Apple analyst Mark Gurman, who writes for Bloomberg, the MacBook Air with M4 chip may launch sooner than we expect.  In a post shared on X, Gurman has once again confirmed that the iPhone SE 4, iPad 11, and the next-generation iPad Air will be launched in Spring 2025. This means, around May or June 2025 –– closer to Apple’s annual WWDC or may be at the event –– the three devices could be expected. However, for the MacBook Air M4, Gurman suggests that it could launch even earlier than the iPhone SE 4, iPad 11, and the upgraded iPad Air.  Considering, the timeline Gurman is hinting at isn’t Apple’s usual launch event timeline –– WWDC in June, iPhone hardware event in September, and a Mac event later in the year –– the MacBook Air M4 could be announced in a press announcement.  Apple is expected to release a 13-inch and a 15-inch MacBook Air, powered by an M4 chip. The launch of the MacBook Air was recently also revealed by Apple accidentally. In the macOS 15.2 release, the company had accidentally confirmed that new MacBook Air models are coming in 2025.  A recent report also suggests that Apple is “deep” in manufacturing the new MacBook Air. Based on this report, Apple could possibly start selling the laptop in the first quarter of 2025. As for what to expect from the new MacBook Air, it is unlikely to see significant design updates, with most rumours pointing to the inclusion of the M4 chip and a few minor enhancements. Potential upgrades might feature a Center Stage camera for improved video calls and a shift from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 4 ports.   Apple has already refreshed the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini with M4 chip options earlier this year. According to Geekbench results, the M4 chip delivers approximately a 25 per cent boost in multi-core CPU performance compared to the M3 chip.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  OnePlus 12 price drops just two weeks before OnePlus 13 India launch eventAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateAlso read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

Now, imagine describing that dream and watching it transform into a high-definition video. Sounds impossible? Not anymore. Enter Veo2, Google DeepMind’s latest text-to-video platform, which creates realistic 4K videos from simple text prompts. Its capabilities have stunned the internet with mesmerising demo videos, leaving many in awe — and some video creators worried about their jobs. But Veo2 isn’t alone. OpenAI’s Sora is another challenger in the fray, bringing its approach to this exciting new age of AI-generated video creation. So, how do these platforms compare? Which one is better? And what does this mean for the future of video creation?Veo 2 vs Sora Sora, launched in early December this year, is available to ChatGPT Plus users globally. While the OpenAI video maker has gained a headstart with general users being able to use the platform, Google’s Veo2 is still in its beta testing. Seemingly, Google’s Veo2 has an advantage over Sora thanks to multiple reasons: 
4K video resolution: Veo2 offers users video resolution up to 4K which means better quality videos. In contrast, Sora offers a maximum resolution of 1080p which isn’t bad but still 4K is 4K.
Video duration: Veo2 renders videos up to 2 minutes in length. Compared to this, Sora creates shorter videos of up to 20 seconds.
Cinematic control: Veo2 offers virtual camera control with options for adding cinematic movements like pan, tilts, etc. Its accuracy has stunned many users online. You can even play around with the lighting for a particular scene. This helps enhance storytelling. Sora focuses more on style presets and storyboarding. It’s similar to editing photos on your phone. You can choose between each adjustment manually or use the presets that phones offer.

Despite the prompt telling the camera to rotate, the output in Sora has rendered a static camera shot. This stifles a creator’s vision in many ways.
Realism: Some Veo2 renders online show its true ability to output photorealistic videos. This is also true in the case of physics-based motion accuracy which makes animations look more natural. This is an area where Sora struggles.
 The following video by X user Ruben Hassid shows the differences between the two video engines. There are several inconsistencies in the results Sora has generated whereas Veo2 has been able to render more lifelike results.

Google’s DeepMind has made the tool available only to a select few users, with no clarity on when the final version will be rolled out. Sora, on the other hand, is available for commercial use with a ChatGPT Plus subscription that costs around Rs 1676 in India.Room for improvement Many X users have posted similar renders comparing the two and most feel that Sora is losing the battle in many departments. While Sora might not be the most refined version of itself, there’s still room for improvement. It is still in the initial stages of its release and I believe that an improved version of this platform will be released in the coming days, especially after Veo2’s superior performance. Right now, it feels that Sora focuses more on motion rather than physics and accuracy, a sentiment echoed by an X user.
Sora vs. Veo 2:

I spent a few hours running prompts on both models and wanted to share some comparisons â¬‡ï¸.

IMO - Sora biases towards more motion, whereas Veo focuses more on accuracy / physics. And a larger % of clips from Veo are usable.

— Justine Moore (@venturetwins) December 18, 2024 The company recently launched a rebranded version of the platform called Sora Turbo but had to halt new signups due to an avalanche of users overwhelming the servers. This is also an issue that online video platforms will face in the coming days. Google has set a high benchmark for OpenAI to improve upon, but the real challenge is the time at hand. With 2024 almost over, OpenAI will now have to shift focus to 2025 on how it can beat Google at its own game. No matter who takes the crown in the end, eventually, it’s the users who win.A boon or threat? Now to address the elephant in the room. The possibility of these AI tools eating up the jobs of people who create (shoot or edit) video content for a living. This pickle is the same as ChatGPT killing writing jobs. Gradual improvements to Veo2, Sora and other similar tools will result in a substantial decrease in requirements for conventional video-creation methods. Why would anyone pay for a cameraperson, equipment, travel and logistics when they can just write a prompt on a computer and generate a 4K video with specific details about lighting, environment and colour accuracy? This would cater more to industries or creators that require more stock footage. It would be more cost-effective to ask Veo2 or Sora to generate stock videos instead of creating them from scratch or paying stock video platforms like Envato, Adobe or iStock. However, some videos cannot be created (for commercial use) by AI due to copyright issues. Videos of celebrities, interviews with politicians, sports events and live TV. All of these profiles still need people to function within the ecosystem. However, you can make similar videos like this awesome Game Of Thrones trailer made using Veo2.

In fact, thanks to these tools, more high-quality content will be created, which means more consumption and that will lead to more creators cropping up shortly. Rest assured, the future of video creation is about to be transformed with tools like Veo2 and Sora at the helm of it.

The iPhone 16 is selling at a discount of up to Rs 16,000. But there is a catch. The deal is part of a Christmas Carnival sale by Apple’s exclusive retail seller Imagine, and the sale ends today, December 26. Which means, you have only until today to avail the offer, if you are interested.  As for the deal, the iPhone 16 was launched at a starting price of Rs 79,900. During the ongoing sale at Imagine, you can get a discount of Rs 3,500, which brings the price of the phone down to Rs 76,400. Additionally, SBI, ICICI and Kotak Bank users can also get a discount of Rs 4,000 on the purchase. Which means, a further price reduction of Rs 72,400. On top of that, you can also get further discounts by trading-in or exchanging a smartphone. According to the Imagine website, you can get up to Rs 8,000 on exchange. If you do get the highest value for exchange (which is honestly rare) you can get the iPhone 16 for around Rs 64,400. Which is a great deal.Why is the iPhone 16 deal so good? The iPhone 16 is arguably one of the best smartphones in the new iPhone lineup this year. The Pros are great, but the iPhone 16 sits in the goldilocks zone. It has the new chipsets, and Apple hasn’t cut corners with the vanilla model this time by excluding the good stuff (like a camera capture button or Apple Intelligence). And if you are someone who loves a compact device, the iPhone 16’s form factor is an added bonus.  The iPhone 16 features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits and the innovative Dynamic Island for an enhanced user experience. At its core lies the powerful 3nm A18 chipset, comprising a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core neural engine, delivering top-notch performance. It supports dual SIM functionality and runs iOS 18 out of the box, complete with Apple Intelligence features for a seamless smart experience.   Photography enthusiasts will appreciate the dual-camera setup, which includes a 48-megapixel wide-angle lens with 2x in-sensor zoom and an f/1.6 aperture, alongside a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with an f/2.2 aperture and autofocus. For selfies and video calls, the 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera ensures sharp and detailed captures.   On the connectivity front, the iPhone 16 offers support for 5G, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, and a USB Type-C port, ensuring modern and versatile usage. The device is also built to withstand challenging environments, boasting an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The iPhone 16 comes in three storage options—128GB, 256GB, and 512GB—with ongoing offers applicable to all variants. It is available in five striking colors: Black, Pink, Teal, Ultramarine, and White, catering to diverse aesthetic preferences.

Priced at Rs 601, the new mobile plan offers unlimited 5G data for a whole year. What’s even better? You can buy it for yourself or gift it to your friends or family. Here’s how it works: — To enjoy unlimited 5G, you must already be on a Jio recharge plan that offers at least 1.5 GB of 4G data per day. 
— Plans like Rs 199, Rs 239, Rs 299, and others in this range are eligible. 
— Unfortunately, if you’re using Jio’s more basic 1 GB per day plan or the Rs 1,899 annual recharge plan, this voucher won’t work for you.What you get with the Rs 601 voucher When you purchase the Rs 601 Jio True 5G gift voucher, you’ll receive 12 upgrade vouchers. These can be redeemed one by one through the My Jio app. Once activated, users can enjoy unlimited 5G data and an increased 4G daily data limit of 3 GB per day. It’s important to note that the validity of this voucher aligns with your existing base plan’s validity, with a maximum limit of 30 days per voucher. This means if your base plan has 28 days of validity, the unlimited 5G benefits will last the same number of days for that period. However, the annual voucher provides a total of 12 such vouchers, giving you the freedom to activate them when needed over 12 months.Who Can Use This Plan? Jio’s unlimited 5G voucher will work with several popular recharge plans, like Rs 199, Rs 239, Rs 299, Rs 319, Rs 329, Rs 579, Rs 666, Rs 769, and Rs 899. If you’re already on one of these plans, you’re good to go. Just make sure your base plan is valid when you activate a voucher.How to Gift It to Someone Else The Rs 601 plan is designed not just for yourself but also as a gift option. You can purchase it for family or friends directly through the My Jio app. But before you gift it, make sure the recipient is on an eligible plan so they can enjoy the unlimited 5G benefits.Other 5G Plans from Jio Apart from the Rs 601 voucher, Jio also offers smaller 5G upgrade plans. These are priced at Rs 51, Rs 101, and Rs 151, with validity lasting one, two, and three months respectively. These are great for short-term needs or for those looking to try out Jio’s 5G services without a long-term commitment.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

7cff180b-2882-407e-a296-3c774db98888,TRAI directs telcos to provide call and SMS-only tariff plansThe latest TRAI mandate directs telecom operators to now also offer mobile tariff plans that focus only on SMS and voice calls.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/trai-directs-telecom-operators-to-provide-non-data-tariff-plans-2655486-2024-12-26,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has announced new regulations to make telecom services more affordable and consumer-friendly. The Telecom Consumers Protection (Twelfth Amendment) Regulations, 2024, issued on Monday, include several key changes to benefit users, especially those who rely heavily on basic calling and SMS or use secondary SIM cards for specific purposes like calls and SMS. One of the biggest changes is that telecom operators must now offer tariff plans that focus only on SMS and voice calls. This is a big relief for millions of users, particularly the estimated 150 million (15 crores) people in India who still use basic mobile services. Many of these users don’t need data services but are forced to buy expensive plans that bundle data along with calls and SMS. These new SMS-and-call-only plans will allow such users to pay only for the services they actually use. The change is also expected to benefit users who keep a secondary SIM card exclusively for making calls or sending messages. Until now, these users had no choice but to pay for data benefits they didn’t want. TRAI’s new rules aim to fix this imbalance and make telecom plans more tailored to user needs. However, this move could impact telecom companies like Airtel and Vi. Reliance Jio, which operates only 4G and 5G networks, is unlikely to be directly affected by this regulation. Telecom companies have been focusing on increasing their Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by offering bundled plans that include a mix of data, calling, SMS, and even benefits like subscriptions to OTT platforms. This new mandate might force them to rethink their strategies. The regulations also bring another consumer-friendly change — increasing the validity of Special Tariff Vouchers (STVs). These vouchers, which are usually more affordable than standard plans, will now have a validity of up to 365 days, compared to the earlier limit of 90 days. This means users can enjoy the benefits of these special plans for a longer period without frequent recharges. In addition, TRAI has instructed telecom operators to ensure that top-up vouchers are available in various denominations, starting from as low as Rs 10. This step is aimed at making small-value recharges more accessible and convenient for consumers, especially those with limited budgets. TRAI’s decisions are based on extensive consumer surveys and stakeholder feedback. The telecom authority has emphasised that these changes are designed to ensure users get the best value for their money and aren’t forced to pay for services they don’t use.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Along with the two phones, the company will also launch an updated variant of the OnePlus Buds Pro 3. Leading up to the event, the company has been teasing a bunch of details about the phone. For instance, OnePlus has confirmed that the OnePlus 13 will launch in India in three colourways: Black Eclipse, Arctic Dawn, and Midnight Ocean. The company has also revealed that the smartphone will feature  IP68 and IP69 rating. The OnePlus 13 is also confirmed to be powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.  OnePlus has also revealed that the OnePlus 13 will come with OxygenOS 15 out-of-the-box. The smartphone will also be integrated with a bunch of AI features like Intelligent Search, AI-powered photography tools, and more.OnePlus 13: Expected specifications and features While that’s all OnePlus has confirmed about the OnePlus 13 in India so far, however, considering that the phone has already launched in China, there is already a lot we know or can expect from the OnePlus 13. In China, the OnePlus 13 features a 6.82-inch display — matching the size of its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. It boasts a 120Hz refresh rate and QHD+ resolution, delivering stunning visuals. The screen remains impressively bright, with 1,600 nits of standard brightness and a peak of 4,500 nits. However, two standout upgrades set this model apart: glove compatibility and a dynamic local high refresh rate feature.  The glove usability feature is particularly handy for colder regions, like Delhi during winter, allowing users to operate the phone effortlessly while wearing gloves. The dynamic high refresh rate feature intelligently adjusts the screen’s refresh rate based on activity—for instance, lowering it while watching videos but switching seamlessly to 60Hz, 90Hz, or 120Hz for smoother scrolling. Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 runs on Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, ensuring top-notch performance. One of its major upgrades is the battery. The device now packs a larger 6,000mAh battery, an upgrade from the 5,400mAh unit in the OnePlus 12, promising nearly two days of use. It supports 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, with the addition of magnetic wireless charging via a special case, a first for OnePlus. On the camera front, the OnePlus 13 retains the 50-megapixel LYT-808 primary sensor but enhances the telephoto and ultrawide lenses to 50 megapixels each. The Hasselblad branding remains a highlight, complemented by 4K/60fps Dolby Vision video capabilities for stellar photography and videography. Durability has also been a focus, with IP68 and IP69 certifications ensuring the phone is not just water-resistant but can withstand high-pressure water jets. It includes an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor for precise unlocking, even with wet hands. Additionally, the phone introduces a new vibration motor, enhancing the gaming experience with more immersive feedback.  Packed with cutting-edge features and thoughtful upgrades, the OnePlus 13 sets a new benchmark for premium smartphones.OnePlus 13: Expected price in India The price of the OnePlus 13 has not yet been revealed, but it is anticipated to remain under Rs 70,000. For context, the OnePlus 12 launched in India at a starting price of Rs 64,999. Even if OnePlus decides to slightly raise the price for its latest model, it is expected to stay within the Rs 70,000 range.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Apple MacBook Air with M4 chip could launch even before iPhone SE 4Also read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateAlso read |  OnePlus Open 2 launch timeline leaked: Here is when it will launch in 2025

However, a new report reveals that some technical challenges make this difficult to achieve.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-18-to-be-apples-first-bezel-free-display-phone-here-is-what-the-fresh-leak-revealed-2655544-2024-12-26,"Apple has long been working towards creating a completely bezel-free iPhone, and a recent supply chain leak suggests the company was hoping to achieve this with the iPhone 18, set for release in 2026. However, according to the TheElec report, technical challenges are making this goal uncertain, despite the efforts of display suppliers Samsung and LG. 9To5Mac reported that the idea of a bezel-free iPhone stems from former Apple design chief Jony Ive's vision of a ""single slab of glass."" This would involve the entire front of the phone being a seamless display, with no visible bezels or edges. While Apple made strides towards this concept with the iPhone X in 2017, the progress since then has been gradual, with smaller bezels but no complete elimination. Apple is aiming for a design where the display wraps around the sides of the phone, creating a continuous screen without any interruptions, according to reports. However, suppliers have struggled to meet Apple's requirements for this advanced design. According to TheElec site, the discussions between Apple and its display partners are still ongoing, and some hurdles remain unresolved. Several practical issues need to be addressed before a truly bezel-free iPhone can become a reality. These include ensuring that the joint between the curved display and the phone’s body is waterproof, preventing distortions like the ""magnifying glass effect"" that can occur with curved edges, and maintaining antenna performance without interference from the new design. Additionally, the durability of the curved screen edges is another concern, as they could be more vulnerable to impact damage. While Apple had reportedly hoped to introduce this bold design with at least one model of the iPhone 18, the timeline is now unclear due to these challenges. But, there is still a lot of time for the launch of the iPhone 18 series and if Apple manages to make it possible by 2026, then we might get to see it. For now, the company is rumoured to launch a new model iPhone 17 Air or Slim by the end of next year, which is said to be the slimmest ever device from Apple, according to the leaks.

Expected to launch in September 2025, the next-generation iPhones might include a bunch of major updates, including the long-awaited ProMotion display on all models to a brand-new design and improved cameras. But there’s more — Apple might also introduce a new model, the iPhone 17 Air, replacing the Plus model. The iPhone 17 Air could be the thinnest iPhone ever, even slimmer than the iPhone 6, which was just 6.9mm thick. Some reports suggest the 17 Air will measure around 6.25mm, which is a big deal considering modern iPhones have been getting thicker to accommodate larger batteries, better cameras, and Face ID.  According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone 17 Air will be about 2mm thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro, which measures 8.25mm. To make this possible, Apple is rumoured to be using its own custom-designed 5G modem chip. This chip is reportedly smaller than Qualcomm’s, saving much-needed space inside the device. Apple has also optimised the internal layout, ensuring the 17 Air doesn’t sacrifice battery life, camera quality, or display performance. Analyst Jeff Pu predicts the thickness of the iPhone 17 Air could be about 6mm, while The Information suggests it might range between 5mm and 6mm.  For years, Apple’s ProMotion technology, which offers a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, has been exclusive to the Pro models. But in 2025, this feature might come to the entire iPhone lineup. This means even the standard iPhone 17 models will benefit from smoother scrolling and improved touch response. Moreover, ProMotion also supports a variable refresh rate, ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz. This helps save battery life when high refresh rates aren’t needed. On top of that, the iPhone 17 series is expected to feature a new anti-reflective display layer, similar to what we have also seen on the Galaxy S24 Ultra.  The iPhone 17 Pro models are rumoured to be powered by Apple’s next-generation A19 Pro chip. Speculated to be built using TSMC’s advanced 3nm process, this chip will likely deliver faster performance and better energy efficiency. Apple might also introduce its own Wi-Fi 7 chip, replacing the Broadcom chips used in earlier models. When it comes to RAM, there’s some debate. Higher-end models like the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are expected to feature 12GB of RAM, a significant upgrade from the 8GB in the iPhone 15 Pro and the 16 Pro. The standard iPhone 17 and the 17 Air will likely come with 8GB of RAM, which is the same as the standard iPhone 16.  All iPhone 17 models are expected to include a new 24MP front-facing camera, a big jump from the current 12MP selfie cameras. At the rear, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is rumoured to have a triple-camera setup, with three 48MP sensors. This includes a primary camera, an ultra-wide camera, and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. Meanwhile, the standard iPhone 17 and the 17 Air will likely stick to a single 48MP rear camera. One standout rumour is that at least one iPhone 17 variant will include a mechanical aperture. This feature would allow users to adjust the aperture size, giving them more creative control over their photos. The iPhone 17 series might also introduce a fresh design. Reports suggest the iPhone 17 Air model will have a centred camera bump, moving the rear camera from the upper-left corner to the middle of the device. This could give the phone a unique look while maintaining functionality.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The latest update is live on the App Store and if you are an iOS user, you can download it. With the new update, WhatsApp now offers tools that make it more engaging and practical, especially for those who love using the camera or frequently sharing documents. One of the standout features in this update is the addition of AR (augmented reality) effects. When using the camera within WhatsApp, users will now notice a new image wand icon next to the gallery button in the viewfinder. This opens up a variety of AR effects that can be applied to photos and videos. Whether it’s adding playful confetti, magical sparkles, or even creating the illusion of being underwater, these effects bring a creative twist to your captures. Other available effects include starry windows, teardrops, and even a karaoke mode for fun, music-themed content.  In addition to AR effects, WhatsApp has also introduced new backgrounds that can be applied during video recording. These backgrounds are designed to obscure the user’s surroundings, offering more privacy or simply creating a different mood for the video. Along with this, the app now lets users adjust the colour tone of their videos, allowing for subtle tweaks to make your footage look just right. Another practical feature in this update is the document scanning option, which is now integrated into the file-sharing menu. When you open the document-sharing window, you’ll find a new option labelled “Scan Document.” This feature is incredibly handy for anyone who needs to quickly digitise physical documents. Once you capture an image of the document, the app automatically crops the edges for a cleaner look. It also provides options to adjust the image using filters like colour, greyscale, and black-and-white. For added convenience, there’s an auto-shutter mode that captures the document automatically when it’s perfectly aligned in the frame. Users can also manually adjust the borders if needed.  These new tools come shortly after WhatsApp rolled out a series of festive updates to enhance video calls and messages ahead of the New Year celebrations. Users can enjoy new animations, stickers, and even themed calling effects that reflect the season’s cheer.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Krishnan’s appointment comes at a time when debates around immigration and tech policy are more charged than ever. Critics have taken to social media to accuse Krishnan of undermining Trump’s “America First” agenda, and they are demanding a ban on the H1-B Visa. Basically, they want fewer Indians in Silicon Valley. Krishnan’s opposition on X (formerly Twitter) was led by far-right political activist Laura Loomer. Her ire was particularly focused on Krishnan’s advocacy for removing country-specific caps on green cards, a reform that is aimed at addressing the lengthy backlog that disproportionately affects Indian applicants.   In a post on X, Loomer wrote, “Deeply disturbing to see the appointment of Sriram Krishnan @sriramk as Senior Policy Advisor for AI.” She alleged that Krishnan’s policies would encourage foreign workers to dominate Silicon Valley, sidelining American STEM graduates. Her stance struck a chord with parts of Trump’s base that remain skeptical of high-skilled immigration.  
 



 


Silicon valley vs Trump supporters The backlash didn’t stop there. New York-based conservative columnist Gavin Mario Wax amplified the criticism, warning of the dangers of relying on “cheap foreign tech workers.” Loomer quickly backed him, arguing that such conflicts predated Trump’s re-election. Their argument painted a picture of Silicon Valley as a battleground between “tech bros” and nationalist populists, a coalition bound to fracture under pressure.  
 


 However, prominent figures in the tech world quickly came to Sriram’s defence. Venture capitalist David Sacks, dismissed the accusations. “Sriram is definitely not a ‘career leftist,’” Sacks tweeted, attempting to distance Krishnan from the ideological tags pinned by his detractors. Meanwhile, Joe Lonsdale, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, argued that the US must continue to attract the “best and brightest” to maintain its global edge.  
 



 


The Immigration conundrum  At the heart of the debate is the controversial H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire skilled foreign workers. While proponents see it as a vital tool for attracting top talent, critics argue that it displaces American workers and suppresses wages. Trump supporters view Krishnan’s appointment as a signal of a shift in immigration policy, one they believe undermines domestic talent.   At the heart of the debate is the controversial H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire skilled foreign workers.

Trump supporters view Krishnan’s appointment as a signal of a shift in immigration policy, one they believe undermines domestic talent.   Krishnan’s advocacy for reforms like removing country-specific caps on green cards further fuels the controversy. Currently, US immigration laws allocate green cards equally among all countries, a system that disproportionately affects Indian applicants due to high demand. While applicants from smaller countries face minimal delays, Indians often wait over a decade. Krishnan has called for a merit-based system that prioritises efficiency, a stance that has drawn support from figures like Elon Musk but enraged immigration skeptics.  Silicon valley’s response   The tech community has rallied around Krishnan, highlighting the indispensable contributions of high-skilled immigrants to the US economy. Jason Calacanis, a tech investor, was among those who pushed back against the anti-immigration rhetoric, emphasising that immigrants are integral to innovation and economic growth. Krishnan himself remained assertive, defending his stance on policies designed to make the US a magnet for global talent.   The divide between Silicon Valley and Trump’s base is emblematic of a broader cultural and political conflict. On one side are tech leaders advocating for open borders to foster innovation, while on the other are populists who believe unchecked immigration threatens American jobs and values. For now, the debate rages on. Trump’s base sees Krishnan’s nomination as a betrayal of the “America First” ethos, while Silicon Valley views it as a step toward preserving US leadership in technology.

While not perfect, it stands out with its ergonomic build, vibrant display, and solid battery life.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/poco-m7-pro-5g-review-strong-on-the-fundamentals-2655685-2024-12-26,"After spending two weeks with the Poco M7 Pro 5G, I can confidently say — Poco knows exactly what people want. Speed, power, and value, all at a price tag that doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket. And with the M7 Pro priced at just Rs 14,999, it’s hard to find much to complain about. You see, this phone isn’t just a small step up from last year’s M6 Pro, which, let’s be honest, didn’t feel like much of an upgrade over the M5 itself.  The Poco M7 Pro is different — it brings noticeable upgrades across the board. From the camera to the display, to the chipset that powers it all, Poco has made sure this phone isn’t just another budget option — it’s the one that stands out. But here’s the big question — are these upgrades good enough to warrant a purchase? How do these upgrades stack up in real-world performance? Read our review of the Poco M7 Pro to find out.  Poco M7 Pro 5G: Quick look at the specs — Display: 6.78-inch FHD+, 120Hz refresh rate, AMOLED, Gorilla Glass 5 protection, in-display fingerprint sensor
— Dimensions: 8mm thickness, 190g weight
— Chipset: MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra, 6nm fabrication process
— RAM and storage: 6GB + 128GB (Rs 14,999), 8GB + 256GB (Rs 16,999)
— Battery: 5,110mAh
— Charging: 45W, charger included in-box
— Software: HyperOS based on Android 14, 2 years of OS updates plus 4 years of security patches
— Camera: 50MP Sony LYTIA LYT-600 primary rear camera, 2MP depth sensor, 20MP front
— Miscellaneous: IP64 rating, 3.5mm headphone jack, IR blaster, dual-stereo speakers, USB type-C portA phone can look good and be ergonomic The Poco M7 Pro carries the typical Poco design that looks good, feels robust and just clicks right. Of course, there are a few tweaks to the phone’s design over the M6 Pro, such as the curves around the corner at the rear for a better grip, a camera island for the rear lenses and a two-tone finish. Speaking of which, this two-tone finish gives the M7 Pro a distinct character. Granted, the Lavender Frost colour, aka the light mauve colour, may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but trust me when I say this — you have to see this colour in person to believe how beautiful it looks. It isn’t as gaudy as it looks in the promotional images. In fact, after using the lavender shade for myself, I wonder how cool the Lunar Dust (silver) colourway would be. Not to mention, there’s also a third colour option — Olive Twilight, which honestly, I don’t like that much.  Having said that, while liking a particular colour or design is always a subjective matter, what can’t be denied is how ergonomic this phone is. There are a bunch of phones in this price range that I have seen and used, that don’t look and feel the part. But, the Poco M7 Pro has the right balance of good looks, and a good build that makes it comfortable to hold and operate. Don’t get me wrong, it is still 190g in weight and about 8mm thick, but for some reason, the phone feels lighter and sleeker when you actually use it.   Bonus: To add good ergonomics to the phone, Poco has fortunately not skipped on the practical additions, like an IR blaster, dual-stereo speakers, a type-C port, and an in-display fingerprint reader.  For added peace of mind, there’s also an IP64 rating for dust and water resistance. Last I remember, similar phones — for instance, the Galaxy A16 that launched in October 2024 –– come with just an IP54 rating and are priced higher than the M7 Pro for the same RAM and storage configuration. For the unaware, the first digit in an IP rating indicates the level of protection against solids. In Poco's case, the ""6"" in IP64 offers a higher level of solid protection than the ""5"" in IP54. As for the overall design of the phone, it looks like a Poco phone. Some may say Poco is recycling the same design –– which isn’t entirely wrong –– but, truth be told, Poco has played it safe here, and that’s not always a bad thing. In Poco’s defence, the overall experience is solid here. After a long time, I have tested a phone in the budget segment that looks the part, doesn’t cut corners on the necessary features, and is supremely comfortable to use. A display that surprised me, in a good way Smartphone companies these days boast a lot about their device’s peak brightness, where in reality — peak brightness is just a number to describe the maximum brightness a smartphone's display can achieve, even if it's only in a small area of the screen. It's often used to describe the brightness of HDR content, like videos. So, when I was going through the phone’s promotional material on X — Poco claimed that the M7 Pro has the brightest display on a phone in its segment. I honestly thought how good can it be, considering we are talking about a sub-Rs 15,000 device here? To be frank, quite good. First of all, the Poco M7 Pro has some of the slimmest bezels you would see on a budget smartphone. Looking at the front profile, you can easily mistake it for a more expensive phone.   And if we talk about the brightness, the M7 Pro has a peak brightness of 2,100nits, and while I can’t confirm the number in high brightness mode, you can rest assured the phone gets plenty bright, both indoors and outdoors. When indoors, of course, the display is pretty nice and vibrant when watching videos, playing games or simply gawking at the screen. The viewing angles are spot on. But, it is decently legible even when using it outdoors.  I am glad that Poco didn’t fall for the curved display trend that’s coming back with the likes of Lava Blaze X. Sure, they look good, but curved display also means accidental touches and glare. The Poco M7 Pro has a flat display. Which means, reduced chances of mistouches and glare around the edges. Overall, the 120Hz AMOLED screen is also bright and smooth. It's a big step up from its predecessor and definitely, one of the best panels you can get on a phone at this price point. Good real-world performance with a few minor niggles Performance in budget phones has often been a hit-and-miss. In fact, in recent memory, I can only remember the CMF Phone 1 to be a device that is priced under Rs 15,000, and is probably the smoothest phone you can get on this budget. And, while, I won’t say, the Poco M7 Pro has the best performance in a phone at this budget, it is definitely one of the best.  Part of the reason is the Dimensity 7025 Ultra chip, which is also there inside the recently launched Redmi Note 14. Now, we won’t get into the nitty gritties on how similar the Poco is to the Redmi and vice versa. But, for what it’s worth — the M7 Pro performs pretty well in day-to-day use. Granted, minor hiccups and frame drops do appear here and there, but speed and responsiveness on a whole easily get 8 out of 10, which is quite good considering we are talking about a budget phone.  HyperOS atop Android 14 is also feature-loaded. However, there are a couple of things to point out here. The phone is loaded with pre-installed apps. It’s annoying for sure, but it’s through bloatware and ads that brands are able to offer such solid smartphones like the M7 Pro under Rs 15,000. Also, you can always uninstall most of the apps.   Downside of the OS, though: Not having Android 15 on a brand-new phone is kind of a missed opportunity. Not that Android 14 is bad, but, the whole purpose of having two years of main OS updates is defeated with a year-old Android software version.  That said, coming from MIUI on the M6 Pro, HyperOS on the Poco M7 Pro feels like a big upgrade. It has faster app loading time, and surprisingly good background memory retention, despite my unit only having 6GB RAM. There are also a bunch of other things that make the software experience good. For instance, there are several customisations you can do on the lockscreen. The quick settings menu that we have recently seen on OxygenOS 15, is already there on HyperOS. They are both quite iOS-inspired, but I am not complaining. Additionally, the Home Screen layout is more stable, with no excess space at the top and neatly displayed folder icons. This phone easily lasts a day The Poco M7 Pro stands out with its amazing endurance numbers. It comes with a solid 5,110mAh battery, which can easily get you through an entire day on regular use without needing to charge it again. Even if you’re someone who uses their phone a bit heavily — streaming videos, gaming, or video calling — you’ll probably only start looking for a charger by the end of the day, which is still pretty good. When it’s time to charge, the Poco M7 Pro doesn’t keep you waiting for long. It takes about 30 minutes to go from 0 to 60 per cent, and about 65 minutes for a full charge, which is impressive when you compare it to similar phones in this range. Plus, you don’t have to worry about buying a fast charger separately because the phone comes with a 45W charger included in the box. Decent camera performance across different lighting conditions The main camera on the Poco M7 Pro takes 12.5-megapixel photos by default, and it does a pretty good job in daylight. The pictures come out nice, with balanced brightness and colours that look lively. It also handles both bright and dark areas well, so you get decent detail across the image. The photos are sharp and clear, which is great for everyday shots.  If you want to use the full 50-megapixel resolution, there’s a special mode for that. The photos in this mode appear noticeably sharper than the regular ones, but there’s a trade-off — you might notice a bit of grain in the pictures, in some cases. Also, the colours slightly lean towards a warmer tone. It’s not a huge difference, but it’s something to keep in mind.  The portrait mode is also quite good and does a fine job with edge detection. However, in some cases, it tends to over-brighten the image. But it only sometimes happens, so if there’s an issue like this, you can always retake the photo and hopefully, the phone will get it right at the next attempt.  Click on any photo below to access all the camera samples When it comes to low-light photography, the cameras do an okay job if you use night mode. The pictures look much better and capture more detail in the night mode, but without it, you might see some graininess and light streaks ruining the shot. The 20-megapixel front camera’s performance is surprisingly good for a phone at this price. Casual selfies captured in good lighting turn out great. The skin tones look pretty natural and even portrait photos come out with accurate edge detection. There are also a bunch of fun filters you can play around with, which add a bit of fun to the selfie-taking experience.Poco M7 Pro 5G: Final verdict Poco has put a lot of thought into this phone that punches well above its weight.  At a starting price of Rs 14,999, it feels like Poco has hit the sweet spot for folks on a budget, who don’t want to compromise on features or performance.  The phone's design, while safe and typical of Poco, stands out with its ergonomic build and gorgeous two-tone finishes, especially the Lavender Frost colourway. Using the phone daily feels comfortable, and it doesn’t feel like you’re lugging around a bulky device despite a 6.78-inch display. The addition of practical features like an in-display fingerprint sensor, dual-stereo speakers, and an IP64 rating shows that Poco hasn’t cut corners. The display was a surprise package for me. It’s bright, sharp, and vibrant, and using it outdoors or indoors is a treat.   Performance-wise, the Dimensity 7025 Ultra does its job well, handling everyday tasks with ease. Sure, there are minor hiccups and frame drops now and then, but that’s expected in this price range. HyperOS feels smooth and loaded with features, though it would’ve been nice to see Android 15 right out of the box. Battery life is another big win for the M7 Pro. It can easily last a full day of moderate to heavy usage, and the 45W fast charger in the box ensures you’re not stuck waiting when it’s time to juice up. The cameras are decent for a budget phone. The main camera performs well in good lighting, and the selfies from the front camera are a pleasant surprise. The low-light performance is where it struggles a bit, but night mode does help improve the results. Overall, I wouldn’t call the Poco M7 Pro, the perfect sub-Rs 15,000 smartphone. But, it’s certainly a fantastic choice if you’re looking for a budget-friendly phone that delivers on design, display, and battery life while offering solid day-to-day performance.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Lured by promises of easy money for minimal work, the man ended up transferring a large sum of money over a period of time before realising he had been scammed. The cybercrime police have since filed an FIR against 14 people under various sections of the IPC and IT Act for their involvement in the case. The scam began on August 16, when the victim received a Telegram message from a woman named Ansuya. She introduced him to a part-time job that promised earnings of Rs 4,650 for just three hours of online work each day.  After two days, another woman, Abhinaya, contacted him claiming to be associated with a company called 'Mango Fashion.' She guided the businessman to register on the company's platform, where his digital wallet was credited with a Rs 10,000 bonus. As he continued completing tasks, his wallet balance grew, making him believe the opportunity was legitimate. Encouraged by the increasing wallet balance, the man was convinced by Abhinaya to invest in Mango Fashion, with promises of even greater returns. Over time, he transferred a total of Rs 58.06 lakh to 11 different bank accounts provided to him by the scammers. His digital wallet showed Rs 76 lakh, including profits, but when he attempted to withdraw the funds, he was only able to retrieve Rs 30,858 in two small transactions.  As repeated attempts to withdraw larger sums failed, he realised he had been duped. On August 29, he reached out to the cybercrime helpline and filed a formal complaint, which led to an investigation. Finally, on December 24, the police registered an FIR against 14 individuals connected to the fraud. This case highlights the growing number of part-time job scams that target unsuspecting victims through messaging platforms. To avoid falling prey to such schemes, it is better to verify the legitimacy of any job offers, especially if they arrive unsolicited. Genuine companies do not ask for money or investments upfront. Any request for payments should raise suspicion. If you find yourself in a similar situation, it is important to report the matter to the authorities as quickly as possible to prevent further financial loss.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 26, 2024

The company confirmed that its AI models, including its video model, Sora and ChatGPT, were down for several hours. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-faces-second-major-outage-in-december-2656015-2024-12-27,"This is the second time that OpenAI's ChatGPT has suffered a major outage. At around 1:30 PM ET (12 AM IST), many users experienced issues with ChatGPT, as the chatbot abruptly stopped responding to queries, according to an outage tracking website, DownDetector. Some users were met with an ""internal server error"" message.  According to DownDetector, tons of US users reported that the site wasn't working for them in the early afternoon, though the reports started receding after half an hour or so. Noticing the outage, OpenAI posted on X claiming that it has identified the issue and is working on it.  OpenAI didn’t specify the “upstream provider” linked to the issue, but its exclusive cloud provider, Microsoft, reported a “power issue” at one of its data centers that started around the same time as the OpenAI problems and affected North America, and problems with Xbox cloud gaming.
 


 API and Sora were also experiencing outages, according to OpenAI. A few hours later, the company posted that the Sora issue has been fixed and it is currently working on ChatGPT and API, which are also almost fixed. ChatGPT has experienced multiple outages this month, with the latest occurring on December 11, the same day Apple launched iOS 18.2 featuring GPT integration in Siri. Consequently, some users may be unable to use the OpenAI chatbot through Siri at the moment. 
 


 Last time, in December 11, ChatGPT underwent a similar outage. All three platforms were affected during the last outage as well: Sora, ChatGPT and API. According to Downdetector, there were 2,483 outage reports during that time.  The AI model has been suffering such outage for quite some time. On November 8, ChatGPT was unavailable to over 19,000 users worldwide for 30 minutes. At the time, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted that ChatGPT had been down for 30 minutes, adding a frown emoji and saying, ""We are much, much better at reliability than we used to be, but clearly more work in front of us.""  That said, since its debut in November 2022, ChatGPT has gained 250 million weekly active users. OpenAI's valuation has skyrocketed to $157 billion, up from $14 billion in 2021, with revenues soaring to $3.6 billion from zero, far surpassing the projections made by Sam Altman at the time. Earlier this month, Altman mentioned that the company’s technology was now reaching 300 million active users weekly.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

Samsung has been building an ecosystem that helps its phones, tablets, and laptops work better together. The new update improves these features further, adding small but handy tools like Camera continuity. With Camera continuity, you can take a photo or scan a document on your Galaxy phone and then immediately continue working on it on another Galaxy device, like a Galaxy Book laptop. This can be helpful if you’re switching between your phone and laptop during work or study. The feature will work with Samsung apps like Samsung Internet and Samsung Notes. However, there are some requirements. Your devices need to be signed in to the same Samsung account, connected to the same Wi-Fi network, and close enough for Bluetooth to work. Samsung already offers cross-device syncing in apps like Samsung Notes. You can manually add photos or documents to notes, and they’ll automatically sync between devices. Camera continuity builds on this, making the process a bit smoother by automatically connecting your phone and laptop. This could save time for users who often use both devices for tasks like editing documents or managing photos. Another improvement in the One UI 7 update is a change to the feature previously known as Continue apps on other devices. Samsung has renamed it to “Continue on other devices” to better reflect its expanded functionality. Now, in addition to switching between apps like Samsung Internet and Notes, the feature also syncs your saved Wi-Fi networks across devices. This isn’t entirely new, as Samsung devices could already sync Wi-Fi through Samsung Cloud, but it’s now a more visible part of the system. One UI 7 also suggests that more apps may eventually be included in this feature. Earlier versions of the software specifically mentioned only Samsung Internet and Notes. The updated settings page now mentions “other apps,” which could mean that more third-party apps will be supported in the future. If you already use multiple Galaxy devices, the new features in One UI 7 might make your experience more convenient. While they aren’t revolutionary changes — something that we haven’t seen before — they’re part of Samsung’s effort to make its ecosystem a little more user-friendly with each update.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Rumours suggest the event will be held on January 22, as per some leaked documents. However, the company has yet to confirm the official launch date. At the event, the company is expected to launch four new smartphones: the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and the new and highly-anticipated Galaxy S25 Slim. The latter may be revealed at the event but is expected to be made available later in 2025. Along with the smartphones, Samsung is also expected to release the next-generation Galaxy Ring at the event. Ahead of things going official, there have been several leaks around the phones. The latest reveals a new colourway for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Shared by the popular Samsung leaker @iceuniverse on X (formerly Twitter), the phone will come in a new blue variant this time. But honestly, when we looked at the post, it took us a minute to understand things. The leaker has put up a picture of a grey colour swatch, but the post reads “S25 Ultra. Blue.” Had it not been for the text in the post, we would never have guessed it to be a shade of blue.
 


 Anyway, nitty gritties of the post aside, the leaker suggests that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be coming in a blue, almost-grey colour.   Anyway, nitty gritties of the post aside, the leaker suggests that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be coming in a blue, almost-grey colour.  In the past, the smartphone has also been leaked in a space grey-ish colour, a deep blue, a light blue, and grey. 
 


 At this point, it’s hard to distinguish one from the other, but shades of grey and blue seem to be the general colourway for the phone. It’s unclear if these colors will also be available on other Galaxy S24 models. There have also been other leaks regarding the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Recently, a report revealed that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will feature 16GB of RAM, exclusive to its 512GB and 1TB storage variants. The base model with 256GB storage will come with 12GB of RAM. This configuration is a notable distinction within the Galaxy S25 lineup.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra launch date, pre-order, sale details Pre-orders for the Galaxy S25 in South Korea are expected to take place from January 24 to February 3, 2025, with deliveries and in-store sales beginning on February 7. In international markets, including the US, pre-orders are likely to follow a similar timeline, starting around January 22 or 23 and closing in early February. This schedule mirrors Samsung’s approach with the Galaxy S24, which was unveiled on January 17, 2024, with pre-orders starting immediately and the phone becoming available by January 31.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateAlso read |  OneUI 7 adds improved continuity features for Galaxy devicesAlso read |  OnePlus Ace 5 aka OnePlus 13R launched: Price, specs and more

Contractors noticed that Claude has stricter safety settings, avoiding unsafe prompts, while Gemini flags such inputs more explicitly.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-collaborates-with-anthropic-to-improve-gemini-ai-using-claude-2656066-2024-12-27,"Google is reportedly relying on Claude, an AI model developed by Anthropic, to help improve the performance of its own AI system, Gemini. According to a report from TechCrunch, contractors hired by Google are tasked with comparing responses generated by Gemini and Claude to the same user prompts. Their job is to evaluate the quality of the output based on factors such as truthfulness, clarity, and verbosity. The process works like this: Contractors are shown responses from both Gemini and Claude for a specific prompt. They then have up to 30 minutes to carefully assess each answer and rate how well it meets the evaluation criteria. This feedback helps Google identify areas where Gemini may need improvement. Interestingly, the contractors started noticing some unusual patterns during this evaluation process. On occasions, Gemini’s output included references like, “I am Claude, created by Anthropic,” sparking curiosity about how closely the two systems might be connected. One thing that stood out in the comparison was Claude’s strict approach to safety. Contractors reportedly observed that Claude tends to avoid replying to prompts it deems unsafe, staying firm on maintaining high ethical standards. On the other hand, Gemini sometimes flagged these unsafe prompts but did so in a way that contractors found more detailed yet possibly less strict. For instance, in one case involving prompts related to nudity and bondage, Claude refused to engage, while Gemini identified the input as a huge safety violation. Google has a system in place for these comparisons, using an internal platform that makes it easier for contractors to test and review multiple AI models side by side. However, the use of Claude for this purpose has raised some questions. Anthropic’s terms of service explicitly state that users are not allowed to access Claude to create or train competing AI products without approval. This rule applies to other companies using the model, but it’s unclear if it extends to investors like Google, which backs Anthropic financially. In response to the speculation, Shira McNamara, a spokesperson for Google DeepMind, clarified the situation. She emphasised that comparing AI models is standard practice in the industry and essential for improving performance. McNamara firmly denied any claims that Google has used Anthropic’s Claude to train Gemini, calling such suggestions inaccurate. For now, the collaboration highlights how competitive the AI industry has become, with major players like Google leveraging a mix of internal development and external partnerships to enhance their models. At the same time, it also raises questions about ethical boundaries and how companies balance collaboration with competition.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The company has yet to announce an official launch date, but Oppo has been teasing the new smartphone series on X (formerly Twitter) quite frequently now. We are expecting the Reno 13 series will launch sometime in the second week of January 2025. The Reno 13 series will likely include two smartphones: the Reno 13 and Reno 13 Pro. Ahead of the launch, the company has revealed the design of the smartphones.  The Reno 13 and 13 Pro have been confirmed to sport two vertically aligned cameras and a third on its right. The two vertically aligned cameras are so big and prominent that your eye doesn’t go to the third one, and the camera setup gives off a very iPhone-like design. In the teaser, there are two colours that we notice. There is white and a beautiful lavender. You can tell that we are already feeling a little inclined towards the lavender colourway. Both variants have a pattern on the back, which in the white model gives off a marble-like appearance. Oppo says it is a “one piece sculpted glass” back.

— OPPO (@oppo) December 25, 2024 The teaser confirms that the phone has an aluminium frame. Interestingly, the phone uses an almost flat display, with slight curves on the edges, which can possibly give you the best of both worlds –– thinner bezels, less glare, and reduced accidental touches. In previous posts, Oppo has also confirmed that the rear panel of the Reno 13 series will be protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 7i. Oppo hasn’t gone into details about it yet, but the teasers do list the phones as AI phones, as were last year’s Oppo Reno 12 series. Which means, we could expect a few upgrades in terms of the AI features on the phone. The Oppo Reno 12 Pro was loaded with AI features like AI Best Face, AI Eraser 2.0, and AI Clear Face. For productivity, it offered AI Summary, AI Record Summary, AI Clear Voice, AI Writer, and AI Speak. Oppo Reno 13 series: What to expect The Reno 13 series, already launched in China, provides a glimpse of what to expect from these smartphones. In China, the series features a 6.59-inch flat AMOLED display with a crisp 2760x1256 pixel resolution and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, offering vibrant visuals and seamless performance. Powering the devices is the MediaTek Dimensity 8350 chipset, a notable upgrade with an improved GPU for enhanced gaming and faster app performance. This is paired with a substantial 5,600mAh battery that supports 80W fast wired charging for quick recharges and extended use. Continuing the Reno series’ focus on camera excellence, the Reno 13 comes equipped with a 50-megapixel primary camera featuring optical image stabilisation (OIS) for sharp and steady photos, complemented by an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens for capturing broader perspectives. For selfies and video calls, a 50-megapixel front-facing camera ensures high-quality images and videos. The Reno 13 runs on ColorOS 15, based on Android 15, delivering a polished software experience with modern features and optimisation. Durability is another highlight, as the device boasts IP66, IP68, and IP69 certifications, making it dustproof and resistant to various water exposure conditions. In terms of pricing, the Reno 13 series starts at CNY 2,699 (approximately Rs 31,400) in China. While the official India pricing remains undisclosed, considering the Reno 12 launched at Rs 32,999 in India, the Reno 13 is likely to be priced in a similar range upon its Indian debut.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Oppo Reno 12 Pro review: It makes premium AI experience more accessibleAlso read |  Sriram in White House, Trump supporters demand ban on H1-B Visa and fewer Indians in Silicon ValleyAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim vs Apple iPhone 17 Air: All we know about the 2 most exciting phones of 2025

The company has a track record of introducing new budget or mid-range phones at the start of the year to give users better options. Although, Xiaomi has seemingly changed its strategy for a few smartphones. Why am I saying that? Well, the Redmi Note 14, which should have been announced in January 2025 like the previous model, debuted a month before in December 2024. Similarly, the successor to the Redmi A3 also arrived one month early. It's not just Xiaomi, several brands are racing to churn out new phones faster than their expected launch timelines to give consumers new options before others. However, this doesn't seem to be working for them because many of them are doing the same, something that we saw with flagship phones. The Vivo X200 Pro, Oppo Find X8 Pro, Realme GT 7 Pro, OnePlus 13 (only in China) and iQOO 13 debuted at the end of 2024. Coming back to the Redmi 14C, this will be a successor to the Redmi 13C, which made its debut in December last year. Xiaomi has just started teasing this product and hasn't confirmed the launch date. But since it has started teasing it and only a few days are left for 2024 to end, the budget Redmi 14C smartphone is likely coming in January 2025. The teaser suggests that the Redmi 14C will have a design similar to the Redmi A4, which is fine because this entry-level phone looks stunning. Its premium design can make anyone feel that this could be a mid-range premium device. It has a circular camera module at the back, including multiple sensors. But, the Redmi 14C will seemingly be available in a new blue hue, which looks quite attractive in teasers. It is believed that the new Redmi 14C will be a rebranded version of the recently launched Redmi 14R. So, we know its possible specifications. The Redmi 14C could be powered by a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 SoC and a 5,160mAh battery with support for 18W wired charging. It is reported to come with a massive 6.68-inch HD+ LCD screen with support for 120Hz refresh rate and 600nits of peak brightness. At the back, we might see a 13-megapixel dual rear camera setup. The new Redmi budget phone is expected to be priced under Rs 15,000 in India. You can stay tuned to India Today Tech to get all the latest updates.

Set to launch on January 22, 2025, leaks and rumours suggest that Samsung has focused on delivering meaningful upgrades to the Galaxy S25 vanilla variant, making it a solid choice for those seeking a powerful yet compact flagship device. However, it’s also important to consider its predecessor models, the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23, especially when price and value are key factors.advertisementSamsung Galaxy S25: Everything we know so farThe Galaxy S25 is rumoured to feature a similar design approach we are already accustomed to for that compact feel, making it more comfortable to hold and use daily. The display is expected to remain a dynamic AMOLED panel, likely around 6.3 inches. However, improvements in brightness levels and colour accuracy could make this screen one of the best in its class. Samsung has always been a leader in display technology, and it seems the Galaxy S25 will continue that trend. Performance is another area where the Galaxy S25 is expected to shine. Rumours suggest it will be powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The phone is expected to feature 12GB of RAM from the base version, which will again be a first for a vanilla Galaxy S phone. Battery life on the Galaxy S25 is another aspect to watch out for. While leaks suggest that it will feature a 4,000mAh battery like its predecessor, the more efficient chipset and optimised software could result in better overall performance.

In terms of cameras, the Galaxy S25 might once again include a triple-camera setup, headlined by a 50MP main sensor. The addition of improved AI processing for photos and videos could also enhance the overall experience. The front-facing camera is rumoured to be upgraded as well.Samsung Galaxy S24, Galaxy S23: Should you buy? Considering the aforementioned points, the Galaxy S25 seems like a fantastic upgrade in many ways. If Samsung takes a similar route in terms of pricing as the Galaxy S24, expect the S25 to launch in India at around Rs 80,000. Now, as good as the Galaxy S25 would be, this higher price point does put it out of reach for many consumers.  Fortunately, Samsung’s last-generation flagship models, the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23, offer excellent alternatives at much more affordable prices. The Galaxy S24, for example, is currently available for 50,999 online on Amazon. For those on an even tighter budget, the Galaxy S23 can be purchased for just Rs 37,999 on Flipkart, making it an incredible deal for a premium smartphone. The Galaxy S24, despite being almost a year old, still provides top-tier performance with its Exynos 2400 processor and a versatile camera system. It also features a gorgeous AMOLED display, similar in size and quality to the one expected in the S25. These similarities make the S24 an excellent choice for those who don’t need the very latest hardware but still want a modern and capable device. For budget-conscious buyers, the Galaxy S23 is even more appealing. At about Rs 38,000, it offers fantastic value with its compact 6.1-inch design, relatively powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, and dependable cameras. While it may lack some of the refinements found in the S25, it remains a solid choice for users who prioritise performance and reliability over having the absolute latest technology. Another key advantage of choosing the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S23 is their availability. As these models have been on the market for a while, they are widely supported by software updates, and accessories like cases and screen protectors are readily available at discounted prices. Additionally, the more established presence of these devices means that any software or hardware bugs have likely been resolved, providing a more stable user experience. The Rs 50,999 price of the Galaxy S24 on Amazon and the Rs 37,999 price of the Galaxy S23 on Flipkart make these models far more accessible while still delivering excellent performance and features.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

First introduced at the beginning of 2024 alongside the Galaxy S24 series, Circle to Search has quickly become one of Android’s most useful features. Initially, it was exclusive to select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy flagship phones. However, after about eight months, Google expanded its availability to other brands, including Xiaomi, Oppo, and Motorola. Now, Nothing has joined the list, bringing the feature to its smartphones. In a community post, Nothing shared that Circle to Search is now available on the Phone 2, Phone 2a, and Phone 2a Plus. These devices must be running Nothing OS 3.0, which is based on Android 15. The company explained that the feature wasn’t included in the initial release of Nothing OS 3.0 because it required additional testing.

 To use Circle to Search on Nothing phones, you’ll need to enable it first. Head to Settings > Special features > Gestures > Navigation mode > Circle to Search. If you don’t see the option right away, Nothing suggests rebooting your phone and trying again. The feature works with both gesture navigation and the traditional 3-button navigation, so you can use it no matter how you’ve set up your phone’s interface. Circle to Search is a simple but powerful tool. It lets you search for anything on your screen by drawing a circle around it. Whether it’s an image, text, or even a location, you can quickly get more information without having to copy and paste anything into Google Lens. This makes searching easier and faster for everyday tasks. For instance, you can use Circle to Search to look up a word’s meaning, translate text from an image, find details about a place, or even get directions. Google has also been improving Circle to Search since its launch. One of the latest updates added the ability to search for songs, making it even more useful. There are hints that Google is working on more upgrades, like enabling Circle to Search within videos. As for Nothing’s other devices, the company noted that Circle to Search will roll out to them once they receive the Android 15-based Nothing OS 3.0 update. This includes Phone 2a models sold in Japan and possibly the CMF Phone 1, which should also get the feature with its stable Android 15 release.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

While the standard and Pro models are now available globally, the tech community is buzzing with rumours about the upcoming Vivo X200 Ultra. According to fresh leaks, this high-end Ultra variant could debut in China in April 2025, with a slight possibility of arriving as early as March, according to tipster Digital Chat Station (DCS). However, for those wondering whether the Ultra model will be launched in India, the chances appear slim. The Vivo X200 Ultra model may not make it to India, much like its predecessor, the Vivo X100 Ultra, which never reached global markets. Noted tipster Yogesh Brar has further fuelled speculation by stating that the X200 Ultra isn’t expected to expand beyond China. However, we believe that if sales of the existing X200 series see an unexpected surge, it could force a strategic rethink by Vivo. However, it mostly seems that Indian consumers may have to settle for the standard and Pro models without the Ultra in the lineup. As for the features of the Vivo X200 Ultra, early leaks suggest that the device could offer a camera setup similar to the Vivo X200 Pro. Reports hint at a 50-megapixel primary sensor, a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto lens. While this configuration mirrors the Pro model, there are whispers that the Ultra could bring subtle upgrades, including larger apertures. We might also see it offering 5x optical image stabilisation (OIS) like the iPhone 16 Pro, but nothing is confirmed.  When it comes to video capabilities, the Ultra model is tipped to support 4K video recording at 120fps, like the Pro model. Under the hood, the Vivo X200 Ultra is tipped to be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, in contrast to the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chip found in the Pro model. We have already tested the devices that are using the same chipsets and their benchmark results have shown that the Snapdragon chip offers slightly better performance and efficiency compared to the MediaTek.  The Ultra may also feature a 2K display, a slight upgrade over the Pro’s 1.5K panel. As for battery life, rumours suggest a 6,000mAh battery with 100W fast charging, slightly faster than the Pro’s 90W charging support. For reference, the Vivo X200 currently retails at Rs 64,999, while the Pro version is priced at Rs 94,999. Whether the Ultra model will bring enough new features to justify a higher price remains to be seen. With the launch still a few months away, more details will likely emerge in the coming weeks. However, Indian consumers may have to watch from afar as the Ultra remains exclusive to the Chinese market, unless Vivo surprises with a broader release strategy.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

Alongside the regular Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and the top-end Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to stand out with a thinner and more compact design. While we wait for Samsung’s official announcement at the Galaxy Unpacked event, rumoured to be on January 22, 2025, a new leak sheds light on what makes the Galaxy S25 Slim unique. Reportedly, the Galaxy S25 Slim might use Samsung's latest ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) technology for its telephoto camera. This tech was recently announced by Samsung Semiconductor and promises to make smartphones thinner without sacrificing image quality. According to tipster Jukanlosreve on X, citing Meritz Securities, ALoP could be the key to giving the Galaxy S25 Slim its sleek profile while still packing a punch in the camera department.

 So, what exactly is ALoP? In simple terms, it’s a clever design for telephoto cameras that helps reduce the size of the camera module. Traditional telephoto cameras use folded optics, which can be bulky and lead to large camera bumps on the back of phones. ALoP solves this by positioning the telephoto lens flat, along the plane of the phone, and using a 40-degree tilted prism with a 10-degree tilted sensor. This setup not only shortens the camera’s length by about 22 per cent compared to older designs but is also capable of capturing sharp images. Thanks to the ALoP tech, the Galaxy S25 Slim could feature a much smaller camera bump while maintaining great zoom capabilities. The phone is rumoured to include a periscope telephoto lens with 3.5x optical zoom, a 200-megapixel ISOCELL HP5 main sensor, and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera. That’s impressive for a device that’s rumoured to come with a 6.66-inch display.  Interestingly, it looks like the Galaxy S25 Slim will have some features that even the standard Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+ won’t include, such as the advanced telephoto camera. However, all four models in the lineup are expected to debut at the same time, with rumours suggesting that the pre-orders will start on January 24, 2025, with the sales kicking off on February 4, 2025. We’ll have to wait for Samsung’s official reveal to know for sure what exactly the Galaxy S25 Slim is going to be, come January.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The controversy gained traction earlier this week following Indian-American venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan's appointment as Senior Policy Advisor for AI in Trump’s administration, sparking accusations from far-right figures that the move undermines the ""America First"" agenda. While some blame immigration policies for displacing American workers, entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has offered a different perspective: the issue lies not with immigration but with American culture itself.   Ramaswamy took to X (formerly Twitter) with a bold critique of what he sees as America’s systemic failure to foster excellence among its youth. In his post, he argued that top tech companies hire foreign-born and first-generation engineers not because Americans lack innate talent but because American culture prioritises mediocrity over excellence.

— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) December 26, 2024 “Normalcy doesn’t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent,” Ramaswamy tweeted. He pointed to the cultural glorification of prom queens and jocks over math prodigies and valedictorians as a fundamental flaw in American society.   In a long-form post, Ramaswamy has primarily highlighted the broader concern about the cultural upbringing of American children. He juxtaposed the values of immigrant families, who often emphasise academic rigor, discipline, and achievement, with what he described as the “normalcy” celebrated by mainstream American culture.   Citing examples from popular 90s TV shows like Boy Meets World and Saved by the Bell, Ramaswamy highlighted how American media has long idolised the charming but average protagonist while relegating the “nerdy” characters to comic relief. “A culture that venerates Cory from ‘Boy Meets World,’ or Zach & Slater over Screech in ‘Saved by the Bell,’ will not produce the best engineers,” he wrote.   Immigrant families, he noted, often avoided such cultural distractions. Many imposed strict limits on television and social outings, encouraging their children to focus on math competitions, science projects, and other intellectually enriching activities. The results, Ramaswamy argued, speak for themselves — these children often grew up to become leaders in STEM fields.  MAGA is furious Of course, Vivek Ramaswamy’s post offended a lot of Americans. Many took issue with Ramaswamy’s framing of the issue as cultural rather than systemic. Some have also condemned his remarks as dismissive of American workers and overly sympathetic to H-1B visa holders.  One recurring argument was the prevalence of fraud and manipulation within the H-1B visa system. Some commenters claimed that unqualified individuals (from India) with fake credentials often secure jobs in the US, posing significant risks to national security. “It’s an incentive in India to issue fake education documents to acquire US jobs,” one user wrote. 
 


 Some have pointed out that relying on foreign workers undermines the accomplishments of past American generations, such as those who propelled the US to the moon or built its aerospace industry, achievements made long before the influx of H-1B workers.  
 


 Others call out the economic realities behind hiring preferences, asserting that companies favour foreign workers not because of cultural excellence but due to cost advantages. Temporary visa holders, they argued, are often paid less and subjected to exploitative conditions, with their residency tied to employment. This creates a power imbalance, enabling corporations to suppress wages and control working conditions, which harms both American and foreign workers.   However, at large, Ramaswamy’s dichotomy between excellence and normalcy drew sharp criticism. “Framing success as requiring the abandonment of social experiences or leisure is damaging,” one commenter noted, emphasising that balance and well-being are crucial to sustainable achievement. They argue that immigrant families’ focus on academic rigour, while admirable, represents only one path to success and shouldn’t be seen as the gold standard for all.

— Alb (@amandalouise416) December 26, 2024 Perhaps the harshest criticism accused Ramaswamy of bias, with some alleging that his comments were designed to defend a system that disproportionately benefits individuals from his own ethnic background. “This is all I needed to read to understand Vivek is defending the system that promotes more of his people coming to America,” one critic remarked.   The backlash underscores the deep divisions surrounding the H1-B visa debate. While Ramaswamy intended to spark introspection about cultural values, many Americans interpreted his post as an attack on their way of life and a defence of exploitative labour practices. For a nation grappling with questions of identity, fairness, and global competitiveness, his remarks have struck a nerve that is unlikely to calm anytime soon.The H-1B debate Ramaswamy’s critique arrives amidst a heated debate over the H-1B visa program. MAGA supporters argue that the program allows companies to prioritise cheaper, foreign talent over domestic workers, undermining American job security. Conservative activist Laura Loomer has been particularly vocal, accusing Sriram Krishnan, senior policy advisor for Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the White House, of betraying Trump’s “America First” policy by advocating for reforms to green card backlogs that disproportionately benefit Indian workers.   On the other hand, advocates for high-skilled immigration, including Silicon Valley leaders, argue that attracting top global talent is essential for maintaining America’s competitive edge. Ramaswamy aligns with this view but takes it a step further by urging Americans to focus on cultivating their own homegrown talent.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also read |  Sriram in White House, Trump supporters demand ban on H1-B Visa and fewer Indians in Silicon ValleyAlso read |  What is the Qualcomm vs Arm battle that could have huge implications on future laptops, phonesAlso read |  Ahead of Donald Trump taking charge, tech CEOs from Cook to Zuckerberg lineup at his residence for dinner

Performance-wise, the iPhone 16 Pro surpasses even flagship Android phones powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. If you’re into gaming, this phone handles high-demand titles like Genshin Impact at 60fps on high settings smoothly —something most Androids still struggle with. The iPhone 16 Pro is powered by Apple’s A18 Pro chipset, built on second-gen 3nm fabrication process. Apple claims the A18 Pro’s 6-core GPU is 20 per cent faster than the A17 Pro. It also includes next-gen machine learning capabilities, faster USB 3 speeds, and ProRes video recording. Battery life has seen a slight improvement, with the phone comfortably lasting a full day with average use. When it comes to videography and photography, iPhones are known for their quality, and the 16 Pro doesn’t disappoint. The standard iPhone 16 offers average photography, but if you're after top-notch camera performance, the 16 Pro is a better option. It boasts a triple rear camera setup, including a new 48MP main camera with a second-gen quad-pixel sensor, which eliminates shutter lag in 48MP ProRAW and HEIF photos. The cameras support 4K120 video capture, delivering crisp clarity, natural colours, and excellent audio. The ultra-wide camera has been upgraded to 48MP with autofocus, and the third sensor is a 12MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom and a 120mm focal length. It’s worth noting that the iPhone 15 Pro doesn’t offer 5x optical zoom, but the 16 Pro does. Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro brings meaningful upgrades across performance, display, and camera capabilities, making it a solid choice for those who want the best from Apple.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

The 128GB base version of the iPhone 15, originally priced at Rs 69,900, is now available for Rs 59,999 on Flipkart. That's a flat Rs 9,901 discount, making it one of the most attractive prices for Apple’s last-generation standard flagship model. But wait, there’s more. If you’re a fan of the green colour variant, Flipkart is offering it at an even lower price of Rs 58,999. That’s an extra Rs 1,000 off for those who don’t mind picking a specific colour. Also, if you're planning to exchange your old phone, you could save even more. Flipkart’s exchange program offers up to Rs 56,500 off depending on the device you trade in. Here are some examples to give you an idea of the savings you could enjoy:
— If you exchange an old iPhone 12, you can get up to Rs 22,700 off.
— If you trade in an old Samsung Galaxy S22, you can get up to Rs 20,300 off.
This means that with the right exchange, you could bring down the effective price of the iPhone 15 to almost half its original cost. That’s a huge steal for anyone looking to upgrade to a new iPhone.iPhone 15: Should you buy it? Now that you know about the deal, the big question is: should you buy the iPhone 15 right now? Well, the iPhone 15 is equipped with Apple’s A16 Bionic chip, which offers top-notch performance. Whether you’re gaming, editing reels, or just browsing, this phone delivers a smooth experience. It also comes with a bright and vibrant OLED display that’s great for watching content. Apart from this, the iPhone 15 features a 48-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, which captures stunning photos and videos, even in low light. If you’re someone who loves photography, this phone will not disappoint at this price. The iPhone 15 was also the first iPhone when Apple adopted the USB-C port for charging, which is more universal and convenient. This might not sound like a big deal, but for people tired of carrying multiple cables, this was a game-changer. Moreover, the iPhone 15 has a premium build with Ceramic Shield glass, making it more resistant to drops and scratches. Plus, it’s lightweight and comes in a range of colours to suit your style. However, here’s the main reason why this deal makes so much sense. The iPhone 16, which offers more or less the same user experience, minus Apple Intelligence, retails for Rs 79,900. If you don’t really need Apple Intelligence, you are better off with the iPhone 15. Unless you’re someone who always wants the absolute latest tech, the iPhone 15 at this discounted price offers great value for money.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The new regulation, designed to reduce e-waste and simplify charging for consumers, requires phones, tablets, cameras, and other electronic devices sold in the EU to feature USB-C ports.   The move spells the end of proprietary charging standards in the region, forcing even giants like Apple to adapt. While most Android smartphones have embraced USB-C in recent years, Apple’s transition has been more gradual. The tech giant introduced USB-C ports with the iPhone 15 series in 2023, but older models, such as the iPhone 14 and the iPhone SE (3rd generation), retained the now-outdated Lightning connector.  advertisementApple discontinues iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in the EUTo comply with the EU’s new rules, Apple has discontinued the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in the region, as these models feature the lightning port. While they remain available through third-party sellers until stocks last, the regulation prohibits brands from selling non-USB-C products directly. Outside the EU, including major markets like the United States, India, and China, these models continue to be available for purchase.   To comply with the EU’s new rules, Apple has discontinued the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in the region, as these models feature the lightning port. While they remain available through third-party sellers until stocks last, the regulation prohibits brands from selling non-USB-C products directly. Outside the EU, including major markets like the United States, India, and China, these models continue to be available for purchase.   Apple’s decision aligns with its broader strategy to phase out the lightning port in favour of USB-C, a transition expected to culminate in the launch of a USB-C-equipped iPhone SE in early 2025. This move not only adheres to regulatory demands but also addresses consumer expectations for streamlined charging solutions.  One charger to rule them all The European Commission (EC) celebrated the enforcement of this regulation with a playful yet impactful tweet, highlighting the benefits of having a common charging standard for all devices. “Today’s the day! USB-C is officially the common standard for electronic devices in the EU! It means: The same charger for all new phones, tablets & cameras; Harmonised fast-charging; Reduced e-waste; No more ‘Sorry, I don’t have that cable,” EC’s post on X reads.   
 


The law aims to alleviate the frustration of juggling multiple chargers while addressing the growing environmental concerns posed by e-waste. By standardising charging technology, the EU expects to simplify consumer choices and extend the lifecycle of accessories like cables and adapters.  A global shift in the making?

By standardising charging technology, the EU expects to simplify consumer choices and extend the lifecycle of accessories like cables and adapters.  A global shift in the making? Although the regulation currently applies only within the EU, its impact resonates globally. With USB-C becoming the universal standard in Europe, manufacturers may increasingly adopt the technology across all regions to streamline production and meet consumer demand.   For Apple, the EU’s push accelerates its broader shift toward USB-C, ensuring compliance and future-proofing its product lineup. As other countries watch the EU’s progress, the USB-C revolution might just become the global standard for electronics, leaving tangled cables and mismatched chargers in the dustbin of history.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Sriram in White House, Trump supporters demand ban on H1-B Visa and fewer Indians in Silicon ValleyAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim vs Apple iPhone 17 Air: All we know about the 2 most exciting phones of 2025Also read |  What is the Qualcomm vs Arm battle that could have huge implications on future laptops, phones

Of course, it’s not the iPhone 17. For that, we’ll have to wait another nine months until September 2025. Instead, Apple’s next big release will be the iPhone SE 4, and it’s expected to launch as early as next spring, just three months from now. This will be a big moment for the iPhone SE series. The upcoming model will be the first update in three years and promises the biggest changes the lineup has seen since its debut. Here’s everything we know so far about the iPhone SE 4 and the top five upgrades it will likely bring.advertisementA newer design and a bigger, better displayFor about three years, the iPhone SE has stuck to the older iPhone 8 design, i.e., a 4.7-inch LCD screen, rounded edges, and a home button. But that’s about to change. The iPhone SE 4 is expected to adopt the look of the iPhone 14. This means a larger 6.1-inch OLED display with flat edges and a smaller notch. It’ll also drop the home button in favour of Face ID, giving the SE a more modern feel. While it won’t have the dual cameras of the iPhone 14, it will still feature a single rear camera. According to display expert Ross Young, Apple will use the same OLED screen as the iPhone 14, supplied by BOE and LG Display.Apple Intelligence featuresOne of the more surprising upgrades could be the inclusion of Apple Intelligence. This also suggests that the iPhone SE 4 will be powered by the A18 chipset paired with at least 8GB RAM, which is also the same configuration used in the iPhone 16.  With the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, advanced features like Writing Tools, Genmoji, Photos Clean Up, and the all-new Siri, will come for the first time to the iPhone SE lineup.Switching to USB-C For about three years, the iPhone SE has stuck to the older iPhone 8 design, i.e., a 4.7-inch LCD screen, rounded edges, and a home button.

With the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, advanced features like Writing Tools, Genmoji, Photos Clean Up, and the all-new Siri, will come for the first time to the iPhone SE lineup.Switching to USB-C One of the more practical changes coming to the iPhone SE 4 is the move to USB-C. Apple has already made the switch to USB-C with the iPhone 15 lineup in 2023, and now it’s the SE’s turn. This change is largely driven by European Union regulations, which require all devices with charging ports to use a unified connector. For SE users, this means you’ll finally be able to charge your iPhone with the same cable you use for your iPad or MacBook.Big camera upgrades The camera system on the iPhone SE 4 is expected to get a major boost. Reports suggest it will feature the same 48-megapixel rear camera found on the iPhone 15, which is a big leap from the current model’s 12-megapixel sensor. The front-facing camera is also set for an upgrade, jumping to a 12-megapixel sensor, up from the 7-megapixel camera on the iPhone SE 3. These improvements should make a noticeable difference for both casual photos and selfies.Apple’s first in-house modem Finally, the iPhone SE 4 is also expected to be the first to include Apple’s in-house modem, which has been in development for years. Codenamed Centauri, this modem will handle 5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. This is a big move for Apple, as it allows them to reduce reliance on Qualcomm’s expensive modems. Not only does this help lower production costs, but it also gives Apple more control over its hardware.Price and availability Rumours suggest the iPhone SE 4 might cost a bit more than its predecessor, possibly starting at $499 (around Rs 47,000). While this is a price increase, it’s still a great deal for what’s essentially a modernised version of the iPhone 14. For reference, Apple currently sells the iPhone 14 for Rs 59,900 in India, though during sales and offers, you can find it for around Rs 45,000 to Rs 50,000. If the SE 4 is priced at $499 and considering Apple’s usual pricing approach of $1 equalling Rs 100, the iPhone SE 4 could start at Rs 49,900 in India. This would make it a great choice for those looking for an updated iPhone at a more affordable price. Apple is also expected to discontinue the iPhone 14 once the SE 4 is launched, giving budget-conscious buyers another reason to pick the SE.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

The Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to arrive months later than the rest. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-expected-to-arrive-later-than-the-rest-of-the-series-2657077-2024-12-30,"As Samsung gears up to release its flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S25, rumour has it that the series will bring a new entry -- the Galaxy S25 Slim. As the name suggests, the company is speculated to be focusing on the sleek and slim design language. Based on the current leaks, this variant will be competing with the iPhone 17 Air. However, the Samsung's Slim will take its sweet time to enter the market.  The Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim will not be launched on the same day as the others. The expected launch date of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is January 22 and a new report supports this claim, based on Samsung's latest One UI 7 beta. The beta includes a list of US carrier-specific Samsung phone models, but the Galaxy S25 Slim's model number is notably absent. This suggests that the Slim won’t be part of the initial wave of devices launching with One UI 7 based on Android 15. Earlier rumours indicated that the S25 Slim would debut in the second quarter of next year (between April and June), which aligns with the findings in One UI 7.Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim: Leaks and rumours  While Samsung has traditionally leaned into larger, high-performance models, the Slim variant is anticipated to appeal to users who prefer a more manageable form factor without compromising on high-end specs. The device could sport a thinner profile, possibly under 7mm, making it one of the most pocket-friendly premium smartphones on the market. One of the standout features of the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to be its impressive 4,700 to 5,000mAh battery, a remarkable achievement for a phone with its slim profile. Reports suggest that Samsung may be utilising advanced silicon-carbon anode battery technology, similar to the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro, allowing for extended battery life without sacrificing the device's sleek design. In terms of performance, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, ensuring top-tier processing power. The device is also likely to feature a 6.66-inch display, positioning it similarly to the Galaxy S24+ in terms of screen size. On the camera front, the S25 Slim may come equipped with a 200-megapixel HP5 primary sensor, paired with a 50-megapixel ultrawide lens and a 50-megapixel 3.5x telephoto camera, promising impressive photographic capabilities. According to reports, the Galaxy S25 Slim could feature Samsung's new ALoP (All Lenses on Prism) technology for its telephoto camera. Recently introduced by Samsung Semiconductor, this innovation is designed to allow smartphones to maintain a slim form factor without compromising on image quality. A recent tip suggests that ALoP could be the key to achieving the Galaxy S25 Slim's sleek design while still delivering powerful camera performance.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

Finally, it seems like the wait might be coming to an end. Reports suggest that Apple is working on two foldable devices — a clamshell-style iPhone and a large 20-inch foldable iPad. Of the two, the foldable iPhone is likely to hit the market first, and it’s already generating plenty of buzz and curiosity. Apple’s first foldable iPhone is expected to have a clamshell design, much like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola’s Razr. It will feature a standard-sized smartphone screen that folds inward, making it compact and easy to carry around. But there’s more to it. According to recent leaks, this foldable iPhone will actually offer a screen larger than the current iPhone 16 Pro Max. This could mean a display size of at least 7 inches, giving users plenty of room to enjoy their apps, games, and videos without sacrificing portability. The Wall Street Journal recently shared some insights into Apple’s plans. The company is also developing a larger foldable device, a 20-inch foldable iPad. This product is being designed to double as a laptop, with a screen size that rivals some desktop monitors. While the foldable iPad is an exciting concept, the smaller foldable iPhone is expected to be Apple’s first release in this category, and the company seems to be putting a lot of effort into getting it right. Developing foldable technology hasn’t been easy for Apple. Challenges like reducing the visibility of creases on the screen, designing durable hinges, and finding the right materials for the display have all slowed progress. However, Apple’s commitment to quality means the company is determined to tackle these issues before releasing its product. They’re not rushing it, and that’s likely a good thing for consumers who expect nothing but the best from the brand. Interestingly, Apple’s move into the foldable market could shake things up. While foldable phones have been growing in popularity, the market is showing signs of slowing down. According to Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), the foldable smartphone market grew by an impressive 40 per cent annually from 2019 to 2023. However, growth is expected to drop to just 5 per cent in 2024, with a decline of 4 per cent projected for 2025. Demand has levelled off at around 22 million units per year. That’s where Apple could make a difference. Many people love the idea of foldable phones like the Galaxy Z Flip but hesitate to switch from their trusted iPhones. Experts believe Apple’s brand power and loyalty along with its reputation for innovation might be just what the foldable segment needs to get back on track. As for when we’ll see this new iPhone, sources suggest a release in the second half of 2026. It’s likely to launch alongside the iPhone 18 lineup, provided there are no further delays. Reports also mention that Apple has given the project a codename, V68, which indicates that development has progressed beyond the early stages.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

A floating “Play something” button has been spotted in the YouTube app for Android, as reported by 9to5Google. This button sits just above the bottom navigation bar in the app and works as a random video picker. When you tap it, YouTube selects a video for you to watch. This isn’t the first time YouTube has experimented with this idea. Over the past year, the platform has tested different versions of the Play something feature. Previous versions included a banner with the same name and a simpler black-and-white button resembling the YouTube logo. Now, YouTube seems to be focusing on a more prominent floating button. Interestingly, the Play something button in its current form uses the YouTube Shorts player to show videos. This is the same player designed for portrait-oriented Shorts videos. However, it doesn’t just stick to Shorts, it also plays standard YouTube videos. The only catch is that all videos — whether Shorts or standard, are displayed in the vertical Shorts player format. Some users may find this odd, especially for regular videos that aren’t meant to be viewed vertically. Hopefully, YouTube will address this before rolling the feature out in a wider release. If the name Play something sounds familiar, it might remind you of Netflix’s Surprise Me feature. Netflix originally launched it as a similar feature to YouTube’s Play something in 2021, but the streaming service retired the feature last year. Both features serve a similar purpose — helping users quickly find something to watch without scrolling endlessly through options. YouTube’s Play something button could be especially helpful for people who want to discover new content or just can’t decide what to watch. It’s similar to flipping through TV channels back in the day, letting you stumble upon something interesting by chance. For creators, it could also mean more visibility for their videos, as the feature randomly showcases content from YouTube’s vast library.  While the idea is promising, some things still need tweaking. For instance, the Shorts player’s vertical format may not be the best fit for standard YouTube videos. A mix of formats that adapt to the type of content being played would likely make the feature more appealing. YouTube hasn’t announced when or if this feature will become widely available. For now, it’s just another experiment in the app’s ongoing evolution.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Previous leaks suggest that this series will debut with a new design pattern. However, a new rumour sheds light that the Pro model might follow the OG design pattern. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-17-pro-design-rumours-divided-over-design-will-it-follow-a-new-pattern-2657147-2024-12-30,"A recent leak indicates that there are still chances that the iPhone 17 Pro might not undergo a design change like the standard iPhone 17 variant. Based on previous leaks, the iPhone 17 series has been speculated to follow a new design language. It is thought that the upcoming Apple flagship model (which might debut in September 2025) will do away with the traditional rear panel and will bring a Google Pixel-like rectangular camera bump. While it could be true for the iPhone 17 variant, the Pro models might not be tweaked that much.  The iPhone 17 model is anticipated to debut with a vertical camera setup, but the iPhone 17 Pro might stick to its triangular one. Take a look at the rendered images of the iPhone 17 Pro. 
 


 But even with the new leak, the rear panel is anticipated to be revamped, staying true to the previous rumours. The iPhone 17 series is also expected to take a design shift from titanium to aluminium and might debut with a dual-tone rear panel. The move to aluminium could result in a lighter device, potentially enhancing user comfort during prolonged use. Additionally, aluminium is generally more cost-effective than titanium, which might influence the device's pricing strategy. iPhone 17 Pro: Leaked specs The upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are set to include Apple’s next-generation A19 Pro chip, built using TSMC’s cutting-edge third-generation 3nm technology. This upgrade is anticipated to bring improved power efficiency and incremental performance boosts over current iPhone models. Furthermore, one version of the iPhone 17 is rumoured to debut an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, replacing the Broadcom components used in previous iterations.   Both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are expected to feature 12GB of RAM, a specification previously thought to be exclusive to the Pro Max. This memory upgrade, compared to the 8GB found in all four iPhone 16 models, promises enhanced multitasking capabilities and improved support for Apple’s advanced AI features. The added RAM is likely to deliver smoother performance across the board, making it a standout improvement for the Pro lineup.   Camera upgrades also take center stage in the iPhone 17 series. All models are rumoured to feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, a significant jump from the 12-megapixel resolution on the iPhone 16 lineup. For the Pro models, the Telephoto camera is expected to receive a substantial boost to 48 megapixels, a marked improvement over the 12-megapixel Telephoto lens on the iPhone 16 Pro. These enhancements aim to elevate both front and rear photography, offering sharper images and greater versatility.   Another notable design change is a smaller Dynamic Island, achieved by integrating a metalens into the Face ID system. This innovation would increase the screen-to-body ratio, providing a more immersive display experience. Altogether, the iPhone 17 Pro lineup is shaping up to deliver substantial upgrades in performance, memory, camera capabilities, and design, setting a new benchmark for Apple’s flagship devices.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also read |  Apple discontinues iPhone SE and iPhone 14 as EU officially adopts USB-C as universal charging standardAlso read |  iPhone SE 4 said to launch soon, likely to get 5 big upgradesAlso read |  iPhone 18 Fold leaks: When is Apple's first foldable phone coming?

However, a new feature in iOS 18 has raised concerns about how the tech giant handles user information, especially when it comes to photos. A fresh report by developer Jeff Johnson has revealed that iPhones and Macs running iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia are sharing photo data with Apple by default, potentially without users' explicit consent. India Today Tech also verified this and found it to be correct. The feature in question is ""Enhanced Visual Search,"" which Apple has automatically enabled in the latest software updates. This functionality allows users to get more detailed information about landmarks in their photos, but it also means that certain data from those images is shared with Apple for processing. What is Enhanced Visual Search? The feature uses machine learning to analyse images and detect landmarks. For example, if you take a picture of a famous monument or building, the system scans the photo to identify regions that may contain some landmarks. Once a potential landmark is detected, the device creates a vector embedding, a digital representation of the image's characteristics. This embedding is then encrypted and sent to Apple's servers, where it is compared with a global database to identify the landmark, according to the developer. So, what is the need for this feature? It is basically designed to improve the Photos app experience, allowing users to look up information about landmarks they've captured easily. Users can see its name and other related details by swiping up a photo of a recognisable building. The idea is to provide more context about the places in your photos, making them searchable within the app.
 


How serious is this matter? Despite Apple’s efforts to anonymise data through on-device processing and encrypted vector embeddings, the automatic sharing of photo data with Apple raises privacy concerns. Although the data sent to Apple is claimed to be anonymised, the fact that this feature is enabled by default means users may unknowingly share information. While this may not be a serious concern for everyone, there might be users out there who might not be comfortable with this feature. The vector embeddings — condensed digital representations of images — are sent to Apple’s servers for comparison with its database. In a machine learning research blogpost, Apple suggests that the data is not personally identifiable, but this still involves transmitting image data to the company. This raises questions of whether Apple’s privacy practices align with users' expectations of control over personal information. Apple’s technical explanations may be difficult for the average user to understand, and the fact that users must opt-out rather than opt-in highlights a lack of transparency in the company's approach to privacy.How to disable this feature on iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia For those concerned about their photo data being shared with Apple, disabling this feature is possible. If your iPhone is running iOS 18 version, you can go to Settings, Scroll down and tap on Apps. Now, select Photos, Scroll to the bottom and turn off Enhanced Visual Search. If your Mac is running on the macOS Sequoia version, then you need to visit the Photos app, and Settings and disable the ""Enhanced Visual Search"" feature.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 30, 2024

And with so many people using the app, every now and then, people face issues with it. However, in places like India particularly, we are used to picking up calls on customer care in case of an issue with a device, gadget or any appliance we own. If your Blinkit order doesn’t get delivered in 8 minutes, we like to pick the phone and enquire about every detail. But what happens if you face a problem with WhatsApp? The only choice you have is to Google and see if someone else on the internet found a solution to your problem. It’s not the best way out, and not the most convenient either. But things may change soon.  A WABetaInfo report claims that WhatsApp is working on a new feature which will bring access to human support on the web app. The blog claims that WhatsApp is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to shorten response times and deliver a more tailored and efficient customer support experience. The platform is basically experimenting with ways to provide users with direct access to the support team, making it easier and more seamless to address their concerns. Currently, the mobile app offers no way to contact customer care. There is only a Help Centre with some frequently asked questions (FAQs) in case they address your issue. On the web app, however, there is still no way to interact with a human agent to get an issue resolved, but there is the Contact Us option, which lets you send WhatsApp your issues. You can choose to send it via an in-app chat box or via email, accordingly someone from WhatsApp will reach out to you either through a WhatsApp chat, or via email. Many times, this chat is actually with an AI agent.  However, with the new WhatsApp feature coming in, contacting with a human agent will be an additional layer added to the WhatsApp support.

ec98b33d-dd5d-4ea7-8904-6fd398c29420,"Vivek Ramaswamy is an American-Indian that Trump supporters love to hate Vivek Ramaswamy, once a MAGA favourite, now faces backlash after a tweet on American parenting ignites fierce debates on culture, immigration, and American values.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/talking-points/story/maga-darling-a-month-ago-vivek-ramaswamy-now-an-american-indian-trump-supporters-love-to-hate-2657276-2024-12-30,"In the volatile world of American politics, the tides of admiration can shift dramatically. Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and 2024 presidential candidate, has seen this firsthand. Just a month ago, he was a rising star within MAGA circles, celebrated for his alignments with conservative values, his critique of the “woke” culture, his advocacy for national sovereignty, among other things. But today, he finds himself at the centre of a growing backlash, accused by some of being unpatriotic, divisive, and even complicit in undermining American workers. The tipping point? A single tweet that sparked a firestorm of debates about parenting, culture, and immigration.A month ago Ramaswamy’s ascent in the MAGA universe was swift and, at first glance, unstoppable. As a self-made entrepreneur with a knack for headline-grabbing rhetoric, he seemed to embody the American Dream that Trump supporters revere. His critiques of “woke” culture and Big Tech resonated with a base hungry for intellectual firepower to back their grievances.  Then came his now-infamous tweet, a cultural critique that questioned how Americans raise their children. In the tweet, Ramaswamy argued that top tech companies hire foreign-born engineers not due to any inherent IQ deficit among Americans, but because of a cultural gap that prioritises mediocrity over excellence. He blamed American parenting practices and pop culture for fostering complacency, contrasting this with the disciplined upbringing of immigrant families. 
The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over “native” Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers & if...

A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers & if...
— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) December 26, 2024 What followed was an explosion of anger from MAGA supporters, many of whom accused him of being ungrateful and elitist. Some even took his remarks as an attack on American identity itself –– a cardinal sin in a movement centred on nationalism.From favourite to foe  The fallout was swift. Immediately after his tweet, prominent MAGA influencers took to X (formerly Twitter) to denounce Ramaswamy. The comments ranged from critiques of his “anti-American” tone to outright xenophobia, with some questioning his loyalty as an Indian-American. The debate spiralled into a larger cultural clash, with hashtags like #AmericansFirst and #NoH1Bs trending as users debated immigration, the H1-B visa program, and the role of Indian professionals in the US economy. 
 



 


 Ramaswamy’s critics framed his tweet as proof that he aligns more with immigrant interests than with the American working class. Others latched onto his background –– a child of Indian immigrants –– to argue that he was out of touch with the average American’s struggle. Ironically, this rhetoric came from the same crowd that had championed him as a symbol of the American Dream just weeks earlier. Indians vs Americans: The latest debate The controversy has reignited long-simmering tensions between Indian immigrants and native-born Americans, particularly in the Silicon Valley. Critics argue that the influx of highly skilled Indian professionals through visa programmes like H-1B has displaced American workers and driven down wages. Supporters counter that these professionals fill crucial gaps in a hyper-competitive global market, bringing expertise that keeps US innovation alive.  On X, the debate has taken on a life of its own. Indian-Americans have rallied to Ramaswamy’s defence, emphasising the sacrifices and discipline that immigrant families embody. They have highlighted the success stories of Indian-origin engineers, doctors, and entrepreneurs who have contributed to America’s global leadership. Meanwhile, the MAGA crowd has doubled down on their critique, accusing Indian immigrants of exploiting American opportunities while undermining their culture.The broader implications Ramaswamy's experience underscores how quickly admiration can turn to animosity when a politician’s message deviates from the script.  His predicament also reveals the precarious balancing act of being an immigrant –– or the child of immigrants –– in American politics. While his rise was fuelled by his ability to speak to American values, his cultural critiques have exploded a fault line within the MAGA movement. Moving forward For Ramaswamy, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. He must reconcile his vision of American exceptionalism with a base that feels increasingly alienated by his cultural critiques. His supporters argue that his message –– though controversial –– is necessary for sparking a much-needed national conversation about meritocracy, parenting, and education. But whether that message resonates or further alienates MAGA supporters remains to be seen. In the end, Ramasway’s journey from being a MAGA darling to a divisive figure serves as a cautionary tale. It highlights the complexities of navigating identity, nationalism, and ideology in today’s polarised America. For a movement that prides itself on loyalty, the question now is whether MAGA can forgive one of its own for speaking a truth it may not want to hear.

The tech billionaire and CEO of SpaceX believes that direct democracy, where decisions are made by the people themselves rather than through elected representatives, would be the ideal system for governing the Red Planet. Musk’s thoughts came in response to a user query on X, the social media platform he owns, regarding whether Martian governance would mirror the systems found on Earth. Musk’s response was clear and forward-looking. He stated that it would be up to the Martians themselves to decide how they are ruled but suggested that direct democracy could be the best approach. ""The Martians will decide how they are ruled. I recommend direct democracy,"" Musk wrote, hinting that he imagines a more participatory form of government than is typically seen on Earth. This means that Musk wants people to have more power, bypassing the often complicated and slow processes of representative governments. Beyond governance, Musk also provided updates on SpaceX’s progress toward making Mars exploration a reality. According to Musk, uncrewed Starships could begin landing on Mars within the next two years, potentially as early as 2026. He added that fully crewed missions to Mars might follow within four years, a timeline that could see the first humans stepping foot on Mars by 2028. These timelines are dependent on several factors, including the continued development of SpaceX’s Starship, which is designed to carry both cargo and crew on long-distance space missions. Musk also discussed the enormous financial and technological challenges associated with establishing a human colony on Mars. He estimated that building a self-sustaining city on the planet would cost over $1,000 trillion — a staggering amount that far exceeds the current GDP of the United States, which stands at around $29 trillion. This immense cost stems from the need to transport at least a million tons of equipment and materials to Mars to support human life. Musk has previously mentioned that current Mars missions cost roughly $1 billion per ton of payload delivered to the planet, and he stressed the need for a 1000-fold improvement in rocket and spacecraft technology to make these missions economically viable. One of the major hurdles SpaceX faces is reducing the cost of sending cargo and people to Mars. Currently, the high cost of space missions makes it prohibitively expensive to think about building a colony, but Musk remains optimistic that advances in reusable rockets and other technologies will help bring these costs down. If SpaceX succeeds in its plans, the future could see humans not only living on Mars but also deciding their system of government in a way that has never been done before. But, there is still a lot of time for this to become a reality.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 30, 2024

It’s the most used messaging app in the world with about 2 billion monthly active users. It's where people like you and me connect with family, friends, and even colleagues. But with WhatsApp constantly evolving and adding new features, some older devices will no longer support the app. Starting January 1, 2025, over 20 Android smartphones will lose access to WhatsApp. This change is linked to the fact that these devices are running outdated versions of Android, particularly Android 4.4 aka KitKat or earlier software versions. According to a recent report from HDblog, Meta, the company behind WhatsApp, is phasing out support for these older devices as part of its ongoing updates to ensure better security and functionality. It’s worth noting that all the affected phones are nearly a decade old or more, meaning they are no longer compatible with the latest software and features. While this decision makes sense from a technical standpoint, it can feel a bit unsettling for those who still rely on these older phones.  Brands like HTC and LG, which stopped making smartphones years ago, are among the ones affected. If you’re still using one of these phones, now might be the time to consider upgrading. Here’s the full list of Android smartphones losing WhatsApp support in 2025:Samsung
Galaxy S3
Galaxy Note 2
Galaxy Ace 3
Galaxy S4 Mini
Motorola
Moto G (1st Gen)
Motorola Razr HD
Moto E 2014
HTC
One X
One X+
Desire 500
Desire 601
LG
Optimus G
Nexus 4
G2 Mini
L90
Sony
Xperia Z
Xperia SP
Xperia T
Xperia V
 If you think your phone might be on the list, don’t panic just yet. WhatsApp recommends backing up your chats to a Google account before the support ends. This way, all your important conversations can be easily restored on a new phone. To do this, open WhatsApp > go to Settings > tap Chats > select Chat Backup. Follow the instructions to save your chats safely. This step will make transitioning to a new phone much smoother. If your phone is relatively new, you don’t need to worry. WhatsApp will continue to run as usual. But for those holding onto these older devices, it might be time to say goodbye and move on to something newer. The good news? There are plenty of affordable, feature-packed smartphones available today.

To recap, the iPhone SE 4 has previously been rumoured to be the most affordable phone to offer Apple Intelligence features. It was also tipped that the company may be dropping the SE branding altogether, and instead, it will add the SE 4 to the iPhone 16 line-up. The rumour has it that the phone is expected to carry several iPhone 16 features, including camera and display specs. If this holds to be true, the iPhone 16e makes a lot of sense. Now, the recent price leak also adds up to it. advertisementiPhone SE 4: Leaked Price According to a report from Korean outlet Naver, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to be priced at $500 (approximately Rs 42,700) or lower. This information reportedly comes from an unnamed Japanese carrier. Notably, this aligns with previous rumours about the iPhone SE 4’s $499 price point.  
 


For context, the iPhone SE 3 was launched in India in 2022 at a starting price of Rs 43,900, and it was priced at $429 (approx Rs 36,700) in the US. And with the upcoming iPhone SE 4, we must expect this price gap as well. If the iPhone SE 4 or 16e is to follow the traditions, the price in India could go up to Rs 49,900.

Previously, the rumour has it that the iPhone SE 4 is up for a potential price reduction, which may be attributed to Apple’s decision to utilise its own in-house 5G modem in the SE 4. By transitioning away from Qualcomm’s modems—like the Snapdragon X70/75 modems used in the iPhone 16 series—Apple avoids paying licencing fees, thereby reducing production costs.   However, while this cost-saving measure could lower the overall manufacturing expense, it doesn’t necessarily mean Apple will pass the savings directly to consumers. Pricing strategies often consider factors beyond production costs, such as market positioning, profit margins, and competitive dynamics.   If the $500 pricing rumour holds true, the iPhone SE 4 could become an even more attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. However, it is important to note that the exact prices and specs will only be disclosed during the launch of the phone. Till then, we advise you to take it with a pinch of salt.  iPhone SE 4: Specs and features (rumoured) The iPhone SE 4, also referred to as the iPhone 16e, is shaping up to be a major upgrade over its predecessors. Departing from the iPhone 8-inspired design, it is expected to adopt a look similar to the iPhone XR or iPhone 12, featuring a more modern and immersive user experience. A 6.06-inch OLED display will replace the previous 4.7-inch LCD, delivering significantly improved viewing quality comparable to Apple’s premium models.   Another notable change is the shift from the Touch ID home button to Face ID, which will slim down the bezels and align the device with Apple’s latest design trends. The 16e is rumoured to share the same screen size and full-screen design as the standard iPhone 16, providing a cohesive design language across Apple’s lineup.   Under the hood, the iPhone 16e will reportedly be powered by the A18 chipset and upgraded to 8GB of RAM from 4GB, resulting in a substantial performance boost. This improvement will enhance multitasking and support demanding apps, including Apple’s latest AI and machine learning features. Coupled with 128GB of storage, the 16e promises a better overall user experience while maintaining affordability.   The camera system is another area of improvement. The 16e is rumoured to feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, similar to the iPhone 16, marking a significant leap for Apple’s budget-friendly lineup. The advanced ""Fusion"" lens enables high-quality standard and 2x zoom photos without compromising detail, providing sharper and more versatile photography for users upgrading from older SE models.   Positioned as an affordable yet powerful alternative, the iPhone SE 4/16e aims to deliver premium features in a compact, budget-friendly package, bridging the gap between entry-level and flagship Apple devices.

IT department now has your entire details, says reportThe IT department's alleged use of DigiYatra data has raised privacy concerns, but the app's CEO denies storing personal user information. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/used-digiyatra-it-department-now-has-your-entire-details-and-will-check-it-for-tax-evasion-says-report-2657356-2024-12-30,"In an eyebrow-raising report, The New Indian Express recently claimed that India’s Income Tax Department is leveraging passenger data collected via the DigiYatra app to identify potential tax evaders. The report has sparked concerns about privacy, surveillance, and the scope of government data usage, with the claim being contested by DigiYatra's CEO, Suresh Khadakbhavi. DigiYatra, a civil aviation ministry-led initiative, was launched to simplify and streamline air travel by making it seamless and paperless. The process uses facial recognition technology. The app captures passengers' biometric data, travel details, and ID documents to facilitate a smoother airport experience. However, the recent report suggests that the IT Department has begun cross-referencing DigiYatra’s passenger data with income tax filings to flag discrepancies — specifically targeting high-spending frequent flyers whose declared income does not justify their expenditures.
 


advertisementWhat does DigiYatra's CEO have to say?Khadakbhavi’s strongly-worded response dismisses the allegations as baseless. He has clarified that DigiYatra does not store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in a central repository. Instead, the data is stored locally on passengers' devices, aligning with the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework. This approach ensures data security, privacy, and scalability — making it impossible for the government or any other entity to access this information directly. Khadakbhavi’s strongly-worded response dismisses the allegations as baseless. He has clarified that DigiYatra does not store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in a central repository. Instead, the data is stored locally on passengers' devices, aligning with the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework. This approach ensures data security, privacy, and scalability — making it impossible for the government or any other entity to access this information directly. “Such baseless articles overshadow the achievements of DigiYatra,” Khadakbhavi said, highlighting the app’s milestone of crossing 9 million active users in 2024. According to the DigiYatra CEO, the app's privacy-first design safeguards passengers from any potential misuse of their data.But is there a loophole here?! While the privacy claims are reassuring, the mechanism by which DigiYatra verifies passenger identities at airports raises some questions. If no central repository exists, how does the system ensure seamless data retrieval for identity confirmation during check-in? The process involves users uploading Aadhaar details or passport information, a selfie, and their boarding pass to the app, which then generates a unique QR code for airport use. Critics argue that some form of data cross-verification must occur behind the scenes, leaving room for potential privacy vulnerabilities.“Stupidification of governance?” The controversy has also reignited broader debates about data usage and governance in India. A widely shared tweet criticised DigiYatra, equating it with past measures like demonetisation, claiming that such initiatives focus on catching small-scale violators while ignoring systemic issues like large-scale loan fraud and government-enabled corruption. According to the tweet, the government remains “stupid” to the real sources of black money generation, which often stem from big-ticket loans for government contracts.
 


 The allegations, if true, mark a significant shift in how travel data could be weaponised for tax enforcement. The IT Department reportedly plans to scrutinise frequent international travellers, particularly those whose spending habits don’t align with their reported income. While this aligns with the government's broader push for accountability and transparency, it also raises ethical questions about the scope of surveillance.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

And if not heard: The OnePlus 13 series — the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R — is set to arrive in India on January 7. Given that these are the phones from OnePlus, a brand with a tremendous fan-following in India, there is a lot of buzz around the next OnePlus flagships. Already a lot is known about the phone. For example, we know — and this is big — that the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R are going to come with lifetime display warranty.  At the same time, with an emphasis on AI in OxygenOS 15, durable display technology, and optimised software, this latest flagship lineup is expected to cater to both enthusiasts and average consumers alike. Now, we will know more about the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R once they arrive. The full details, and in what respect they are different from their China variants, will be revealed on January 7. And, of course, we will get to know about their price on the same day. But even before the launch, there is a lot we know about the two phones. So, let's take a closer look. OxygenOS 15 with AI smarts  One of the key highlights of the OnePlus 13 series — and the one that makes it different from other phones in the market — is OxygenOS 15, which is based on Android 15. There's a big focus on AI in the company's latest software approach, with several features designed to improve user productivity and experience. The key to AI smarts in the OxygenOS 15 is going to be Google Gemini. Using Gemini, along with its own algorithms and fine-tuning, OnePlus is going to offer a number of key AI features in the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R.  For example, the OnePlus 13 series will have Intelligent Search — a feature that aims to make finding information on your phone simple. Rather than opening multiple apps or scrolling through long files, users can simply input natural language queries to search across their devices. This feature will help save time and improve efficiency for anyone managing a large number of files or documents. For photography enthusiasts, the OnePlus 13 series brings several AI-powered tools that promise to enhance your photo-taking experience. The AI Detail Boost feature enhances low-resolution or cropped images, instantly improving their quality to 4K resolution. The AI Unblur fixes blurry photos, by automatically sharpening images and the AI Reflection Eraser helps users remove unwanted reflections in their photos. Apart from the new AI features, OxygenOS 15 also brings optimisations that improve the overall performance of the device. One of the biggest improvements is the reduction in system storage requirements. For context, the system's storage footprint is down by nearly 20 per cent compared to OxygenOS 14 on the OnePlus 12. This optimisation not only frees up space for more apps and data but also leads to faster system performance, providing a smoother and more responsive experience for users.

Here are the details.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-17-to-get-a-big-display-upgrade-that-iphone-16-lacks-2657433-2024-12-30,"The iPhone 17 is said to bring a big display upgrade, one that is missing from the iPhone 16 series. A known tipster claims that Apple is planning to introduce its high-refresh-rate ProMotion technology to the standard model of the iPhone 17, marking a first for the base variant of the flagship lineup. This news will likely bring relief to users who have avoided the standard model due to the lack of high refresh rate support. According to a report by Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station on Weibo, supply chain materials have confirmed that the upcoming iPhone 17 will feature a higher refresh rate display. Although the exact refresh rate has not been mentioned, it is widely speculated that Apple will include the 120Hz ProMotion feature, which has so far been limited to the Pro models. This move would be a big leap from the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models, which use LTPS (low-temperature polycrystalline silicon) panels capped at 60Hz. For the iPhone 17, Apple is expected to switch to more advanced LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) panels, which enable dynamic refresh rates ranging from as low as 1Hz to 120Hz. This technology is not only more power-efficient but also allows features like always-on display, which brings always-visible time, widgets, and notifications—currently available only on the Pro models. With a higher refresh rate, users can expect smoother scrolling, faster animations, and an overall better experience when using the phone for tasks like gaming or video streaming. This upgrade could make the standard iPhone 17 a more attractive option for those who don’t want to pay a premium for the Pro models but still want top-end features. The potential inclusion of ProMotion technology would mark a major shift in Apple’s strategy, as this has been one of the key differentiators between the standard and Pro variants in recent years. By bringing this feature to the base model, Apple could make the iPhone 17 more competitive in the market, especially considering that many Android phones in similar price ranges already offer higher refresh rates. Apple has not officially confirmed any details regarding the iPhone 17 series, but if this rumour turns out to be true, it could be one of the biggest upgrades to the standard iPhone lineup in years. Along with this display upgrade, the iPhone 17 is likely to come with other new features and performance improvements.

One of the most common scams involves part-time jobs, but this time, it wasn’t a job scam. A man ended up losing a large sum of money while trying to apply for a loan. Surprisingly, this incident happened through the Flipkart app. Here’s what happened. A postmaster from Ludhiana lost Rs 87,000 after falling prey to a loan-related cyber fraud. The victim, Sarabjit Singh, a resident of Kaille village in the Sudhar area, had applied for a loan of Rs 2 lakh through the Flipkart app. Days after submitting the application, on December 4, he received a call from an individual posing as a representative of the app, claiming that his loan was approved. However, the caller informed him that the loan couldn’t be disbursed due to incomplete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. To rectify this, Sarabjit was asked to click on a link and complete an online KYC form. Believing it to be a legitimate process, he followed the instructions and was asked to make a token payment of Rs 5 to finalise the verification. But instead of Rs 5, a hefty sum of Rs 86,998 was deducted from his bank account. Shocked by the sudden deduction, Sarabjit immediately contacted the individual, but the person cut off the call and switched off the phone. Sarabjit then approached the Jagraon police station, and the case was forwarded to the cyber crime department for further investigation. According to ASI Jagroop Singh, an FIR has been lodged under section 318(4) for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under the BNS, as well as section 66(D) of the Information Technology (IT) Act. The authorities are now working to trace the bank accounts into which the stolen money was transferred. To prevent falling victim to such frauds, it is essential to stay cautious when dealing with unknown callers or suspicious links, particularly in financial matters. Always verify the authenticity of calls or messages, especially when asked to complete KYC or make any payments. Avoid clicking on unsolicited links and never share personal details or banking information without cross-checking the source. Using official banking apps and authorised websites is the safest way to handle transactions. It is always better to apply for loans via authorised banks and not through third-party apps like Flipkart. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

It has an aluminium frame and a flat screen within a 8mm thin body. The volume rocker and power buttons are conveniently placed on the right edge, while the iconic alert slider is located on the left.  While the black variant has a matte finish, the white variant might reflect a pearl-like colour. Take a look at the images. 
 


OnePlus 13R: Specs and features  Ahead of its official launch, OnePlus has confirmed that the OnePlus 13R will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, a notable upgrade from its predecessor, the OnePlus 12R, which featured the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. As is typical for the R series, OnePlus is using the latest flagship chip for this model. The device will also come equipped with a suite of AI features, including AI Notes, AI Cleanup, AI Imaging, and Intelligent Search, along with a Snapshot feature for its camera system. Additionally, the OnePlus 13R will feature a large 6,000mAh battery, a substantial increase from the 5,500mAh battery found in the OnePlus 12R, promising extended usage time. It will also support SuperVOOC fast charging, with rumours suggesting a 100W fast-charging capability. As with previous models, OnePlus is expected to include a charger in the retail box.

Meanwhile, the current Snapdragon 8 Elite is just starting to appear in flagship phones worldwide.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-2-may-launch-soon-check-details-here-2657602-2024-12-31,"Qualcomm seems to already be gearing up for its next big flagship chip release, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2. Just a few months after introducing the Snapdragon 8 Elite at the Snapdragon Summit in October 2024, rumours suggest that its successor could be arriving sooner than expected. The upcoming flagship chipset is expected to bring significant upgrades, and if leaks are to be believed, it could hit the market earlier than Qualcomm’s usual timeline. According to tipster, Digital Chat Station, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2, internally referred to as the SM8850, might debut much earlier than expected. This would be ahead of Qualcomm’s typical schedule, as this year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite was unveiled on October 22. An early launch could give smartphone brands additional time to work with the new chipset, allowing them to integrate it into their devices ahead of key launches later in the year. One of the most exciting aspects of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 is its expected improvement in GPU performance. Reports suggest the chipset will be built using TSMC’s advanced N3P fabrication process, a step up from the N3E process used for the current Snapdragon 8 Elite. This upgraded fabrication process could deliver better power efficiency and enhanced performance, making it ideal for power users. Performance gains are also expected to be substantial. The new chip could offer at least 20 per cent better performance than its predecessor, according to the tipster. Another leaker, Jukanlosreve, also highlighted the possibility of a 20 per cent jump in both single-core and multi-core CPU performance. Considering that the Snapdragon 8 Elite already delivers a 30 per cent improvement in CPU performance compared to last year’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 could push the limits of mobile processing even further.  It’s worth noting that the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is still in the early stages of making its way to global markets. So far, it has only debuted in the iQOO 13, but that’s set to change soon as brands like Samsung and OnePlus prepare to launch their flagship devices — Galaxy S24 and OnePlus 13 — powered by the latest Qualcomm chipset. With the first generation just beginning to roll out, the idea of an accelerated timeline for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 might seem a bit surprising. While the leaks are intriguing, it’s always wise to take such early information with a grain of salt until Qualcomm makes an official announcement.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

While the specs and features are still under wraps, the rumour suggests that there could be a new entry in the series. It looks like Samsung might be diversifying its foldable lineup further with a more budget-friendly option, following the same philosophy as its Galaxy FE (Fan Edition) devices. The potential of the ""Galaxy Z Flip XE"" was spotted in the GSMA database (via SmartPrix), which could target consumers who are interested in foldable tech but find the flagship Galaxy Z Flip models too pricey.  If the GSMA database listing is accurate, this could mark an exciting shift for Samsung's foldable strategy. A ""lite"" or ""affordable"" foldable might feature slightly scaled-down specs—such as a lower-tier processor, simpler materials, or fewer premium features—while retaining the signature clamshell foldable design.  In late November, rumours hinted that Samsung might launch the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7, with the FE model reportedly powered by the Exynos 2400e. This chip, which also powers the Galaxy S24 FE, is designed to deliver solid performance while helping Samsung keep costs lower. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to feature the more advanced Exynos 2500, a processor yet to be officially unveiled. Unfortunately, the available code snippets provide little insight into the specifics of these foldable devices. Even the exact names of the phones aren't confirmed, though the Android Authority has speculated based on the limited information available. So far, there hasn't been much information about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, aside from indications that they are in development. Details about potential upgrades remain unclear. For now, attention is largely focused on the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 series, anticipated to debut in January. This year's lineup may expand to include a new Galaxy S25 Slim edition, in addition to the usual three models. That said, the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2025 is expected to take place on January 22, which will disclose the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. According to recent reports, the Galaxy S25 Slim will not be released at the same time as the rest of the phones. The Slim variant might arrive a few months later and a new report supports this claim, based on Samsung's latest One UI 7 beta. The beta includes a list of US carrier-specific Samsung phone models, but the Galaxy S25 Slim's model number is notably absent. This suggests that the Slim won’t be part of the initial wave of devices launching with One UI 7 based on Android 15. Earlier rumours indicated that the S25 Slim would debut in the second quarter of next year (between April and June), which aligns with the findings in One UI 7.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 slim expected to arrive later than the rest of the seriesAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim tipped to feature ALoP technology for better photography and smaller camera moduleAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateMust Watch

According to a recent report from the supply chain, the standard iPhone 17 could finally come with a high refresh rate display, a much-needed upgrade over the current 60Hz screens on non-Pro models. This means smoother animations, better responsiveness, and a display experience that feels more in line with modern flagship phones. That said, whether these are your regular 120Hz high refresh rate screens or 120Hz ProMotion displays, remains to be seen.  120Hz ProMotion displays, as Apple calls them, have been exclusive to the Pro and Pro Max models for several years. These premium models feature an adaptive refresh rate ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz, thanks to their advanced LTPO display panels. This not only improves the visual experience but also helps conserve battery life by lowering the refresh rate when it isn’t needed. Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t offered this feature on non-Pro iPhones, and the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus continued the trend, much to the disappointment of fans. Thankfully, things could change with the iPhone 17. While the new report doesn’t explicitly mention ProMotion, rumours from reputable sources like display analyst Ross Young and ETNews have previously hinted that non-Pro models could get this display tech. If true, it could also mean the addition of an Always-On Display. Currently available only on Pro models, this feature uses the 1Hz refresh rate to keep important information on the screen without draining the battery. The iPhone 17 isn’t just about the display, though. It’s expected to bring several other exciting upgrades. A new A19 chip is almost certain, with reports suggesting it will be built using an improved version of TSMC’s 3nm process. This should result in better performance and energy efficiency, even though 2nm chips are still a few years away. Another big change could be in the selfie department. The iPhone 17 might debut Apple’s first 24-megapixel front-facing camera, replacing the 12-megapixel lens that has been standard for years.  Interestingly, Apple might also be reshuffling its lineup. As mentioned in a lot of leaks, the iPhone 17 Plus could be replaced by a super-slim iPhone 17 Air. This new model might make a few compromises, like featuring only a single rear camera, to prioritise a lightweight and ultra-thin design.  As for the iPhone 17 Pro models, they’re expected to continue with titanium frames, a narrower Dynamic Island, and upgraded 12GB RAM for improved AI capabilities. A new type of display, called Low-Dialectric TEE, could also enhance performance and durability while improving power efficiency.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Following the success of the Reno 12 series, the new flagship lineup is expected to feature two models: the Reno 13 5G and the Reno 13 Pro 5G. While the exact date of launch is still under wraps, the company has shared a bunch of teasers that provide a glimpse of what users can expect from the smartphones.  The Reno 13 series is designed with durability in mind, claims Oppo. The company says the phones use a premium aluminium frame, a sculpted rear panel, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for protection. Oppo’s teasers also highlight the use of “aerospace-grade aluminium” on the device.  From the teaser images, it is also evident that the Oppo Reno 13 series 5G will feature a flat display and a triple-camera setup. Unlike its predecessor, the Reno 12, the camera module on the Reno 13 series appears slightly revamped. Additionally, the rear camera setup includes two vertically aligned lenses, with a third lens placed on the side to form a triangular layout. An LED flash, likely designed as a ring light, is housed within the camera module, aligning with current design trends. While details about the Indian variant remain limited, the Reno 13 series has already been launched in China, offering insights into its potential specifications. The Chinese version features a 6.59-inch flat AMOLED display with a resolution of 2760x1256 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering crisp visuals and smooth performance. Powering the device is the MediaTek Dimensity 8350 chipset, equipped with an upgraded GPU for better gaming and faster app loading. A 5,600mAh battery with 80W fast charging support ensures prolonged usage and quick recharges.   The Reno 13 series shines in the camera department, a hallmark of the Reno lineup. It includes a 50-megapixel primary camera with optical image stabilization (OIS), an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 50-megapixel front-facing camera for exceptional selfies and video calls.   Running on ColorOS 15, based on Android 15, the Reno 13 series offers a polished software experience with advanced features and optimizations. Additionally, its durability credentials are bolstered by IP66, IP68, and IP69 certifications, making it resistant to dust and water in various conditions.   In China, the Reno 13 series starts at CNY 2,699 (approximately Rs 31,400). While pricing for India hasn’t been confirmed, the Reno 12 was launched at Rs 32,999, suggesting the Reno 13 could follow a similar pricing structure. With its sleek design, enhanced performance, and premium features, the Reno 13 series is poised to be a strong contender in the flagship smartphone market.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

The lineup will make its debut on January 9, 2025, at 5:30 PM IST, as confirmed through a post on X (Twitter) by the company. Poco has also revealed that both smartphones in the series will be available for purchase via Flipkart.  Apart from the Poco X7 and X7 Pro, contrary to some earlier rumours, Poco India's Head, Himanshu Tandon, has confirmed there won’t be a third Neo variant in the lineup, putting those speculations to rest. Over the past few weeks, leaks and teasers have provided a good idea of what to expect from these new smartphones, and fans have plenty of reasons to look forward to them. Starting with the Poco X7, the base model is rumoured to feature the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra chipset under the hood. The phone might come with up to 12GB RAM and 512GB of internal storage. It is expected to sport a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Additionally, expected features like HDR10+ support, TUV Rheinland eye care certification, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection make it an appealing choice for those who value display quality and durability. The Poco X7 Pro, on the other hand, is set to feature a more powerful MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset. It is also expected to come with a 6.67-inch AMOLED display, but this screen could take things up a notch with a CrystalRez 1.5K resolution, 2,560Hz touch sampling rate, and an impressive 3,200 nits peak brightness. When it comes to cameras, the Poco X7 is rumoured to feature a 50-megapixel main rear camera with OIS, while the Pro model could include a 50-megapixel Sony IMX882 sensor with f/1.5 aperture and 4K video recording support. Both phones may come with a 20-megapixel front-facing camera. Battery life is another area where the Poco X7 series looks promising. The vanilla model could house a 5,110mAh battery with 45W fast charging support, while the Pro variant might step up with a massive 6,000mAh battery and 90W fast charging support. Both devices are also said to come with IP68 dust and water resistance. It will be interesting to see how Poco approaches the pricing strategy for the Poco X7 series, especially given the highly competitive nature of the mid-range smartphone market in India. With so many brands vying for attention in this segment, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Poco can position the X7 series as a strong contender for the title of bestseller in the sub-Rs 30,000 price range. For context, the predecessor models — the Poco X6 and X6 Pro — made their debut in India at attractive price points, with the standard variant starting at Rs 21,999 and the Pro version at Rs 26,999.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Ahead of the launch, 2024’s flagships, the OnePlus 12 and the OnePlus 12R, have been listed at a massive discount. While a Rs 10,000 discount on the OnePlus 12 is available on Flipkart, there is up to Rs 7,000 off you can get on the OnePlus 12R, and the best deal is on the top variant of the phone. But there is a catch –– there is always a catch. At the time of writing the story, the deal had a timer on it with a validity for the next 12 hours and 40 minutes. Which means the discount will only be available till midnight today.  You can read our detailed review of the OnePlus 12R.OnePlus 12R discount On the OnePlus India website, the OnePlus 12R is currently available with a flat discount of up to Rs 7,000. Here is a breakdown of the deal: The base variant of the OnePlus 12R, with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage has no deal, and is in fact, the most expensive one right now because of the discounts. It is selling at its original price of Rs 39,999. The middle variant, which offers 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, is available with Rs 4,000 discount. That means, instead of its usual price of Rs 42,000, the OnePlus 12R’s base variant is currently selling at Rs 38,999.  The top variant with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage, however, is selling with a flat discount of Rs 7,000 and has the best offer available right now.

Additionally, on top of the flat discount, the OnePlus India website is also offering a bank discount of Rs 3,000 on payments made via ICICI Bank, OneCard, and RBL Bank credit and debit cards.

2a130872-ea86-4fd2-8974-f5cbb82a47a7,Apple TV+ will be free to stream for all users in India for 3 daysApple TV+ content will be free to stream for all users in India and worldwide for the first weekend of New Year 2025.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-tv-will-be-free-to-stream-for-all-users-in-india-for-3-days-2657784-2024-12-31,"Apple TV+ content is great, but it doesn’t have as many subscribers as, say, Netflix or Amazon Prime. It’s more popular among Apple users, comparatively –– also because you can club it as part of Apple One, which gives Apple users access to Apple Music, iCloud+ and other apps as well. Apple TV+’s relatively smaller user base (the company does not disclose its subscriber base publicly) is interesting considering it is also not very expensive –– its subscription starts at Rs 99 for a month, in India. However, it seems like Apple is trying to fix exactly that now. Apple has announced that Apple TV+ will be free to stream for all users in India and worldwide for the first weekend of 2025. 
 


 This basically means that starting Friday, January 3, Apple TV+ will be free to access by all, regardless of if you have the subscription of the platform or not. The platform will be free to stream till Sunday, January 5. This offer will be available everywhere in the world. The only condition: the streaming service is available where you stay –– that is, you are not using the service via VPN.  All you need to access this offer is an Apple ID and password. If you don’t have one, you can create it for free. But why is Apple letting people access Apple TV+ for free? Let’s go back to what we said at the beginning of the piece. Apple is trying to fix its relatively small user base. With open access to all for three days, Apple is trying to drive people to sign up to Apple TV+ and hopefully get them hooked to a show or some Apple TV+ exclusive content that forces them to sign up to the streaming service when the free weekend is over.  Apple has an interesting lineup on Apple TV+ including series like Severance, Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, along with critically acclaimed titles like Silo, Shrinking, and Slow Horses. For sci-fi fans, there is also Dark Matter, For All Mankind, and Foundation. The platform also has films like Fly Me to the Moon, Wolf, The Instigators and The Family Plan.

It slots in comfortably between the regular Galaxy S24 and the flagship Galaxy S24 Ultra, offering many of the premium features that users want, without the hefty price tag that comes with the Ultra model. If you're someone who wants a big-screen phone and top-tier performance but doesn't necessarily need the S24 Ultra and its S Pen prowess, the Galaxy S24+ is an ideal option. And right now, it's available at a price that makes it even more tempting.advertisementGalaxy S24+ available at Rs 35,000 massive discountAt present, the Galaxy S24+ is available on Flipkart for just Rs 64,999, a solid Rs 35,000 off its original list price of Rs 99,999.

With the price reduction, the S24+ is positioned as one of the best value-for-money phones in the market today.There’s also an exchange offer that makes the deal even sweeter. Depending on the device you're willing to trade in, you could get up to Rs 46,299 as an exchange value. For example, if you want to exchange an old iPhone 14 Plus, you could get up to Rs 31,500 as part of the exchange offer, while a Galaxy S22+ can fetch up to Rs 20,300.

Now, you might be wondering if it's the right time to buy, especially with the Galaxy S25 series expected to launch soon. While the new S25 phones will no doubt come with a slew of upgrades, they are also likely to come with a much higher price tag. This means that for anyone who’s on a budget but still wants a big phone with high-end specs, the Galaxy S24+ is a superb deal right now. Should you buy Galaxy S24+? In terms of design and performance, the Galaxy S24+ does not disappoint. It comes with a sleek look that’s typical of Samsung’s flagship devices, with a large, beautiful display that makes watching videos or gaming as immersive as it gets. The phone comes with top-tier performance, with the Exynos 2400 processor under the hood paired with 12GB RAM and up to 512GB storage. The phone also supports up to 7 years of software updates. While the Galaxy S24 Ultra might have some additional features, such as the S Pen, the S24 Plus offers everything that most users need in a high-end phone at a much more affordable price point. If you're in the market for a big phone with top-tier features but don’t want to spend a fortune, the Galaxy S24+ is a phone worth considering. With its current discount and exchange offers, it’s the best time to grab it before prices go back up. In fact, most people who buy Galaxy S devices don’t really talk much about the plus model. Even if you try to buy the Galaxy S24+ right now — apart from Flipkart — the phone is really hard to find on online channels. As for purchasing it offline, you won’t be able to score such a good deal.  In short, if you need a premium phone but don't have the budget for the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Galaxy S24+ could be exactly what you're looking for — and right now, it's at a price that’s hard to beat.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

6ad6ef78-0604-498f-add0-6918a3756f91,"iOS devices are easier target for hackers compared to AndroidiOS devices face more phishing attacks than Android, with 19 per cent of enterprise iOS devices targeted in 2024.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ios-devices-are-easier-target-for-hackers-compared-to-android-2657830-2024-12-31,"A new report from security analysts at Lookout suggests iOS devices are more vulnerable to phishing attacks than Android devices. According to the latest Mobile Threat Landscape Report for Q3 2024, 18.4 per cent of iOS devices were targeted by phishing attempts compared to 11.4 per cent of Android devices. Lookout, a data-centric cloud security company, based its findings on data from an AI-powered mobile dataset that analysed 220 million devices, 360 million apps, and billions of web items. Their security cloud has identified over 473 million malicious websites, including phishing sites, since 2019. These phishing attacks aim to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and other personal data. What makes iOS devices more attractive to attackers? One reason could be their popularity in the workplace. The report highlights that iOS devices are more common than Android devices in enterprise settings. In fact, Lookout’s user base had more than twice as many iOS devices as Android devices. This higher number of devices means more opportunities for attackers to strike. The statistics back this up. In 2024, 19 per cent of enterprise iOS devices faced at least one mobile phishing attack during each of the first three quarters. On the other hand, only 10.9 per cent of enterprise Android devices were exposed to phishing attacks in the same period. This data suggests that the threat might be more about sheer numbers rather than any inherent weakness in iOS. In addition, Lookout’s researchers noted a 17 per cent increase in enterprise-focused credential theft and phishing attempts since the previous quarter and a 32 per cent rise in malicious app detections. These findings emphasise how cyber criminal groups are shifting their tactics to target mobile devices more aggressively in the early stages of their attacks.  While the report focused on enterprise devices, regular users shouldn’t let their guard down. Phishing attacks have become increasingly advanced, often targeting everyday consumers through emails, messages, and even fake websites. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android phone, phishing can put your personal information at risk. Experts warn that phishing is only going to become more sophisticated as we head into 2025. The rise of AI has enabled cybercriminals to craft convincing fake messages that look almost identical to legitimate communications. The goal is always the same — to get you to click on a link or download a file that compromises your data. The takeaway? Stay vigilant. Be cautious of emails or messages that seem too urgent or unusual, even if they appear to come from trusted sources. Always double-check links before clicking and never share personal information unless you’re absolutely sure it’s safe.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

This feature is rumoured to utilise a composite sensor that combines data from various dedicated sensors, such as the accelerometer and GPS, to identify car crashes.Currently, this functionality is inactive, even in the latest One UI version. The report notes that similar references to the feature were present in Samsung’s software as far back as One UI 5.1.1 and have been spotted on devices like the Galaxy S24 series and Samsung's newest foldable smartphones.

Samsung Galaxy S25 to offer free advanced Gemini features Another report also indicated that Google may collaborate with Samsung to bundle its premium AI features with the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. This potential partnership was uncovered during a teardown of the beta version of the Google app (v15.52.37), where several lines of code hinted at the offer. The discovered code references both Google One and Samsung, along with the term “upsell,” suggesting that this initiative might be part of a broader strategy. By offering free access to its advanced AI capabilities, specifically the Gemini Advanced features, Google could aim to familiarise users with its premium services, hoping they’ll subscribe after the trial period ends. Interestingly, additional strings of code explicitly mention “Samsung_S25,” further connecting the offer to the Galaxy S25 series. Speculation suggests that the free subscription durations might vary by model. For instance, the standard Galaxy S25 might include three to six months of Gemini Advanced access, while the higher-end Plus and Ultra variants could offer extended trials of nine months to a year. If true, this move could enhance the appeal of the Galaxy S25 lineup by bundling cutting-edge AI tools, creating added value for buyers while positioning Google’s AI offerings to reach a broader audience.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 may arrive with a budget-friendly variant in 2025Also read |  iPhone 17 may get 120Hz display but there's a catchAlso read |  OnePlus 13R leaks show off two colour variants, ahead of January 7 launchMust Watch

afcc7b4d-95c3-4328-86c7-327ab59f5d75,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai has a message for his employees for 2025, says move fasterGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai addressed his employees ahead of the new year 2025. He stressed over the urgency to develop and improve the company's AI products.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-has-a-message-for-his-employees-for-2025-says-we-need-to-move-faster-2657820-2024-12-31,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai has outlined ambitious goals for 2025, calling it an important year for the company amidst rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Addressing employees during a strategy meeting at Google’s Mountain View headquarters, Pichai emphasised the urgency of adapting to a rapidly evolving tech landscape, citing the importance of delivering innovative solutions and maintaining focus. “The stakes are high,” Pichai remarked, as reported by CNBC. “These are disruptive moments. In 2025, we need to be relentlessly focused on unlocking the benefits of this technology and solving real user problems.”   At the heart of Google’s strategy for 2025 is its AI initiative, Gemini. The app, designed to offer versatile tools, including chatbots and other consumer-facing applications, is seen as central to Google’s efforts to remain competitive in the generative AI market. Pichai stressed the importance of selling Gemini to a target of 500 million users, placing it among Google’s flagship products.  “Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year,” he stated. “We’ve seen strong momentum recently, but there’s work to do to close the gap and establish a leadership position.”   DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis further elaborated on the vision for Gemini, describing plans to enhance its capabilities into a universal assistant adaptable to any device, domain, or modality. He also hinted at updates to Project Astra, Google’s experimental AI assistant, expected in the first half of 2025.   While Google remains a leader in search, it faces increasing competition from rivals like OpenAI, supported by Microsoft, and other AI-powered search tools. Addressing this competitive pressure, Pichai reassured employees that being “first” isn’t always necessary for success.   “In history, you don’t always need to be first, but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,” he explained. “That’s what 2025 is all about.”   Google also showcased emerging AI-driven products during the meeting. Josh Woodward, head of Google Labs, demonstrated tools like Jules, a coding assistant; NotebookLM, an AI-powered note-taking tool integrated with podcasts; and Project Mariner, a Chrome extension designed to streamline multitasking. These innovations highlight Google’s commitment to developing practical and impactful solutions for users.  Despite the company’s focus on AI, Google faces mounting regulatory challenges. In 2024, it was accused of monopolistic practices in search and advertising. Pichai acknowledged the scrutiny but urged employees not to lose focus. “It’s not lost on me that we are facing scrutiny across the world,” he said. “It comes with our size and success. But through this moment, we have to ensure we don’t get distracted.”   Pichai also encouraged employees to adopt a resourceful mindset, reflecting on the ingenuity of Google’s founders during the company’s early days. “Constraints often lead to creativity. Not all problems are solved by headcount,” he noted, referencing recent cost-cutting measures.   As Google navigates this transformative period, Pichai’s message is clear: accelerate innovation, execute effectively, and remain focused on delivering world-class products.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also read |  MAGA darling a month ago, Vivek Ramaswamy now an American-Indian Trump supporters love to hateAlso read |  Sriram in White House, Trump supporters demand ban on H1-B Visa and fewer Indians in Silicon ValleyAlso read |  What is the Qualcomm vs Arm battle that could have huge implications on future laptops, phones

The government, on Tuesday, has removed restrictions on the app’s payments service, WhatsApp Payment, which is a major win for parent company Meta. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which oversees the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system, announced that WhatsApp can now expand its payments feature to all users in the country, lifting the previous cap of 100 million users. This was first reported by TechCrunch.   This decision represents a significant shift in regulatory policy, which had previously limited WhatsApp Payment’s rollout. Initially capped at 40 million users in 2020 and later extended to 100 million in 2022, the cautious approach by NPCI reflected concerns over market concentration in India’s booming digital payments sector.   India’s UPI platform processes over 13 billion transactions monthly, with Google Pay and PhonePe controlling more than 85 per cent of the market. WhatsApp’s expansion poses a direct challenge to these incumbents, bolstered by its massive user base and seamless integration with the messaging app.   The timing is particularly favourable for Meta, as the company recently introduced its generative AI product, Meta AI, which has also gained significant traction in India, further solidifying the country’s importance to Meta’s global strategy.   In addition to lifting restrictions on WhatsApp Payment, NPCI deferred a proposed rule to cap any single app’s UPI transaction share at 30 per cent until December 31, 2026. This extension gives WhatsApp more time to establish its foothold in the competitive fintech landscape.   The decision not only amplifies Meta’s financial services ambitions but also underscores India’s role as a critical growth market for the tech giant.

However, some users of the Galaxy S22 Ultra are struggling with a frustrating problem that’s making their phones almost unusable.  These users have reported their devices randomly rebooting over and over again in what is known as a boot loop. The issue has become a hot topic on social media platforms like Reddit, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and even Samsung’s official forums.  While some users mention occasional crashes, freezing, or lagging, others say their Galaxy S22 Ultra has completely stopped working because of the endless rebooting. For many, the trouble started after they installed Samsung’s One UI 6.1 update, released in September of last year. A recent report from Sammobile highlighted that users who sought help at Samsung service centres were told the issue was due to a faulty motherboard. Unfortunately, since the Galaxy S22 Ultra is out of warranty for most users now, they’ve had to pay for costly repairs. Some customers are reportedly shelling out hundreds of dollars to fix a problem they feel isn’t their fault. To make matters worse, Samsung hasn’t yet provided an official solution. Many users are sharing tips and temporary fixes online. One unusual method involves putting the Galaxy S22 Ultra in a freezer for a few minutes. Some claim this helps the phone work again for a short time. However, the problem returns once the device heats up. Experts warn against trying this method, as exposing your phone to extreme cold could damage its internal components. The frustration among Galaxy S22 Ultra users is growing. One user posted on Reddit, “This was the most expensive phone I’ve ever bought, and now it’s just restarting all the time. I can’t even back up my data.” Others have expressed disappointment with the lack of acknowledgement or support from Samsung. For now, users are left with few options. They can either pay for repairs or wait and hope that Samsung provides a fix, whether through a software patch or a repair program. Many believe the company should take responsibility, especially since the problem seems linked to a recent update.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Previously, the rumour has it that the Galaxy S25+ could be powered by Exynos 2500 SoC. But now a Geekbench list, featuring the international model of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, indicates that a Snapdragon processor makes more sense.  The international version of the Samsung Galaxy S25, identified by the model number SM-S931B, recently appeared on Geekbench. It operates on Android 15 and is equipped with 12GB of RAM. In Geekbench's tests, it achieved scores of 2,986 in single-core and 9,355 in multi-core performance. While these scores are lower compared to some other Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered devices, this could be a prototype, and the final retail version is expected to deliver improved performance.Samsung Galaxy S25 series: Everything we know so far  The Samsung Galaxy S25 series has already sparked significant interest ahead of its official release, with several rumours and leaks emerging. The flagship lineup is expected to feature a significant performance boost, with the international Galaxy S25 model (SM-S931B) recently surfacing on Geekbench. This device is reported to run Android 15 and come with 12GB of RAM.  Aside from raw performance, rumours indicate that the S25 series will offer notable upgrades in its display, camera capabilities, and battery life. The Galaxy S25 is expected to come with a dynamic AMOLED display, possibly featuring a higher refresh rate for smoother visuals. The camera system may be enhanced with advanced sensors and AI-powered features to capture sharper images in varied conditions.  Additionally, Samsung is reportedly working on improving its battery efficiency, with a larger capacity and faster charging speeds to accommodate heavy usage throughout the day. The S25 series will likely maintain its signature sleek design, with a glass and metal body, and improved durability. Additionally, the company is also expected to release a fourth device in the series-- Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim. However, this phone might not be able to make it like the rest of the phones. The Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to arrive later than the rest.  With Samsung set to reveal more details soon, fans and tech enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the official announcement to confirm these speculations and see what the new generation of Galaxy devices has to offer.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

2c29d0bb-5ca8-4955-bcd9-50ba463fc044,India pushes UPI market cap deadline to 2026The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has extended the deadline for applying market share limits on UPI payment apps to December 2026.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/india-pushes-upi-market-cap-deadline-to-2026-2658433-2025-01-02,"In a big move, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has decided to delay the implementation of market share caps for Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment apps by two years, pushing the deadline to December 2026. This decision offers a reprieve to major players like PhonePe and Google Pay, which currently dominate the UPI landscape in India. The NPCI had initially proposed a cap in 2020, aiming to limit any single UPI payment app to a 30 per cent market share. This step was meant to stop any one company from dominating the market and encourage healthy competition. However, as of November 2024, PhonePe, backed by Walmart, commanded approximately 47.8 per cent of UPI transactions, while Google Pay held around 37 per cent. Implementing the cap as scheduled could have led to major disruptions for these platforms and their vast user bases. The decision to postpone the cap is seen as a strategic move to ensure the continued growth and stability of the UPI ecosystem. By extending the deadline, the NPCI aims to provide emerging players with additional time to expand their market presence. In addition to delaying the market share cap, the NPCI has lifted the user limit on WhatsApp Pay, allowing the Meta-owned platform to expand its user base beyond the previous cap of 100 million users in India.  The UPI platform has experienced exponential growth in recent years, with transaction volumes reaching unprecedented levels. In 2024 alone, UPI transactions surged by 46 per cent, totalling 172 billion, up from 118 billion in 2023. This fast adoption underscores the platform's integral role in India's digital payment landscape, making decisions particularly impactful. While the delay offers immediate relief to dominant players, it also underscores the NPCI's commitment to maintaining a fair and competitive environment. By giving more time, the NPCI is trying to stop any one company from taking over the market while managing the challenges of enforcing rules in a fast-changing digital ecosystem. As the new deadline approaches, it will be crucial for leading UPI apps to strategise on diversifying their services and possibly collaborate with emerging players to ensure compliance. For consumers, these developments may lead to a more diversified market with a broader array of choices, potentially offering improved services in the country’s ever-evolving digital payment sector.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

While the launch date will unveil the high-end phone in full glory, the company has confirmed a few specs, giving us a sneak peek into the future. As the latest addition to the company’s premium lineup, the device is expected to bring significant upgrades in terms of design, performance, and features. Here, let's take a look at things we already know. advertisementOnePlus 13 to launch soon: 5 things we already know Design: OnePlus teasers indicate that the OnePlus 13 is up for a design change, as compared to its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. The OnePlus 13 retains the familiar circular rear camera module with three sensors. However, the design now features flat sides and a flat display, replacing the previous curved style. Despite housing a larger battery, the new model is slimmer and lighter than the OnePlus 12. It is also offered in two finish options: leather and glass, catering to different style preferences. In India, it is set to launch in three colourways: Black Eclipse, Arctic Dawn, and Midnight Ocean (leather). The company has also revealed that the smartphone will feature IP68 and IP69 ratings. 
 


Display: Since the OnePlus 13 has already been launched in China, it is said that the Indian variant will mimic the same. So, in China, it comes with a 6.82-inch display, matching its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. It offers a QHD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate for exceptional visuals. The screen impresses with 1,600 nits of standard brightness and a peak of 4,500 nits. Two standout features elevate this model: glove compatibility and dynamic local high refresh rate. The glove-friendly feature ensures effortless use in colder climates, like Delhi in winter. Meanwhile, the adaptive refresh rate optimises performance, adjusting seamlessly for activities like video playback or smooth scrolling. Processor: The OnePlus 13 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, delivering a performance boost of up to 45 per cent than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It runs on OxygenOS 15, built on Android 15, with a strong focus on AI to enhance user productivity and experience. A key component of this AI innovation is Google Gemini, which, combined with OnePlus's fine-tuned algorithms, introduces features like Intelligent Search, AI Detail Boost, AI Unblur, and AI Reflection Eraser. 
 


OxygenOS 15 also brings significant system optimisations freeing up space for users. Beyond AI enhancements, these optimisations improve the phone's overall performance, making it faster and more efficient. This combination of hardware and software positions the OnePlus 13 as a high-performing, user-friendly flagship device.
 


Battery: The OnePlus 13 introduces a significant battery upgrade, featuring a larger 6,000mAh unit compared to the 5,400mAh battery in the OnePlus 12. OnePlus claims this enhancement delivers nearly two days of battery life, though this will be confirmed upon testing when the phone launches in India.
 


Camera: OnePlus has consistently focused on improving its camera technology, and the OnePlus 13 appears to be no exception. The smartphone sports a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, a name synonymous with premium photography. The primary sensor is rumoured to be a 50-megapixel LYT-808 with optical image stabilisation (OIS), accompanied by telephoto and ultrawide lenses, both of which now feature 50-megapixel sensors. This setup is expected to deliver exceptional photography and videography capabilities, including 4K video recording and advanced night mode. On the front, the device may house a 32-megapixel selfie camera with AI enhancements for sharper and more vibrant portraits.
 


OnePlus 13 price expectations in IndiaThe pricing details for the OnePlus 13 remain undisclosed, but it is widely speculated to be priced under Rs 70,000. To provide context, the OnePlus 12 launched in India at a base price of Rs 64,999. Even if OnePlus opts for a modest price increase with its latest flagship, the cost is still expected to fall comfortably within the Rs 70,000 bracket, maintaining its competitive edge in the premium smartphone market.

The smartphone sports a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, a name synonymous with premium photography. The primary sensor is rumoured to be a 50-megapixel LYT-808 with optical image stabilisation (OIS), accompanied by telephoto and ultrawide lenses, both of which now feature 50-megapixel sensors. This setup is expected to deliver exceptional photography and videography capabilities, including 4K video recording and advanced night mode. On the front, the device may house a 32-megapixel selfie camera with AI enhancements for sharper and more vibrant portraits.
 


OnePlus 13 price expectations in India The pricing details for the OnePlus 13 remain undisclosed, but it is widely speculated to be priced under Rs 70,000. To provide context, the OnePlus 12 launched in India at a base price of Rs 64,999. Even if OnePlus opts for a modest price increase with its latest flagship, the cost is still expected to fall comfortably within the Rs 70,000 bracket, maintaining its competitive edge in the premium smartphone market.

Rumours about the device, which will likely follow the Xiaomi 15 series, have surfaced online. If leaks are to be believed, Xiaomi might bring some exciting updates to its camera technology this time around. The Xiaomi 15 and Xiaomi 15 Pro were launched in China back in October 2024, powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. These models feature a Leica-tuned triple rear camera system, headlined by a 50-megapixel main sensor. However, one standout feature was exclusive to the Pro version, i.e., a periscope telephoto camera.  As per tipster Smart Pikachu on Weibo, the rumoured Xiaomi 16 might include a periscope telephoto camera in its standard variant, along with the Pro version. What’s so special about the periscope telephoto lens? It allows you to zoom in on distant objects with minimal loss in quality. In 2024, only the Xiaomi 15 Pro model had this feature. It comprises a 50-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto camera with 10x lossless zoom, along with a 50-megapixel primary sensor, and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera. On the other hand, the standard Xiaomi 15 comes with a 50-megapixel primary camera, a regular telephoto camera, and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle shooter. If the rumours hold true, Xiaomi might be aiming to make this “pro” camera feature more accessible in its next release. The Xiaomi 15 series brought a lot to the table beyond cameras. Both models are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and run on Xiaomi’s HyperOS 2 atop Android 15. They’re also built to last, with an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The standard Xiaomi 15 comes with a 6.36-inch OLED display with a 1.5K resolution and up to 3,200 nits. Meanwhile, the Pro version takes things up a notch with a 2K OLED display. Under the hood, the Xiaomi 15 packs a 5,400mAh battery with 90W wired and 50W wireless charging, while the Pro model has an even bigger 6,100mAh battery with the same charging speeds. To recall, the Xiaomi 15 was launched in China at a starting price of CNY 4,499 (roughly Rs. 53,000), while the Xiaomi 15 Pro was launched at a starting price of CNY 5,299 (roughly Rs 62,000). Both phones are expected to launch in India by March 2025.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

He ended up losing Rs 13 lakh after downloading a malware-laden file under the guise of a KYC update. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/techie-working-with-drdo-loses-rs-13-lakh-while-updating-kyc-for-bank-2658488-2025-01-02,"In yet another case of cyber fraud, scammers managed to dupe a techie of Rs 13 lakh. The victim, employed as a senior technical officer at the Defence Research and Development Organisation in Pune, was contacted by unknown individuals regarding a supposed KYC update linked to his bank account. However, as he followed the instructions, he ended up losing his money from his bank account.  As per the case reported by The Indian Express, the victim, a 57-year-old techie at DRDO, lodged a complaint at the Yerawada police station this week. In his complaint, the victim revealed that in the third week of November, he received a WhatsApp message from an unknown sender, purportedly from a public sector bank. The message falsely claimed that his KYC details were overdue for an update and warned that his bank account would be frozen if he failed to act promptly. Along with the message, the sender also attached a file that they instructed him to download. Thinking it to be a genuine message from the bank to remind users about a KYC update, the victim clicked on the attachment and downloaded the file to his smartphone. However, this file contained a malware application specifically designed by the scammers to grant them remote access to his device. Shortly after downloading the file, the officer received several One-Time Passwords (OTPs) on his phone. However, as the victim was not conducting any transactions on his end at that moment, he ignored these OTP messages. Following the messages, the scammers exploited the remote access granted by the malicious application to siphon Rs12.95 lakh from his bank account. It was only after seeing messages about unauthorised transactions that the victim promptly approached the Pune city cyber police station to report the crime. Following a preliminary investigation, an FIR was registered at the Yerawada police station. According to the police, this is not an isolated case where an individual has lost money after downloading an unknown file. In fact, this case is yet another example of frauds that typically involves cybercriminals tricking victims into downloading files or applications that allow unauthorised access to their devices. Once access is granted, the criminals can manipulate banking and payment applications to drain the victim’s accounts. Given the seriousness of the rising cases of online fraud in India, the cyber cell and police have issued a strong advisory regarding measures to stay safe from lingering cyber scams. To keep yourself safe, here are some safety precautions: – First and foremost, never respond to messages or emails from unidentified numbers or addresses claiming to be from banks or service providers. – If you receive any attachment file or link from an unknown sender, do not click on it unless you cross-check who the sender is. – Always pay attention to OTPs received on your phone, especially if you are not carrying out any transactions.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  India pushes UPI market cap deadline to 2026Also Read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso Read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and more

In China, for instance, OnePlus has already launched the OnePlus Ace 5, featuring a massive 6,415mAh battery, a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and a flat display. Therefore, we anticipate similar specifications for its global counterpart. Here is everything we know so far about the OnePlus 13R, including its rumored specifications and expected price.OnePlus 13R chipset The OnePlus 13R will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, the same chipset which was earlier featured in last generation OnePlus’ flagship device and other premium Android smartphones. This upgrade is expected to offer better performance, efficiency, and AI capabilities, including support for advanced photo editing and note-taking features compared to the OnePlus 12R.OnePlus 13R display  The new-generation OnePlus 13R is also expected to sport a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and an impressive peak brightness of 1,600 nits.OnePlus 13R new colours Notably, the OnePlus 13R is already confirmed to come in two new colour options– Astral Trail and Nebula Noir.

On the right edge, rumours suggest that users will find the volume rocker and power button, while the signature OnePlus alert slider will be on the left.OnePlus 13R camera  Rumors also suggest that the OnePlus 13R will feature a 50-megapixel Sony IMX906 primary sensor with optical image stabilisation, paired with an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens and a 2-megapixel macro sensor. On the front, the phone is likely to get a 16-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. The triple-camera system is expected to deliver better low-light performance and detailed shots.OnePlus 13R battery Under the hood, while the Chinese version of the device, the OnePlus Ace 5, packs a 6,415mAh battery, the Indian variant might slightly reduce the capacity to 6,000mAh. Nonetheless, the phone will support 80W wired fast charging for quick charging support.  Additionally, the OnePlus 13R is rumoured to include extra features like an IR sensor at the top, a USB Type-C port, a SIM card slot, a speaker grille, and a microphone at the bottom. An IP65-rated build is also expected, offering protection against dust and light water exposure.OnePlus 13R pricing in India As for pricing, the OnePlus 13R will undoubtedly be the affordable sibling of the flagship OnePlus 13. Reports suggest the OnePlus 13R will launch in India and select global markets at a starting price of Rs 40,999 for the base variant, making it a strong option for those seeking flagship-level features at a more accessible price point. Meanwhile, the flagship OnePlus 13 is expected to be priced between Rs 67,000 and Rs 70,000.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  Techie working with DRDO loses Rs 13 lakh while updating KYC for bankAlso Read |  India pushes UPI market cap deadline to 2026Also Read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

Here is what happened.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/woman-loses-rs-15-crore-after-ordering-food-for-daughter-2658524-2025-01-02,"A 78-year-old woman from South Mumbai fell victim to a cyber scam and lost Rs 1.5 crore after being tricked by fraudsters posing as the Special Investigation Team of Delhi police, according to a report by TOI. The elderly homemaker, who is related to a well-known builder in the area, was misled into believing she was under investigation for money laundering and drug-related charges. Here is what happened. The incident began a few weeks back when the woman arranged for a courier service to send food to her daughter in the US. The next day, she received a call from someone claiming to be from the courier company. The caller alleged that her package contained more than just food—it reportedly included her Aadhaar card, expired passports, credit cards, and illegal substances, along with USD 2,000 in cash. The fraudsters accused her of being involved in a conspiracy with two other individuals. As part of the elaborate scam, several people posing as officials from various government departments, including the Cyber Crime Branch and the Finance Department, contacted her in the days that followed. They even conducted video calls, appearing in police uniforms and showing her fake documents, such as arrest warrants and investigation reports, to make their claims seem credible. Under pressure, the woman was convinced to reveal her personal banking details because the scammers showed her fake warrants and investigation reports on WhatsApp. Believing she was safeguarding her assets during the ""investigation,"" she transferred Rs 1.51 crore to bank accounts provided by the fraudsters. It wasn’t until she discussed the situation with a family member that she realised she had been tricked. She immediately reported the crime to the Cybercrime Police Helpline and the case was passed on to the South Cyber Cell of the Mumbai Police. Officials noted that the fraudsters used multiple accounts to quickly move the money, making it harder to trace. Cybercrime experts have urged people, particularly the elderly, to be cautious of such scams. They recommend verifying the legitimacy of claims made by unknown callers, avoiding sharing personal information over the phone, and reporting suspicious activity promptly.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 2, 2025

Until now, the feature, accessible via the Good Lock app, has been limited to certain regions and is only available through the Galaxy Store. However, with the release of OneUI 7 in 2025, Good Lock support is set to expand. The app will soon be available to users worldwide, and for the first time, it will be accessible on the Google Play Store. Good Lock has been around for several years, offering users more control over their Samsung Galaxy devices. The app allows users to tweak various aspects of OneUI, including modifying the default Samsung launcher and adding support for running apps on the cover display of devices like the Galaxy Z Flip. The news of Good Lock’s expansion comes as Samsung prepares to roll out OneUI 7, which is in beta for the Galaxy S24 series and is expected to roll out to the Galaxy S25 series upon its launch. For the first time, Good Lock will be available in all countries, making it accessible to a much wider audience.  Until now, users in regions where Good Lock wasn’t available had to find workarounds or rely on different methods, such as sideloading the app from third-party websites. Now, with its new global availability, more users will be able to take advantage of its features, such as customising the user interface, adjusting the layout of apps, and even adding widgets that weren’t previously possible. Additionally, the feature will no longer be restricted to the Galaxy Store; users will be able to download and update Good Lock directly from the Google Play Store. Alongside the new distribution channels, Samsung is also redesigning the Good Lock app itself. The update will focus on improving the overall user interface, making it easier for users to find and manage their customisation options. A new “My Page” tab will be added, allowing users to better organise their settings and preferences. There will also be a filter feature that helps users find specific Good Lock apps more easily. Although Good Lock has been around for a while, the upcoming update will introduce new changes to the way it works with OneUI 7. Some Good Lock apps that weren’t previously compatible with the system will be updated to work with the latest version of Samsung’s software, providing even more options for customisation.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

As the tournament’s official smartphone, the company is putting its best Android devices front and centre for tennis fans worldwide.  The Australian Open is just the latest addition to Google’s growing lineup of sports partnerships. Pixel is already the official smartphone for the NBA, NWSL, and Germany’s Frauen-Bundesliga. It’s also teamed up with UEFA’s European Championships and Premier League powerhouses like Liverpool and Arsenal. Now, by partnering with one of tennis’s biggest events, Google is continuing to push the Pixel brand to a broader audience. But this isn’t just another marketing campaign with a logo slapped on some banners. Google is using the Australian Open to highlight the features that make its Pixel smartphones stand out. Key tools like Gemini, Circle to Search, Magic Eraser, and Magic Editor are all being showcased as part of this partnership. These features are designed to make life easier, whether it’s editing a photo with AI or finding information quickly. To bring these features to life, Google has created an interactive Pixel Studio at Rod Laver Arena, the heart of the Australian Open. This hub lets fans get hands-on experience with the Pixel 9 Pro’s advanced tools. At the Pixel Studio, expert coaches are available to help visitors learn how to capture the perfect action shot or use the phone’s AI-powered editing tools to enhance their photos. It’s a chance for people to see what the Pixel can do in a real-world setting. The Australian Open runs from January 12 to January 26, ending with the men’s singles final. During this time, Google is also rolling out some big deals on its Pixel phones. Starting January 12, fans can look forward to discounts and improved trade-in deals on the Pixel 9 Pro and the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL through the Google Store, depending on whether the Google Store operates in your country — you’ll need to check to confirm. While the exact details of these offers haven’t been revealed yet, more information is expected to come soon. This partnership gives Google a massive platform to show off the Pixel’s top-tier camera and AI features. With millions of folks tuning in to the Australian Open, Google is betting that the combination of on-site experiences and exclusive deals will help boost Pixel’s popularity.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

53e24afb-9b2a-48e2-b452-8e164f25d215,"Acer Swift Edge 16 review: Good performance but at the cost of battery life Laptops with a large screen are often bulky. Acer Swift Edge 16 is not. But this reduction in its heft and weight also comes at a cost as we find in this Acer Swift Edge 16. And no, by cost we do not mean its price. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/acer-swift-edge-16-review-good-performance-but-at-the-cost-of-battery-life-2658716-2025-01-02,"We are a big of light and compact laptops over here at India Today Tech. But as much as we love the 13-inchers, there is no denying that when it comes to work, a bigger screen almost always makes a difference. It’s just so much better to work on a larger laptop. This is probably the reason why the Acer Swift Edge 16 exists — it is a laptop that aims to give users a mix of large-laptop power with the low weight and slim design of a compact machine. And it is incredible how well it succeeds on this particular count.  But success — and there is always a but whenever we are reviewing something — comes at a cost. And by cost we don’t mean the price of the Swift Edge 16. Instead, its design — petite and lightweight as it is — also means a downgrade in certain other aspects of the machine. In other words, the Swift Edge 16 is a laptop where you gain some, and lose some.   To put it another way: The Acer Swift Edge 16 is a 16-inch laptop that not only promises a large OLED screen but is also fairly powerful, featuring the AMD Ryzen 7 chipset with a graphics card. To my surprise, despite its size and plenty of ports — which, by the way, seems to be a deal-breaker for many laptops nowadays that come with just 2 or 3 ports — the Swift Edge 16 is lightweight. In fact, it feels lighter compared to the 13-inch MacBook Air. And the figures reveal why. It weighs just 1.23 kilograms! However, as much as I like the display, the performance, and the portability that the Swift Edge 16 offers, there are some areas that are really off-putting. But first a quick look at its specifications. The Acer Swift Edge 16 that I am reviewing is powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 7840U, a chipset with 8 cores and 16 threads. It comes with a maximum boost speed of 5.1 GHz and the U in its model number indicates that it is an ultra-power-efficient chip.  The laptop comes with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM (5200 MHz) and includes AMD Radeon graphics. Although this graphics chip is Radeon 780M, which is basically an integrated graphics chip with 512MB dedicated video RAM. In other words, while this GPU chip is better than some other chips in slim and petite laptops, you won’t be playing demanding games like the latest Call of Duty at high graphics and FullHD on it.  For storage, the Swift Edge 16 is equipped with a 512GB NVMe SSD. And as its name suggests, the Swift Edge 16 features a 16-inch OLED display offering 3.2K resolution and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.Design and display  The Acer Swift Edge 16, despite being a full-size laptop, is surprisingly lightweight. I carried it every day to work and was easily able to carry it without any hassle in not just my backpack but also in my tote bag. In fact, I found it to be lighter than a 15-inch MacBook Air. However, while its lightweight design is its highlight, what impressed me more about the Swift Edge 16 is its inclusion of multiple ports. You see, one thing I absolutely hate about compact machines is the trend of manufacturers removing ports. For instance, even on premium laptops like MacBooks — which are undoubtedly powerful — you often get as few as two USB-C ports. That's it. This makes carrying a port extender almost essential – and for many users more hassling. However, the Swift Edge 16 has two full-size and high-speed USB-A ports, one HDMI port, two USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD card reader. The ports make the user experience better. 
 


 That said, as handy and lightweight as the Swift Edge 16 is, there's a significant drawback: the build quality. It seems that in making the laptop lightweight, some compromises were made in the build quality. The chassis — made of aluminium alloy — uses somewhat thin sheets of metal and feels a bit plasticky. There is very little heft to the laptop and if you tap on it, it makes a hollow sound. Compared to something like a MacBook, I found the metal and feel of the Swift Edge 16 noticeably inferior. It is also, I find, more prone to scratches. In other words, you do get a magically lightweight laptop in Swift Edge 16 but it comes at a cost. 
 


 I also find that the trackpad, for a laptop this big, was on the smaller side and it too feels a little plasticky to touch. On the other hand, I found the keyboard tactile, and I really enjoyed working on it. While the laptop ships with Windows 11, it does not include the dedicated Copilot key. While this isn't an issue, it does make the Swift Edge 16 feel a bit dated compared to its competitors which include this quick button to access the AI chatbot.
 


 Now the display. It is, in my opinion, the best feature of the Swift Edge 16. The 16-inch OLED screen of the Acer Swift Edge shows crisp and bright visuals while effectively minimising reflections despite its glossy finish. I spent hours working on it and even watching Netflix and YouTube, and the display consistently provided me with vibrant colours and comfortable viewing angles. Even in the bright office lights, or on my work desk when the sun was filtering in, I was able to work without straining my eyes. All in all, while the laptop impresses with its lightweight design, abundance of ports, and bright OLED display, the build quality is a letdown.Good performance, bad battery  The Swift Edge 16 runs on the AMD Ryzen 7 chipset, which is a fairly decent processor. For over two weeks I worked on the laptop for almost 9 hours daily, using various applications, including our content management system, Word processors, web browsers and apps for  image editing and AI. Not once did the laptop lag or slow me down. In fact, even after long working hours and binge watching sessions on YouTube and other OTT apps afterwards, the laptop maintained its performance without heating up — although that was not the case while charging but more on that shortly.  To get some performance numbers and put the words in a context, I ran Cinebench on the Swift Edge 16 and the laptop scored 579 points on multi-core CPU tests and 99 points on single-core. The score makes the Swift Edge 16 a decently powerful laptop, though not exceptionally powerful. However, this machine is not designed for gaming and I am not expecting it to do well in that area — for regular work, it handles everything quite smoothly.
 


 The feature I liked while using the Swift Edge 16 is the inclusion of a fingerprint scanner, integrated with the power button. While the laptop also supports facial recognition, I personally find the fingerprint lock quicker and more reliable. Now, let's talk about the speakers. They are bottom-firing, which means that while the laptop is placed on a table, you can listen to the sound clearly. However, if you're lying in bed and streaming content with the laptop on your lap, the speaker placement means the sound gets muffled. Additionally, the speakers are not  particularly loud and tend to sound slightly squeaky when played at maximum volume. This is another area where I believe the emphasis on the size, weight and slimness of the laptop was prioritised by Acer because a better set of speakers would have invariably added more weight and heft to the machine.  As a result, most of the time, I preferred using external speakers while watching any movie.  Another significant drawback of the Swift Edge 16 for me is its battery life. And again, I believe, the reason is that the Swift Edge 16 puts weight and slimness ahead of a bigger and weightier battery. Battery life, to put it bluntly, is not good at all. In the office, where I work for 8 to 9 hours, I had to charge the laptop 2 to 3 times. It's like every 3 to 4 hours I ended up looking for the charger.  And whenever the laptop was on charging, the fans made a lot of noise. Charging made the laptop’s underbelly heat noticeable. And because the laptop uses a rather thin sheet of metal in its shell this noise was fairly audible. On charging, the Swift Edge 16 whooshed and whooshed. Acer Swift Edge 16 review: Should you buy it? I believe the idea is good: The Acer Swift Edge 16 is a laptop with large — and superb by all measures — screen and fairly capable hardware. And yet it is light as a feather at a weight of just 1.23 kilograms. Usually laptops with 16-inch screen weight around 1.60 to 1.70 kilograms, and that is if they are sleek and slim. So, the idea sure is nice.  But it looks like there is no defeating the laws of physics. If you want a large laptop that is light and slim apparently you do need to compromise on certain aspects. I just don’t like how much of a compromise the Swift Edge 16 does on aspects like battery life and build quality. 
The Swift Edge 16 is not a bad machine — it excels with its display and its performance is fantastic for office and regular work. But its fair share of shortcomings hold it back, particularly in a segment where prices are premium and expectations of consumers are sky high.

Despite being a budget offering, the Moto G05 comes with features that are usually reserved for phones priced under Rs 25,000. With Flipkart confirming key specifications and design details ahead of the official launch, it shows that Motorola aims to shake up the budget segment and give tough competition to Xiaomi’s Redmi A and C series. The Moto G04 was launched at Rs 6,999 and its successor, the Moto G05, is expected to cost around Rs 10,000 because of the big upgrades that it is set to receive. This new model is packed with features like a 90Hz display boasting 1,000 nits of peak brightness, Dolby Atmos sound, a vegan leather finish, water touch technology for using the screen with wet hands, and the latest Android OS with a promise of two years of updates.

Its standout feature is water touch technology, which will allow users to interact with the screen even when wet. The phone’s IP52 rating will likely offer better durability by safeguarding it from minor water exposure. One of the more surprising elements is the inclusion of a vegan leather back panel, a rarity in this price range. This not only gives the Moto G05 a premium aesthetic but also offers a solid grip. Available in Green and Red, the phone features a side-mounted fingerprint scanner and a raised camera island for a modern look. Internally, the Moto G05 is powered by the MediaTek Helio G81 Extreme chipset, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, with support for virtual RAM technology.

A preliminary settlement was filed on Tuesday night in the Oakland, California federal court, and requires approval by US District Judge Jeffrey White. Mobile device owners complained that Apple routinely recorded their private conversations after they activated Siri unintentionally, and disclosed these conversations to third parties such as advertisers. Voice assistants typically react when people use ""hot words"" such as ""Hey, Siri."" Two plaintiffs said their mentions of Air Jordan sneakers and Olive Garden restaurants triggered ads for those products. Another said he got ads for a brand name surgical treatment after discussing it, he thought privately, with his doctor. The class period runs from September 17, 2014 to December 31, 2024. It began when Siri incorporated the ""Hey, Siri"" feature that allegedly led to the unauthorised recordings. Class members, estimated in the tens of millions, may receive up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, such as iPhones and Apple Watches. Apple denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. The Cupertino, California-based company and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to similar requests. They may seek up to $28.5 million in fees, plus $1.1 million for expenses, from the settlement fund. The $95 million is about nine hours of profit for Apple, whose net income was $93.74 billion in its latest fiscal year. A similar lawsuit on behalf of users of Google's Voice Assistant is pending in the San Jose, California federal court, in the same district as the Oakland court. The plaintiffs are represented by the same law firms as in the Apple case. The case is Lopez et al v.

After months of waiting, OnePlus’ upcoming flagship smartphone will officially launch worldwide on January 7. For those who don’t know, the OnePlus 13 made its first appearance in October, followed by the OnePlus Ace 5 aka the OnePlus 13R, which was released just before 2024 wrapped up. Both models have been getting a lot of attention, but now there’s something else for fans to look forward to — new accessories. And these aren’t your regular cases and covers. If the latest leaks are accurate, OnePlus will bring something fresh to the table. According to Sudhanshu Ambhore on X, the OnePlus 13 series cases come with new features and fresh materials. What caught everyone’s eye is that these cases are magnetic, which at first, doesn’t sound groundbreaking, but let’s break it down. Considering these cases are from the company itself, they should snap onto the phone effortlessly and work with other magnetic accessories, like chargers and mounts. Similar to how MagSafe cases work on iPhones with wireless chargers and mounts.

 Speaking of wireless charging, you’ll be happy to know that these magnetic cases are expected to be compatible with Qi2 chargers. Qi2 is the next big thing in wireless charging, offering a more reliable and efficient experience. But the benefits of magnetic cases don’t stop there. They can also work with other handy add-ons, like grips, straps, wallets, car mounts, and desk stands. 
As for the design, OnePlus seems to be sticking to materials that fans already love. Leaks suggest these cases will come in Sandstone, Aramid Fiber, and Wood Grain finishes. If you’ve been a OnePlus fan for a while, you’ll probably recognise these textures, as the brand has used them in the past. But coming back to the magnetic properties of the cases, it’s interesting to see how the Android world is catching up with Apple’s MagSafe. Apple has been offering magnetic accessories for years, with the iPhone 12 from 2020 being the first iPhone to support the new MagSafe wireless charger introduced at the time. However, it’s good to see brands like OnePlus stepping up with their own take on magnetic wireless charging all while aligning with the Qi2 standards.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

But, the recent rumour claims that 2026 might end this pattern by bringing Samsung for the role. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-might-replace-sonys-camera-sensor-on-iphones-2659022-2025-01-03,"Apple has been using Sony's camera sensor for the longest period of time. However, lately, rumours have started churning claiming this might change soon. Last year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that with the iPhone 18 (set to release in 2026), the Sony camera sensor pattern might change. And now, a new leak backs this story. The most recent report indicates that Samsung is developing a 3-layer stacked camera sensor for Apple, which is expected to enhance the performance of upcoming iPhone cameras.advertisementSamsung camera sensor for iPhone 18 The leakster, @Jukanlosreve, took to X (formerly Twitter), claiming that Samsung will replace the Sony camera sensors. He said that Samsung is currently working on a 3-layer stacked image sensor for Apple. 
 


Samsung is said to be planning a three-layer configuration for its processor, stacked against the sensor. The mention of a PD-TR-Logic setup refers to the following layers: Photodiode layer (PD), Transfer layer (TR), and the Logic layer.

 Samsung is said to be planning a three-layer configuration for its processor, stacked against the sensor. The mention of a PD-TR-Logic setup refers to the following layers: Photodiode layer (PD), Transfer layer (TR), and the Logic layer.  The Photodiode layer initially captures light, while the Transfer layer is responsible for reducing noise—this aspect is reportedly new in Samsung's sensor. Finally, the Logic layer handles the computational photography of the iPhone. Similarly, Kuo has also claimed something similar. He said that Samsung was expected to make at least one of the sensors for the iPhone 18 in 2026. He added, ""Samsung is expected to begin shipping 1/2.6-inch 48MP ultra-wide CMOS image sensors (CIS) to Apple for iPhones as early as 2026, breaking Sony’s years-long monopoly on supplying CIS to Apple. To this end, Samsung has established a dedicated team to serve Apple."" iPhone 18: What do we know so far The recent leaks claim that Apple is aiming to bring a bezel-less display for at least one model of the iPhone 18 series.  This would mean the entire front of the phone would feature a smooth, continuous display without any visible bezels or edges. Although Apple took steps towards this idea with the iPhone X in 2017, advancements since then have been slow, with smaller bezels but no full removal.  Another leak suggests that the iPhone 18 series will be the one to step into the foldable phone universe.  iPhone 18 should debut in 2026, but there is no official notification so far.

Now, fresh rumours suggest Samsung is doubling down on this feature for its next flagship, the Galaxy S25 Ultra.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/galaxy-s25-ultra-rumoured-to-feature-corning-gorilla-armor-2-with-improved-anti-reflective-coating-2659075-2025-01-03,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, launched in January 2024, introduced Corning's new Gorilla Armor glass, touted as the toughest Gorilla Glass at the time. This advanced glass not just stood out for its impressive protection against drops and scratches, but also its anti-reflective coating, making the S24 Ultra’s screen the least reflective in smartphone history. For users, this was a disruptor, improving visibility and usability, especially outdoors. Now, fresh rumours suggest Samsung is doubling down on this feature for its next flagship. According to Ice Universe, a reliable leaker on X (formerly Twitter), the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra will be the first and only phone to use Corning’s second-generation Gorilla Glass Armor. The new version is expected to retain the anti-reflective properties that made the S24 Ultra unique but may take things even further with better durability and enhanced reflection reduction. If true, this could further solidify Samsung’s reputation for leading display technology.

 For the unaware, anti-reflective coatings might not sound exciting at first. But the difference they make is easy to spot. Just put the S24 Ultra next to any other smartphone, and you'll notice how much less glare and reflection there is on Samsung’s flagship. This isn’t just about aesthetics — it’s a practical feature too. Less reflection means the screen looks brighter without needing to crank up the brightness levels. This is great for saving battery life, and it’s a big help for anyone who struggles with glare, whether due to sunlight or sensitivity to light. The same could be true for the Galaxy S25 Ultra if this rumour pans out. While specific details about the second-generation Gorilla Glass Armor haven’t been confirmed, it’s safe to assume that Corning will have refined its formula to make the new glass even tougher and more effective at reducing reflections. 
Samsung has been leaning into unique selling points like this to set its flagship phones apart. While competitors focus on megapixels and fast charging, Samsung seems determined to give users practical advantages they can see and feel. For the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the inclusion of improved Gorilla Glass Armor could be one such edge. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to launch on 22nd January 2025, though Samsung hasn’t officially announced the date yet. Rumours suggest that the S25 Ultra will drop the boxy look of the S24 Ultra in favour of slight curves around the corners. The phone is also expected to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset under the hood, and may also come with a 16GB RAM option for the first time on a flagship Samsung smartphone.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

1f027bff-20e5-4234-a724-80de4e4c2720,"Telegram introduces third-party verification to combat scams on the platformTelegram has recently announced a plethora of new features, including third-party verification that aims to curb scams on the platform. This comes after the application and CEO Pavel Durov were charged in September 2024. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/telegram-introduces-a-third-party-verification-to-curb-scams-on-the-platform-2659064-2025-01-03,"Telegram, a global messaging platform, has unveiled a third-party verification system to enhance security and transparency. This initiative is designed to combat scams and reduce misinformation, addressing longstanding concerns over the platform's misuse by bad actors. In recent years, Telegram has faced criticism for its vulnerability to fraudulent activities, including phishing schemes, fake investment channels, cyber-bullying, and more. But now, the company has a new verification system that allows public figures and organisations to obtain verified badges, enabling users to quickly identify legitimate sources of information. In order to enhance transparency, Telegram now supports official third-party services that can assign additional verification icons to user accounts and chats. This decentralised approach introduces a proactive solution to prevent scams, setting a new standard for safety on social platforms. This system operates independently of Telegram's existing verification process. Instead of the traditional blue checkmark, accounts and chats verified through third-party services will feature a distinct icon displayed to the left of their name. By clicking on the profile of a third-party verified account or chat, users can view details about the verifying service and the reasons for the verification.
 


 Verified accounts will be clearly marked, providing users with confidence in their authenticity. This feature is expected to benefit businesses, influencers, and public entities, ensuring secure and trustworthy interactions. The platform will also include enhanced reporting tools for flagging suspicious accounts, strengthening its efforts to mitigate fraudulent activity. 
 


 The update follows recent challenges for Telegram, including the arrest of CEO Pavel Durov by French authorities over allegations of enabling illegal activity on the platform. In response, Telegram has revised its privacy policy, disabled features prone to misuse, and adopted a more proactive stance on moderation. Durov also revealed that Telegram achieved profitability last year, with total revenue exceeding $1 billion.   In addition to the verification update, Telegram is introducing several new features. These include advanced search filters to simplify finding specific chats, the ability to scan QR codes using the app’s built-in camera on both iOS and Android, and a feature that allows users to convert digital gifts into NFTs. Telegram stated in its blog, ""The search bar in your chat list lets you quickly find messages from any of your chats. Results in the 'Chats' tab now have extra filters that let you refine the list to show results only from private chats, group chats or channels.""  Along with these features, the company has also announced that Telegram's profitability in 2024 was driven by its Premium subscriptions, privacy-conscious ads, and Telegram Stars.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  Government denies claims that IT dept accesses DigiYatra data to check for tax evasionAlso read |  Apple to pay $95 million to settle Siri privacy lawsuitAlso read |  Blinkit starts ambulance service, says within 10 minutes of booking it will send ambulance

While there’s been plenty of buzz around the Pro model, details about the standard Poco X7 have been harder to come by. Now, courtesy of a Geekbench listing, we’ve got a closer look at what the vanilla Poco X7 might bring to the table. According to a leaked Geekbench listing, the Poco X7 scored 1,032 points in single-core tests and 2,926 in multi-core. The phone is powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 7300 Ultra processor, which is paired with 8GB of RAM in the prototype tested. These numbers suggest decent performance, especially for a mid-range device, though the final retail version could offer other memory options as well.  The software side of things might disappoint some fans, though. The Poco X7 is expected to ship with HyperOS atop Android 14, even though Android 15 has been available for a few months now. This was also the case with the recently launched Poco M7 Pro. You can read our review here. The model spotted on Geekbench is the version heading to India, carrying the model number 24095PCADI. For those familiar with Xiaomi’s naming patterns, the “I” at the end confirms it’s intended for the Indian market. Certification listings in various regions had already hinted at the Poco X7’s arrival, and now this benchmark gives us a better idea of what to expect under the hood. The Poco X7 Pro, on the other hand, has garnered more attention in the run-up to the launch. It’s believed to be a rebranded version of the Redmi Turbo 4, which was recently unveiled in China. If that’s the case, the Pro model will likely feature a more powerful chipset and other premium features, leaving the standard Poco X7 to serve as a more budget-friendly option. Based on the official promotional materials shared by Poco on X (formerly Twitter), we have a clear idea of the design for both the Poco X7 and X7 Pro. The Poco X7 is set to feature a triple-lens setup on the back, while the X7 Pro will sport a dual-lens configuration. Additionally, both devices are expected to feature a striking two-tone design, combining yellow and black colours. With just a few days to go until the big reveal, it’ll be interesting to see how Poco positions the X7 and X7 Pro. For now, the Geekbench listing gives us a small glimpse of what’s coming, and fans of the Poco brand have reason to be excited.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Here is what Apple is likely to launch in 2025 Apple is rumoured to launch a new budget iPhone, possibly named iPhone 16e, in 2025, instead of the anticipated iPhone SE 4. The device is expected to feature design and performance upgrades including A18 series chip, first in-house modem chip and more. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se4-or-iphone-16e-here-is-what-apple-is-likely-to-launch-in-2025-2659108-2025-01-03,"Rumors about the possible iPhone SE 4 have been swirling for months, with reports from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggesting a launch by the end of March 2025 or early April. While these reports support the possibility of Apple releasing a new budget iPhone, some suggest that the Cupertino-based company might not launch the iPhone SE 4 at all but introduce a device named the iPhone 16e instead. According to a recent post by Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter), the leaker revealed that the so-called iPhone SE 4 might debut as the iPhone 16e. This aligns with Apple’s potential plan to tie the budget smartphone to its flagship iPhone 16 lineup, which includes the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max. Majin Bu is not the only source hinting at this name change. Just a few days ago, Chinese leaker Fixed Focus Digital shared similar insights on Weibo, adding weight to the claim and pointing to a strategic branding shift. However, it should be noted that Apple has not confirmed this name change, nor has the company provided any hints about the upcoming launch. So, will it be the iPhone SE 4, the successor to the iPhone SE 3, or the newly named iPhone 16e? Only the official launch will confirm. Meanwhile, regarding specifications, numerous rumors and renders suggest that the new affordable iPhone will bring significant changes compared to its predecessor.iPhone SE 4 design inspired by iPhone 14 Reports indicate that the iPhone SE 4—or iPhone 16e—will feature a design refresh. Ditching the dated iPhone 8-inspired look, the SE is expected to adopt a design similar to the iPhone XR or iPhone 14. This includes a 6.06-inch OLED display, a major upgrade from the 4.7-inch LCD screen found on the iPhone SE 3. The shift to OLED will offer users richer colours and deeper contrasts. Another major design change rumoured for the iPhone SE 4 is the elimination of the Touch ID home button. Instead, it is expected to feature Face ID, aligning it with Apple’s flagship devices and enhancing security. Apple may also slim down the bezels on the iPhone SE 4 for a more immersive user experience.Powered by the A18 series chip Under the hood, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to run on Apple’s latest A18 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM—double that of its predecessor. This hardware upgrade promises not only a powerful performance boost but also support for Apple Intelligence features, including advanced AI and machine learning applications. The phone is also likely to include 128GB of base storage to meet modern user needs. Additionally, the iPhone SE 4 is rumoured to be the first Apple device to use the company’s in-house 5G modem, reducing reliance on Qualcomm Snapdragon modems.Big camera upgrades The iPhone SE 4 is also expected to see significant camera upgrades. Rumours suggest it will feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, a substantial improvement over the 12-megapixel camera on the iPhone SE 3. This enhanced sensor, combined with a Fusion lens, is anticipated to deliver high-quality images and improved 2x zoom capabilities.Pricing and availability in India Despite the upgrades, pricing rumours suggest the iPhone SE 4 could debut at around $500 in the U.S. (approximately Rs 42,700), according to a report by a Korean outlet citing a Japanese carrier. This aligns with Apple’s strategy of keeping the device affordable while offering substantial improvements. For comparison, the iPhone SE 3 launched in India at Rs 43,900. Given the typical price gap between India and the U.S., the iPhone SE 4 could be priced between Rs 49,900 and Rs 53,900 in India.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  Blinkit starts ambulance service, says within 10 minutes of booking it will send ambulanceAlso Read |  Acer Swift Edge 16 review: Good performance but at the cost of battery lifeAlso Read |  Huawei launches Watch GT5 Pro in India, comes with ECG and up to 14 days battery life

c15a5f9e-1320-4a9c-84e1-1b77e2b22535,Brushing scam now makes buzz as it targets online shoppers: everything you need to knowA new online scam known as the 'Brushing Scam' is targeting unsuspecting online shoppers by sending unsolicited packages and posting fake reviews. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/brushing-scam-now-makes-buzz-as-it-targets-online-shoppers-everything-you-need-to-know-2659172-2025-01-03,"We all love online shopping. It’s convenient, time-saving, and often helps you get the best deals and discounts. However, as many people are busy making their purchases online, scammers are also looking for ways to trick them for personal gain. You see, most of us rely on product reviews and ratings to decide whether to buy something from an e-commerce site. And reportedly scammers are manipulating reviews and faking popularity to generate fake sales in a new scam called the ""Brushing Scam."" Brushing scam is a deceptive online practice in which scammers send fake products to people and then post reviews under their names online. The term “brushing” originates from Chinese e-commerce practices where sellers increase their product ratings by creating fake orders and reviews. The scam involves sellers sending unsolicited packages to random users of e-commerce sites. These packages often contain cheap, low-quality items such as costume jewelry, small gadgets, or even seeds. Once the package is delivered, the scammers write 5 star  reviews using the recipient’s name on the product page in order to boost the product's visibility and fake popularity on platforms like Amazon and AliExpress. According to the McAfee report, this scam is aimed at manipulating sales figures and creating an illusion of quality and demand for products on e-commerce sites. For legitimate buyers, this practice is misleading, leading them to make purchases based on fake reviews rather than genuine customer feedback. But if users are getting free products, how harmful can it really be? Well, through this scam scammers are exploiting your sensitive data and can even steal your money if you do not take precautions.  As mentioned, scammers are boosting the popularity of products by sending unsolicited parcels, using the names and addresses of unsuspecting e-commerce users. And they are able to obtain this information through data breaches or illegal purchases of personal data. Receiving such a package could indicate that your personal information has been compromised, posing significant risks such as identity theft and other privacy violations. Beyond identity theft and misleading reviews, a report by ABC Action News reveals that many unsolicited packages now include QR codes urging recipients to scan them. Scammers use enticing messages like, “Scan this QR code to leave a review and win a $500 gift card.” Scanning these QR codes can lead to malicious websites designed to steal sensitive information or install malware on your device. The stolen personal data can then be used for financial fraud or phishing attacks.How to protect yourself from brushing scams To safeguard yourself from brushing scams and avoid receiving fraudulent parcels: Do not scan random QR codes: Avoid scanning QR codes included in unsolicited packages, especially from unknown senders. Protect your e-commerce account: Update your login credentials on e-commerce platforms and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. Report the incident: If you receive such a package, report it to the e-commerce platform and local authorities.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  iPhone SE4 or iPhone 16e?

Sanders’ statement comes amid a heated debate over using the H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire skilled workers from abroad. In a statement released on Thursday, Sanders, a long-time advocate for workers’ rights, said Musk’s support for the H-1B visa program is not about filling a talent gap but rather about reducing labour costs. The influential US politician also argued that major companies like Tesla are using the program to replace well-paying American jobs with cheaper labour from countries like India. He added that this undermines local workers and benefits billionaires. ""Elon Musk is wrong,"" Sanders posted on X. ""The H-1B visa program’s primary purpose is not to bring in the best and the brightest, but to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage labour from abroad,"" he added. Sanders called for reforms to the program so that American workers are not displaced.
 


 Musk, who has long defended the use of H-1B visas, recently stated that there is a shortage of highly skilled tech workers in the US, making foreign talent essential for companies like Tesla and SpaceX. He highlights that many of the engineers who have helped build these companies came to the US through the H-1B program. However, Sanders countered this argument, pointing out that Tesla laid off over 7,500 American workers earlier this year, despite continuing to employ H-1B visa holders. Sanders further questioned Tesla's hiring practices, noting that some H-1B visa holders were employed in roles like associate accountants and mechanical engineers with salaries that do not reflect the highly specialised positions Musk claims the program is meant for. Sanders claimed that such positions should be filled by qualified American workers first. The debate over the H-1B program has intensified in recent weeks, with political figures like Laura Loomer and Steve Bannon criticising the program for not prioritising American workers. Meanwhile, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a close ally of Musk, has defended the need for foreign workers, arguing that the US must improve its education system to produce a highly skilled workforce capable of filling these roles. Musk has also made it clear that he supports the H-1B visa program because the US is facing a shortage of top-tier engineering talent. Former President Donald Trump also weighed in, expressing support for H-1B visas, saying that the US needs to attract smarter individuals to strengthen its economy.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 3, 2025

But is it truly a disruptive force in the market, or is there more to the story?",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/snapdragon-8-elite-for-just-rs-55000-is-iqoo-13-too-good-to-be-true-2659291-2025-01-03,"Among all the latest flagship phones that have arrived or are yet to arrive, the iQOO 13 stands tall, especially when you factor in — price to performance ratio. For starters, this phone retails in the sub-Rs 60,000 price segment in India. But, don’t let the price fool you, because this phone has every ingredient to make it go toe-to-toe with premium offerings from the house of Apple and Samsung. The base variant of this phone with ample 12GB RAM and 256GB storage is priced at Rs 54,999. It packs the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset — the very same processor expected to power the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 series. At first glance, the iQOO 13 seems almost too good to be true, a flagship device at a price that undercuts its competitors by tens of thousands. But is it truly a disruptive force in the market, or is there more to the story? Let’s start with the elephant in the room — performance. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s top-tier offering, promising blazing-fast performance, good energy efficiency, and superior AI processing capabilities compared to the 8 Gen 3 chip. On the iQOO 13, this processor is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. So, whether you’re gaming, multitasking, or pushing the phone to its limits with resource-heavy apps, the iQOO 13 handles it all effortlessly. And this is where the comparison with the Galaxy S25 series becomes interesting. Samsung’s next-gen flagship is rumoured to feature the same Snapdragon 8 Elite, but the base model might start at around Rs 80,000, with the Ultra variant expected to stretch past Rs 1.5 lakh. The question naturally arises — why pay almost double for essentially the same core performance?  Of course, raw power isn’t the only metric for a great smartphone. Features like display quality, cameras, battery life, and design matter just as much. Here, the iQOO 13 doesn’t disappoint. Its 6.82-inch AMOLED display, with a stunning 144Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 4,500 nits, is a visual treat. Watching videos, scrolling through social media, or gaming feels buttery smooth. While devices like the Galaxy S25 Ultra are expected to offer similarly impressive displays, they don’t have a significant edge — at least not enough to justify such a stark price difference. Then there’s the camera setup. The iQOO 13 comes with a triple-camera system featuring three 50-megapixel sensors. In an age where many phone manufacturers have moved to Sony’s LYTIA sensors, the iQOO 13 sticks to the Sony IMX921 sensor for the main camera. For what it’s worth, this phone can also shoot up to 8K videos. Even the 32-megapixel front-facing camera, which supports 4K video recording, punches above its weight. For instance, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and its camera setup headlined by a 200-megapixel primary snapper, might win on sheer numbers, or to be honest, even in most scenarios when it comes to photography. But how much of a difference will this make for the average user? Most of us post photos on social media, and the iQOO 13’s camera is more than capable of delivering eye-catching shots.  Battery life and charging are other areas where the iQOO 13 shines. There’s a massive 6,150mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of heavy use. Even better, the 120W fast charging — and yes, you get the 120W charging brick in the box — means you can go from zero to full charge in about 30 minutes. For someone like me who’s always on the go, this kind of fast charging is a lifesaver. This kind of fast charging is also one of the prime reasons why OnePlus 12 was my daily driver in 2024, as opposed to the likes of Galaxies or iPhones. But, coming back to the iQOO 13, and what truly sets it apart, though, is how it packs in premium features without cutting corners. You get stereo speakers, an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner, connectivity options like Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4, and IP68 water and dust resistance — you name the features, and it is probably there on the iQOO 13. All this while managing to include a sleek, durable design, with glass on the back and a shiny aluminium frame. These are features that many high-end flagships talk about, yet iQOO offers them at a relatively lower price point. Now, all of this raises an important question — why does the iQOO 13 cost so much less for a flagship phone? Of course, one might suspect that something is missing, but after using the device for a while, I have honestly struggled to find any major compromises. Perhaps the answer lies in iQOO’s aggressive pricing strategy, which was the case with the iQOO 12 as well. By offering top-tier specs at an accessible price, iQOO is clearly aiming to disrupt the dominance of Samsung, Apple, or even the likes of OnePlus. Of course, no phone is perfect. The iQOO 13 lacks the extensive ecosystem integration that brands like Samsung and Apple excel at. If you’re someone who’s deeply embedded in the Galaxy ecosystem with devices like the Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Buds, a high-end Samsung Galaxy might still make more sense for you. Similarly, Apple’s ecosystem is a whole different ballgame, and the iPhone’s seamless connectivity with Macs, iPads, and AirPods is something that has been hard for brands like even Samsung to replicate, let alone iQOO.  So, is the iQOO 13 too good to be true? Well, for those who prioritise value for money, the iQOO 13 is worth consideration. It challenges the notion that a flagship smartphone must cost upwards of Rs 80,000. This device is a clear example that you can still buy a flagship smartphone with top-notch features without burning a hole in your pocket.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also read |  iQOO 13 review: Flagship phone at not-so-flagship priceAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and moreAlso read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

f25f8c83-26a6-41b7-a4a3-d994cb2fb4be,"Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0 review: Good looks, average sound The Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0 evokes nostalgia. Its vintage design feels like it has traveled straight from the past. But as a speaker it must deliver more than just good looks — and on the sound it struggles to the right note.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/swiss-military-retro-classic-10-review-good-looks-average-sound-2659372-2025-01-03,"Swiss Military speaker? Yes, they do make them along with the outdoor gear like rugged bags. This is a brand that is well recognised, albeit not for its gadgets. This made me particularly excited about reviewing the Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0. This excitement only grew when I took it out of the box and its looks instantly transported me back to my childhood when I used to sit beside my grandpa for hours as he tuned into the radio and connected to All India Radio to listen to Ramyun, Geet Mala, and other programs. The wooden design, vintage aesthetics, and most notably the antenna — yes, this vintage speaker comes with an antenna — were enough to start a journey into nostalgia. So, full marks to Retro Classic 1.0 as far as first impressions go.  But then as they say. Don’t go by the looks, let them also speak a few words before you make an impression of someone. Apparently, the same is true for speakers. At the end of the day what matters is how well they sing. And on that count, the Retro Classic 1.0 doesn’t score all that well. While I have reviewed many speakers with a vintage theme, like the Marshall Middleton and another speaker from Boult recently, the Military Retro Classic 1.0 clearly has gotten the vibes right. But you cannot just spend Rs 1,799 bucks solely on the vibes? A speaker has to be a speaker. So, I spent a week trying to figure it out and played hundreds of songs on the Retro Classic 1.0. But before we dive deeper into what it offers, here’s a quick look at the specs. The Retro Classic Wireless Bluetooth speaker features a 10-watt Class D amplifier with versatile connectivity options, including Bluetooth, a 3.5mm jack, USB 2.0, and FM stereo. It also promises up to 6 hours of continuous playback on battery, something that goes in its favour. It's a looker As I said earlier, the Swiss Military Retro Classic stands out because of its design. It features a wooden-box finish with a plasticky mesh on the front of the speaker and an antenna, reminiscent of the old-time radios we used to have at home. The speaker also comes with a wide faux leather strap that makes it easier to carry and, of course, adds an extra vintage touch to the design. For me, though, it’s the antenna that truly stands out. With the new tech and gadgets that don't need a physical antenna to connect with the network, I honestly can’t remember the last time I bought a gadget with an antenna. So, the antenna at the back is definitely what gives the Swiss Military Retro Classic its distinct look and more vintage look.
 


 On the back, this Bluetooth speaker also includes several connectivity options: a USB-C port that can be used for both connecting and charging, a USB port, an SD card slot, and an AUX port. While I really like the design and the availability of so many connectivity ports, the speaker doesn’t look premium. It lacks proper finishing. I understand that with the wooden box finish, the speaker aims for a vintage aesthetic, but the quality of the plastic and wooden frame feels cheap. Additionally, the faux leather strap is not of great quality and I could see the edges of the strap already fraying. 
 


To put it another way, it looks vintage and feels vintage — like something you just pulled out of the attic. But probably too vintage once you take into account the materials, build, and finish. Sounds okay. But just okayThe Swiss Military Retro Classic sounds okay. The audio is clear but lacks depth, and if you like bass-heavy music, or treble, this speaker will disappoint you. Although the volume is decent, making it a good portable speaker to turn on for casual listening. In other words, if you’re looking for a rich music experience, this speaker won’t deliver that.
 


advertisementI tried the other connectivity options, and the most impressive — and worth mentioning — is the FM. Given that even smartphones are phasing out the FM feature, tuning into FM channels like the good old days makes this retro speaker truly fulfils its purpose.However, while the sound didn’t impress me here, the battery life really stood out. With normal use —say 1 to 2 hours a day — the device lasts for about a week. Additionally, it has an auto power-off feature, meaning that if you disconnect your phone but forget to turn off the speaker, it powers itself off to save battery.
 


Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0: should you buy it?If you’re in the market for a budget speaker with a vintage design, the Swiss Military Retro Classic 1.0 is worth checking out. Primarily because of how affordable it is. I mean it costs just Rs 1,799. For the price it offers a good design, okay build quality and okay sound. It not only features a retro look but also includes functional features like FM and design elements such as the antenna that make it feel like a classic FM radio from the past.Additionally, the speaker offers impressive battery life and a range of connectivity options, making it convenient to use with various devices. But do keep in mind its sound quality. That is unlikely to delight anyone, which makes it difficult for me to fully recommend Retro Classic 1.0. There are other speakers in the market in a similar price range which might be boring looking but they deliver a somewhat meatier sound.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  Brushing scam now makes buzz as it targets online shoppers: everything you need to knowAlso Read |  iPhone SE4 or iPhone 16e?

For Indian customers, the big question is whether the iPhone SE 4 can remain under the Rs 50,000 mark.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-may-cost-more-than-its-predecessor-2659777-2025-01-04,"The iPhone SE 4 is expected to arrive early next year as a follow-up to the iPhone SE (2022), also known as the iPhone SE 3. While Apple hasn’t officially confirmed its plans to launch the next iPhone SE, recent leaks have provided details on what to expect from Apple’s upcoming smartphone. Additionally, a leak from South Korea also suggests that there might be a price hike for the iPhone SE 4.  According to a South Korean blog post, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to cost slightly more than KRW 8,00,000 (roughly Rs 46,000). Globally, the phone is tipped to be priced under $500 (roughly 43,000). An earlier rumour placed its price between $499 (roughly Rs 43,000) and $549 (roughly Rs 47,000. This is a noticeable jump from the launch price of the iPhone SE 3, which debuted at $429 or Rs 43,900 in India. However, after just a few months, the Indian price of the SE 3 rose to Rs 49,900. The iPhone SE 4 is rumoured to borrow its design from the iPhone 14, moving away from the dated look of its predecessor. This means a 6.1-inch OLED display, a notch and the addition of Face ID for unlocking the device. If true, it would be a big step up from the 4.7-inch LCD screen and Touch ID found in the iPhone SE 3. Under the hood, the phone is expected to be powered by Apple’s A18 chip, the same processor that also powers the iPhone 16 models. Additionally, the iPhone SE 4 could also feature 8GB RAM, another big improvement over its predecessor. One of the standout features of the iPhone SE 4 is its rumoured 5G connectivity, powered by Apple’s first in-house 5G modem. Until now, Apple has relied on Qualcomm for its modems, but this move would make the iPhone SE 4 the first phone to use Apple’s own 5G chip. However, this innovation could come with a price increase. For Indian customers, the big question is whether the iPhone SE 4 can remain under the Rs 50,000 mark. With its upgraded features, including a 48-megapixel camera, 6.1-inch OLED display, and a USB-C port for charging, it might be tough for Apple to keep the cost low. If the price starts at Rs 49,900, similar to the revised price of the SE 3, the phone could still appeal to those looking for an affordable iPhone with modern features.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

The latest buzz gives us a closer look at the possible colour options for both the standard Galaxy S25 and the high-end Galaxy S25 Ultra. A new report suggests the Galaxy S25 series will be available in up to seven colours, including a couple of eye-catching blue shades. Images shared by Gizmochina show the Galaxy S25 and S25 Ultra sporting Spigen's Crystal Flex cases. The renders highlight the blue colour variants of the phones, each having slightly different tones. Also, leaks have pointed out that the standard Galaxy S25 could come in a shade called Icy Blue, which sports a deeper shade of blue. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, on the other hand, might sport a more subtle Titanium Blue finish, which is sleek and understated. These colour leaks tie in with earlier details shared by tipster, Ishan Agarwal. He mentioned that the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus might launch in shades like Silver Shadow, Mint, Icy Blue, and Navy. Meanwhile, the Ultra model could feature a more premium palette, including Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium White Silver, and Titanium Silver Blue. While Samsung’s website will likely offer additional colours, it’s worth noting that availability could vary depending on your region.
Beyond colours, the leaks reveal a bit more about the design of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The phone is expected to feature rounded corners and incredibly slim bezels, giving it a sleek appearance. However, it’s important to remember that these are just renders, so the final product might look slightly different. One of the more interesting parts of this leak involves the inclusion of a MagSafe-style ring on the back of the Galaxy S25 series. This addition, visible through the transparent Spigen cases, looks very similar to what we’ve seen on iPhones since the iPhone 12 series. Interestingly, it’s rumoured that the Galaxy S25 series might not support Qi2 wireless charging straight out of the box. Instead, users may need to rely on accessories like the Spigen case to enable this functionality. Again, this mirrors the trends we’ve seen from other Android manufacturers, who are adopting similar approaches. While it’s always wise to take leaks with a pinch of salt, these details give us a good idea of what to expect when the phones officially launch. The Galaxy S25 series is rumoured to launch on January 22. All the phones are expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Oppo claims the phones feature a premium aluminum frame, a sculpted rear panel, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for added protection. Teaser images also emphasize the use of “aerospace-grade aluminum” in the device's construction. The teaser visuals reveal that the Reno 13 series 5G will include a flat display and a triple-camera setup. Compared to its predecessor, the Reno 12, the camera module appears to have undergone a redesign. The rear camera layout features two vertically aligned lenses, accompanied by a third lens placed to the side, forming a triangular arrangement. Additionally, the camera module incorporates an LED flash designed as a ring light, aligning with modern design trends. While details about the Indian variant remain scarce, the Reno 13 series has already debuted in China, offering a glimpse of its possible specifications.

With only a day left before the big event, the company has revealed a few details about the features and upgrades these new devices will bring. Here’s everything we know so far about the OnePlus 13 series, from the design changes to the expected prices. The OnePlus 13 is expected to cost under Rs 70,000 for its base variant, while the OnePlus 13R is likely to launch at under Rs 50,000 altogether. The increase in price for the OnePlus 13 is reportedly due to the higher cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, but we’ll have to wait for the official announcement to confirm the exact figures.  When it comes to design, both the OnePlus 13 and 13R are moving away from the curved displays of their predecessors and adopting flat sides, giving them a fresh look. The familiar circular camera module remains, but the design element that connected the camera bump to the phone’s frame is no longer there. This gives the phones a cleaner and more minimalistic appearance. Another interesting change is that the OnePlus 13 will now come in two finishes — vegan leather and glass. Both versions will offer impressive IP68 and IP69 ratings, ensuring dust and water resistance. However, the more affordable OnePlus 13R will not include the vegan leather finish or the same level of water resistance. In terms of specifications, both phones will pack a massive 6,000mAh battery, promising long-lasting performance, and they will support fast charging. The key difference between the two models lies in the chipset. The OnePlus 13 will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest and greatest — Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13R will feature the last-generation Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is also a strong contender in its own right. Both devices will run on OxygenOS 15, based on Android 15, right out of the box. Software support is another area where both phones may differ. The OnePlus 13 is expected to receive 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security patches, while the OnePlus 13R may get 3 years of Android updates and 4 years of security patches. The camera department also promises a few upgrades. The OnePlus 13 is said to feature a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-808 primary sensor, alongside a 50-megapixel telephoto lens and a 50-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. For the OnePlus 13R, rumours suggest a triple-camera setup with a 50-megapixel primary lens, a 50-megapixel telephoto lens, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. If true, this will mark the first time an R-series device includes a telephoto lens.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

This smartphone is said to be the thinnest iPhone ever made, and if the reports are accurate, it has the potential to have a big impact on those who have long wanted a flagship phone with a super-slim profile. According to South Korea’s Sisa Journal, Apple is targeting a thickness of just 6.25mm for the iPhone 17 Air. For context, the iPhone 6, which currently holds the title of Apple’s thinnest phone, measures 6.9mm. The iPhone 17 Air would therefore be around 20 per cent thinner than the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, and about 25 per cent thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. Some rumours have even speculated that the device could end up being as thin as 5mm, though this remains unconfirmed. If the reports hold true, Apple’s new device will replace the iPhone 17 Plus in the lineup, with a similar price point to the iPhone 16 Plus, which starts at $899 (roughly Rs 77,000) in the USA. For fans in the UK, this could mean a starting price of around £899 (roughly Rs 92,000), although official pricing, as well as the India pricing of the phone, won’t be announced until closer to the launch. The design is expected to come with some compromises to achieve such an ultra-thin profile. Most sources agree the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, a single rear camera, and Apple’s own 5G modem. It will reportedly feature the new A19 chip and Dynamic Island, similar to its predecessors, but will have only one rear camera, unlike the dual or triple-camera setups seen on Pro models. The device is also expected to include 8GB of RAM to support Apple’s intelligence features. However, it’s not just Apple making headlines for going thinner. Samsung is also rumoured to be working on its own ultra-thin device, the Galaxy S25 Slim, which could have a thickness in the mid-6mm range. This could set the stage for a head-to-head battle between the two tech titans for the best slim high-end phone of 2025. While the ultra-thin profile of the iPhone 17 Air sounds exciting, some Apple fans might be wondering what features will be sacrificed. A thinner phone often means a smaller battery, and with a single rear camera, photography enthusiasts might find themselves drawn to the Pro models instead. Still, the idea of a phone that’s sleek, light, and easy to slip into a pocket is sure to appeal to many.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

However, with the imminent launch of the OnePlus 13 series, is it a good time to buy a previous generation device? Here are 4 reasons to buy and 1 reason to skip.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oneplus-12r-available-under-rs-40000-4-reasons-to-buy-1-to-skip-2660270-2025-01-06,"OnePlus is currently gearing up for the launch of its new OnePlus 13 series, scheduled for January 7, 2025. Ahead of the new generation of OnePlus flagship phones, the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12R, launched in 2024, are available at discounted prices. For the OnePlus 12R specifically, Amazon is offering the 8GB RAM + 256GB storage variant for as low as Rs 39,999 to select bank card holders. However, with the imminent launch of the OnePlus 13R, is it a good time to invest in the OnePlus 12R now? Here are four reasons to consider getting the discounted OnePlus 12R and one reason to skip the deal altogether.Reason 1: Premium design and vibrant display When we reviewed the OnePlus 12R in 2024—including both the standard and the new Sunset Dune color variant—we were impressed with its design. With its curved design, the OnePlus 12R stood out as sleek and sturdy. In fact, the affordable 12R resembled its flagship siblings. With Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection on the front and an IP64 rating, the device also promises durability. On the front, the phone’s 6.78-inch AMOLED display offers vibrant colors, deep contrasts, and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate.Reason 2: Smooth performance  The OnePlus 12R is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, delivering fast and smooth performance for multitasking and gaming. It can handle graphic-intensive games and demanding apps effortlessly. OnePlus has also included effective heat management to keep the device cool during extended use. Additionally, AI RAM acceleration ensures efficient memory usage, making app-switching seamless. The OxygenOS 14 interface further enhances the user experience with its clean design and minimal bloatware.Reason 3: Long-lasting battery with superfast charging The OnePlus 12R comes with a 5,500mAh battery, providing all-day usage even with heavy tasks. When it’s time to recharge, the 100W SUPERVOOC charging can power the device from 0 to 100 per cent in just 25–30 minutes.Reason 4: Impressive camera performance In our review, we also appreciated the camera performance of the OnePlus 12R. Its 50 megapixel main camera managed to capture detailed and vibrant shots in good lighting conditions. Even in low light, the results are among the best in this price range, capturing well-lit images with minimal noise. While the 8 megapixel ultrawide camera also performs decently in optimal lighting, the 2 megapixel macro lens is more of a secondary addition. With the introduction of the OnePlus 12 Sunset Dune edition, OnePlus also addressed earlier issues with sluggish camera software, making it more reliable for everyday photography.1 Reason to Skip While the OnePlus 12R is undoubtedly a great Android phone and a strong contender in its price range, there is one reason– and a big one — to skip this deal. OnePlus is set to launch the next generation of the OnePlus 13R tomorrow as part of the OnePlus 13 series. The upcoming model is expected to bring significant upgrades in performance, design, and features. Rumors suggest the OnePlus 13R will feature the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor (previously seen in the OnePlus 12 flagship), enhanced cameras, and a more refined design—all priced under Rs 50,000. For users seeking the latest tech and willing to spend a bit more, the OnePlus 13R might be worth waiting for. And with the OnePlus 13R launch, we are expecting more price cut on the OnePlus 12R which will make it more budget friendly.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says AI Agents will join workforce in 2025OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed that AI agents could become part of the workforce by 2025. Here is everything you need to know.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/job-crisis-and-layoffs-openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-ai-agents-will-join-workforce-in-2025-2660314-2025-01-06,"OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) agents could soon join the workforce, potentially in 2025. In a blog post, Altman also discussed the rapid advancements in AI and how the technology is likely to reshape entire industries in the near future. Speaking just over two years after the launch of ChatGPT, Altman noted how quickly AI capabilities have evolved.  ""We’re finally seeing some of the massive potential of AI come to life,"" he said, adding that OpenAI's progress will profoundly impact the global workforce. According to Altman, OpenAI is now confident in its ability to build AGI — artificial general intelligence, which is a more advanced form of AI designed to perform complex tasks traditionally carried out by humans. He suggested that by 2025, AI agents could start becoming integral parts of workplaces to improve productivity and efficiency. This bold prediction comes at a time when many industries face economic uncertainty, with mass layoffs and job insecurities affecting workers worldwide. The idea of AI stepping in to play a more prominent role in the workplace is likely to fuel debates about the future of work and whether AI will create new opportunities or displace human jobs. Altman, however, remains optimistic. He highlighted that AI agents would work alongside human teams rather than replace them, potentially leading to ""material changes"" in how companies operate. The CEO pointed out that as these technologies are introduced, they will gradually be integrated into existing workflows, giving people time to adapt. Despite his optimism, Altman acknowledged that OpenAI's journey hasn't been without its challenges. The company, which started as a quiet research lab in 2015, has grown exponentially, particularly after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. The launch sparked a surge of interest in AI, transforming OpenAI from a relatively unknown entity into one of the biggest names in tech. In the two years since, OpenAI has experienced rapid scaling, a process Altman described as “messy and stressful.” He also alluded to internal tensions, including his sudden firing and reinstatement in 2023, which made headlines around the world. Talking about the incident, Altman said it was a “failure of governance” but believes the company emerged stronger from the ordeal. Looking ahead, Altman envisions AI tools accelerating scientific research and innovation, helping to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems. ""We’re beginning to turn our aim towards superintelligence,"" he said, hinting at even more advanced AI capabilities beyond AGI. As AI agents prepare to enter the workforce, questions about job displacement and the ethical implications of AI will undoubtedly follow. But Altman is confident that OpenAI’s mission to ensure AI benefits all of humanity will guide the company’s future work. It will be interesting to see how the world will react to AI agents taking up positions or jobs in big tech companies.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

aea327d0-2e2c-4c87-9a97-92ea3a3ffb78,"Digital arrest to illegal parcels, here is how Indians are being scammed by cyber criminals On almost daily basis we hear of one scam or other. Indians are increasingly losing money to cyber scams such as ""digital arrest"" and ""illegal parcel delivery"". Here is way to understand these scams, and consequently stay safe. 
",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/digital-arrest-to-illegal-parcels-here-is-how-indians-are-being-scammed-by-cyber-criminals-2660394-2025-01-06,"India is witnessing an alarming rise in online fraud, with cyber scammers employing new and sophisticated tactics to exploit unsuspecting individuals. Every day we hear of one scam or other. Thousands of people have lost lakhs and crores to cyber scammers, who lure their victims under the pretext of work-from-home jobs, updating KYC through links, and in some cases by threatening people with with the so-called ""digital arrest.” To stay safe from these scams, it is more essential than ever to remain vigilant online and not fall for the words of anyone who connects with you online offering easy money or promise of financial assistance. From threatening calls, messages offering easy money-making tactics or investment opportunities through groups, here are some of the most prevalent cyber tactics scammers are using in India to trick people. Digital arrest scam In recent months, you might have come across the term ""Digital Arrest."" This scam uses fear and intimidation to snare people. Victims receive calls from individuals impersonating law enforcement agencies, accusing them of serious crimes such as money laundering or tax evasion. To make their claims appear more credible and threatening, these fraudsters often send forged legal documents and demand immediate payment to ""settle"" the issue and avoid arrest. Through persistent calls or messages, they create panic and leave victims with little time to verify the claims. However there is no such term as ""digital arrest"" in the Indian Penal Code. But people might not know that. To stay safe, never share personal or financial details over unsolicited calls. If you receive such calls, hang up and possibly — if you have time — report the incident to the Cyber Crime Cell.Illegal parcel scam In the illegal parcel scam, scammers take advantage of the current surge in e-commerce deliveries. With online shopping becoming commonplace, scammers pose as courier services or law enforcement officials and call unsuspecting individuals. During their call they threaten them claiming that a package addressed to the victim contains illegal or prohibited items such as drugs or weapons. To add credibility, they may conduct video calls, posing as fake police officers. Further when the individuals fall for the words of the scammers, fraudsters demand payment to ""clear"" the parcel or avoid legal action. Often, scammers send phishing links to collect payments or use urgency to extract sensitive information. To protect yourself, never click on suspicious links. If you receive such calls, contact the courier company’s official customer service.KYC scam Know Your Customer — KYC — scams exploit the routine updates required by banks and mobile service providers. Fraudsters pose as representatives from banks or telecom providers, call unsuspecting individuals and urge them to update their KYC details to avoid service suspension. Victims often receive fake SMS alerts with malicious links or are contacted by phone, where scammers ""assist"" them in the process through an app that actually takes over the phone of the victim and give full access to the scammer. This access is then used by the scammers to open sensitive apps, like a bank or payment app, or to read OTPs.  Once scammers gain access to OTPs or account credentials, they can drain bank accounts or misuse personal information. To stay safe, remember that banks will not call to request OTPs or send links to update KYC. Only update your information through official channels, and never share OTPs or passwords with unknown individuals.Work-from-home scam Work-from-home scams have also surged in recent months, especially with the rise of remote work and the number of people seeking such work. Scammers promise high earnings for simple tasks like liking videos or completing easy assignments. They connect with victims on platforms like Telegram or WhatsApp, offering lucrative opportunities. As victims fall into the trap and begin working, they are asked to pay a registration fee. Initially, small payouts are made, but scammers later demand higher deposits, promising bigger returns. Eventually, when victims try to withdraw their money, the scammers disappear with the deposits. To stay safe, thoroughly research work-from-home platforms, avoid upfront payments, and verify the credibility of companies through official websites or reviews.Emergency call scam Emergency call scams involve fraudsters posing as relatives or acquaintances, claiming to need urgent financial help due to medical emergencies, accidents, or legal troubles. Victims have reported receiving calls from unknown individuals posing as family friends or even fake police officers, claiming a family member is in distress or in hospital and money is immediately required.  Fraudsters often impersonate family members using details gathered from social media and emotionally manipulate victims into transferring money quickly. They typically request payment via digital wallets or gift cards, making the transactions untraceable. To stay safe, always verify the caller's identity by directly contacting the alleged family member or acquaintance.Stock market investment scam The cases of the stock market investment scams are also rising. In this scam, fraudsters target individuals eager to make quick profits. Scammers pose as financial advisors or brokers and connect with victims on platforms like WhatsApp, offering guaranteed high returns on investments. Victims are often lured into joining fake groups where other participants appear to be earning profits, creating a false sense of legitimacy. To trick victims and gain their trust, scammers also create fraudulent apps or websites mimicking legitimate trading platforms. Once victims invest, the scammers cut all contacts with the victims  or manipulate the system to show false losses, urging the victims to invest more to get their money back. To protect yourself, research investment opportunities thoroughly before investment and always verify the credentials of financial advisors.

e32ff672-29d2-4b16-a47e-18dda169ff50,"Redmi 14C quick review: A promising phone under Rs 10,000At a time when there are few under Rs 10,000 phones from big brands, Redmi is bringing the Redmi 14C to India. At a starting price of Rs 9,999, the phone packs a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chip and a 5160mAh battery. And in this quick review of the Redmi 14C we find that it is quite promising.  ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/redmi-14c-quick-review-a-promising-phone-under-rs-10000-2660391-2025-01-06,"After days of teasing, the Redmi 14C has been finally launched in India at a starting price of Rs 9,999. Compared to its predecessor — the Redmi 13C — the new phone brings a lot of upgrades. It comes with a 120Hz bright display, a 5160mAh battery, splash-resistant design, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, a 50-megapixel primary camera and more.  In other words, it is fairly packed with hardware that makes it seem like a Rs 15,000 phone instead of something that you can buy under Rs 10,000. This is also where its appeal is: you see the price of the Redmi 14C starts at Rs 9,999 in India. So, is this a phone to buy under the Rs 10,000 segment? We will have a detailed and definitive answer in the full review of the Redmi 14C. But at a first glance, it sure looks promising. advertisementRedmi 14C: Design and display For a few years now, Redmi has been giving some careful attention to the design patterns, especially for its entry-level segments. We saw it on the Redmi 13C and now the Redmi 14C continues the legacy of a beautiful design language. The smartphone is available in three colours: Starlight Blue, Stardust Purple, and Stargaze Black. I am reviewing the Starlight Blue variant and I love it. The rear panel has a striking ombre effect with silver on the top and blue on the bottom. The back panel features a circular island that houses a dual-camera setup. Although, the island is made to give viewers an illusion that the phone carries a triple-camera setup. Additionally, the camera island doesn’t bulge much, which minimises the wobbliness when the phone is kept on a table.

 



Redmi 14C, the Starlight Blue
The Redmi 14C features a boxy look with a fairly slim body — for the price — of 8.22mm. One of the most striking features of the phone is its screen. It is a large screen, measuring 6.88 inches. But more significantly, it is a screen that comes with 120Hz refresh rate, something that is a rarity in this price segment. So full marks to Redmi on this count. Redmi 14C: Processor and powerThe Redmi 14C is powered by a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset, coupled with 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage. This hardware too, for the price, seems to be a really good deal.  The phone runs on Xiaomi’s HyperOS 14, which is based on Android 14. While the chipset is a little dated, in my limited use so far it performed well enough. It’s been lag-free so far, even while quickly scrolling through Instagram timeline. Regular apps, such as social media apps, and the bundled Chrome browser have been smooth on the Redmi 14C so far. Significantly, even the gaming performance seems to be good enough. I played a few games on the Redmi 14C like Block Blast and they worked smoothly.
 


Inside the phone there is a 5160mAh battery with 18W charging support. Redmi is one of the few brands that still bundle a charger with their phone. The Redmi 14C comes with a 33W in-box charger.

 For a few years now, Redmi has been giving some careful attention to the design patterns, especially for its entry-level segments. We saw it on the Redmi 13C and now the Redmi 14C continues the legacy of a beautiful design language. The smartphone is available in three colours: Starlight Blue, Stardust Purple, and Stargaze Black. I am reviewing the Starlight Blue variant and I love it. The rear panel has a striking ombre effect with silver on the top and blue on the bottom. The back panel features a circular island that houses a dual-camera setup. Although, the island is made to give viewers an illusion that the phone carries a triple-camera setup. Additionally, the camera island doesn’t bulge much, which minimises the wobbliness when the phone is kept on a table.

 



Redmi 14C, the Starlight Blue
 The Redmi 14C features a boxy look with a fairly slim body — for the price — of 8.22mm. One of the most striking features of the phone is its screen. It is a large screen, measuring 6.88 inches. But more significantly, it is a screen that comes with 120Hz refresh rate, something that is a rarity in this price segment. So full marks to Redmi on this count. Redmi 14C: Processor and power The Redmi 14C is powered by a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset, coupled with 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage. This hardware too, for the price, seems to be a really good deal.  The phone runs on Xiaomi’s HyperOS 14, which is based on Android 14. While the chipset is a little dated, in my limited use so far it performed well enough. It’s been lag-free so far, even while quickly scrolling through Instagram timeline. Regular apps, such as social media apps, and the bundled Chrome browser have been smooth on the Redmi 14C so far. Significantly, even the gaming performance seems to be good enough. I played a few games on the Redmi 14C like Block Blast and they worked smoothly.
 


Inside the phone there is a 5160mAh battery with 18W charging support. Redmi is one of the few brands that still bundle a charger with their phone. The Redmi 14C comes with a 33W in-box charger. For now, I observed that in 45 minutes, the phone charges up to 58 per cent, from 34 per cent to 92 per cent.  Inside the phone there is a 5160mAh battery with 18W charging support.

It mentions Gemini as a ""wearable"" assistant, suggesting a tailored experience for smartwatches.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/googles-gemini-ai-may-come-soon-to-wear-os-smartwatches-2660756-2025-01-07,"Last year, Gemini made its way to iOS devices through a dedicated app, and now Google is eyeing even bigger opportunities. One of the big announcements at CES 2025 was that Google TV devices will soon get a boost from Gemini. The highlight? You’ll be able to talk to your TV’s virtual assistant without needing to speak into the remote. This is all thanks to an upgraded voice assistant powered by Gemini AI, set to roll out later this year. But TVs aren’t the only focus. Wear OS, Google’s smartwatch platform, is also likely to get Gemini support very soon. There’s been speculation that this could happen alongside Google’s March 2025 Pixel Feature Drop. A recent report from 9to5Google pointed out some strong hints about this in the beta version of the Google App (v16.0.5). Buried in the code are references to Gemini as a wearable assistant. One line reads, “Easily talk back and forth to get more done with an assistant on your watch, reimagined with Google AI.” That wording suggests that the assistant on Wear OS will be more natural and conversational than before, allowing for more dynamic back-and-forth chats.  When Gemini arrives on Wear OS, it’ll likely be through an update to the existing Google Assistant app. The basic way to call up the assistant probably won’t change much — you’ll still use the Hey Google wake word or long-press your watch’s side button. However, there’s also been talk about a new Hey Gemini hot word, which could replace or sit alongside Hey Google. This was spotted in demo videos for Android XR and could make its way to Wear OS as well. Google is clearly betting big on Gemini to redefine how we interact with its devices. From TVs to smartwatches, it’s all about making tech feel more human. While we’ll have to wait for exact dates, 2025 looks like it’s going to be another exciting year for Google’s AI-powered ecosystem. For the unaware, Google made significant strides with its Gemini AI in 2024, and it seems the momentum will continue going forward. Originally introduced as Bard, Google’s chatbot has since evolved into Gemini, which is gradually being integrated into a variety of the company’s products and services. From smartphones and tablets to Gmail, Google Docs, and Maps, Gemini is becoming a more common presence across Google’s ecosystem.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

2133e408-2c0f-46b6-a064-a87eb82d6ea3,Sam Altman says OpenAI is losing money because of ChatGPT Pro subscriptionOpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ChatGPT Pro is so popular that the company is actually losing money because of it. The company didn't expect so many people to subscribe to it.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sam-altman-says-openai-is-losing-money-because-of-chatgpt-pro-subscription-2660749-2025-01-07,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently made a surprising revelation on X (formerly Twitter) about the company’s financial challenges with its ChatGPT Pro subscriptions. In his tweet, Altman stated, “Insane thing: we are currently losing money on OpenAI Pro subscriptions! People use it much more than we expected.” The Pro subscription for ChatGPT, which offers access to the advanced GPT-4 model, has gained significant traction globally, including in India. In India, the subscription is priced at $200 per month, which is about Rs 17,000. It is an attractive option for professionals, businesses, and students seeking enhanced productivity and creativity. The Pro subscribers of ChatGPT receive benefits such as faster response times, priority access during peak usage hours, and advanced capabilities powered by GPT-4. Despite the steady influx of subscribers, Altman’s comments underline a major issue — usage levels that far exceed expectations. While the Pro subscription was designed to offset the high operational costs of running large-scale AI models, the current usage rates are proving to be unsustainable for OpenAI’s financial model. Large language models like GPT-4 require substantial computational resources, which lead to escalating cloud computing and server costs. The announcement sheds light on the delicate balance tech companies must maintain between offering powerful, accessible tools and ensuring financial viability. OpenAI’s pricing model for Pro subscriptions, aimed at democratising AI access, now faces scrutiny as the company grapples with these unexpected challenges. India has emerged as a significant market for ChatGPT, with professionals across sectors such as education, IT, and content creation adopting the Pro subscription to streamline tasks and unlock AI-driven efficiencies. The relatively affordable pricing in India compared to global rates has also contributed to its popularity. Altman’s disclosure has sparked a wave of curiosity about OpenAI’s next steps. The curiosity has especially been growing ever since Altman’s recent post about his prediction of AI replacing humans at work in 2025.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Samsung S25 series: What to expect In the teaser, Samsung has shared a glimpse of 4 phones. The rumours have also indicated that this year, the company will release a fourth model other than usual. This year, along with the Samsung S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra, S25 Slim could also make the cut. The Slim variant is expected to compete with the rumoured iPhone 17 Air (may launch in September 2025).  The Samsung Galaxy S25 series has already generated significant buzz ahead of its official debut, fueled by numerous leaks and rumours. The flagship lineup is anticipated to deliver a major performance upgrade, with the international variant (SM-S931B) recently appearing on Geekbench.

The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) has confirmed that Qi2 wireless charging is coming to Android, with Samsung and Google leading the way. The announcement was made at CES 2025, bringing an exciting update for fans who have long wanted the Qi2 wireless charging standard for Android smartphones.  For the unaware, Qi2 is the next big step in wireless charging, replacing the older Qi standard. It promises faster and more efficient charging, with speeds of up to 15W. The technology uses magnetic rings to align your device perfectly with the charger. This clever design reduces energy loss caused by misalignment, making it a more reliable option than before. While Apple’s MagSafe has been using similar technology since 2023, Android phones have mostly lagged behind — until now. Both Samsung and Google have officially committed to the Qi2 standard. Samsung announced that Galaxy phones will start supporting Qi2 later this year. However, it’s still unclear if the upcoming Galaxy S25 series, set to launch this month, will include native Qi2 support. Rumours suggest the S25 might offer Qi2 functionality through special cases, but full integration may have to wait until the Galaxy S26. Google’s plans are a bit more mysterious. The company has said it’s playing a major role in advancing the technology, especially with the development of Qi 2.2. Google aims to improve cross-brand compatibility, which has been a pain point for Android users. If successful, this could allow chargers and phones from different manufacturers to take full advantage of Qi2’s faster speeds. Google’s involvement hints at big improvements for devices like its Pixel series and other Android smartphones. For years, Apple users have had a better wireless charging experience with MagSafe. Android phones have supported wireless charging, but it’s been less reliable and often slower. The arrival of Qi2 could finally change that. By adopting the magnetic alignment system, Android devices will deliver more consistent performance and faster charging, putting them on par with Apple’s offering. 2025 could mark the start of a new era for wireless charging on Android. With Samsung and Google backing Qi2, the technology might become a standard feature across Android devices in the coming years.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Announced during CEO Jensen Huang's keynote at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Cosmos, he says, is specifically designed to teach robots and machines how to interact with the physical world. Cosmos was trained on 20 million hours of real footage of “humans walking, hands moving, manipulating things,” Jensen said. From industrial robots to humanoids and self-driving cars, the applications of this technology are vast — and fascinating.advertisementWhat sets Cosmos apart? While language models like ChatGPT or Bard learn to generate text by digesting mountains of written content, Cosmos is focused on the visual and physical realm. Huang explained that the AI models were trained on 20 million hours of real footage of humans performing everyday actions — walking, moving their hands, manipulating objects. ""It’s not about creating art,"" Huang noted. ""It’s about teaching AI to understand the physical world.""  During the presentation, Huang apparently showcased Cosmos in action, simulating warehouse environments where boxes fell off shelves. This type of realistic video generation is critical for training robots to recognise and respond to real-world scenarios, such as accidents at the workplace. Companies can also fine tune Cosmos using their proprietary data, tailoring it to specific needs.

Humanoid robot startups like Agility Robotics and Figure AI, alongside self-driving car companies such as Uber, Waabi, and Wayve, are leveraging the technology. These businesses hope to push the boundaries of what robots can achieve, whether it’s navigating complex environments or performing intricate tasks.  Isaac to complement Cosmos To complement Cosmos, Nvidia also unveiled an upgrade to its Isaac robot simulation platform. The new feature allows robots to learn new tasks with unprecedented efficiency. For instance, builders can use a few examples of a desired action, like grabbing an object, and Isaac will generate a horde of synthetic training data to perfect the skill. Huang’s CES keynote featured life-sized digital images of 14 humanoid robots from industry leaders like Tesla, Boston Dynamics, and Agility Robotics, emphasising Nvidia’s ambition to shape the future of robotics. “With Cosmos and Isaac, we’re giving developers the tools to create robots that can truly understand and operate in our world,” Huang said.   Nvidia’s bold vision underscores its leadership in the AI space, blending innovation with practicality. The integration of AI into robotics could redefine industries, from logistics and manufacturing to autonomous driving. With Cosmos, Nvidia is paving the way for machines to become more human-like—not in thought, but in motion.

As of January 5, the third beta update of OneUI 7 has been released in several regions, following the initial launch in the US late last year. This new beta build is now available in Germany and has also reached users in India and Poland. However, it’s worth noting that Indian and Polish users are essentially receiving the second beta update, while Germany and other regions are getting their third. Despite the slight variation in release stages, the latest firmware comes with the same build number ending in ""ZXLJ"" across all regions. It brings a host of improvements and bug fixes for the Galaxy S24, S24+, and S24 Ultra. The changelog reveals a bunch of enhancements and fixes aimed at improving the overall user experience. Game Booster mode has received some useful updates, including the option to change the default screen playback setting, rename FPS settings, and adjust the maximum FPS value. Users can now also set the default scanning rate to 120Hz, making gaming smoother and more customisable. Samsung Messages has gained a new ""Modify Exception"" feature when saving MMS images. Additionally, OneUI 7 introduces a vertical app drawer, and the scrolling interface has seen refinements in this latest beta. Improvements have also been made to the quick panel, which now offers smoother closing operations. On the visual side, the lock screen, always-on display, and status bar battery icon have been revamped, aligning with OneUI 7’s design updates. A long-standing issue with the volume key operation in Routine+ mode has been addressed, and tools in the Edge panel, which weren’t displaying properly before, are now fixed. This third beta is a hefty download, weighing in at over 1.2GB. It includes the January security patch, adding an extra layer of protection for users. If you’re already enrolled in the OneUI 7 beta programme, you can download the update now by heading to your device’s settings. For those who haven’t joined the beta programme, it might be worth waiting for the stable version. The final release is expected shortly after Samsung unveils its next flagship, the Galaxy S25 series, which is rumoured to launch later this month. This update is a clear sign that Samsung is fine-tuning its software before the final release. Users have reported smoother performance, fewer bugs, and enhanced features with each new beta.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

Here are the best 5G phones you can buy in India this January for under Rs 15,000. The list includes the Poco M7 Pro 5G and three other devices.advertisementPoco M7 Pro 5GWe start the list with the Poco M7 Pro 5G, a solid phone that gets the basics right. Over its predecessor, the Poco M6 Pro, the latest model features a 6.67-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, providing a smooth and vibrant viewing experience for everyday use. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra processor and up to 8GB of RAM, the M7 Pro handles multitasking and casual gaming with ease.

Its 120Hz LCD display is a major improvement, offering smoother scrolling and gaming experiences compared to its predecessor. The new 108MP primary camera performs well in good lighting, delivering sharp and detailed photos that stand out in its price segment. While the 5,000mAh battery remains unchanged, charging speeds have been increased to 33W, and a fast charger is included in the box. The phone ships with HyperOS based on Android 14, which is faster and more intuitive than the older MIUI interface, providing a better overall user experience. With a strong balance of features, the Redmi 13 5G maintains its position as one of the best budget phones, offering reliable performance and useful upgrades without pushing the price too high.Motorola G64 5G The Motorola G64 5G is a solid choice for those who want a clean, bloatware-free smartphone experience. It is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 processor, which handles daily tasks and light gaming effectively. A standout feature is its massive 6,000mAh battery, which can easily last more than a day on a single charge, making it perfect for heavy users. The 50MP main camera with OIS, captures sharp and stable images, especially in good lighting. Design-wise, the phone resembles its predecessor but now comes in more colour options for added variety. Running on stock Android 14, the software is free of unnecessary apps, ensuring a smooth and simple experience. The Moto G64 5G is available in two variants — 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 12GB RAM with 256GB storage.

Here is when they will receive the salary hikes.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/infosys-delays-salary-hikes-here-is-when-employees-will-get-it-2660883-2025-01-07,"Infosys has delayed its annual salary hikes, with employees now getting increments in the fourth quarter of the current financial year (Q4 FY25). This shift marks a departure from the company's usual practice of earlier hikes, driven largely by the global uncertainty surrounding IT services demand. This could be disappointing for Infosys employees because the last salary hike was implemented in November 2023. Here is everything to know. The company plans to roll out the increments in phases, starting in January for some employees, with the rest receiving theirs in April. Infosys' Chief Financial Officer, Jayesh Sanghrajka, confirmed the phased approach during the company's Q2 results briefing. While the exact reason for the delay is unknown right now, but the move suggests that the IT sector could be facing some challenges. These include weak discretionary spending, delayed client budgets, and ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Other IT firms like HCLTech, LTIMindtree, and L&T Tech Services have also skipped salary hikes recently in efforts to manage costs and maintain profitability. Despite reporting a 2.2 percent rise in net profit to Rs 6,506 crore in the second quarter, Infosys reportedly fell short of market expectations. MoneyControl reported that the company’s margins improved slightly by 10 basis points thanks to cost-saving initiatives such as reduced onsite costs and better utilisation rates. It is being reported that Infosys could face further pressure on margins in the December quarter, due to factors like furloughs and fewer working days. However, the company’s margin improvement plan, known as Project Maximus, along with pricing gains and subcontractor cost optimisation, could help balance the impact. It is worth noting that this isn’t the first time Infosys has adjusted its salary hike timelines. In November 2023, the company had already shifted from its usual practice of salary revisions in April, primarily focusing on experienced employees, while excluding entry-level staff.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 7, 2025

The devices, which are aimed at hardcore gamers, would be available in the coming weeks and months.  As far as the desktop is concerned, the new Area 51 desktops would be the company’s most powerful gaming computers. The new desktops, says Dell, have been designed for users seeking a powerful machine capable of handling extreme performance demands. The desktop would be housed in an 80-litre full-size tower, which will help Dell put the absolute top performing hardware inside it, as well as provide users with room for upgrades.

Alienware has also introduced a unique AlienFX motherboard harness that ensures compatibility with aftermarket components, enabling users to create a truly personalised setup. With the reimagined Area 51 Desktop, Alienware has also upgraded the thermal architecture. The desktop features a positive-pressure airflow system with dual 140mm fans, larger dual 180mm fans, and optional liquid cooling configurations. This system expels heat through passive exhaust, reducing temperatures by up to 13 per cent and noise levels by 45 per cent compared to previous models. This advanced airflow design, according to Dell, results in 50 per cent more processing power, making the desktop ready for today’s intensive gaming and future applications.Alienware Area 51 laptops Joining the revamped desktops are the Area-51 laptops, which will be available in 16-inch and 18-inch models. These laptops feature a new design, complete with a liquid teal anodised aluminium finish and translucent thermal shelves illuminated by AlienFX lighting.

They support Gen 5 SSDs offering up to 12TB of storage and DDR5 memory sticks with speed of up to 7200 MT/s.Area 51 pricing and availability The Area 51 desktop and laptops will be available for purchase in the coming months. The desktop’s default configuration, equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, will start at approximately $4,499. The laptops will start at $1,999 for the entry-level configuration while the premium model, mobile variant of RTX 5080, will be priced at $3,199.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also Read |  Dell simplifies PC names with Pro and Pro Max variants, says bye-bye to Latitude, XPS and InspironAlso Read |  Digital arrest to illegal parcels, here is how Indians are being scammed by cyber criminalsAlso Read |  OnePlus 12R available under Rs 40,000: 4 reasons to buy 1 to skip

47b6d085-b417-4494-9c7b-30170221bbc9,"Forbes Air Purifier 500 review: Affordable and effective Air purifiers come in different sizes and different price points. The Forbes Air Purifier 500 is in sort of middle, price-wise as well as size-wise. But when it comes to performance, we find in the Forbes Air Purifier 500 review, this machine punches above its weight and its price-point. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/forbes-air-purifier-500-review-affordable-and-effective-2660976-2025-01-07,"Delhi-NCR is a gas chamber nowadays. With air pollution in winter soaring to 1,000 AQI, the city leaves its residents gasping for fresh air. I am one of those residents. Like everyone, every year, I prepare myself to face the grimy winter air in Delhi. Being an asthmatic, this preparation for me also includes some extra help from devices like air purifiers. So, when Eureka Forbes reached out recently about their latest air purifier – the Forbes Air Purifier 500 — I was keen to see if this purifier, despite its relatively lower price, would help me breathe easy. You see I am rather used to Dyson, which is very effective but also one of the most costliest options. The Forbes Air Purifier 500 looked like a product that could be an equally effective job but at a lower price point, something that could benefit a lot of consumers in a place like Delhi-NCR. So, I took the plunge. And emerged impressed.  The Forbes Air Purifier 500 is priced at Rs 28,000 in India. However, you can get it for as low as Rs 19,999 when in discount. At this price this air purifier highlights its 360-degree air intake technology and it comes with a 4-stage purification system, which includes a pre-filter, activated carbon filter, true HEPA H13 filter, and plasma filtration to clean indoor air. It is also WiFi enabled which means users can connect to and operate it with its dedicated smartphone app called Smart Life.   The air purifier also offers features like a PM2.5 digital display, VOC color indicator, and AI mode for automatic adjustments based on air quality. These are the features that you usually get on more expensive air purifiers. Then there are functionalities like child lock, sleep mode, adjustable fan speeds, and a timer setting. According to Forbes the Air Purifier 500 is ideal for a house with up to 670 sq ft. This the air purifier does with help of 500 m3/hr airflow and with a low sound of 66 dB or below.  Looking at the features, the Air Purifier 500 certainly looks smart and fancy. But the question remains: does it really help you breathe easily while cleaning indoors from pollutants such as dust, allergens, bacteria, and odours? But before I answer this question a bit about its design.Boring design, cool display  The Forbes Air Purifier 500 comes dismantled in two big cubes, which you need to assemble by placing one on top of the other. It's easy, lightweight, and quick to set up. Once assembled, it looks like a small tower. To me, though, it’s boring. I understand that aesthetics are matters of personal choice, but at least to my eyes the Air Purifier 500 looks not at all fancy. It’s all utility and no joy. Although, the looks should not define the performance of a machine and in the case of the Air Purifier 500 they don’t.  On top of the Air Purifier 500 is a black grill with a circular digital display in the middle. The display shows the AQI, features touch control buttons to operate the device, and includes a light indicator to signify PM2.5 levels. This display comes handy to get a quick glance at the pollution levels in the room. Also, the top panel adds some flair to otherwise boring design.
 


Using the Forbes Air Purifier 500 I have been using the Forbes Air Purifier 500 since mid-December when Delhi’s pollution levels peak and winters are in full swing. This is certainly the perfect time to test what an air purifier is really capable of. To my surprise, the Air Purifier 500 manages to hold its own in the cold. Often as soon as I turned on the device, the Air Purifier 500 quickly reduced AQI in the room. For reference, within 10 minutes, it brought the pollution down from 537 to 35. Pretty fast! To verify this, I cross-checked the readings with the Dyson Cool Gen 1 — which, by the way, is a bit costlier — and the readings were similar. The Air Purifier 500 even managed to clean smoke from the kitchen – it’s winter, and parathas are never off the stove – and filtered out pollen effectively. But – yes there is a but — as someone who deals with asthma, there are a few things I noticed the Air Purifier 500 struggles to detect. For example, my landlord had walls painted recently in my condo. During that time I was really struggling to breathe due to the paint fumes, so I turned on the Air Purifier 500. It displayed room AQI between 45-55. However, the Dyson showed an AQI of around 200. And what I could figure out with these distinct readings is that while the Air Purifier 500 is capable of handling common pollutants, its filters and sensors weren’t as effective for all types of pollutants, such as paint fumes. The Air Purifier 500 uses a silent motor, although at higher fan speed, say level 6 to 12, it isn’t entirely quiet. You can clearly hear the fan running. When set on auto or sleep mode, the fan manages noise levels well enough, at least well enough to not keep you awake in the dark when you are trying to sleep and want a quiet room. But the cold air is another matter. Unlike some other air purifiers that nowadays can also throw out hot air, the Air Purifier 500 only blows out cooler air. In a few hours, in winters, this can actually cool down the room, which is not desirable. 
 


 In short, the performance of the Air Purifier 500 is decent. If I take into account its price, I would say the performance is really good. If you’re someone looking for an affordable air purifier to clean your indoor air of gases, pollutants, and pollen, the Air Purifier 500 is very capable.advertisementEasy controls with the app Quick access to your gadgets through your phone is always a good idea. In fact, throughout my review period, I controlled the Forbes Air Purifier 500 using the Smart Life app, which I downloaded from the App Store on my iPhone.The app is easy to access and, once set up with details like your location, it displays the outdoor AQI alongside the indoor AQI along with the weather. The app also allows you to connect your device and control all its settings with just a few taps. You can even control the timer through the app, adding to its convenience.Beyond app control, the purifier can also be connected to smart assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant, making it even easier and smarter to manage the device. Should you buy Forbes Air Purifier 500? So, is the Forbes Air Purifier 500 worth Rs 20,000, the price at which it often sells? Definitely. The machine is capable of filtering pollutants and pollen, helping to keep your indoor air clean. It is lightweight, easy to clean, portable, and simple to set up.The app controls and smart display make it convenient to track the AQI and control the machine. While it does throw cool air, it’s not directed straight at your face. Additionally, once the AQI in the room improves, the fan – if set on AI mode – can slow down, making it quieter for night. Overall, it effectively cleans the indoor air to make it breathable. In terms of performance, it sort of matches the performance offered by more expensive air purifiers. Although, when it comes to feature set — such as warm air — or jazzier design, the more expensive air purifiers still have an edge over them. But for the price I believe you can’t go wrong with the Forbes Air Purifier 500. At its selling it is totally worth it.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ces-2025-nvidias-new-personal-ai-supercomputer-costs-over-rs-250000-and-anyone-can-use-it-at-home-or-office-2660961-2025-01-07,"Nvidia, a giant in the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware game, is shaking things up by bringing AI capabilities straight to your desk. The company announced its newest product at CES 2025: Digits, a personal AI supercomputer, which will be available starting May this year. Priced at $3,000 (which is a little over Rs 2,50,000), Digits aims to make advanced AI accessible to developers, researchers, and enthusiasts without the need for massive cloud infrastructure.  
“The age of AI is here. Project Digits, with the new GB10 Superchip designed with MediaTek, makes our most powerful Grace Blackwell platform more accessible — placing it in the hands of developers, researchers, and students to solve the most pressing issues of our time,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the time of launch.   advertisementA supercomputer in a book-sized box  Digits is small enough to fit on your desk but packs a serious punch. At its core is the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, co-developed with MediaTek. With 128GB of unified memory and up to 4TB of NVMe storage, Digits is tailor-made for handling large AI workloads. What can Digits do? Digits isn’t just powerful — it’s versatile. It can run a large language model (LLM) with up to 200 billion parameters, a metric that measures model complexity. That’s a game-changer for hobbyists and researchers who previously needed expensive cloud services or custom setups to run advanced AI models.  
Want to push it further? Connect two Digits machines with Nvidia’s high-speed interconnect, and you can run models as large as Meta’s Llama with 405 billion parameters. This feature puts Digits in a league of its own for experimentation with near-state-of-the-art AI models.  Who is Digits for? Digits is small enough to fit on your desk but packs a serious punch.

ec822d2c-35ff-4d6d-a557-58bdfc7466b3,"Many Indians among 185 employees fired by Apple for salary fraud, says report185 employees have been fired by Apple for misusing a grants clause to gain higher salary from the company. Of these, many are said to be Indians. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/many-indians-among-185-employees-fired-by-apple-for-salary-fraud-by-misusing-charity-clause-says-report-2661013-2025-01-07,"Frauds can often be very ingenious. And this one over at Apple sounds particularly clever and insidious. Apple has reportedly fired 185 employees at its headquarters in Cupertino after finding that these employees indulged in a monetary fraud to boost their compensation. Of the fired employees, six have been named by authorities in the Bay Area and warrants have been issued against them. While none of these six is Indian, another report highlights that among the fired employees many are Indians who were reportedly misusing some Telugu charity organisations in the US to carry out fraud.  NBC, citing the district attorney’s office in Los Angeles, notes that Apple has terminated several employees from its Bay Area offices over the misuse of its Matching Grants program. Apple has not issued an official statement on the matter and we were also unable to independently verify the information. The reported scheme revolves around Apple’s Matching Grants program, a corporate social responsibility initiative designed to amplify employees’ charitable contributions by matching their donations to nonprofit organisations. The allegations suggest that some employees, in collaboration with specific nonprofit organisations — including associations reportedly linked to the Indian community — falsified donations to exploit the program. According to these claims, employees donated funds to nonprofits, which were then matched by Apple. However, the nonprofits allegedly funnelled the original donations back to the employees, allowing them to retain Apple’s matching contributions. If accurate, this would not only breach corporate policies but also violate US tax laws, as the employees’ false claims could amount to tax fraud. According to the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office, six individuals defrauded Apple of approximately $152,000 over three years by falsely claiming to donate to two nonprofits — the American Chinese International Cultural Exchange (ACICE) and Hop4Kids. The individuals charged include: -Siu Kei (Alex) Kwan, 37, of Castro Valley
-Yathei (Hayson) Yuen, 34, of San Jose
-Yat C (Sunny) Ng, 35, of Milpitas
-Wentao (Victor) Li, 38, of Hayward
-Lichao Ni, 39, of Sunnyvale
-Zheng Chang, 31, of Union City According to the DA’s Office, Kwan, identified as the ringleader, served as both the CEO of Hop4Kids and the accountant for ACICE. The scheme reportedly involved employees pretending to make donations, which were later returned to them. Kwan retained Apple’s matching contributions and also wrote off these fictitious donations on the defendants’ tax returns, defrauding the state of California in the process. A separate report by Great Andhra notes that a total of 185 Apple employees have been fired, even though current authorities have released details of only 6 whom they have charged with certain crimes. This report notes that there are many Indians amongst the fired employees. These Indians, claims the report, misused Apple’s Matching Grants program, a corporate social responsibility initiative designed to amplify employees’ charitable contributions by matching their donations to nonprofit organisations. The allegations suggest that some employees, in collaboration with specific non-profit organisations –– including associations reportedly linked to the Telugu employees –– falsified donations to exploit the program.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announces $3 billion investment in India for AI, cloud infrastructure and skillingAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia's new personal AI supercomputer costs over Rs 2,50,000 and anyone can use it at home or officeAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's new AI models were trained on 20 million hours of human moves

f130b009-8404-4c31-8fb3-abe9e991ed8e,"Apple Intelligence will soon be available in Indian English: Everything we know so farFor now, Apple's AI features are only limited to certain languages, including US English. But India will soon get the upgrade. In 2025, Apple Intelligence will finally expand to other languages. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-intelligence-will-soon-be-available-in-indian-english-everything-we-know-so-far-2661001-2025-01-07,"Apple released the first wave of Apple Intelligence in October 2024 with the iOS 18.1. Since then, the company has been constantly working on its AI-powered features. While the initial phase brought just a handful of Apple Intelligence features, iOS 18.2 showed off some grand ones. iOS 18.1 introduced new features designed to make everyday tasks easier and more efficient, like writing tools, Photos app enhancements with Clean up tool and Memories features. On the other hand, iOS 18.2 surfaced with ChatGPT integration, Image Playground, GenMoji, Visual Intelligence and more. Read all the features in detail here.  While Apple is steadily climbing up the ladder, it is yet to expand its branches across the globe, especially when it comes to AI. We earlier reported how Apple is running late in the AI race, but limiting features to certain areas is still a major drawback. For now, Apple Intelligence is available in Australian English, Canadian English, English (Ireland), New Zealand, South Africa, UK and US in most regions around the world. However, Indian English is yet to come.  But the good news is that 2025 is the year when Indian English will be able to support Apple Intelligence. While there is still a way to use it, for that users have to change their default regional settings. How to use Apple Intelligence in India?  Apple Intelligence is only eligible for the iPhone 16 series and iPhone 15 Pro models right now. To access the AI features on your eligible iPhones, you need to change your default regional setting to one of the languages that support Apple Intelligence. To change you settings, go to Settings > General > Language & Region and select English (US) or any language that supports Apple Intelligence as your device’s primary language. (Something that is yet to feature with Indian English). This setting configures your device to recognise the language required for Apple Intelligence. After changing the language, go to Settings > Apple Intelligence and Siri > Language and again choose for instance, English (US) as the language for Siri and Apple Intelligence. After setup, Apple will invite you to join a waitlist for access to Apple Intelligence. Once you’ve joined, you’ll be notified within a few hours or days when the local language model for Apple Intelligence has been downloaded to your device. At that point, you can start exploring Apple’s new suite of AI features.What do you need for Apple Intelligence?  This year Apple will not just expand its Apple Intelligence reach, but also release new features. Once Indian English starts supporting Apple Intelligence, it will be much easier for the Indian audience. But you must remember that Apple's AI features require more storage. Hence, if you are planning to go for high-end iPhones (eligible for Apple Intelligence), we advise you to go for a higher storage variant.  According to an official document, Apple Intelligence is supported on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, all iPhone 16 models, and iPads and Macs equipped with the M1 chip or newer. For iPhone devices, 4GB of storage is required to install and use Apple Intelligence features.  Apple may have separate criteria for iPads and Macs, or there could be undisclosed reasons for not sharing additional details. The storage requirement is expected to grow as new features are introduced. The document states, “Storage requirements for on-device Apple Intelligence models will increase as more features roll out.” However, it remains unclear how much additional storage will be needed for upcoming updates. A potential doubling of the minimum requirement to 8GB within the next year wouldn’t be surprising.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also read |  iPhone 17 Air price details leaked, will cost less than Pro modelsAlso read |  iPhone SE 4 may cost more than its predecessorAlso read |  Apple to pay $95 million to settle Siri privacy lawsuit

cd00b358-481b-4066-9810-2a2886d8306d,"OnePlus 13 review: Solid flagship phone for smart buyersAfter many teasers, the OnePlus 13 has arrived in India today. And with it, the phone brings a fairly compelling package of top hardware and a good price. As we find in this OnePlus 13 review, this is another solid offering from the house of OnePlus. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/oneplus-13-review-solid-flagship-phone-for-smart-buyers-2661180-2025-01-07,"  OnePlus has been a household name in India for some time now, largely due to its ability to strike a balance between premium performance and accessible pricing. With the OnePlus 13, the brand aims to uphold its legacy of delivering a smooth user experience and well-polished software along with raw performance. But with a price of Rs 69,999, a slight increase over its predecessor, the OnePlus 12, does the OnePlus 13 justify the premium? Let’s dive into the details and find out in this detailed OnePlus 13 review.advertisementDesign: Subtle yet premium refreshThe OnePlus 13 may seem familiar at first, but it brings a refreshing update to its design with subtle yet impactful aesthetic changes. While the circular rear camera module with four sensors remains, the device now features flat sides and a flat screen, giving it a more modern appearance. However, since the new version has a boxy design, it gives the impression of a wider form factor compared to the OnePlus 12. In reality, the OnePlus 13 is slimmer and lighter. This shift in design, combined with leather and glass finish options, makes the OnePlus 13 feel noticeably more premium than its predecessor.The white model I am reviewing features a frosted glass back panel with a subtle shimmer effect, which reminds me of the sandstone texture seen on older devices like the OnePlus 5T. However, this new version has a smooth finish, which makes it slightly slippery. For those who prefer a better grip, OnePlus also offers a vegan leather option. That said, I personally prefer the white model for its elegant and classy appearance. The silver accents around the camera module and side frames contrast beautifully with the white finish, giving the device a stunning look.
 


OnePlus has also managed to reduce the weight (and thickness) of the device by 10 grams, despite housing a larger 6000mAh battery compared to the 5400mAh unit in the OnePlus 12. This is quite impressive. Durability too has seen an upgrade with IP68 and IP69 water and dust resistance ratings, meaning the OnePlus 13 can survive water splashes and even submersion to a certain extent, making it more reliable for everyday use.Another welcome upgrade is the use of an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which offers a much faster and more reliable unlocking, even with wet fingers. The placement of this sensor is well within reach, though the volume and power buttons are positioned a bit higher, which may take some getting used to. OnePlus has retained the popular alert slider on the left to let you easily switch sound profiles, which is one of the most useful features that the brand has offered for years.Display: Bright, sharp and richOn paper, the OnePlus 13 has a display that is similar to the one we saw on the OnePlus 12. The size remains the same, so you still get the 6.82-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and QHD+ resolution. The brightness is impressive, with 1600 nits of usual brightness and 4500 nits of peak brightness when watching HDR content on apps like Netflix and YouTube. The screen remains quite visible even in direct sunlight, and the high peak brightness makes shadows in darker scenes on Netflix more visible.
 


Additionally, OnePlus has also added 2nits of minimum brightness support, allowing the screen to get sufficiently dim in dark environments, making it easier on the eyes. I have to say, with a pixel density of 510ppi, the OnePlus 13 offers some of the sharpest visuals in its class. The quality of colours too is excellent. The phone has a bright screen with rich colours and a slightly warmer tone, making photos and videos appear lifelike.One of the best additions is the ability to use the device while wearing woollen or sheepskin gloves, which is particularly useful during cold Delhi winters. I believe other smartphone brands should also offer this feature for the added convenience it provides. The OnePlus 13 features a micro quad-curved display this time, giving the panel a subtle curve that makes the bezels appear thinner, which in turn makes the display look even larger.advertisementThe OnePlus 13 also supports LTPO technology, allowing the display’s refresh rate to adjust between 1Hz and 120Hz. However, it rarely drops to 1Hz or even below 60Hz. To save battery, the refresh rate should ideally dip to 1Hz or 10Hz when Always-On Display (AoD) is enabled, but the screen generally stays between 60Hz and 120Hz. This, though, is a minor issue that is easily solvable with a software update.The display is protected by Ceramic Guard, which OnePlus claims is 20 percent tougher than Gorilla Glass Victus. OnePlus, as it has been doing since the very beginning, puts a scratch guard on the phone. This is always a welcome sight because it saves consumers from buying their own glass or plastic shield for the phone. Performance: A workhorseJust like the OnePlus 12, the OnePlus 13 is set to earn the ""flagship killer of the year"" title, and I say this purely based on its impressive performance. Let’s dive into the benchmark scores first. The multi-core performance on Geekbench is strong, easily surpassing the 9,000 mark. On Antutu, while the score of 2,585,262 falls slightly short of OnePlus claims for the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the 1.1 million GPU score alone highlights the phone's exceptional potential for GPU-intensive tasks. In the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme test, the OnePlus 13 offers a 15 per cent performance boost over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from last year.
 


advertisementWhile these scores are impressive, the device can get slightly hot while running benchmarks, particularly in PCMark and 3DMark. But then we don’t go around running benchmarks on our phone. In regular use, it rarely gets warm and while playing games it can be warm to touch but not in an alarming way. For example, even after 35 minutes of gaming the phone was only slightly warm. Gaming performance is top-notch, with titles like Genshin Impact running at 60fps (medium graphics) and Call of Duty consistently hitting 120fps. That said, in our thermal management tests, the OnePlus 13R ran slightly cooler, indicating that while the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset delivers outstanding performance, there’s room for improvement in thermal efficiency.advertisementOverall, the OnePlus 13 feels smooth, fast, and responsive. The haptics are mostly solid, and the app launches as well as animations are quick, thanks to the new OxygenOS 15 software, LPDDR5X RAM, and UFS 4.0 storage. The OnePlus 13 supports a USB 3.2 port with display port capabilities, making it an excellent choice for gamers who want to stream their content to a larger screen.How is the software?You get the usual clean and fast user interface in the OnePlus 13. With OxygenOS 15, OnePlus has added a new ""Share with iPhone"" feature, which is impressively fast and allows you to transfer large video or photo files in under 30 seconds. The update also includes the BeaconLink feature, enabling you to call someone nearby when there's no network on your phone. It operates within a 200-meter range. However, this doesn't work with every phone. Also, both Bluetooth and the feature itself must be turned on in the settings. While it’s a useful addition, the feature is only available on select OnePlus and Oppo devices.
 


Additionally, OnePlus has included eSIM support, which is a great feature, though it requires you to disable the second SIM when using eSIM. OxygenOS 15 also brings a split notification mode, allowing you to access notifications and shortcuts separately for a better experience. You will also find some useful privacy features such as app lock and the option to hide apps. The overall experience is great and you won't see bloatware on this device.Larger 6000mAh battery makes a big differenceThe OnePlus 13 features a massive 6000mAh battery, which is a big upgrade compared to the previous version's 5400mAh unit. As I used the phone, often it lasted for 1.5 days with moderate usage, providing around 10 hours of screen-on time. This included a mix of calling, texting, social media usage, lots of photography sessions, and watching a few videos. For those who want to know the PCMark battery result, it recorded an impressive number —18 hours and 32 minutes. Although, this is around 2 hours less than what phones with MediaTek 9400, such as Oppo Find X8 Pro, are managing in the same benchmark.
 


Charging the device is a breeze, thanks to the 100W wired charging support, which takes the phone from 5 per cent to 100 per cent in just about 30 minutes. A lot of companies, nowadays, such as Samsung, Apple and Google are no longer bundling a charger in the box. Thankfully, OnePlus hasn’t joined the gang yet.The OnePlus 13 also supports 50W magnetic wireless charging, which takes about one hour to fully charge the device. Furthermore, OnePlus has introduced a slim and compact 5000mAh magnetic wireless power bank that easily attaches to the back of the phone, providing quick top-ups when you are on the go. It is possible that OnePlus may launch this power bank in India soon. Camera performance: Expect good, cinematic shotsIn flagship phones, cameras are now so close to each other in performance that the differences are minute and often require that you pick a magnifying glass and go hunt for pixel-level flaws. The camera in the OnePlus 13 is flagship grade, but if you have seen photos clicked with other flagships — say the iPhone 16 series, or the latest Oppo and Realme and iQoo phones or Samsung phones — you will be hard pressed to objectively call one superior to the other. They all excel in some areas and they all falter at this thing or that. The exceptions, in my opinion, would be the latest Vivo and the latest Pixels. With this large context, let me take a look at the OnePlus 13 camera performance. Particularly for its price, it delivers a good experience. In daylight, the OnePlus 13 can capture shots with natural colours, decent sharpness, and ample details. The dynamic range is generally well-balanced, though performance can be inconsistent at times. Occasionally, skies may appear blown out or highlights and shadows get clipped in scenes that have a crazy amount of variation between highlights and shadows. In good light,  meanwhile, the device can produce cinematic shots, especially during post-processing, where it adds drama to scenes, making the skies and foreground look stunning — something that’s particularly noticeable in beach photos. The 3x optical zoom — and even 120x digital zoom — performs well, allowing you to capture distant subjects with surprising clarity. For instance, I was able to capture a surfer in the sea and the photo was clicked at over 800mm effective focal length. Yes, the photo was a little messy but it was still incredible that I could click such a photo.  Click on any photo below to access all the camera samplesPortrait shots in daylight also turn out well, especially when clicked in good lighting. Close-up portrait photos offer good detail, texture, sharpness, and natural colours, with balanced exposure. However, when capturing portraits from a distance, the photos look good but the details get a bit soft. The edge detection and background blur are mostly on-point, creating pleasing depth effects.Macro photography isn’t the OnePlus 13’s strongest suit, but the shots are decent enough for sharing on social media. That being said, OnePlus has made noticeable improvements in low-light photography with this version. The photos come out brighter, with better clarity, good detail, and lifelike colours, all while minimising noise, which is nice. The dynamic range is just fine. Additionally, there's no lens flare issue, which is a definite plus. Overall, the OnePlus 13 offers reliable and cinematic shots for your Instagram, especially in well-lit conditions.OnePlus 13: Is it worth buying?The OnePlus 13 is a well-rounded phone that offers top performance and flagship experience at relatively good prices. It brings meaningful upgrades, including a bigger battery, faster charging, improved fingerprint tech, a more powerful chipset, and better waterproofing. While the display remains largely unchanged, faster performance and design refinements make it a solid option in the flagship market. It even offers a good camera experience in its price range.Priced at Rs 69,999, the OnePlus 13 offers a premium experience and a smooth software experience, making it a worthy investment for those seeking a high-performance device with long-lasting battery life and good aesthetics. If you are looking for a solid yet relatively affordable flagship device, the OnePlus 13 is the phone for you.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Must Watch 
 The OnePlus 13 may seem familiar at first, but it brings a refreshing update to its design with subtle yet impactful aesthetic changes. While the circular rear camera module with four sensors remains, the device now features flat sides and a flat screen, giving it a more modern appearance. However, since the new version has a boxy design, it gives the impression of a wider form factor compared to the OnePlus 12. In reality, the OnePlus 13 is slimmer and lighter. This shift in design, combined with leather and glass finish options, makes the OnePlus 13 feel noticeably more premium than its predecessor. The white model I am reviewing features a frosted glass back panel with a subtle shimmer effect, which reminds me of the sandstone texture seen on older devices like the OnePlus 5T. However, this new version has a smooth finish, which makes it slightly slippery. For those who prefer a better grip, OnePlus also offers a vegan leather option. That said, I personally prefer the white model for its elegant and classy appearance. The silver accents around the camera module and side frames contrast beautifully with the white finish, giving the device a stunning look.
 


 OnePlus has also managed to reduce the weight (and thickness) of the device by 10 grams, despite housing a larger 6000mAh battery compared to the 5400mAh unit in the OnePlus 12. This is quite impressive. Durability too has seen an upgrade with IP68 and IP69 water and dust resistance ratings, meaning the OnePlus 13 can survive water splashes and even submersion to a certain extent, making it more reliable for everyday use. Another welcome upgrade is the use of an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which offers a much faster and more reliable unlocking, even with wet fingers. The placement of this sensor is well within reach, though the volume and power buttons are positioned a bit higher, which may take some getting used to. OnePlus has retained the popular alert slider on the left to let you easily switch sound profiles, which is one of the most useful features that the brand has offered for years.Display: Bright, sharp and rich On paper, the OnePlus 13 has a display that is similar to the one we saw on the OnePlus 12. The size remains the same, so you still get the 6.82-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and QHD+ resolution. The brightness is impressive, with 1600 nits of usual brightness and 4500 nits of peak brightness when watching HDR content on apps like Netflix and YouTube. The screen remains quite visible even in direct sunlight, and the high peak brightness makes shadows in darker scenes on Netflix more visible.
 


Additionally, OnePlus has also added 2nits of minimum brightness support, allowing the screen to get sufficiently dim in dark environments, making it easier on the eyes. I have to say, with a pixel density of 510ppi, the OnePlus 13 offers some of the sharpest visuals in its class. The quality of colours too is excellent. The phone has a bright screen with rich colours and a slightly warmer tone, making photos and videos appear lifelike.One of the best additions is the ability to use the device while wearing woollen or sheepskin gloves, which is particularly useful during cold Delhi winters. I believe other smartphone brands should also offer this feature for the added convenience it provides.

f46eae0a-bc26-4b8b-ab88-039b17b7b627,"Apple iPhone SE 4 may launch in April with iOS 18.3The iPhone SE 4 aka 16e is rumoured to launch in April 2025 with iPad 11. According to Mark Gurman, Apple may unveil the devices at the same time as iOS 18.3 release. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-iphone-se-4-may-launch-in-april-with-ios-183-2661294-2025-01-08,"Apple is rumoured to bring back the SE series after 2 years in 2025. The company last launched the device, the iPhone SE 3, in 2022 and now the iPhone SE 4 is next in line. Previously, rumours indicated that the phone would hit the shelves in March. However, Mark Gurman, a trusted Apple source, claims April might be the launch month for the iPhone SE 4.  Gurman took to X (formerly Twitter), rubbishing a report that stated the iPhone SE 4 will be launched this month. He added that if everything stays on track and Apple is able to meet the decided timeline, the iPhone SE 4 might be released by April. Moreover, he claimed that we can expect the affordable iPhone launch before iOS 18.4. Moreover, it is highly likely that the launch time will overlap with iOS 18.3. 
 


iPhone SE 4: Expected specs and features  According to the rumours and leaks, Apple might be planning to rebrand its upcoming SE 4 to the iPhone 16e. It looks like the company will be associating the toned-down iPhone SE with its flagship series from now on. The upcoming phone is also expected to bring several upgrades over its predecessors.  For starters, the shift from the iPhone 8-inspired design to one more in line with the iPhone 16 will provide a more modern and immersive user experience. The rumoured 6.06-inch OLED display is relatively large over the 4.7-inch LCD, and will enhance the overall viewing quality, making it more comparable to high-end iPhones. With the rumoured A18 chipset, the SE 4 aka 16e will have a substantial performance boost, bringing it closer to the iPhone 16 series in terms of processing power. The increase to 8GB of RAM (up from 4GB) is especially notable, offering better multitasking capabilities and support for more demanding apps, including Apple's latest AI and machine learning features. Moreover, the phone could also feature the same rear camera as the iPhone 16. The fourth-generation iPhone SE is expected to come with a 48-megapixel rear camera, along with a 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera, bringing significant upgrades to Apple's more budget-friendly device. This new camera setup aligns closely with the iPhone 16’s rear camera, which uses a 48-megapixel wide-angle lens that Apple refers to as a ""Fusion"" lens, capable of handling both standard and 2x zoom photos without losing detail.iPhone SE 4: India price leaked  We have previously reported, citing a South Korean blog, that the iPhone SE 4 is expected to be priced at $500 (approximately Rs 42,700) or lower. Notably, this aligns with previous rumours about the iPhone SE 4’s $499 price point. For context, the iPhone SE 3 was launched in India in 2022 at a starting price of Rs 43,900, and it was priced at $429 (approx Rs 36,700) in the US. And with the upcoming iPhone SE 4, we must expect this price gap as well. If the iPhone SE 4 or 16e is to follow the traditions, the price in India could go up to Rs 49,900.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

ed3fb728-cc31-452f-908a-9c7114252148,"Google widely rolls out QR code-based sharing via Quick Share on AndroidGoogle's Quick Share now supports QR codes, making file transfers simpler and faster. You no longer need to save a contact or verify a device before sharing files between Android devices.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-widely-rolls-out-qr-code-based-sharing-via-quick-share-on-android-2661316-2025-01-08,"Google is widely rolling out a new feature for Android users that makes sharing files even easier. Now, you can use QR codes to share files through Quick Share, a tool already built into your Android phone. This update is part of the latest version (24.49.33) of Google Play Services and is available to users worldwide. The new feature works in a way that feels simple and familiar. Once you tap the Quick Share option in your phone’s share menu, a fullscreen interface will appear. You’ll now see a new option called “Use QR code” in the “Send to nearby devices” section. Selecting this will bring up a unique QR code branded with the Quick Share logo. When the QR code appears, your screen automatically brightens to make it easier for other devices to scan. What makes this feature so handy is its simplicity. The person you’re sharing with just needs to open the camera app on their Android phone and point it at your QR code. This will instantly generate a ""quickshare.google"" link on their device, and the file transfer will begin without any additional steps. Google says you don’t need to add anyone as a contact, verify devices, or fiddle with sharing settings — it just works. Another useful feature is that the QR code can be scanned by more than one device. This is great if you need to send the same files to multiple people, such as sharing event photos with friends or documents with colleagues. For anyone who’s ever struggled with Quick Share not detecting nearby devices or simply not working, this QR code option could be a game-changer. This update is part of Google’s December 2024 Feature Bundle, which focuses on making Android more versatile. While Quick Share itself isn’t new, the addition of QR code support is a welcome improvement. It makes the process more reliable, especially in situations where devices don’t appear on the nearby list — a common frustration for many Android users. Interestingly, Samsung users might find this feature familiar. Galaxy devices have had their own version of QR code-based sharing in Samsung Quick Share for a while now. However, Samsung’s version includes some extra features, like the ability to share files through Samsung Cloud. These extras are still exclusive to Galaxy devices, but Google’s new update means that QR code sharing is now available on all Android phones, not just Samsung’s.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's new AI models were trained on 20 million hours of human moves

But with high costs and low production, the Samsung tri-fold might materialise as much as it seems. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsungs-triple-fold-phone-could-debut-in-2025-2661324-2025-01-08,"Samsung has been working on a triple-fold smartphone for quite some time. And now finally, the company might release the tri-foldable phone this year. Samsung's involvement in developing a tri-fold smartphone isn't a new topic. Back in March 2023, rumours suggested the company might delay the Galaxy S23 FE launch—eventually released in October 2023—in favour of focusing on a groundbreaking smartphone with a triple-folding display. Samsung even showcased the concept of this tri-fold design during the Samsung Developer Conference (SDC) in October 2023. Although the tri-fold smartphone didn't debut then, it appears Samsung remains committed to this innovation, with a potential launch now anticipated in 2025. advertisementSamsung triple-fold phone: Big prices, low productionThis comes after a Chinese company, Huawei, released the world's first triple-fold smartphone in September 2024 -- Huawei Mate XT. While the concept is similar, the price gap may be huge. The Huawei Mate XT is priced at 20,000 Yuan in China (approximately Rs 2,31,800). However, a report by the Korean publication Sisa Journal indicates that Samsung’s version will come with a higher price tag. Citing insights from a display industry insider, the report highlights that the tri-fold device will feature three display panels, two internal and two external hinges, along with enhanced hardware technology—making it significantly more expensive than current foldable smartphones.Since the display is a problematic area in the tri-fold phone, Samsung learnt its lesson from the Huawei Mate XT. As reported by the Sisa Journal, Samsung’s triple-folding smartphone will feature a G-shaped design, where the outer screens fold inward. This differs from the Huawei Mate XT’s S- or Z-shaped folding mechanism, which folds both inward and outward. The report suggests that Samsung’s innovative design will result in a more durable device overall.

This differs from the Huawei Mate XT’s S- or Z-shaped folding mechanism, which folds both inward and outward. The report suggests that Samsung’s innovative design will result in a more durable device overall. But Samsung appears cautious about its new sub-category of devices, with plans to produce fewer than 3,00,000 units of the G-type triple-folding smartphone, as per the report. The device is expected to debut in the second half of 2025. Similar to the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition, the initial launch will likely be restricted to South Korea and select Asian markets. A broader global rollout might depend on the device's performance and reception during the initial launch phase. Samsung's 2025 plan for foldables  It looks like Samsung has major plans for foldable phones this year. After Galaxy Unpacked event (scheduled for January 22), which will unveil the Galaxy S25 series, the company will turn its focus on Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. This year, the company has two more foldables: Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and a triple-fold phone. While there is a lot of variety in 2025, production is still expected to be low. Samsung triple-fold: Expected Specs Currently, there’s limited information available about Samsung’s tri-fold device, but one intriguing theory suggests it could feature a stunning 12.4-inch display when fully unfolded. This would position the device as a potential replacement for both a traditional smartphone and a tablet, surpassing the 10.2-inch screen of Huawei’s groundbreaking Mate XT. Interestingly, the device might also offer a partially unfolded mode with a screen size of around 10.5 inches, delivering an impressive viewing experience. Another noteworthy rumour is the possible exclusion of under-display camera technology. While this could enhance the quality of the front-facing camera, it would necessitate a hole-punch cutout on the main screen, slightly compromising the device’s overall elegance. However, this trade-off might be worth it for improved camera performance.

Announced earlier this year at Google I/O 2024, the “Ask about this PDF” feature is now available in the Files by Google app. It allows users to ask questions about a PDF document directly, making it faster and simpler to get the information you need. The new feature is part of Google’s Gemini overlay, which is designed to bring AI-powered tools to various parts of Android. If you’re viewing a PDF in Files by Google’s updated viewer, you’ll now see a new button called “Ask about this PDF”. Tapping it lets you upload the document and then ask questions about its contents. For example, you could ask for a summary of the document, clarification on specific sections, or even detailed information about tables or charts inside the PDF. Once you tap the “Ask about this PDF” button, the app will begin uploading the document. You can then type your question into an “Ask Gemini” text box. While the file uploads, the send button will remain greyed out until the process is complete. After that, you’re good to go. Gemini will display its answers as an overlay, so you can still see the PDF in the background while reading the response. You can also ask follow-up questions without needing to restart the process. This functionality is similar to what you can already do in the Gemini app itself. There, you can upload files and have a conversation about their content. However, the new integration in Files by Google makes the process smoother by keeping everything in one app. There’s no need to switch between apps, which can save you time and effort. For now, this feature is only available in the Files by Google app. It doesn’t work with Google Drive’s PDF viewer, which continues to offer the standard “Ask about this screen” feature seen in other apps. This may be a bit of a disappointment for those who use Google Drive to manage their files, but future updates may expand the feature to more apps. It’s worth noting that the “Ask about this PDF” feature is only available to customers using Gemini Advanced. This version of the AI takes advantage of a long context window, meaning it can process and understand larger documents more effectively. If you’re not on Gemini Advanced, you won’t see this option. The feature is rolling out as part of version 16.0.5 of the Google app. This version is currently in beta but should become widely available in the near future.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's new AI models were trained on 20 million hours of human moves

He posted on X, saying the claims are utterly untrue. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/sam-altmans-sister-accuses-him-of-sexual-abuse-openai-ceo-denies-claims-2661391-2025-01-08,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is once again making the headlines, and for the wrong reasons. Ann Altman, his sister, has filed a lawsuit alleging that her brother sexually abused her repeatedly over a nine-year period, beginning in 1997. The lawsuit, filed Monday in US District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri, claims the abuse occurred at the family’s home in Clayton, Missouri, starting when Ann was three years old and Sam was 12. The lawsuit alleges that the abuse happened “several times per week"". It also states that Ann has suffered “severe emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression” as a result of the alleged abuse, with these effects expected to persist. This is not the first time Ann has spoken out against her brother; she previously made similar accusations publicly on social media. For instance, in November 2021, she posted on X that she had suffered ""sexual, physical, emotional, verbal, financial, and technological abuse"" at the hands of her brothers, Sam Altman and Jack Altman. However, this marks the first time she has taken legal action. Represented by Illinois-based attorney Ryan Mahoney, who specialises in sexual assault and harassment cases, Ann is seeking a jury trial and damages exceeding $75,000, according to the CNBC report.  In a joint statement released on X (formerly Twitter), Sam Altman, his mother Connie, and his brothers Jack and Max denied the allegations. “Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam,” the statement reads. It describes the lawsuit as false and asserts that Annie faces “mental health challenges” while rejecting “conventional treatment.”
 


 “This situation causes immense pain to our entire family,” the statement adds. This is not the only legal challenge the OpenAI CEO has faced. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk filed a separate lawsuit in March, accusing Altman and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman of breach of contract and fiduciary duty. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, left the organisation’s board in 2018 and has since criticised its transition to a for-profit model. After initially filing in a San Francisco court, Musk refiled his lawsuit in federal court in June. OpenAI has pushed back against Musk, stating that in 2017, Musk himself proposed transitioning the company to a for-profit structure.

The company has confirmed that this move will primarily target underperforming employees.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/microsoft-says-it-will-fire-more-employees-who-are-underperforming-2661445-2025-01-08,"Microsoft is preparing to fire more employees. People who are familiar with the matter told Business Insider that this move will primarily target underperforming employees. While the company has confirmed the news, it has not disclosed the exact number of workers affected. Here are the key details. A Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged the upcoming layoffs and reiterated the company's focus on high-performance talent. The spokesperson stressed that when employees fail to meet performance expectations, appropriate actions are taken. As part of its strategy, Microsoft evaluates staff performance across multiple levels, even reaching some senior employees at level 80. Several departments, including the company’s critical Security division, are expected to feel the impact of these job cuts, according to the sources. The spokesperson also mentioned that roles left vacant due to these performance-based exits are often filled with new hires, suggesting that Microsoft’s overall headcount may not change drastically. As of mid-2024, the company employed roughly 228,000 people worldwide. This move aligns with Microsoft’s long-standing history of workforce restructuring, a practice it has followed under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella. Since taking charge in 2014, Nadella has overseen multiple rounds of layoffs, including a major cut that same year which affected 18,000 employees—nearly 14% of Microsoft’s total workforce at the time. In recent years, Microsoft has continued to make strategic job reductions across various sectors. In 2023, the company let go around 10,000 employees, cutting across different divisions, including Xbox. Following its high-profile acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft laid off nearly 2,000 employees from its gaming division in early 2024. More cuts followed during the summer, with about 1,000 people from its Azure cloud services division affected.  In September 2024, Microsoft reduced its workforce further, with 650 layoffs hitting its Xbox division, pushing the number of job cuts from its gaming segment to nearly 3,000 for the year.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 8, 2025

In short, the new OnePlus 13R promises four years of software upgrades and six years of security updates, giving it a longer software lifecycle.Refreshed design and improved build quality OnePlus has also refreshed the design of its affordable OnePlus 13R. Compared to the curved display of the OnePlus 12R, the OnePlus 13R features a flat display and an aluminum frame with Crystal Shield Glass protection on the front and back. Adding durability to the design, the OnePlus 13R also boasts an IP65 rating, offering better protection against dust and water compared to the IP64 rating of its predecessor. Additionally, the OnePlus 13R is the first OnePlus phone to feature Corning Gorilla Glass 7i on the front.

For those interested, pre-reservations for the Galaxy S25 series have started in India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-is-now-up-for-pre-reserve-in-india-check-out-offers-2661428-2025-01-08,"It’s official. Samsung is gearing up to launch its Galaxy S25 series on January 22, 2025, at the Galaxy Unpacked event. This upcoming flagship smartphone lineup promises to deliver a next-level AI experience, thanks to the new OneUI7 software and top-tier hardware. 
For those interested, pre-reservations for the Galaxy S25 series have started in India. For a small, refundable payment of Rs 1,999, customers in India can pre-reserve their Galaxy S25 ahead of the official launch. This token payment not only guarantees early access to the devices but also lets you avail additional benefits worth Rs 5,000. This offer is available in both online and offline stores. It’s a win-win situation — if you decide not to go through with the purchase, you’ll get your money back. Samsung is sweetening the deal further for customers who pre-order through the company’s official website. Users will have the exclusive chance to choose special-edition colour options and pick from different RAM and storage configurations. On top of that, Samsung is offering the best possible trade-in value for your current smartphone, making it easier to upgrade to the Galaxy S25 series. The Galaxy S25 series is expected to include at least three models — the standard Galaxy S25, the larger Galaxy S25 Plus, and the feature-packed Galaxy S25 Ultra. Rumours suggest there could be a fourth model as well, the Galaxy S25 Slim, which could be Samsung’s thinnest flagship ever. However, reports suggest this sleek device won’t hit the market until later in 2025. While Samsung hasn’t officially revealed all the details about the Galaxy S25 series, expectations are high. The new OneUI 7 is expected to bring a smoother, more intuitive user experience, along with a bunch of new features. On the hardware side, the Galaxy S25 series is likely to pack the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, top-notch camera systems, and Dynamic AMOLED displays. By pre-reserving a Galaxy S25 now, customers can ensure they’re among the first to get their hands on Samsung’s next big thing. Those who take advantage of the pre-reservation scheme will also gain early access to sales, giving them a head start before the general public. It’s worth noting that Samsung’s refundable token amount makes the pre-reservation process risk-free. If you change your mind or don’t find the new Galaxy S25 to your liking after its launch, you can easily get your money back — no strings attached.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  CES 2025: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's new AI models were trained on 20 million hours of human moves

From eye-catching designs to long battery life and good cameras, these phones offer fantastic value. Here are four top picks for January, including the new Redmi Note 14 Pro+ 5G.advertisementRedmi Note 14 Pro+ 5GThe Redmi Note 14 Pro+ 5G is a standout in the sub-Rs 35,000 segment.

Under the hood, the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor ensures smooth performance, whether you’re multitasking or gaming. Its 6,200mAh battery easily lasts all day, and the 90W fast charging means you’ll be back up and running in no time. The 6.67-inch AMOLED screen is bright and vivid, reaching up to 3,000 nits — perfect for watching videos or playing games. On the camera side, there’s a versatile triple-lens setup: a 50MP main camera with stabilisation, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 50MP telephoto lens. Plus, with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 rating, the phone is tough enough to handle everyday bumps and splashes.Vivo T3 Ultra 5GNext up is the Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, another great choice at this price. This phone is slim and light, weighing just 192g and measuring 7.6mm thick. Despite its sleek design, it packs a 5,500mAh battery which easily lasts more than a day.

This change comes at a crucial time, as Meta tries to balance free speech, content moderation, and political pressures, probably with the incoming US President, Donald Trump. The impact of this decision is wide-ranging, from how misinformation will be managed on platforms like Facebook and Instagram to the future of third-party fact-checking organisations that rely on Meta’s support. Here is the full story in 5 points.advertisementMeta ends fact-checking programMeta’s decision to end its fact-checking program is a big shift in how the social media giant approaches content moderation. The program, once a key part of the company’s efforts to combat misinformation, had been in place for years. It partnered with third-party fact-checkers to verify content on Facebook and Instagram, flagging false information and reducing its spread. However, Zuckerberg has recently pointed to errors in the system and acknowledged that the company had perhaps gone too far in moderating content. In a video statement, Zuckerberg asserted the need to return to Meta’s roots, which he described as prioritising free speech and less interference with user content. He noted that the platform would refocus on ensuring that user expression was not overly restricted, acknowledging that the fact-checking system had faced big criticism, especially from conservative circles, for being too aggressive in its censorship efforts.Is Zuckerberg trying to appease Donald Trump? Meta’s decision to end its fact-checking program is a big shift in how the social media giant approaches content moderation. The program, once a key part of the company’s efforts to combat misinformation, had been in place for years. It partnered with third-party fact-checkers to verify content on Facebook and Instagram, flagging false information and reducing its spread. However, Zuckerberg has recently pointed to errors in the system and acknowledged that the company had perhaps gone too far in moderating content.

He noted that the platform would refocus on ensuring that user expression was not overly restricted, acknowledging that the fact-checking system had faced big criticism, especially from conservative circles, for being too aggressive in its censorship efforts.Is Zuckerberg trying to appease Donald Trump? The timing of Meta’s decision has led many to question whether it is politically motivated. It is being reported that the move coincides with efforts to mend relations with Trump, who has long been a critic of social media platforms for what he views as the suppression of conservative voices. Trump’s criticisms of Facebook and other platforms have centered on claims of censorship, and now that he is back in the political spotlight with another run for the White House, Meta’s decision could possibly be a strategic alignment with Trump’s views, likely to be in his good books. Adding to this perception is Meta’s recent appointment of individuals with ties to Trump, such as Dana White, to its board. These moves suggest that the company is trying to avoid future conflicts with the Trump administration and align itself more closely with conservative ideologies, especially around free speech. Nearly two months ago, Zuckerberg had dinner with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club, during which they discussed Meta's plan to donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee. This gesture could also be Meta's efforts to repair ties with Trump, who was suspended from Meta platforms in 2021 and reinstated in 2023.Meta takes a new approach: Community Notes In place of its traditional fact-checking system, Meta will introduce a new system inspired by Elon Musk’s approach for X (formerly Twitter), called community notes. This system allows users to add context or debunk claims by attaching notes to posts. It is designed to provide a more decentralised approach to fact-checking, giving users more control over what is flagged and how it is explained. While some have praised community notes for promoting different perspectives, others are skeptical about its effectiveness in addressing misinformation. Critics argue that without a central fact-checking authority, false information may still increase, and the system could be manipulated by bad actors to spread misinformation under the guise of context.  Meta’s new Chief Global Affairs Officer, Joel Kaplan, has stated that the new system will be phased in over several months in 2025, with input from various political perspectives to reduce bias. However, the big question remains whether this approach will be enough to satisfy concerns about the spread of false information, particularly in an era where misinformation can easily go viral.A blow to fact-checking organisations Meta’s decision has blindsided many fact-checking organisations that were a key part of its Third-Party Fact-Checking Program. Groups like Lead Stories, which worked closely with Meta to verify content, expressed disappointment and uncertainty about the future. Alan Duke, Editor-in-Chief of Lead Stories, revealed that they had no prior notice of Meta’s plans to end the program, leaving them in a precarious position. The move is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the global fact-checking community, many of whom relied heavily on Meta’s funding and platform partnerships to continue their work. A survey by the International Fact-Checking Network found that 64 per cent of global fact-checkers were part of Meta’s program, and its sudden end raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of these groups.Political and regulatory challenges ahead for Meta? Fact-checking has been a long-standing issue for Republicans, who view Meta's moderation policies as a form of censorship. With Trump re-entering the political scene, Republicans might reignite their criticism of platforms like Facebook for allegedly suppressing conservative views. Trump, in his next term, has indicated plans to challenge companies that endorse moderation, with his FTC pick, Andrew Ferguson, set to target firms accused of ""facilitating censorship."" Zuckerberg says Meta’s latest decision will bring balance to public discourse. But, critics are suggesting that ending fact-checking could lead to a surge in viral misinformation. Alan Duke of Lead Stories believes fact-checking is vital for free speech, as it supports informed debate by verifying facts.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 8, 2025

The company is calling it the Microsoft AI Tour. Nadella addressed an event in Bengaluru on January 7, and today a similar event was hosted by the company in New Delhi. We were in attendance at the event, where the company chief announced its AI efforts in India, partnerships with Indian companies, and its big investments in AI in the country. Among the many announcements was a key partnership that Microsoft announced in collaboration with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) wherein the company aims to skill 5,00,000 students and teachers in AI in India by 2026.  Key initiatives under the partnership not only include skilling 500,000 individuals — students, educators, developers, government officials, and women entrepreneurs — by 2026, it also entails establishing an AI Center of Excellence called AI Catalysts to promote rural AI innovation, support 100,000 AI developers, and foster community-driven solutions. Additionally, 20 AI productivity labs will be set up in National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) and NIELIT centers across 10 states to train 20,000 educators in AI fundamentals.  

 



Microsoft held an AI Tour event in New Delhi on Wednesday
 The collaboration will further focus on creating AI solutions for critical sectors like healthcare, education, accessibility, and agriculture, tailored to India’s unique challenges. It also includes developing foundational AI models with Indic language support and enabling research through Microsoft Research (MSR) India. Eligible AI startups will gain access to Microsoft’s Founders Hub program, which provides technology, mentorship, and business resources.   At the event, Nadella also reiterated that Microsoft will be investing $3 billion in India over the next 2 years. He made this announcement at the Microsoft AI Tour event in Bengaluru on Tuesday.  Additionally, the company has also shared its plans to invest in new data centers to enhance its AI infrastructure. Through its ADVANTA(I)GE India initiative, the company aims to equip 10 million Indians with AI skills by 2030.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also announced that the new data centres that open in India will feature waterless cooling systems and rely on renewable energy, which will contribute to the company’s goal of being carbon negative by 2030.

 



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
 AI is clearly a major focus for Microsoft moving forward. During the event, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and company president Puneet Chandok repeatedly referred to AI as the ""guardian angel"" of the future for consumers. Microsoft envisions a future where consumers fully embrace AI while developers and companies rely on Microsoft’s technology to create AI-driven solutions for users.   Nadella sees significant potential for this vision in India. In a separate fireside chat at the event, he highlighted how AI is not just being discussed in India—it is actively being applied. This, he believes, leads to a rapid rate of diffusion and impact. According to Nadella, India serves as the ideal ground for AI use case studies and implementation. He also emphasized the need for India to focus on frontier AI work and use it to develop tools that support local languages. ""India should do frontier work in AI and use it to develop more local language tools,"" Nadella stated.

Let's find out in this India Today Tech review.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/amazon-eco-spot-review-cute-smart-enough-and-pricey-2661716-2025-01-08,"Let's be honest: we all have a love-hate relationship with alarm clocks. I mean, we like the idea of something helping us wake up on time, but at the same time, we hate it when it actually rings early in the morning. But what if you could personalise your alarm and make your alarm clock do more than just ring? Imagine setting your favourite song as your alarm or assigning different songs to different alarms based on your mood and the time of day. Or maybe you are in the mood to have a bedside conversation with someone. Imagine you could simply say, ""Alexa, what's going on in India right now."" Sounds fancy and fun right?  Well, Amazon has introduced its next-gen Echo Spot in India, a smart alarm clock that does more than just wake you up. The device features a small touch screen, a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker, and Alexa smart assistant. It also comes with a ton of customisable options, that let users set custom displays with various clock faces and colour options. What else? You can also set custom music alarms, play music, podcasts, audiobooks, and display media information on the screen. Another feature is that the Echo Spot integrates with smart home devices, supports voice calls and announcements, and includes privacy features such as a microphone off button. In India, the new Amazon Echo Spot is priced at Rs 8,999. However, as part of a limited-time introductory offer, it is available for Rs 6,449. It's a fancy smart clock, but at the same time, it is quite pricey. So, the question remains: is it worth it, and what difference does it make sitting next to your bedside? Let's find out.Cute and compact  The Amazon Echo Spot has a small and compact design resembling a half-egg. But with an oval cutout at its base so that you can keep it on the table. The device I am reviewing is in black colour, and overall, the design is pretty neat. The Echo Spot has a rubber rim underneath that keeps it stable and rooted on the table. At the back, there is a socket for connecting the power cord. On the spherical top, you'll find three buttons: volume up, volume down, and a microphone button that either turns off the microphone. The same button is also needed to pair the device with the accompanying app on the phone and to connect the device to WiFi while setting it up. On the front, the Echo Spot features a touch screen on top half, and a front-firing speaker below it. 
 


 While the idea of a touch screen is smart and it offers several functions – which I'll get to shortly — the display size could have been larger. Although the display area takes up more than half of the circle, the actual screen is much smaller and doesn't utilise the available space fully. A bit bigger display would have been better.  As for the speaker, the front-firing speaker is covered with a fibre mesh. All in all, the design of the Echo Spot is compact, sturdy, and undeniably cute as a bedside companion.
 


Using the Echo Dot The Amazon Echo Spot needs to be plugged in when you are using it. This is standard with smart speakers, but I feel having a small battery option would have been better. As it stands, the device shuts off as soon as you turn off the switch or experience a power outage, making it unusable in such situations. This is not an issue in countries like the US where power cuts are unusual but in India imagine you have set up an alarm but just when it is about to ring there is a power cut! Unusual use case, but can happen. I mean, a battery inside the Spot would have been nice. 
 


 Once powered on, the device allows you to set custom wallpapers, check the time, date, and more, which is quite useful. I particularly liked the feature of setting custom alarms with my favourite songs, which are pulled from the internet. The touch screen also comes handy and makes it easier to control the device and manage various settings. While the display is bright and easy to navigate, it sometimes lags, which I believe is a UI issue. This problem was more noticeable initially, but after receiving a few updates, the lag became considerably less frequent. The speaker inside the Spot is quite loud and delivers clear, crisp audio with decent bass. It's suitable for casual listening and efficiently responds to Alexa commands, including initiating calls. Speaking of Alexa, the virtual assistant works similar to other assistants by helping with tasks such as controlling the device with voice commands, managing smart appliances, or providing information like the weather and news from the internet. It's fun and useful for casual interactions. Kids in particular would love it. My 5-year-old niece loved it and used Alexa to listen to poems or learn new words. In both Hindi and English language Alexa, with the help of the screen, assisted her in dictation and displayed words on the screen, which helped her learn better and in a fun way.
 


 That said, while Alexa is smart, it's not the smartest or the best virtual assistant available today. I mean Alexa used to be the queen of the hill a few years ago. Now we are in the age of LLMs and ChatGPTs. With the arrival of AI in assistants, virtual assistants have become smarter. For example, Google's Gemini in Live Voice mode not only takes user commands but can also continue a conversation, which makes Alexa feel a bit less smart and dated. This doesn't make Alexa bad. In fact, it's quite good, and for me, it's the only feature of the Spot that makes its price worth it. Not always but occasionally. For example, when I saw my niece having total fun with it I thought, sure the price is 100 per cent worth it. If you are getting it for children, I believe it is a useful gadget. For kids it can be a good assistance to learn and listen to songs or rhymes all while keeping away from smartphones or tablets.advertisementAmazon Eco Spot review verdict The Amazon Echo Spot is a cool gadget to add to your bedside. It looks cute, has a sturdy build, and does more than just show you the date and time or set alarms. Not only does it allow you to set calls hands-free, but you can also personalise the tunes or music you want your alarm to wake you up with. Making the smart clock even smarter is Alexa, which not only helps you seamlessly control your eligible smart devices but is also fun to command for quick music-listening sessions. Just say, ""Alexa, play this,"" and the voice assistant will follow your command.That said, as I mentioned, it's not the smartest virtual assistant right now and has its limitations. Whether it justifies the price tag really depends on whether you truly need a smart alarm clock that doubles as a virtual assistant. As a smart clock, I believe it is overpriced. But if you have kids who can also use it as a fun tool, it is totally worth it. And more so because it can also sing lullabies or tell bed-time stories when these kids are trying to sleep.

But Mark Zuckerberg, by getting rid of fact-checking on Facebook, is doing something more: He is trying to curry favours with Trump as well as getting rid of something that he always found irritating. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/talking-points/story/trump-back-in-power-mark-zuckerberg-uses-it-to-throw-facts-under-the-bus-2661700-2025-01-08,"Facts are never convenient. Just take a look around you, at your friends and family members, at people who you see, or just have a closer look at your thoughts, and you will realise that facts are almost always inconvenient. Because facts are inconvenient, everyone tries to avoid them. Silicon Valley, full of vaunted and utopian-sounding tech companies, never cared much for facts. That is until 2015-16 when the misinformation and this apathy for facts became such a big problem that it erupted in a number of scandals. The biggest of these was the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and CEO, moved to contain the damage around the same time Donald Trump entered the White House. He declared that facts were important because lies, which spread through Facebook, might have helped some politicians. This was the beginning of institutional ""fact-checking"" at Facebook. On January 8, as Trump is on the verge of starting his second term as the US president, Facebook is now officially ending its ""fact-checking.""  What a turnaround in just 8 short years! Mark Zuckerberg announced the change in a quick video. To ensure that people get the message, Meta chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan then went on Fox & friends to reiterate everything that Zuckerberg said.  The times are changing, said Zuckerberg as he highlighted that facts are no longer as important as speech. ""The recent elections feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritising speech,"" he said. ""So, we're restoring free expression on our platforms (and) going to get rid of fact-checkers.""  It is quite clear why Zuckerberg is doing so. There are two aspects to it — both fairly evident.  The move to downgrade facts comes just two weeks before Trump re-enters the White House. When Trump lost elections in 2020, the tech industry which had spent the previous four years fighting him, heaved a sigh of relief and moved quickly to de-platform him. Both Twitter and Facebook banned Trump in the subsequent months. Twitter aka X lifted the ban after Elon Musk bought it. Facebook restored his account in January 2023, but with added surveillance. Then, in the middle of the last year, when it became apparent that Trump might win, the account was restored fully.

Now, with Trump set to take oath as the next US president, big tech is trying to get back into his good books for a variety of reasons. Everyone is sweating and working hard. Some tech CEOs have pledged to donate money for Trump's inauguration ceremony. Some are making all the ""right"" noises. Zuckerberg, in the manner of extending an olive branch, is simply getting rid of ""fact checking"" across his platform, the kind of fact checking that would often target outlandish claims made by Trump supporters. Now, with Trump set to take oath as the next US president, big tech is trying to get back into his good books for a variety of reasons. Everyone is sweating and working hard. Some tech CEOs have pledged to donate money for Trump's inauguration ceremony. Some are making all the ""right"" noises. Zuckerberg, in the manner of extending an olive branch, is simply getting rid of ""fact checking"" across his platform, the kind of fact checking that would often target outlandish claims made by Trump supporters. ""After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy,"" Zuckerberg said on January 8. ""We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US."" Read between the lines and you will realise that Zuckerberg, by getting rid of ""fact checking,"" is simply moving to give the sort of blank check to Trump supporters as far as sharing information — or misinformation — is concerned on Meta platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Well, to Trump supporters as well as to everyone else. But it is also self-serving in another way However, getting into the good books of Trump is only half the story here. Mark Zuckerberg by any measure is a smart person. He is near genius if you look at what he has accomplished and achieved. He is also extremely savvy. Zuckerberg, like most other founders and CEOs in Silicon Valley, is not a fan of regulations. Whether necessary or unnecessary, regulations always irk tech big-wigs like Zuckerberg, Musk and Bezos. They want to create and do things with minimal restrictions and regulations. They believe that many rules, or tasks like fact-checking every bit of information that flows on their platforms, do nothing more than slow them down.  Regulating something costs time, people and money. At the same time, people and money can be better used, or so the tech founders argue, in creating and building something.  When Facebook started its fact-checking program, and created Facebook Content Oversight Board with people like Alan Rusbridger in it, Zuckerberg did so under tremendous pressure. He was facing serious heat from the media and from regulators across the world in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The fact-checking program was not really meant to ""fact check"" but was instead an attempt to ride the tough times. That moment of difficulty has passed. Facts no longer matter anymore and we truly are, as Zuckerberg says, at a ""cultural tipping point."" In other words, this is an opportune moment for Zuckerberg to get out of doing something he was never comfortable with. By getting rid of the fact-checking program, and forcing this checking business back on users by means of Community Notes, just like Elon Musk over at Twitter does, Meta is not just going to save money but also going to avoid the headache that comes by taking responsibility for something.  You see, facts are facts. The problem Zuckerberg cites — ""the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created"" — can be solved differently. It doesn't require getting rid of facts or fact-checking units. Instead, the solution could be to double down on facts and have teams and mechanisms robust enough to overcome political bias fact-checkers might have, whether that bias is left-leaning or right.  But that is not what Zuckerberg is deciding. He is going back to the classic Silicon Valley adage that is we are not the ""arbiters of truth."" In 2020, even while Facebook had an institutionalised fact-checking programme, Zuckerberg was not in favour of it. In an interview with CNBC, he said, ""I don't think that Facebook or internet platforms in general should be arbiters of truth... Political speech is one of the most sensitive parts of a democracy, and people should be able to see what politicians say.""  Unfortunately for him and Facebook until now it was nearly impossible to get out of the fact-checking that the website was forced to start 8 years ago. Such a move would have angered government regulators and would have given the media a chance to again go after Meta. But now with Trump back in power, there is an opportunity. Zuckerberg is seizing it gleefully.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Tune In

Chief Judge Richard Seeborg of the federal court in San Francisco rejected arguments that the search engine company adequately disclosed how its Web & App Activity settings worked, and that users consented to the tracking. Google had also argued that its basic record-keeping ""doesn't hurt anyone."" Users of Android and non-Android mobile devices accused Google of invading their privacy and violating a California law against unauthorised fraudulent computer access by intercepting and saving their personal browsing histories without consent. In a 20-page decision on Tuesday, Seeborg said reasonable users could view Google's conduct as ""highly offensive,"" because the company collected data despite fielding concerns from several employees and knowing its disclosures were ambiguous. He cited internal communications suggesting that Google, a unit of Alphabet, opens new tab, was intentionally vague in distinguishing between data collected inside and outside Google accounts because users might find the truth ""alarming."" On the other hand, Seeborg said the Google employees might simply have been suggesting ways to improve the Mountain View, California-based company's products and services. ""Whether Google or plaintiffs' interpretation prevails is a triable issue of fact,"" he wrote. Google said in a statement on Wednesday: ""Privacy controls have long been built into our service and the allegations here are a deliberate attempt to mischaracterise the way our products work. We will continue to make our case in court against these patently false claims."" Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A jury trial is scheduled for August 18. The lawsuit began in July 2020. Last August, the federal appeals court in San Francisco revived a lawsuit accusing Google of tracking Chrome browser users after they chose not to synchronise their browsers with their Google accounts. Four months earlier, Google agreed to destroy billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it tracked people who thought they were browsing privately, including on Chrome browsers set to ""Incognito"" mode. Law firms representing the plaintiffs in that case valued that settlement at more than $5 billion. The same firms represent the plaintiffs in the current case.

However, there was no mention of these recordings being used for marketing purposes.
Following The Guardian's 2019 report, Apple issued an apology and revised its policy. The recent lawsuit surfaced last week complaining that Apple routinely recorded their private conversations after they activated Siri, and disclosed these conversations to third parties such as advertisers. Here, two plaintiffs said their mentions of ""Air Jordan sneakers"" and ""Olive Garden"" restaurants triggered ads for those products. A report published by The Guardian pointed to a similar issue in 2019. The report revealed that human contractors, responsible for reviewing anonymised recordings and assessing whether the trigger was activated intentionally, occasionally encountered recordings of individuals discussing sensitive topics. However, there was no mention of these recordings being used for marketing purposes.
Following The Guardian's 2019 report, Apple issued an apology and revised its policy. The company made retaining audio recordings from Siri interactions optional by default and assured that for users who consent to share recordings, these would no longer be accessible to third-party contractors. And now Apple has shared the updated policies again. Apple's Siri privacy policy After all the commotion over Siri's user privacy policy, Apple has shared a bunch of details around how Siri works. It also points at how loyal the voice assistant is. The statement stated, ""To protect user privacy, Siri is designed to do as much processing as possible right on a user’s device, allowing for personalised experiences without having to transfer and analyse personal information on Apple servers.""  It explained that when a user interacts with Siri, the request is processed on the device. Based on the requests, Siri decides whether it needs to be sent to Apple servers or not. For a daily task, such as reading unread messages or providing widget suggestions, the processing takes place on the device. While Siri tries to minimise the amount of data consumption, Apple claims that it ""does not retain audio recordings of Siri interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve Siri, and even then, the recordings are used solely for that purpose. Users can easily opt out at any time.""  But it is not untrue that the moment you start speaking about any product, the ads pop up almost immediately. But it is not necessarily Siri. One of the most plausible explanations to this is that some apps secretly record on-screen user activity that was shipped to third-parties, an 2018 investigation suggested.  However, there has also been proof that smartphones come with software to listen to users. Last year, in September, we reported that a marketing firm, whose clients are Google and Facebook, admitted that it uses a phone's microphone to collect information. It stated that it is not just what you search for but also what you speak on the phone that gets you the ads.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also read |  Apple to pay $95 million to settle Siri privacy lawsuitAlso read |  Many Indians among employees fired by Apple for salary fraud by misusing charity clause, says reportAlso read |  After years of gaslighting users, marketing firm finally acknowledges that phones listen in on conversations

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/mangaluru-man-tries-to-sell-his-old-coins-online-ends-up-losing-rs-58-lakh-in-online-scam-2662054-2025-01-09,"In yet another case of online scam, a man from Mangaluru ended up losing Rs 58.26 lakh while attempting to sell old coins through an online platform. The victim came across the platform on Facebook, and as he connected with an individual from the platform, he ended up trapped in the foul play of cybercriminals. The ordeal of the Mangaluru man began on November 25, when the victim, while scrolling through Facebook, came across an advertisement claiming to buy old coins at really high rates, reports Deccan Herald. Enticed by the lucrative offer and to make a quick profit from his old coins, the man contacted the WhatsApp number given in the ad. He even shared that he is interested to sell 15 of his old coins. The recipient then asked him to pay an initial payment of Rs 750 to start the process.  The victim thought this payment was a nominal fee to connect on the platform and sell old coins, so he ended up completing the transaction through UPI.  Shortly after the payment, the victim then received WhatsApp messages from unknown individuals who then demanded the victim make additional payments under various pretexts such as GST processing, insurance, TDS, GPS fees, ITR fees, and even an RBI notice fee to move forward with the selling. The victim believed the words of these individuals, thinking that these payments were necessary for completing the transaction, and transferred the requested amounts via RTGS, NEFT, and UPI. Over time, these payments added up to lakhs. However, the process of selling old coins took a darker turn when, on December 15, the victim received a call from someone introducing himself as Gaurav Shivaji Rao Shinde, purportedly the Mumbai Cyber Police Commissioner. The caller claimed that an RBI notice had been issued against the victim due to his previous transactions and threatened him with arrest unless he paid an additional Rs 12.55 lakh. Fearing legal consequences, the man then went ahead and transferred Rs 9 lakh to a DCB Bank account on December 17. However, as the demands for money continued unabated, the victim began to grow suspicious about the matter. He then questioned the legitimacy of the claims, to which the scammers became aggressive and started threatening him to make him pay more money. However, the victim realised that the process, in fact, was a scam, and he had lost a total of Rs 58.26 lakh to the cyber fraudsters. Following his realization, the victim then filed his complaint at the police station. The case yet again highlights the sophisticated methods employed by cybercriminals to exploit unsuspecting individuals. It is advised to individuals to stay vigilant online. If they come across ads that promise good investment opportunities or other financial gains, they should verify the authenticity of advertisements. Remember that if someone is offering quick way to make money or the offer is too good to be true it is a scam.

According to a tipster, Majin Bu, Apple will either release the iPhone 17 Air or the iPhone SE 4. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-is-rumoured-to-release-either-iphone-se-4-or-iphone-17-air-in-2025-2662140-2025-01-09,"Apple's 2025 line-up has been among the most talked about in the recent past. Earlier, it was thought that Apple would release 5 iPhones this year. These iPhones include the iPhone 17 series (with iPhone 17 Air) and the iPhone SE 4. However, a recent tip by a Majin Bu on X, states that Apple might only launch 4 iPhones this year. According to his sources, the fourth model could either be the iPhone 17 Air or the iPhone SE 4. 
 


 In the post, he stated that Apple's 2025 line-up will definitely include the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max. But, the confusion is around the fourth Apple phone. The tipster states that in 2025, Apple might only reveal either the iPhone 17 Air or the iPhone SE 4 (aka iPhone 16e). He added, ""The code name for this last device should be ""Roma"". If this information turns out to be correct, this would mean that the SE series would turn out to be the Air series."" He has also posted an image of the rumoured iPhone SE 4.  This means, if this is true, then the entire iPhone 17 Air rumour will be trashed. However, the other angle could be that Apple might not release the iPhone 17 Air in 2025. It might unveil the phone in 2026 and still associate it to the 17 series. iPhone SE 4: What do we know Before this tip, we were of the opinion that Apple might release iPhone SE 4 in April. Recently, a trusted Apple source, Mark Gurman, posted that if everything stays on track and Apple is able to meet the decided timeline, the iPhone SE 4 might be released by April. Rumours and leaks suggest that Apple may rebrand its upcoming SE 4 as the iPhone 16e. It appears the company plans to align the budget-friendly iPhone SE with its flagship series moving forward. The new model is also anticipated to feature significant upgrades compared to its predecessors. Read all about the iPhone SE 4 here. iPhone 17 Air: What to expect The iPhone 17 Air was expected to be the thinnest iPhone in the Apple-verse. However, the launch was anticipated to take place with the 17 series. Based on tradition, the iPhone 17 is speculated to arrive in September 2024.  The iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to be the most exciting one this year. The design is expected to be thinner than the iPhone 6. Apple is reportedly planning to use its own custom-designed 5G modem chip to achieve this, which is said to be smaller than Qualcomm's version, allowing for more efficient use of internal space. The company has also optimised the device's internal layout to maintain battery life, camera quality, and display performance. Read more about the iPhone 17 Air here.

There are two phones — the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R. These are also the first phones that are part of OnePlus Project Starlight, the company’s programme specifically for Indian users. As part of the programme OnePlus is aiming to give Indian users something unique, the kind of features that take into account India conditions and use cases. So, even as the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R pack in powerful hardware, capable cameras and new battery tech alongside premium design, they also have unique features such as support for 5.5G network. The OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R are the first smartphones in India with such a support.  While the technology is network agnostic, currently the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R will support 5.5G network on Jio. This is because OnePlus and Jio have worked together to test the feature before the launch of the two phones.  During its winter launch event, OnePlus announced that it has collaborated with Jio to offer users the next phase of 5G technology — dubbed 5.5G. This upgraded 5G network is based on Component Carrier Aggregation (3CC) technology, which allows devices to connect to multiple network cells simultaneously, ensuring faster download speeds and reduced latency. “The OnePlus 13 series are the first devices to feature 5.5G in India, thanks to our partnership with Jio,” says James Paterson, OnePlus senior global PR manager. “Cutting-edge 5.5G technology allows your OnePlus 13 series device to connect to three different network cells, possibly even on different towers at the same time, for faster connectivity and better overall performance. We’ve worked hard to ensure our phone provides the most stable network connection anywhere in India.”
 


During the launch event, OnePlus conducted a live demo to show the practical benefits of the faster 5.5G network. It compared download speeds on a standard 5G network versus the 5.5G network. During this test with the OnePlus 13, the device achieved a peak download speed of 1,014.86 Mbps on Jio’s 5.5G network, outperforming the 277.78 Mbps recorded on a traditional non-3CC 5G network. OnePlus highlighted how the upgraded 5.5G network offers up to 380 per cent  improved speed, providing users with fast and stable internet connections.To help users identify connectivity to the 5.5G network, OnePlus revealed that on the OnePlus 13 or OnePlus 13R, devices connected to the 5.5G network will display a “5GA” icon. However, connecting to the upgraded network does not require any additional tweak in settings. It is automatic, depending on the availability of the network.How will this benefit Indian users?

Jio is operating its 5.5G network exclusively on standalone (SA) 5G networks, utilising advanced carrier aggregation to connect devices to multiple network cells. This new connectivity allows the telecom provider to offer users faster data speeds and a seamless, stable mobile experience on 5.5G-supported devices. Once connected to the network, users will enjoy faster downloads for movies, apps, and updates, significantly reducing wait times. With improved speeds and reduced latency, the network will also offer users lag free streaming of high-definition content, including 4K videos, or gaming streams will be smoother than on traditional networks. Mobile gamers, in particular, will benefit from lower latency and quicker response times, maintaining a smooth and lag free gaming experience across multiple titles. Additionally, the 5.5G network also provides clearer voice and video calls, even in challenging and hard-to-reach network areas like basements, crowded public spaces, while traveling, or in remote locations.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also Read |  Mangaluru man tries to old coins online, ends up losing Rs 58 lakh in scam Also Read |  Amazon Echo Spot review: Cute, smart enough and priceyAlso Read |  OnePlus 13R vs OnePlus 12R: 5 Big upgrades

As per the report shared by Telegram, it fulfilled 900 requests in 2024, impacting 2,253 users, a sharp rise from just 14 requests affecting 108 users during the first nine months of the year. The spike occurred primarily between October and December, following the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov in France in August 2024. Durov was detained in August at Le Bourget Airport under allegations related to Telegram’s handling of criminal activities on its platform. French authorities accused him of failing to implement adequate measures to prevent abuse, including cases of fraud, organised crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, and cyberbullying. Investigators described the arrest as a move to end what they called “Telegram’s impunity.” Shortly after Durov’s arrest, Telegram updated its privacy policy to allow sharing user data, such as IP addresses and phone numbers, with law enforcement in response to valid legal requests. Previously, its policy restricted data sharing to cases related to terrorism, and the company stated it had never disclosed user data under that framework. The policy revision marks a significant shift, coinciding with the rise in fulfilled data requests in the last quarter of the year.
The Transparency Report highlighted that the requests primarily sought IP addresses and phone numbers.  That said, why should you care about it? Isn’t the data being shared to the US government? True. However, the sharp rise in data requests fulfilled by Telegram has significant implications for all its users. It highlights the growing tension between privacy and legal compliance, raising questions about the security of personal information shared on the platform.  Telegram’s revised privacy policy, allowing the disclosure of IP addresses and phone numbers to law enforcement, marks a departure from its earlier, stricter privacy stance. This shift is particularly concerning given the dramatic increase in requests fulfilled in just three months, suggesting a potential precedent for broader data access in the future.  For users, this underscores the need for vigilance about how their data might be used or accessed, even on platforms reputed for prioritising privacy. The developments also point to a larger issue: the extent to which tech companies can protect user data while adhering to government demands, a challenge that affects digital privacy across all platforms.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also read |  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman faces allegations of sexual assault by sister: Story in 5 pointsAlso read |  Siri spying on you for ads?

The service, called the AI Subscription Club, will be available starting next month, offering users access to Samsung's AI technology through a monthly fee. As reported by South Korean publication ETNews, Samsung Electronics Vice Chair Han Jong-hee has announced that the subscription plan will apply to both Galaxy smartphones and the company’s newly launched Ballie AI robot. Samsung launched the AI Subscription Club in December 2024 for select home appliances in South Korea. Now, this paid service will be available for more Samsung devices, including Samsung Galaxy smartphones and the Ballie robot. The subscription model will allow users to access AI-powered products such as smartphones, TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines for a recurring fee. The subscription will also offer users options for repair and maintenance services. Although the subscription service offers access to additional features, Samsung has clarified that it is not required to use the core AI features of Galaxy smartphones and other devices. Users will still have access to these AI features for free until at least the end of 2025, with no confirmation of plans beyond that date. Notably, Samsung has recently launched the Ballie robot, which will also be available through the subscription service. Ballie is designed to act as a personal assistant and home companion. Initially, it will be available for customers in South Korea and the United States. This development is part of Samsung's plan to integrate AI into a variety of products, offering an interconnected ecosystem of devices. Although it is still not clear whether the AI Subscription Club will expand beyond South Korea, Samsung is expected to provide more details about the service during its Galaxy Unpacked event, scheduled for January 22, 2025, in San Jose, California. At this event, the company is expected to reveal its Galaxy S25 series and may share additional information about the availability of the subscription plan in other regions. Meanwhile, the highlight of the event will be the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series. The new flagship series is said to launch Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 Ultra. The new series is highly anticipated to bring significant upgrades including upgrades to Samsung’s Galaxy AI. Announcing the launch event, Samsung said,  “The next evolution of Galaxy AI is coming and it’s going to change the way you interact with the world every day.

d78a88cf-8ffd-4e37-9504-2cb2ad414f6c,"Xiaomi Pad 7 quick review: An iPad Air competitor?Xiaomi is launching the Pad 7 in India on January 10. Ahead of the launch, we at India Today Tech, got our hands on the upcoming tablet. Here is a quick look at what it looks like and what it has to offer. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/xiaomi-pad-7-quick-review-an-ipad-air-competitor-2662320-2025-01-09,"Xiaomi is gearing up to launch its new Xiaomi Pad 7 in India on January 10. The device already made its debut in the Chinese market last year, in 2024, and now it is all set for its entry in India. Ahead of the launch, I got my hands on the new Pad 7, and this device has left me impressed. The new Xiaomi Pad 7 is sleek and incredibly lightweight. The new keyboard with a built-in touchpad, paired with Xiaomi Pen, is a cherry on top. However, before I share my initial impressions of the Xiaomi Pad 7, let’s take a quick look at what’s inside. The Xiaomi Pad 7 features the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset and runs on Xiaomi’s HyperOS. It boasts an 11.2-inch IPS LCD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, HDR10, Dolby Vision support, and up to 800 nits brightness. Under the hood, it packs an 8,850mAh battery with support for 45W turbocharging. Paired with the OS are also AI-driven features like AI writing and Xiaomi Creations. The Xiaomi Pad 7 will also come with a variant that has a Nano Texture Display, but that will be reserved for the top-end variant –– that’s not the one we are testing. We are hoping to get our hands on it soon. For now, I have been spending my days testing the one with LCD display. I will share my detailed experience of using the Xiaomi Pad 7 in the full review soon, but for now, here’s my first impression.Oh so light! As soon as I unboxed the Xiaomi Pad 7, I was instantly impressed by how lightweight and sleek it is. The device I am reviewing comes in an iridescent purple shade, which adds to its premium and stylish look. The aluminum build of the Pad feels solid yet easy to grip. In fact, with my small palms, I can easily hold and use it with one hand.
 


 At the back, there’s a 10-megapixel camera housed in a square island design similar to the ones seen in Xiaomi’s flagship smartphones. On the sides, you’ll find a total of four speaker grilles, a power button, a USB-C port for charging, volume buttons, and a magnetic cutout for attaching the Xiaomi Pen. As far as design is concerned, the Xiaomi Pad 7 is pretty much a 10/10.
 


Smooth display and crisp audio The display looks smooth and bright. I have been watching YouTube videos and Netflix shows, and I am totally loving the display quality so far. The speakers are loud, crisp, and clear, making the multimedia experience quite enjoyable. I even tried playing some games like Candy Crush and Minecraft. The tablet runs them all smoothly. I also tried the built-in Mi Canvas for doodling, and I am impressed by the improved Xiaomi Pen with its low latency. The new keyboard with a built-in trackpad –– which doubles as a cover for the tablet –– is also quite well-made, and the trackpad makes work much easier. In fact, I am using the tablet right now to write this first impression and I even file my stories in the CMS. The smooth and tactile keys are letting me type quicker and the trackpad is definitely helping me get work done more easily, even making me ditch the laptop for a while.
 


Final thoughts – for now! I am yet to put the device through its paces still, but for now I can say that this tablet has the potential to be one of the best Android tablets you can find in the market. I am using it for both work and entertainment and really enjoying the performance it has to offer. Stay tuned for the full review of the Xiaomi Pad 7. It's coming sooner than you think.

In our quick review, we found that it has the potential to deliver impressively on both fronts. Here's India Today Tech's quick review of the smartphone.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/oppo-reno-13-pro-quick-review-promises-big-photography-and-ai-upgrades-2662228-2025-01-09,"Oppo’s Reno flagships for 2025 are here, bringing some big promises. The company has launched two smartphones in the Reno 13 series: the Reno 13 and the Reno 13 Pro. Oppo has sent us the Pro variant for review, which we have been using for a couple of days. While we are still testing the device for our final verdict, even in this short time, there’s already plenty to talk about regarding the Oppo Reno 13 Pro. In this brief time, we have largely enjoyed almost every aspect of the phone –– it has a large and bright display, it has a design that stands out from most of its competitors', it has a battery that can really last, amongst other things. However, what truly has our attention here is its cameras and AI features.  It may be a little premature to say this, because we are still in the process of putting the device through its paces, but our first impressions of the device is that with the Reno 13 Pro, Oppo is trying to bring you the smarts of the Find X series on a budget.  For a smartphone priced under Rs 50,000, the Oppo Reno 13 Pro’s camera impresses with not just a strong set of lenses but also excellent AI integration that makes it remarkably easy to capture great photos. We took a trip to Thailand with Oppo, where we tested the phone’s cameras, and tried out a bunch of its AI features. In the short time we used it, we captured several daylight, macro, and night shots — and rarely ended up with a bad photo.

 



Oppo Reno 13 Pro 5G's purple and white colour variants sport a beautiful butterfly design pattern.
 What stands out is the ease of taking quality pictures. While all cameras can produce both good and bad shots depending on factors like lighting, camera setup, and the photographer’s skill, Oppo has significantly minimised the margin for error with its solid AI software. The AI in the Reno 13 Pro’s cameras is able to analyse your surroundings, adjust to lighting conditions, and optimise your subject, ensuring consistently good results. For scenarios where automatic AI adjustments fall short, there are a variety of AI tools on the phone.  We tested many of these tools with the Oppo Reno 12 Pro as well. While we didn’t notice a dramatic improvement in the majority of the tools themselves, features like the AI Shadow Remover and AI Clean Up were nonetheless quite useful. We plan to test these AI tools further for our detailed review.  Apart from its camera and AI capabilities, the battery performance of the Reno 13 Pro is equally impressive. While we still plan to run benchmarks for comprehensive testing, our initial experience suggests that the phone’s battery performs quite well. During our trip to Thailand that we mentioned, we were out for an entire day, starting around 9 am and returning to our hotel only by 8 pm. Throughout the day, we extensively used the phone’s camera, kept it running as a hotspot, and actively used WhatsApp and social media apps. Despite this heavy usage, the phone didn’t require charging until the next day, which is a promising sign of its battery endurance. That said, a smartphone isn’t just about its individual features—it’s difficult to recommend a device unless it delivers a well-rounded experience. This is precisely what we aim to evaluate in our review of the Oppo Reno 13 Pro, which we will share next week. There are still several aspects of the phone to test, including its overall performance, gaming capabilities, battery endurance, and camera quality in challenging lighting conditions. Most importantly, we’ll assess how seamlessly these features work together and whether the phone justifies its price tag. Stay tuned for our in-depth review of the Oppo Reno 13 Pro 5G.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also read |  Redmi 14C 5G quick review: A promising phone under Rs 10,000Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?

The prices start at Rs 21,999 for the Poco X7, while the X7 Pro starts at Rs 27,999 — inclusive of offers. In my initial testing, the X7 Pro already feels like the better deal. And no, not just because it’s the pricier option, but because those extra Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 seem to pack a lot of bang for your buck. Still, both phones bring their own quirks and trade-offs. Here’s a quick breakdown.advertisementPoco X7 series: Design and displayDesign is where these phones — the X7 and X7 Pro, grab attention. My teammate jokingly called the phones “the taxi finish,” thanks to their bright two-tone colourways, dubbed Poco Yellow. Both phones have plastic builds, faux leather finishes, and little extras like an IR blaster. But the real twist? The Poco X7, the affordable model of the two, has a curved display, while the X7 Pro comes with a flat panel. Design is where these phones — the X7 and X7 Pro, grab attention. My teammate jokingly called the phones “the taxi finish,” thanks to their bright two-tone colourways, dubbed Poco Yellow. Both phones have plastic builds, faux leather finishes, and little extras like an IR blaster. But the real twist? The Poco X7, the affordable model of the two, has a curved display, while the X7 Pro comes with a flat panel.  Curved screens are usually reserved for pricier devices, so it’s an interesting choice here. While I personally prefer flat displays, the X7’s curve adds a premium touch. Plus, it’s protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2, which Poco claims offers better drop resistance—a necessity for curved panels. The X7 Pro, meanwhile, has Gorilla Glass 7i, which is slightly less rugged but fine for the flat design, likely saving some production costs. Both phones feature gorgeous 1.5K AMOLED displays with 120Hz refresh rates and plenty of brightness for indoor and outdoor use. Design-wise, I lean toward the X7 Pro’s boxier profile—it feels more refined in hand. That said, the X7’s curved display will undoubtedly catch eyes, especially in the Indian market.

 Overall, the devices are sure to entice their target audiences. In the meantime, I’m looking forward to spending more time with both the X7 and X7 Pro to see how they perform in other areas like battery life, camera quality, and overall speed.Poco X7 series: Performance, battery and camera Performance is where the Poco X7 series shows a clear distinction. The Poco X7 is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra chipset, which delivers good numbers for its segment. But the X7 Pro steps it up with a flagship-grade MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset, setting a new benchmark in the sub-Rs 30,000 price range. This was evident during benchmark testing.  While the scores of the Poco X7 are pretty much in line with other phones such as the Nothing Phone 2a or the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, the Poco X7 Pro punched above its weight, scoring numbers typically seen on pricier phones. Adding to its edge are LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage, carried over from the X6 Pro. I personally loved the X6 Pro for gaming, and from early impressions, the X7 Pro looks like a worthy successor, possibly even better in this department.  Battery life is another area where the X7 Pro shines. Its massive 6,550mAh battery, paired with 90W fast charging, puts the X7’s 5,500mAh battery with 45W charging to shame. Don’t get me wrong — the X7’s endurance is respectable and should last a full day with moderate use. But the X7 Pro’s larger battery and quicker charging setup feel way ahead, making it a strong contender for heavy users. The X7 Pro also gets a leg up in the software department. It runs HyperOS 2.0 on top of Android 15, which feels faster and smoother than its predecessor, offering better animations, transitions, and more customisation options. Sadly, the X7 misses out on HyperOS 2.0 and launches with the older HyperOS atop Android 14. While this may not be a dealbreaker for many, it feels like a missed opportunity, especially for a new phone — which was also the case with the recently launched Poco M7 Pro.

 As for the camera, the setup is where things get interesting. The Poco X7 comes with a triple-lens system — a 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. It also has a 20-megapixel front camera for selfies. The X7 Pro, meanwhile, opts for a dual-camera setup — a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-600 main sensor with OIS and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, paired with a 20-megapixel front camera. While the X7’s extra lens may appeal to spec-sheet enthusiasts, the Pro’s superior hardware and ISP lead to better photos, especially in tricky lighting conditions. Initial results suggest the Pro is the better choice for photography, but I’ll spend some more time testing these cameras to give a final verdict.Poco X7 series is promising  The Poco X7 and X7 Pro bring some exciting features to the mid-range segment, with the Pro standing out as a more complete package for those willing to spend a bit more. Especially when you consider that the X7 Pro is available in the sub-Rs 30,000 range and offers standout features like a massive 6,550mAh battery, UFS 4.0 storage, the latest software, and a flagship-grade Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset — it’s easy to see why the X7 Pro could be yet another winner for Poco. That said, the X7 still holds its own, and it’ll be interesting to see how it performs for what it’s worth. I’ll dive deeper into camera quality, battery performance, and everything else in the detailed review, so stay tuned for that.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Also read |  OnePlus 13 review: Solid flagship phone for smart buyersAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in January 2024: Redmi Note 14 Pro+ and moreAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 15,000 in January 2024: Poco M7 Pro 5G, CMF Phone 1 and more

According to a TechCrunch report, Google Trends highlights increased interest in deleting Facebook and Instagram. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/many-users-now-searching-how-to-delete-facebook-instagram-as-meta-scraps-fact-checking-report-2662651-2025-01-10,"In a move that has sparked considerable backlash, Meta has announced it will no longer be implementing its fact-checking measures on certain posts across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, on January 7, 2025. This decision has led to a noticeable increase in the number of users contemplating or actively pursuing account deletions, as many feel the removal of these safeguards compromises the integrity of the information shared on Meta’s networks. Fact-checking on social media platforms has been a vital tool in curbing the spread of false or misleading information, especially during critical events such as elections and public health crises. Meta’s initiative to integrate fact-checking was initially seen as a step toward restoring credibility in an environment often rife with viral hoaxes, fake news, and propaganda. However, with the discontinuation of these measures, the concern is that users may be exposed to an even greater volume of unreliable content. The impact of Meta’s decision has already been felt in the form of increased discussions surrounding the safety and reliability of its platforms. Many users, especially those advocating for more transparency and accountability from social media giants, have voiced their discontent and begun exploring alternatives. Some have begun deleting their accounts or reducing their time spent on the platforms, citing concerns that Meta’s shift may allow harmful content to flourish unchecked. A report, published by TechCrunch, highlights how users are increasingly looking for social networks or platforms with stronger content moderation policies as a means to ensure a safer and more trustworthy online experience. The report states, “Google searches for terms like “how to permanently delete Facebook” hit a maximum score of 100 — the highest level of interest possible on Google Trends.”  The report adds that Google Trends data shows a sharp spike in searches like “how to delete all photos on Facebook,” “alternatives to Facebook,” “how to quit Facebook,” “how to delete a Threads account,” and “how to delete an Instagram account without logging in.” These terms have experienced an explosive increase in popularity, rising over 5,000 per cent compared to earlier periods.

Furthermore, the timing of Meta’s move has raised concerns, particularly as misinformation remains a persistent issue, especially with political seasons and global events on the horizon. The loss of fact-checking is seen by critics as a major setback in the fight against the spread of false information online. Meta's decision to reduce fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram has led to heightened dissatisfaction among users who view the move as a step backward in ensuring the platforms remain a reliable source of information. As a defence, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg states that this decision is an attempt to restore free speech. Interestingly, when Elon Musk took over X (formerly Twitter), he stated something similar. The CEO of Meta mentioned that his platforms would replace third-party fact-checkers with a community notes system similar to X's, allowing users to flag posts they believe require additional context. As alternative social media options gain traction, it remains to be seen whether Meta’s strategy will ultimately alienate its user base or simply redefine the role of fact-checking in the future of digital communication.

4bf2b8c6-4492-4175-8b98-1ffbfcb02a26,"As Meta scraps fact-checking, its new content policy seen as offensive and dehumanisingMeta is facing flak for its new content moderation policies which now reportedly allow highly offensive slurs and dehumanising language. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-content-moderation-policy-for-facebook-and-instagram-revealed-users-call-it-dehumanising-2662663-2025-01-10,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is under fire for recent changes to its content moderation policies, which now permit a wider range of derogatory speech targeting various racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identities. Internal training material obtained by The Intercept reveal examples of the now-allowable speech, including highly offensive slurs and dehumanising language.  The policy overhaul coincides with Meta's suspension of its fact-checking program, a move aimed at ""lifting restrictions to allow more speech,"" according to a company statement issued on Tuesday. Joel Kaplan, Meta's new global policy chief, defended the shift as an effort to address the growing complexity of content management across the platform. CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed similar sentiments, positioning the changes as a means to foster freer ideological and political expression.   However, critics argue that these changes open the floodgates to harmful rhetoric and misinformation on social media. The said training documents that have surfaced outline how moderators are now instructed to handle posts under the revised hate speech policy. The materials include examples of posts deemed acceptable under the new guidelines, such as derogatory comments about immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and minorities, which were previously prohibited.  Meta on January 7, 2025, announced that it would cease implementing fact-checking measures across its platforms. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that the fact-checking team were making too many mistakes. The team, of course, fought back and said that Zuckerberg’s claims are untrue. This decision has already been quite unpopular among Meta critics around the world, who believe that Zuckerberg only made this change in content policy to appease the new US President, Donald Trump.  Besides, the move has also raised alarms because fact-checking is viewed as a crucial tool for combating misinformation, particularly during elections and public health crises. The removal of these safeguards, critics say, could exacerbate the spread of false narratives and harmful propaganda. 
Consequently, reports suggest that Google Searches on how to delete Facebook and Instagram are surging. There has reportedly also been reduced engagement on Facebook and Instagram ever since the change in policy. Users, particularly those advocating for greater accountability from social media companies, fear that Meta’s policy changes will compromise the safety and reliability of its platforms.   Meta’s fact-checking initiative, which was launched in December 2016, was introduced during a period of heightened scrutiny over the proliferation of fake news. The program was initially lauded as a step toward restoring trust. By flagging and limiting the reach of misleading content, the company aimed to curb the influence of viral hoaxes and disinformation campaigns. The discontinuation of these measures, however, signals a stark reversal, leaving many to question Meta’s commitment to transparency and public responsibility.   The changes have broader implications for the online ecosystem. As harmful content and misinformation potentially flourish unchecked, social media’s role as a source of credible information comes into question. Advocates for responsible digital governance argue that platforms like Meta must prioritise user safety and the integrity of shared information over unregulated free expression.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/you-can-now-buy-laptops-monitors-and-printers-on-blinkit-2662697-2025-01-10,"Blinkit, the quick-commerce platform known for delivering groceries and daily essentials in minutes, is now venturing further into the electronics segment. Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa announced the expansion on X, revealing that users can now order laptops, monitors, printers, and more directly through the platform, with delivery promised in as little as 10 minutes.   “You can now get laptops, monitors, printers and more delivered in 10 minutes! We're expanding our electronics range to cover more use cases and have partnered up with leading brands in this category. We've got: 
â€â Laptops from HP
â€â Monitors from Lenovo, Zebronics and MSI
â€â Printers from Canon and HP
Currently live in - Delhi NCR, Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Lucknow. Most of these will be delivered by our large order fleet,” Albinder Dhindsa announced in a post on X.
 


 The initiative marks Blinkit’s partnership with leading electronics brands, allowing customers to access a wider range of tech products conveniently. Currently, Blinkit is offering laptops from HP, monitors from Lenovo, Zebronics, and MSI, and printers from Canon and HP. Printer cartridges from HP and Canon are also available, with plans to add Epson cartridges in the near future.   Dhindsa stated that this service is currently live in major cities, including Delhi NCR, Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Lucknow. The deliveries, especially for larger items, will be handled by Blinkit's specialised large-order fleet. The company also hinted at plans to expand its portfolio further, bringing more brands and products to its customers soon.   Blinkit’s move to deliver electronics like laptops, monitors, and printers in just 10 minutes could be a game-changer for consumers, but it could spell trouble for small stores and authorised dealers. With this model, Blinkit eliminates middlemen, allowing customers to access products at competitive prices without the hassle of visiting physical stores. For businesses paying high rents and bearing hefty staff costs, this could mark a significant challenge as they struggle to compete with the convenience and speed of Blinkit’s service. Blinkit Ambulance The announcement of tech deliveries comes on the heels of another significant move by Blinkit. Last week, the platform launched a 10-minute ambulance service, starting in Gurugram. Users in the area can now book ambulances for emergencies via the Blinkit app. The company promises rapid response, with ambulances dispatched to reach users within 10 minutes.   While currently in its testing phase, the Blinkit ambulance service represents a significant leap for the platform. Dhindsa has indicated that this initiative is expected to expand across cities in the coming months, aiming to provide a critical service for emergencies.

While authorities in the US have named and issued warrants against six individuals in connection with the fraud, reports suggest that a significant number of those who have been fired are Indian employees allegedly exploiting Telugu charity organisations in the US as part of the scheme. Here is a quick lowdown on the whole story in 5 points.advertisement–Fraudulent misuse of Apple’s Matching Grants programInternal sources confirmed to India Today Tech that around 50 employees were fired by Apple from its Cupertino headquarters following allegations of fraudulent misuse of the company’s Matching Grants program. This corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative is designed to amplify employee donations by matching them for nonprofit organisations. However, some employees allegedly falsified donations in collaboration with nonprofits to exploit the program, ultimately pocketing Apple’s matching contributions. Authorities in the US identified 6 individuals in defrauding Apple of approximately $152,000 over 3 years.–How the scheme workedThe fraud at Apple involved employees donating money to nonprofits, which Apple then matched through the program. The nonprofits reportedly returned the original donations to the employees, enabling them to retain Apple’s matching funds. Additionally, the executive at the nonprofits reportedly wrote off these fictitious donations on tax returns, leading to potential violations of US tax laws.

Kwan, described as the ringleader, reportedly played a dual role as CEO of Hop4Kids and accountant for the American Chinese International Cultural Exchange (ACICE), the nonprofits involved in the fraud. These nonprofits allegedly facilitated false donation claims, retaining Apple’s matching funds and defrauding state authorities.  –Involvement of Indian employees and Telugu charities A separate report highlights that among the fired employees, many were Indian nationals who reportedly misused Telugu charity organisations in the US to carry out the fraud. These nonprofits, allegedly linked to the Telugu community, were purportedly part of the scheme to create false donation records and funnel the money back to employees. Notably, none of the 6 individuals charged are Indian.–Apple remains silent; broader implications  Apple has not issued an official statement regarding the termination or allegations. The revelations have sparked discussions about the potential for misuse in CSR programs and the need for stricter oversight. Fraud of this nature undermines the integrity of charitable initiatives and raises serious legal and ethical concerns. While the case primarily focuses on 50 terminated employees now, there were reports earlier that claimed that around 185 employees were fired.

For years, the Air models of MacBook and iPad have been much loved for offering top-end specifications while keeping the design and price relatively light for users. Now, if rumors are to be believed, Apple could bring an Air variant to its iPhone lineup this year – likely called the iPhone 17 Air.

This model is rumoured to be thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro and is also expected to use Apple’s in-house custom-designed 5G modem chip. Additionally, the iPhone Air model is said to replace the Plus variants, positioning itself among the four flagship models Apple launches every year. The iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to launch in September 2025 during Apple’s annual fall event. However, since September is months away, reports suggest that the iPhone 17 Air is still in its early production stages. There is also a possibility that unforeseen technical challenges or strategic decisions could push the launch to 2026. In fact, a recent report by leaker Majun Bin hinted that this year, Apple might either launch the iPhone SE4 or the iPhone 17 Air, in the 4 flagship lineup.  While Apple has not revealed anything officially, leaks and rumors buzzing on the internet give us hints about what to expect from this ultra-thin iPhone. Let’s take a detailed look at everything we know so far about the upcoming iPhone 17 Air.iPhone 17 Air pricing in India Reports suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will replace the Plus model in the iPhone lineup. If this is the case, the pricing could start at around USD 899 – similar to the iPhone 16 Plus, which starts at Rs 89,900 in India. However, there are also speculations that the iPhone 17 Air could be positioned as a premium model, potentially surpassing the USD 1,199 starting price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, depending on its design and features.Thinnest iPhone The defining feature of the iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to be its ultra-thin design. Reports suggest the device will measure just 6mm in thickness, significantly slimmer than the 7.8mm iPhone 16. If true, the iPhone 17 Air could become Apple’s thinnest device, surpassing even the sleek iPad Pro models. To achieve this slim profile, Apple is reportedly working on advanced display technology known as Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI). This hardware innovation combines the touch and display layers, reducing the overall thickness of the OLED panel. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 6.6-inch OLED display with support for 120Hz ProMotion technology, ensuring smooth visuals and responsiveness. However, the thin design may come at a cost. Reports indicate that Apple might reduce the battery capacity due to technical limitations and high production costs.Simplified camera While it remains unclear whether the iPhone 17 Air will be a standard or premium iPhone, rumors suggest it may feature a simplified camera system. The device might house a single 48-megapixel rear camera, eliminating the ultrawide lens found in the iPhone 16 Plus. This design choice could save space and contribute to the slim profile. The high-resolution main camera is expected to support digital zoom by cropping into the image – a method Apple has refined in previous models. On the front, the iPhone 17 Air is rumored to include a 24-megapixel TrueDepth camera, an upgrade from the 12-megapixel sensors seen in earlier iPhones.Performance  The iPhone 17 Air is likely to be powered by Apple’s new A19 chipset, a successor to the A18 found in the iPhone 16 series. While the A19 may still use a 3nm process rather than a next-gen 2nm architecture, it is expected to deliver improved performance and energy efficiency. Additionally, the device is rumored to feature 8GB of RAM, supporting Apple’s advanced on-device AI features. Apple may also introduce an in-house Wi-Fi chip, signaling its shift toward greater hardware self-reliance.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Also Read |  Xiaomi Pad 7 quick review: An iPad Air competitor?Also Read |  Samsung will launch paid subscription plan for Galaxy smartphones starting next monthAlso Read |  OnePlus 13, 13R support Jio 5.5G network: What does that mean for the user

b06be793-8add-4afd-a170-80826b3fac5f,"OnePlus 13R review: Great hardware, loaded with features, and a killer priceOnePlus is back with two top-end phones — the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R. Of the two, we find in this review that the OnePlus 13R may prove to be a fan-favourite due to its combination of great hardware, ample top-end features and a killer price of just Rs 42,999. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/oneplus-13r-review-great-hardware-loaded-with-features-and-a-killer-price-2662965-2025-01-10,"Just a few days ago, here at India Today Tech, we reviewed the latest and, in fact, the greatest flagship from OnePlus — the OnePlus 13. The device absolutely impressed us with its new more-modern yet lighter design, impressive battery, the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and a capable camera system. And yet I think that OnePlus 13 might not be the best OnePlus phone that the company has launched this month. If I take into account the value proposition, and the prices, I feel absolutely no hesitation in saying that the OnePlus 13R is the real star this time. It gives almost everything you may want from a phone, complete with top-end hardware, and yet costs significantly less. It is as good as the OnePlus 12, and fairly close to OnePlus 13, and yet its price is around 30 to 40 per cent less than these two “true” flagships.  You see, last year when I reviewed the OnePlus 12R, I totally loved what the affordable flagship offered. However, there were a few things — like the overall camera performance — which I wished was better. But regardless of that, overall, the OnePlus 12R was almost perfect and indeed a flagship killer in 2024. Cut to 2025, I got my hands on the OnePlus 13R, and let me tell you, this phone not only fills in those gaps that showed up on its predecessor but it performs better — way better — in almost all areas. But wait, before you think I am completely smitten with the new OnePlus 13R, I will tell you I am not. There are a few areas which I find irksome, although they may not impact the user experience for most people. For example, I am not a fan of its boxy — and more modern, I suppose — design or the reduced charging support of 80W, which is down from 100W. But in the big picture these are niggles and nitpicks. Overall, I do feel at Rs 42,999 — and with some launch discounts the price is even lower — the OnePlus 13R is an absolute gem of a phone.   You see the potency of the OnePlus 13R, and just how close it is to last year’s flagship, the OnePlus 12, as soon as you look at its specs. It is loaded. The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset — the flagship-level chipset we earlier saw in Rs 60,000 to Rs 1 lakh phones last year. The device runs on the latest OxygenOS 15, which offers a smooth and clean UI, and this time OnePlus has included the biggest battery ever in the R series — it measures 6000 mAh. On the front, the device has a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with up to a 120Hz refresh rate and 4500 nits peak brightness. This too is an LTPO display, complete with ProXDR monicker and 10-bit colour support, and hence it comes with variable refresh rate of 1Hz-120Hz.  For the very first time, the OnePlus 13R has also included a new type of glass called Gorilla Glass 7i on the front and back, adding to the durability of the device. For photography, the new OnePlus 13R includes the similar triple-camera setup we saw in the OnePlus 12 but with upgraded sensors. The camera system now uses the 50-megapixel Sony LYT-700 along with a 50-megapixel telephoto camera and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera. On the front, there is a 16-megapixel camera for selfies and videos.OnePlus 13R design review: New flat look  One of the biggest changes OnePlus has made to the OnePlus 13R is the flat design compared to the curves of the 12R. The design, though boxy, is surprisingly lightweight at 206 grams. The device I am reviewing is in the Astral Trail colour option. Now, as much as I love the flat display on the OnePlus 13R, I do find the overall looks a little average. I know the flat is in, and more modern, but given that everyone is doing it — from a Rs 20,000 phone to Rs 80,000 phone — it looks average. The more expensive phones can rely on exotic materials to add some oomph. But the OnePlus 13R, relatively speaking, is not an ultra-premium phone. So the materials here are more regular, such as aluminium frame in matte finish. And that doesn’t help its case in the looks department.  But then talking of the case, looks are also not a key factor nowadays. We all use our phones in a case, and chances are that you will also use the OnePlus 13R, if you get it, in a case. OnePlus does bundle a case with the phone. It is a rubber case and while it will do, personally, if I am going to use the OnePlus 13R I would spend some money and get a better case. 

 



The OnePlus 13R is the first OnePlus phone with Gorilla Glass 7i protection on front and the back
 Looks aside, the phone is built extremely well and there are even some design flourishes that will please users. For example, I like the finish on the rear cover on the phone I am reviewing. It has a subtle pattern of circular lines, which reminds one of the light trails on a clear and starry night. On the back, the phone has a circular camera island similar to the flagship OnePlus 13. The island houses three cameras. The rim has a beautiful glass finish, accompanied by a metallic matte finish at the bottom. On the sides, you’ll find the alert slider and volume buttons. In fact, from the side profile, it looks more premium, with design aesthetics similar to the high-end phones like the iPhone, Pixel, or Oppo Find X8.  The OnePlus 13R is a durable phone, even if it doesn’t carry the same IP rating as the flagship. The phone is rated with IP65 rating.  This is a large phone and it shows when you use it. Given that the sides are now flat, holding it and using it is slightly more tiring for the palm and fingers. This is an issue we see with all big phones that have a flat frame, from the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. So, the OnePlus 13R is not an outlier, but you need to be aware of it. OnePlus 13R display review: Bigger and better While I am skeptical of the boxy design, one thing I truly love is the large display on the phone. At the same time, finally Android phones have gotten rid of chin and it is nice to see that the OnePlus 13R has symmetrical and thin bezels around its screen. I watched a lot of YouTube videos, streamed Netflix, and did some casual gaming on the OnePlus 13R, and I absolutely loved the display experience.  For example in a 4K clip, which showcased the visual delight of Avatar 2, I saw extremely rich colours and the blue of Avatar was bright and punchy. I saw similarly gorgeous colours while playing some games. In games, I also found the display smooth, thanks to its 120Hz refresh rate. 

 



The flat display features 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with up to a 120Hz refresh rate
 The overall brightness of the phone is rated at 1600 nits in general use. This was more than enough for me to use the phone even in outdoor settings. The phone handled the glare and reflections well enough.  One important feature to note here is the Aqua Touch 2.0. It is a neat feature that allows the OnePlus 13R to be used with wet fingers or even when the display is wet, such as in case of light rain or splash. It’s convenient. OnePlus 13R performance review: Goodness of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3  Last year’s flagship performance is more affordable this year. That is how I look at the OnePlus 13R and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. The chipset is a proven workhorse. I casually browsed the web, scrolled through Instagram reels for hours, played games, and jumped through open apps. The OnePlus 13R handled it well and smoothly day after day.  There are a couple of performance-oriented additions to the OnePlus 13R. This includes the upgraded Dual Cryo-Velocity Vapor Chamber system, which keeps the device cool. In my case it did keep the device cool while running BGMI. The smooth and lag-free performance is also due to more RAM. The OnePlus 13R comes with a minimum of 12GB of RAM, compared to the 8GB RAM in the base variant of the 12R. 

 



The OnePlus 13R offers up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage
 Finally, there is the OxygenOS 15, based on the latest Android 15. It's neat. The 13R comes with minimal bloatware — there are 2-3 apps like Netflix and LinkedIn, which are useful. The new design of the OxygenOS is clean, and the software looks slick and clutter-free. There are tons of customisation options. One of them is the side-bar that you can bring with a quick swipe. It is fun and useful. The phone has stereo speakers. This is one area where the OnePlus 12R falls somewhat short of what more expensive phones deliver. Although the speakers are loud and not screechy, even at the full volume. But they also lack the heft that more expensive phones — such as the iPhone 16 Plus — deliver. OnePlus 13R battery review: Big battery  At 6000mAh the OnePlus 13R features the largest battery ever in a OnePlus phone. OnePlus is doing this, while keeping both the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R slim and sleek, by using new battery tech. The big battery also means excellent battery backup. In my usage, where I tend to keep my screen on for hours, switching between apps for both work and entertainment, the battery lasted me about a day and a half — sometimes even a bit longer if I skipped Netflix on my busier days. Now as much as I appreciated the battery capacity, it is worth noting that the charging speed is marginally slower compared to what was offered by the OnePlus 12R. The OnePlus 13R supports 80W charging, compared to 100W on the previous phone. A compatible fast charger that can deliver 80W is included in the box.

 



The OnePlus 13R has the 6000 mAh battery-- a big upgarde to the 5500 mAh battery of Oneplus 12R
OnePlus 13R camera review: Big improvements Last year the OnePlus 12R disappointed me a bit with its camera performance, but the OnePlus 13R comes through. And how! In other words, the cameras in the OnePlus 13R are superb. The portrait photos I clicked with the phone were incredible, filled with vibrant colors and intricate details. They were also well-detailed, with the bokeh effect beautifully rendered and edges detected well. In good lighting, the portraits almost feel like photos captured with a professional DSLR camera. For example, look at the picture below. The portrait shot successfully captures the skin texture, edge-to-edge blur, and facial details remarkably well.

 



In this portrait photo clicked with the OnePlus 13R, you can see the edge-to-edge blur effect and the details on the skin
 Another big surprise is the macro camera. This time, OnePlus has definitely improved it significantly, and the details it can manage are stunning. You can see the details in the picture of the flower I’ve shared below.

 Even regular photos taken with the main camera in good lighting are stunning. But wait — not just in good lighting! The low-light performance is also fairly good, particularly when it comes to managing the colours. At night, the camera manages to capture good details while filtering out noise and filling the photos with clarity. Although the portrait mode does struggle a bit in low light, overall, the camera this time is remarkable for a phone that costs around Rs 40,000. For me, the camera – portrait camera in particular is the biggest highlight of the OnePlus 13R.OnePlus 13R review: Should you buy it? If you are looking for a phone under Rs 50,000, I can say that without a doubt go for it. And one more reason why I say this is not just because of how good the OnePlus 13R is. The company is also making certain aftersales commitments that give the OnePlus 13R an edge over its competitors. OnePlus says that the 13R will be covered under its lifetime display warranty against “green-line issue.” It’s a very specific and niche commitment but it is better than nothing. Then there is the 180-days — 6 months — full replacement warranty on the phone. Essentially if something goes wrong with it within 180-days, OnePlus will replace and give you a new OnePlus 13R. This is on top of the admirable experience that the phone offers. It has good hardware, a versatile feature set, and a great price. Even as OnePlus has now started making and selling a proper, blue-blooded flagship phone, the company also keeps a “flagship-killer” in its lineup. This year the flagship-killer is the OnePlus 13R, and, more or less, it is so good that not only it takes an aim at its competitors but might even hit the OnePlus 13 in a friendly-fire.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Also Read |  OnePlus 13 review: Solid flagship phone for smart buyers

Originally priced at Rs 59,999, the phone is now available for Rs 56,999, offering a flat discount of Rs 3,000 with no additional conditions. However, this offer is limited to the black colour variant. While the reduced price adds to its appeal, is the Realme GT 7 Pro worth purchasing? Here's a breakdown.advertisementRealme GT 7 Pro gets big discount on Flipkart, but is it worth buying?The Realme GT 7 Pro offers a premium design, solid performance, and impressive battery life. Powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, it delivers strong gaming performance and smooth multitasking. However, the device struggles with heat management under heavy loads, such as running benchmarks like 3DMark or playing intensive games like Genshin Impact for extended periods. A software update could potentially address this, improving heat dissipation and reducing performance throttling.One of the phone's major strengths is its battery life. It features a 5,800mAh battery that lasted for over 20 hours in our PCMark benchmark test.

The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with 1.5K resolution is another highlight, offering a 120Hz refresh rate, 6,500nits peak brightness and Corning Glass 7i protection. The display provides vibrant visuals and smooth scrolling. It is bright enough, whether you are indoors or outdoors. The Realme GT 7 Pro is also IP69-rated, making it more durable against water and dust compared to other premium smartphones, including iPhones. On the camera front, the Realme GT 7 Pro delivers decent shots in well-lit conditions but struggles in low light. Its ultrawide camera is serviceable, though not exceptional. Overall, the camera performance is fine in good light but does not stand out in its price point. The design of the Realme GT 7 Pro has also seen noticeable improvements over the previous GT 6 series. The new matte finish rear panel offers a classy and subtle look, especially in the black colour variant. The large rectangular camera module at the back adds a stylish touch but protrudes slightly, causing the phone to wobble when placed flat. With flat frames and slightly curved edges, the device is comfortable to hold. In conclusion, the Realme GT 7 Pro, with its recent price reduction, offers a compelling combination of design, performance, and durability, making it a strong contender in its price bracket. However, if thermal performance is a key concern, it may be worth waiting for a software update. Additionally, users should note that the camera performance is decent but not top-tier, and the phone lacks wireless charging support. For those whose needs align with its strengths, the Realme GT 7 Pro remains a good option.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 10, 2025

Let's find out in this review by India Today Tech. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/redmi-14c-5g-review-an-entertainment-box-under-rs-10000-2662907-2025-01-11,"Xiaomi’s sub-brand, Redmi’s C series, is its budget-friendly smartphone range. The company has recently refreshed the lineup with the launch of the Redmi 14C 5G. And like the previous Redmi C-series phone, you see the company squeezing a lot of premium features in its budget phone. The Redmi 14C houses a big display of 6.88-inch, a 5,160mAh battery, and a 50-megapixel primary camera. Over the Redmi 13C, you will notice some significant improvements in this year’s Redmi 14C. It offers a solid set of features that make it feel more like a sub-20K phone, and not one that you can buy for under Rs 10,000. But that’s all on paper. All its specs and features sound great while going through the spec sheet. But is it just as good in real life? Let’s find out in this detailed review of the Redmi 14C 5G. advertisementDesign and display: I’m lovin’ itThe Redmi 14C 5G is quite the looker. Over the Redmi 13C, the 14C has received a complete design overhaul. And most of the design changes only add more premiumness to the phone’s look. In fact, at first glance I thought this was a more expensive phone. I have been using the Starlight Blue variant. Its rear panel has a beautiful ombre effect, which gradients into silver towards the top. It features a circular camera module housing a dual-camera setup (designed in a way that gives the illusion of a quad-camera arrangement). My favourite part: the Redmi 14C 5G does not come with those big and bulgy camera islands. It is subtly raised, minimising wobble when the phone is placed on its back.
 


Besides the rear panel, the Redmi 14C’s form factor is sleek and boxy. It is slim at 8.22mm thickness –– although thicker than the Redmi 13C 5G which measured at 8.09mm. But the 14C also has a larger battery, so the phone’s thickness is understandable. The phone’s large 6.88-inch display is one of its standout features. It offers ample screen space, and supports a 120Hz refresh rate — a rare feature in this budget range. 
 


During the testing period, I watched a lot of content on Netflix and YouTube on the phone, and quite enjoyed it. The screen is adequately bright and offers vivid colours. Even on a bright sunny day, the Redmi 14C is able to maintain its display legibility.The only aspect of the phone's display and design language that I can complain about is its thick bezels. While this is common in sub-Rs 10,000 smartphones, I really wish to see it phased out.Shining performance  The Redmi 14C 5G is quite the looker.

While this is common in sub-Rs 10,000 smartphones, I really wish to see it phased out.Shining performance  When it comes to performance, the Redmi 14C 5G ticks all the boxes.  My usual day of using a smartphone includes placing and answering calls, opening and closing WhatsApp and Instagram a 100 times a day, watching YouTube videos, and watching shows and movies on OTT platforms. Now, most phones can claim to do all of that well, if not perfectly. And I expected the same. But here’s where I was surprised.
 


 Using social media apps seamlessly, and being able to switch between apps without a stutter was all fun, but what I really enjoyed was watching video content on the phone. Trust me and watch a movie on the Redmi 14C. And no, don’t connect your earphones. Now watch the 14C turn into an entertainment box. The phone comes with a speaker with 150 per cent Super Volume feature, which gives a louder audio experience compared to standard settings. I had to decrease the volume, so that people in other rooms do not get disturbed. Of course, if you are out in public, do not consume content on Super Volume. It’s just rude. But if you end up watching stuff on your phone when you are home, the Redmi 14C deserves to be considered.  Beyond its entertainment capability, I also put the device through its paces with a benchmark test. The device clocked 897 for single-core score and 2169 for multi-core score on Geekbench. While these are not great results, numbers aren’t everything anyway. To compare, the Moto G45 at a similar price range has much better results for its performance. But in real-life scenarios, barring the camera performance, the Redmi 14C can definitely beat the Moto G45 in overall experience.
 


 The Redmi 14C is equipped with a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset, making it a solid offering for the price. It runs on Xiaomi's HyperOS 14, based on Android 14. Although the chipset is somewhat dated, it has performed well with no noticeable lag. Notably, gaming performance is also decent; I played a few rounds of Block Blast, and the phone worked smoothly. The phone comes in three variants: 4GB RAM with 64GB storage, 4GB RAM with 128GB storage and 6GB RAM with 128GB storage.  Overall performance of the Redmi 14C 5G is quite satisfactory for its price. I rarely encountered any heating issues, even during charging.Battery boost Battery is one of the strongest suites of the Redmi 14C 5G. It packs a 5,600mAh battery, which is massive for a sub-Rs 10,000 smartphone. For perspective, Oppo Reno 13, which is priced starting Rs 37,999 also sports a 5,600mAh battery.  In the sub-10K category, whether it’s the Moto G45 5G, Infinix Hot 50 5G and or last year’s Redmi 13C 5G, a 5,000mAh battery is usually the norm.  The battery isn’t just great on paper, it does last you quite a bit –– easily throughout the day. I noticed, after watching an hour and a half-long YouTube video, the battery percentage dropped just 63 per cent to 57 per cent. With 18W of charging support, the Redmi 14C 5G charging speed is a little slow. It took me nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge the device, from 0 per cent to 100 per cent. 

 



The Redmi 14C 5G supports a Type-C charger.
 But, for me, as long as I am getting a good battery backup, I am okay to deal with slow charging speed. It is good for the battery health as well. Camera I would not say that the Redmi 14C 5G has an extraordinary camera, but I think it gets the job done. The phone has a 50-megapixel primary camera and a two-megapixel secondary sensor at the back. 
 


 The primary camera clicks clear images but lacks sharpness. You would notice some lack of detail in images clicked on the standard photo mode as well. 
 


 The phone has several camera modes, including Night Mode, Portrait Mode, Cinematic camera and more. I tested almost all the modes and regardless of which lens you click from you generally get a slightly soft focus. The colours and saturation, however, is good. 
 


 The camera struggles slightly when capturing images in low light, resulting in hazy photos. However, it still manages to add enough light to keep the subject clear and legible.
 


 For the front, the device has an 8-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. By default, the beauty mode is switched on, but I prefer it with off. The selfies are fine. It has a decent amount of detail, but the focus is still not as sharp. For social media, though, I think the images are pretty decent. 
 


 Overall, I think while the primary camera delivers decent-ish performance, the other modes could have been better as well. Here are a few photos clicked by the Redmi 14C 5G. Redmi 14C 5G: Should you buy it?  The Redmi 14C 5G is available at a starting price of Rs 9,999. In this price range, the smartphone offers great value. It boasts a premium design, an impressive display, smooth performance, and a battery life that lasts well beyond a day. Barring the camera performance, the Redmi 14C largely offers a solid experience. I would certainly recommend it for anyone looking for a phone in this budget –– who doesn’t care too much about photography. However, if you do care about photography, then your next best option to consider would be the Moto G45 5G.

According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple Watch SE 3 is scheduled to get a new look with a plastic body. Apple Watch SE 3 to get a new look While Gurman provides few details about the new Apple Watch SE, he does mention that it will feature a ""new look."" The original SE, launched in 2020, was based on the 2018 Apple Watch Series 4 design. This time, the SE could resemble the more modern 2021 Apple Watch Series 7, or perhaps introduce a completely new design. In previous reports, Gurman has suggested that Apple may opt for a plastic body for the SE, which could bring a variety of colours to the model. In September 2023, he stated that this time Apple Watch SE 3 could feature a rear panel with a colourful twist. It could be similar to the iPhone 5C’s coloured plastic case. Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3: What to expect For the higher-end models, Gurman predicts minimal design changes. The Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 are expected to retain a similar appearance but will bring some exciting new features.  Notably, the Ultra 3 is anticipated to support satellite connectivity and 5G RedCap, offering expanded connectivity options for users. Additionally, both the Series 11 and Ultra 3 will likely include blood pressure detection, though it won’t provide specific readings, he stated.  He added, instead, it will notify users if they may be at risk for hypertension, much like Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature. Blood pressure monitoring was originally expected to debut with the Apple Watch Series 10 but was delayed due to the thinner design. This year, however, Apple seems ready to launch it. Gurman also mentions that Apple is working on a new AI-powered coaching service and a revamped health app, although their release timeline is uncertain. These developments could coincide with the upcoming launch of AirPods that feature heart rate monitoring.  Overall, 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the Apple Watch, with both new features and design updates on the horizon.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

It targets macOS devices and can steal sensitive information including browser credentials, e-wallet information, system passwords, etc. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-users-beware-of-banshee-stealer-malware-targeting-macos-devices-2663831-2025-01-13,"Apple users should beware of new malware targeting macOS devices. Security researchers at Check Point Research (CPR) have uncovered an updated version of the Banshee Stealer malware, which has been quietly targeting macOS users. This malware is designed to extract sensitive information, including browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and system passwords, all while remaining virtually undetectable.   Banshee Stealer first came into the spotlight in mid-2024 when it was advertised as a “stealer-as-a-service” on underground forums, available to cybercriminals for $3,000. The malware’s latest iteration, discovered in September 2024, uses advanced techniques to evade antivirus systems, including a string encryption method inspired by Apple’s own XProtect antivirus engine. This innovation allowed Banshee to operate undetected for over two months, posing a significant risk to macOS users.   During its undetected run, the malware was distributed through phishing websites and fake GitHub repositories, often disguised as legitimate software like Google Chrome, Telegram, and TradingView. Once installed, Banshee integrates itself into system processes, making detection and removal extremely challenging.   According to Check Point Research, the malware doesn’t just infiltrate a system—it blends seamlessly, stealing data while evading security measures. ""This stealthy malware doesn’t just infiltrate; it operates undetected, blending seamlessly with normal system processes while stealing browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, user passwords, and sensitive file data,"" CPR noted in a blog post. ""Even seasoned IT professionals struggle to identify its presence. Banshee Stealer isn’t just another piece of malware—it’s a critical warning for users to reassess their security assumptions and take proactive measures to safeguard their data.""   The revelation of Banshee’s capabilities comes as a stark reminder of the growing risks macOS users face. Its advanced evasion techniques allowed it to bypass even sophisticated antivirus systems, exploiting macOS users’ trust in their devices’ inherent security. The stolen data was exfiltrated to command-and-control servers using encrypted files, ensuring minimal traces of the malware’s presence.   Interestingly, a significant development occurred in November 2024 when Banshee’s source code was leaked on an underground forum. While this leak exposed the malware’s inner workings to potential new developers, it also gave antivirus software makers the opportunity to study and counteract its tactics. As a result, detection rates improved, and awareness of Banshee’s threat spread across the cybersecurity community.   To safeguard against threats like Banshee Stealer, experts recommend several precautionary measures. Users should avoid downloading software from unverified sources and remain cautious about system prompts requesting passwords. Regularly updating macOS and antivirus tools is also crucial for staying protected.   Banshee Stealer serves as a wake-up call for the macOS community, proving that no system is entirely immune to cyber threats. As cybersecurity evolves, so do the tactics of cybercriminals, making vigilance and proactive measures essential for digital safety.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Apple Watch SE 3 rumoured to debut this year with a new colourful lookAlso read |  Apple iPad 11 tipped to use A17 Pro chip

It is expected to launch in spring alongside refreshed iPad Air models.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-ipad-11-tipped-to-use-a17-pro-chip-2663814-2025-01-13,"Apple’s next-generation entry-level iPad will reportedly be powered by the powerful A17 Pro chip, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This comes as no surprise, as many had anticipated that the iPad 11 would feature Apple’s new AI features dubbed Apple Intelligence. However, there had been uncertainty about which chip Apple would choose for its most affordable tablet. The A17 Pro chip is based on the first-generation N3B 3nm process, a technology that has had its share of challenges. Reports have long suggested that Apple struggled with this manufacturing process due to its high costs, lower production yields, and limited performance improvements compared to earlier generations. Given these issues, many believed Apple would phase out this process as quickly as possible. In fact, the company’s recent product launches seemed to align with this theory. For example, Apple introduced the M4 chip in the iPad Pro just six months after launching the M3 series in its Mac lineup. This move hinted at Apple’s desire to move beyond the first-generation 3nm chips. Apple has a history of using older chips in its lower-end devices, as seen with the iPhone 14 series. The base model used the A15 Bionic chip from the previous iPhone 13 lineup, while the Pro models received the newer A16 Bionic. However, Apple broke this pattern with the iPhone 16 series, where all models featured the latest A18 chip. This left many assuming that the A17 chip’s lifecycle had effectively ended. But then came the iPad Mini 7th generation. This tablet launched with Apple Intelligence support and surprised many by including the A17 Pro chip from the iPhone 15 Pro instead of the newer A18 chip. The decision made sense given the iPad Mini’s lower production volume and target audience. Now, Apple seems ready to double down on this strategy. According to Gurman, the upcoming entry-level iPads, known internally as J481 and J482, will also feature the A17 Pro chip. The current entry-level iPad models run on the A14 chip with 4GB of memory. The new models are expected to upgrade to 8GB of memory, which is necessary to support Apple’s AI features. Apple is likely to use a binned version of the A17 Pro chip, similar to what was done with the iPad Mini, where a 5-core GPU variant was employed. This approach could help Apple manage costs while ensuring sufficient performance for the entry-level market.

There is supposed to be a fourth smartphone, which the company has not confirmed yet, but the teasers hint towards it –– the Galaxy S25 Slim. Expected to be the company’s slimmest smartphone yet, the S25 Slim is rumoured to only be unveiled at the event with its launch scheduled for a later date. Coming to the pricing of the Galaxy S25 series, the actual cost of the phone will only be revealed at the time of launch. However, last week leaked European prices give us a rough estimate of what the Galaxy S25 series might cost in India.  Expected pricing for the Galaxy S25 series in India   According to a leaked European retail listing, the base model of the Samsung Galaxy S25 with 128GB storage is priced at 964 euros, approximately Rs 85,000. The higher storage variants are expected to cost 1,026 euros (around Rs 91,000) for the 256GB model and 1,151 euros (about Rs 1,01,000) for the 512GB option.   For the Galaxy S25+, the pricing starts at 1,235 euros (roughly Rs 1,09,000) for the 256GB variant and rises to 1,359 euros (approximately Rs 1,20,000) for the 512GB version.   The Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung’s premium offering, comes with a steep price tag. The base model is rumoured to start at 1,557 euros, translating to approximately Rs 1,38,000. The top-end variant with 1TB storage could go as high as 1,930 euros, around Rs 1,70,000.   For context, the Galaxy S24 series, launched last year, came with slightly lower starting prices compared to the rumoured Galaxy S25 lineup. The Galaxy S24 was priced at Rs 79,999 for the 8GB + 256GB variant, with the 8GB + 512GB model costing Rs 89,999.  The Galaxy S24+ started at Rs 99,999 for the 12GB + 256GB option, going up to Rs 1,09,999 for the 12GB + 512GB version. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S24 Ultra began at Rs 1,29,999 for the 12GB+ 256GB model, Rs 1,39,999 for the 12GB + 512GB variant, and Rs 1,59,999 for the 12GB + 1TB option. This comparison highlights a potential price hike in the upcoming Galaxy S25 series.Details of Galaxy S25 series storage options leaked In addition to pricing, Galaxy S25 series’ storage option details have also leaked. The standard Galaxy S25 is expected to come in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options. The Galaxy S25+ may skip the 128GB variant and offer only 256GB and 512GB models. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to feature storage options up to 1TB, catering to users seeking maximum capacity.  Pre-reservation for Galaxy S25 series is open in India   Indian customers eager to get their hands on the Galaxy S25 series can already pre-reserve their devices for a refundable fee of Rs 1,999. This token payment ensures early access to the smartphones and provides additional benefits worth Rs 5,000.   Samsung is offering further incentives for those pre-ordering through its official website. These customers can choose exclusive colour options, customise RAM and storage configurations, and avail the best trade-in value for their current devices, making the upgrade to the Galaxy S25 series even more appealing.

The phone also features a premium build with Ceramic Shield glass, making it more resistant to scratches and drops, while maintaining a lightweight design. At this price, the iPhone 15 offers excellent value for money.

The scam involved remote access to the victim's phone, leading to multiple unauthorized transactions from his bank account.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/delhi-man-loses-rs-9-lakh-after-getting-call-from-fake-electricity-department-officials-2663889-2025-01-13,"Cyber scams are rampant in India. In the past few years, many individuals across the country have lost lakhs and crores to online scammers. The latest victim of such a scam is a man from West Delhi, who reportedly fell victim to a sophisticated scam, losing Rs 9 lakh to fraudsters posing as electricity department officials. The victim's ordeal began on December 26 when he visited the electricity department in his area to submit a name-change application for his power connection, reports PTI. Shortly after leaving the office, the victim received a call from an unknown number. The caller introduced himself as an official from the power distribution company (discom) and informed him about a pending electricity bill payment of Rs 13. To settle the supposed dues and proceed with the application, the victim complied and transferred the amount online, as instructed by the caller. However, after this initial payment, the caller contacted the victim again and instructed him to download an application via a link provided in a message. The victim, believing the app would resolve his name-change issue, complied, further trusting the scammers. However, as he opened the app and shared his details, the scammers managed to gain remote access to the victim's smartphone. Over the next few days, between December 29 and December 31, the fraudsters reportedly exploited this remote access to conduct multiple unauthorized transactions from the victim’s bank account. In total, they managed to siphon off Rs 9 lakh. It was only when the victim noticed the unauthorized transactions that he reported the incident to the police, registered a First Information Report (FIR), and initiated an investigation. A senior police officer confirmed the case and urged residents to exercise caution when dealing with unsolicited calls or payment requests.What is this new scam? At first glance, this case appears to involve a new trick by scammers to deceive people. However, the modus operandi employed by the cybercriminals is similar to what has been observed in other reported online scams. At the start of the scam, the fraudsters contact unsuspecting individuals while posing as legitimate officials, leveraging the victim's recent interaction with the electricity department to gain credibility. They ask the victim to pay a small amount of money, attempting to build trust by sharing details that only the victim would know. In this case, the scammers requested a minimal payment of Rs 13 to move forward with the application the victim had submitted at the actual office. Once the victim trusted them, they sent a malicious file to the victim's phone. As soon as the victim clicked on the link, the scammers gained full access to the victim’s phone, allowing them to steal money from the bank account.How to stay safe With scammers constantly developing new tricks to siphon money from people’s accounts, it is crucial to stay vigilant and avoid trusting unknown calls, especially those asking for payments via online methods. Note that government officials rarely resolve payment issues over the phone. If you believe a call might be legitimate, always cross-check the caller’s identity by contacting the official helpline or visiting the office in person. Do not rely solely on the information provided by the caller. Additionally, never click on unknown links. Fraudsters often send malicious links to gain access to your device. Avoid clicking on such links, particularly from unverified sources. Only use trusted platforms, like the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, to download apps. Lastly, keep your phone and banking apps secure by enabling two-factor authentication, setting up strong passwords, and updating your software regularly to patch vulnerabilities.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also Read |  OnePlus 13R review: Great hardware, loaded with features, and a killer priceAlso Read |  Apple users, beware of Banshee Stealer: Malware targeting macOS devicesAlso Read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series details leak ahead of launch next week

For anyone fed up with YouTube’s relentless ads, this is a golden opportunity to enjoy a smooth, ad-free experience on one of the world’s most popular video platforms. The Reliance Jio offer is available to users who subscribe to postpaid broadband plans priced at Rs 888 or above. This includes some of Jio’s most popular plans, aimed at enhancing the overall experience for its customers. With YouTube Premium, users can watch videos uninterrupted by ads, download content for offline viewing, and even play videos in the background while multitasking. The subscription also comes with access to YouTube Music. You can avail of 24 months of free YouTube Premium with JioFiber and Jio AirFiber postpaid plans priced at Rs 888, Rs 1,199, Rs 1,499, Rs 2,499, and Rs 3,499.  This new initiative from Jio comes as a response to the increasing popularity of YouTube Premium, which has seen a price hike in India over the past year. Currently, a standalone subscription to YouTube Premium costs Rs 149 per month for individual users and Rs 299 per month for families, making Jio’s offer an incredible value for its broadband subscribers. By bundling YouTube Premium with its postpaid broadband services, Jio is targeting households and individuals who consume large amounts of content on YouTube, whether on their smartphones, tablets, or smart TVs. It’s also a strategic move to attract more users to its broadband ecosystem, where Jio has been rapidly expanding its reach. YouTube has become the go-to video platform for most folks these days, whether it’s for catching up on news, watching tutorials, or streaming entertainment. However, the platform’s frequent ads, many of which are unskippable and can last between 15 and 20 seconds, can often disrupt the viewing experience. With YouTube Premium, users can enjoy their videos without interruptions and have a seamless viewing experience.  Another handy feature of YouTube Premium is the ability to play videos in the background. This is especially useful for smartphone users who like to listen to podcasts, music playlists, or even educational videos while using other apps or with their screens turned off. Additionally, users can download videos for offline viewing, making it convenient for those who travel frequently or have limited internet access. The inclusion of YouTube Music in the package is another highlight. With this, users gain access to a dedicated music streaming app that offers millions of tracks, curated playlists, and personalised recommendations — all without ads.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 15,000 in January 2024: Poco M7 Pro 5G, CMF Phone 1 and more

As we found in our review, the OnePlus 13R offers capable hardware and at a superb price point. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/oneplus-13r-review-in-5-points-flagship-killer-for-2025-2663963-2025-01-13,"The OnePlus 13 phones are now available in India. There are two phones: the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R. The OnePlus 13 is a powerful flagship from OnePlus, offering the best Android experience with premium hardware. However, this year, the OnePlus 13 might not be the smartest option for consumers. For most users, the smarter choice could be its sibling the OnePlus 13R.  Here at India Today Tech, we reviewed both phones and absolutely loved them. However, the OnePlus 13R gets some special love from us because it's not only a capable Android smartphone, but the hardware and performance it offers at its price point make it an almost perfect smartphone you can buy under Rs 50,000. This love reflects in the way we rated the two phones. The OnePlus 13 gets 8 points, whereas the OnePlus 13R got 8.5 out of 10.  In our review of the OnePlus 13R, we found that at a starting price of Rs 42,999, this premium smartphone is capable — truly in every sense — of offering users a flagship-level experience. This is all thanks to its powerful hardware, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset (which we earlier saw in the flagship OnePlus 12 of 2024), a stunning flat AMOLED display, upgraded cameras, and a massive 6000mAh battery. You can read our full review here: OnePlus 13R review: Great hardware, loaded with features, and a killer price. The review provides an in-depth analysis of everything from the display to the design and performance of the OnePlus 13R, covering everything you need to know. However, if you're short on time, here’s a quick, bite-sized summary of the OnePlus 13R review.Point 1: Flat design with strong build quality One of the biggest upgrades this year in the OnePlus 13R compared to its predecessor, the OnePlus 12R, is the design. The OnePlus 13R has adopted a boxy design with flat edges to give it a modern look. However, this change — although making the phone look more modern — comes at the cost of comfort, as the flat edges feel less ergonomic during extended use. While the looks didn’t excite us much, the OnePlus 13R is a better built phone compared to its predecessor. It is the first OnePlus phone to feature the new Gorilla Glass 7i on both sides and a hardy aluminium frame. It is a sturdy yet lightweight phone at 206 grams. The device we reviewed was in the Astral Trail colour option. This variant has a unique circular pattern on the back cover almost looking like a starry sky at night.Point 2: Bright display with uniform bezels The OnePlus 13R features a 6.78-inch AMOLED LTPO panel. The display truly stands out with its 120Hz refresh rate, 4500 nits peak brightness, and support for vibrant 10-bit colours. Be it watching content in 4K or gaming, or streaming HDR content, the display provides excellent clarity and brightness. Additionally, the Aqua Touch 2.0 feature ensures smooth operation even with wet hands. Another thing we really appreciated is the symmetrical bezels, that along with the flat display, offer a more immersive and bigger display experience.
 


Point 3: Flagship performance Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset — the same as we had seen in the 2024 flagship OnePlus 12 — and paired with a minimum of 12GB RAM, the OnePlus 13R manages to offer lag-free performance. It offers flagship performance despite its relatively more affordable chipset. Even now most phones with Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 sell for above Rs 50,000, whereas this one is coming around Rs 40,000. From running demanding apps to intensive gaming, OnePlus 13R handles it all efficiently. Multitasking is seamless, and the upgraded thermal management ensures consistent performance under load. The performance is also boosted with the clean and feature-loaded Oxygen OS 15 that, I believe, not only offers the latest Android experience but makes the phone fun to use with personalisation options and AI features.Point 4: Much-needed camera upgrade Last year in the OnePlus 12R, the camera really disappointed me. However, OnePlus has taken care of it, and this time with the OnePlus 13R offers much improved performance. The triple-camera setup is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, with better low-light photography and natural colour reproduction. The 50-megapixel primary sensor captures sharp and detailed images, while the ultra-wide lens delivers good results for landscapes. The telephoto camera also adds more power to the camera system, although its performance is just fine in extreme low-light conditions.  CHECK FULL REVIEW TO SEE IMAGE SAMPLES IN BIGGER SIZEPoint 5: Bigger battery The OnePlus 13R also comes with the biggest battery upgrade with a massive 6000mAh battery. The battery manages to offer over a day’s use with heavy usage, be it social media, calls, games, and whatnot. The charging speed, although slightly reduced to 80W —and the charger comes in the box — still tops up the battery in about 1 hour. This makes it a reliable companion for users on the go, though faster charging would have been a welcome addition.

6f060891-0f47-4871-8042-9464334e6c00,"Apple iPhone 17 Air launch in September seems more likely than everApple is rumored to launch its thinnest iPhone ever this year, the iPhone 17 Air. While several reports have suggested the phone's launch, the latest report further reinforces these rumors.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-iphone-17-air-launch-in-september-seems-more-likely-than-ever-2663945-2025-01-13,"Apple is reportedly preparing to unveil its thinnest iPhone to date, the iPhone 17 Air, alongside the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at its fall event this September. There have been many reports suggesting this already, but the latest one somewhat confirms that Apple may have settled on the iPhone 17 Air moniker for the rumoured phone. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has suggested this in his latest Power On newsletter. As per the newsletter, the iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to be approximately 2 millimeters thinner than existing iPhones. Gurman notes that this slim profile isn’t merely for aesthetics but is a crucial step toward creating foldable iPads and iPhones in the future. This device could act as a ""testing ground for future technologies,"" wrote Gurman. Additionally, the iPhone 17 Air could serve as a platform for Apple’s proprietary cell modem, reportedly codenamed Sinope, which is expected to debut in the iPhone SE in (possibly) March this year. While this year’s iPhones may also introduce Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, Gurman has not confirmed whether the 17 Air will include these components.   Meanwhile, another report by TF Securities International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has provided new details, claiming that the iPhone 17 Air will measure just 5.5mm in thickness, making it the slimmest iPhone ever. Look at the both reports, and the previous ones, here is everything new and old we know about the Apple iPhone 17 Air so far.iPhone 17 Air According to Kuo, the iPhone 17 Air is set to replace the ‘Plus’ variant in Apple’s iPhone lineup. If the 5.5mm thickness is accurate, the device will surpass the 6.9mm iPhone 6 from 2014 as Apple’s thinnest iPhone yet. It would also outshine Samsung’s rumored Galaxy S25 Slim, expected to be around 6mm thick, and dramatically undercut the 7.8mm iPhone 16.   However, the ultra-thin design comes with compromises. Kuo reports that the iPhone 17 Air will lack a physical SIM card slot, supporting only eSIM functionality. This reported decision is in line with Apple’s push toward a wireless future but may present challenges in markets like China, where eSIM adoption is relatively low. iPhone 17 Air may set new standards for mid-range phones To achieve this unprecedented slim profile, Apple is said to be employing advanced display technologies like Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI), which combines touch and display layers into a single unit. The iPhone 17 Air is also rumored to feature a 6.6-inch OLED display with ProMotion technology, enabling a 120Hz refresh rate. If implemented, it will mark the first time Apple extends this feature to non-Pro models, potentially setting a new standard for mid-range devices.  How will Apple squeeze a big camera into a slim body?   The iPhone 17 Air’s simplified design reportedly includes a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a departure from the dual-lens systems of current models. This streamlined camera setup could save space and contribute to the slim build. On the front, the device may feature a 24-megapixel TrueDepth camera, doubling the resolution of previous iterations.   Performance-wise, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to run on Apple’s A19 chipset, offering improved efficiency and processing power. Additional features like 8GB of RAM and Apple’s new in-house modem, codenamed “Sinope,” are also expected.  
iPhone 17 Air pricing in India   Rumours suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will replace the iPhone Plus series, with pricing starting at $899 (approximately Rs 89,900 in India). However, its innovative design and premium features could push its price beyond the $1,199 starting point of the iPhone 16 Pro Max.  iPhone 17 Air to iPhone Fold? Industry experts, including Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, believe the iPhone 17 Air will serve as a precursor to Apple’s future foldable devices. Its ultra-thin design could pave the way for breakthroughs in flexibility and durability, vital for foldable technology.   As Apple gears up for its September event, the iPhone 17 Air has emerged as one of the most intriguing announcements of 2025.

The law, which was the subject of arguments before the nine justices on Friday, sets a Jan. 19 deadline for ByteDance to sell the popular social media platform or face a ban on national security grounds. The companies have sought, at the very least, a delay in implementation of the law, which they say violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. Noel Francisco, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that Supreme Court endorsement of this law could enable statutes targeting other companies on similar grounds. ""AMC movie theaters used to be owned by a Chinese company. Under this theory, Congress could order AMC movie theaters to censor any movies that Congress doesn't like or promote any movies that Congress wanted,"" Francisco told the justices. The justices signaled through their questions during the arguments that they were inclined to uphold the law, although some expressed serious concerns about its First Amendment implications. TikTok is a platform used by about 170 million people in the United States, roughly half the country's population. Congress passed the measure last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, as lawmakers cited the risk of the Chinese government exploiting TikTok to spy on Americans and carry out covert influence operations. Jeffrey Fisher, the lawyer representing TikTok content creators who also have challenged the law, noted during the Supreme Court arguments that Congress with this measure was focusing on TikTok and not major Chinese online retailers including Temu. ""Would a Congress (that is) really worried about these very dramatic risks leave out an e-commerce site like Temu that has 70 million Americans using it?"" Fisher asked. ""It's very curious why you just single out TikTok alone and not other companies with tens of millions of people having their own data taken, you know, in the process of engaging with those websites and equally, if not more, available to Chinese control."" Democratic President Joe Biden signed the measure into law and his administration is defending it in this case. The deadline for divestiture is just one day before Republican Donald Trump, who opposes the ban, takes office as Biden's successor. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, arguing for the Biden administration in defending the law, said it was crucial that it take effect on Jan. 19 as scheduled in order to force ByteDance to act on divestiture. ""Foreign adversaries do not willingly give up their control over this mass communications channel in the United States,"" Prelogar said. ""When push comes to shove, and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider. And it might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process,"" Prelogar said. If the ban takes affect on Jan 19, Apple, opens new tab and Alphabet's Google, opens new tab would no longer be able to offer TikTok for downloads for new users but existing users could still access the app. The US government and TikTok agree that app would degrade and eventually become unusable over time because companies would not be able to offer supporting services. The Supreme Court also debated whether the possibility of TikTok being used for covert influence campaigns or propaganda purposes by China justified the banning it.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

During a podcast with YouTuber Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg mocked Apple for what he described as a lack of innovation in recent years, claiming the company has been ""milking"" the iPhone for nearly two decades. Although from his comments it also seems that Zuckerberg is more miffed at Apple’s policies around App Store and the company’s stance on privacy that hits Meta ad revenue.  “(Apple has) used the (iPhone) to impose a lot of arbitrary rules. It feels like they haven’t really invented anything groundbreaking in a while. Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, and now they’re just sitting on it 20 years later,"" Zuckerberg said. He pointed out that Apple has consistently made incremental improvements to the iPhone but has failed to introduce groundbreaking innovations in the way other companies, like Meta, are exploring technologies such as the metaverse and virtual reality. He also accused Apple of using privacy and security concerns as a shield against criticism from other companies. According to Zuckerberg, Apple could improve user privacy by improving security protocols and adopting better encryption practices. ""It’s insecure because you didn’t build proper security into it. Now you're using that as an excuse for why only your products can connect easily,"" Zuckerberg stated. He further claimed that Apple’s ""random rules"" are limiting Meta’s profitability, suggesting that if Apple relaxed its policies, Meta’s profits could increase by 50 per cent.  His latest comments on Apple are not surprising because there is an ongoing tiff between Meta and Apple, most notably on the point of privacy. While Facebook has traditionally sought access to more consumer data, Apple on Mac and iPhone has made it more and more difficult for tech companies to record and use private data for targeted advertisements. Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s ongoing rivalry This isn't the first time Zuckerberg has targeted Apple’s approach, as Meta has previously criticised the company for its strict App Store policies and privacy features, which have impacted Facebook’s advertising model. Zuckerberg's latest comments suggest that the rivalry between the two tech giants is far from over. Mark Zuckerberg’s rivalry with Apple is rooted in their differing business models, which have often led to public clashes. The tensions heightened in 2021 when Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency feature, which limited Facebook’s ability to track user data across apps. Zuckerberg criticised the move, stating that it would harm small businesses dependent on personalised ads. In the latest interview, Zuckerberg also took a swipe at Apple’s 30 per cent transaction fee on App Store purchases, calling it arbitrary and harmful to competition. He argued that this practice hampers Meta’s profitability and forces consumers to spend more on Apple’s peripherals. ""So how do they make more money as a company? By squeezing people with this 30 per cent developer tax and pushing consumers to buy more add-ons like AirPods,"" Zuckerberg said. ""They’ve made cool products like AirPods, but they’ve restricted anyone else from making something that integrates with the iPhone in the same way."" Zuckerberg also criticised Apple’s Vision Pro headset, which reportedly saw underwhelming sales in the US market. Meta, on the other hand, continues to develop its line of virtual headsets, like the Meta Quest. ""The Vision Pro is probably one of Apple’s bigger swings at trying something new in a while,"" Zuckerberg acknowledged. ""I don’t want to criticise too harshly since we’ve had early versions of products that weren’t great. But the first version of the Vision Pro definitely didn’t hit it out of the park.""Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

The Oppo Find N3 was launched in 2023 in China and was later rebranded as the OnePlus Open globally, a little later.  We expect the company will follow the same timeline this year as well. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oppo-find-n5-aka-oneplus-open-2-to-debut-next-month-as-thinnest-foldable-in-the-world-2664027-2025-01-13,"Oppo has officially announced that its flagship foldable, Oppo Find N5 will be launched in China in February this year. Oppo's Chief Product Officer, Pete Lau (known as Liu Zuohu), has confirmed the imminent launch of the Oppo Find N5 through a teaser image shared on Weibo. Lau, who is also the co-founder and CEO of OnePlus, revealed that the upcoming device will be the world’s thinnest foldable flagship smartphone.
 


 Last time, when Oppo released Find N3 in China in 2023, a few days later, it was then rebranded as OnePlus Open globally. Looking at the trends, we think the company will follow the same timeline. For context, Oppo is the parent company of OnePlus.  The teaser poster reveals that the Oppo Find N5 aka OnePlus Open 2 is slimmer than a standard pencil, which is typically 7-8mm thick. Based on this, the phone appears to be around 4mm thick when unfolded, suggesting it could measure less than 10mm when folded. Renowned tipster Digital Chat Station has also supported this claim, confirming that the Find N5 will be the world’s thinnest foldable phone, surpassing the current record-holder, the Honor Magic V3. Oppo Find N3 aka OnePlus Open 2: Expected specs According to earlier rumours and leaks, the Oppo Find N5 will feature a titanium build, offering enhanced durability compared to its predecessor. The device is expected to come with an IPX8 waterproof rating, addressing the lack of an IP rating in its predecessor.
 


 The Find N5 is rumoured to be powered by Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, supported by a robust 6,000mAh battery. It is anticipated to feature 80W or 100W fast charging, alongside wireless charging capabilities of up to 50W. On the back, the phone may boast a versatile camera setup, including a 50MP main sensor, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses.OnePlus Open 2 launch timeline From a Finnish perspective, the Oppo Find N5 holds particular interest as it is expected to serve as the foundation for the OnePlus Open 2, slated for release a bit later.
 


 Early renders of the OnePlus Open 2 have already surfaced, revealing a foldable inner screen measuring approximately 8 inches and a 6.4-inch cover screen—both slightly larger than the 7.82-inch inner screen and 6.31-inch cover screen of the original OnePlus Open. While earlier rumours suggested the OnePlus Open 2 might launch in the second half of 2025, the Oppo Find N5's scheduled February debut in China has raised hopes for an earlier release, potentially in spring or early summer.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Apple iPhone 17 Air launch in September seems more likely than everAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series details leak ahead of launch next weekAlso read |  Amazon Republic Day Sale announced: Big discounts on OnePlus Nord 4, iPhone 15 and more

Meta recently also eased content moderation policies and fact-checking.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/mark-zuckerberg-wants-more-masculine-energy-and-less-diversity-in-corporate-culture-2664036-2025-01-13,"Dressed in his signature ""Zuck 2.0"" look — baggy black T-shirt, gold chain, and curly blonde hair — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed a new version of himself in a bold interview with podcaster Joe Rogan. The world is calling it ""Zuck 3.0."" This version appears bolder and more controversial, as Zuckerberg shares his vision for corporate culture — one that emphasises what he calls ""masculine energy"" while scaling back on diversity initiatives. Appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Zuckerberg’s remarks were striking. “Masculine energy, I think, is good,” he said, claiming corporate environments have moved away from traditional masculine traits like aggression. According to Zuckerberg, successful workplaces need a balance of masculine and feminine energies, though he believes the pendulum has swung too far toward neutrality.   Zuckerberg’s own connection to this philosophy is personal. He spoke about how practicing mixed martial arts influenced his outlook, describing it as “a much more masculine culture.” His comments come alongside major policy shifts at Meta that further amplify the company’s ideological shift.  Meta scales back diversity policies Zuckerberg’s interview coincided with Meta’s announcement that it was significantly scaling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. An internal memo cited the term “DEI” as controversial, explaining that some perceive it as favouring certain groups over others.  This policy shift eliminates Meta’s diversity training programs and reduces targeted hiring initiatives. But why is this move making so much news? That's because it could result in less inclusive workplaces and widen existing gaps in representation.   In addition, Meta announced relaxed content moderation rules. The platform will now allow more leniency for posts criticising immigrants, transgender individuals, and non-binary people. Fact-checking measures in the United States were scrapped, raising concerns over the potential spread of misinformation.  A tilt toward Trump? Zuckerberg’s remarks and policy shifts have reignited debates about Meta’s political leanings. While the CEO criticised the Biden administration for allegedly pressuring the company to censor content during the pandemic, he praised US President-elect Donald Trump’s focus on “making America win.” Recent actions by Meta seem to align with conservative values, leading to speculation about the company’s relationship with Trump. A shift in priorities Zuckerberg insists that his vision is about balance rather than exclusion. While advocating for masculine traits like aggression in workplaces, he also emphasised the importance of opportunities for women and individuals from diverse backgrounds. “You want women to succeed and companies to unlock the value of great people no matter their background,” he said. However, the practical implications of Meta’s policy changes suggest a departure from these ideals. By scaling back DEI initiatives, loosening content moderation, and ending fact-checking, Meta’s new direction seems a little distant from its aim to maintain balance.

During a podcast with YouTuber Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg shared his vision for the role of AI in coding and the potential disruption it poses to the job market. He stated that by 2025, AI at Meta and other tech companies could effectively replace mid-level engineers who currently write code. This would represent a big shift in how tech companies approach software development.  ""We will get to a point where all the code in our apps and the AI it generates will also be written by AI engineers instead of people engineers,"" he said. For context, Business Insider reported that mid-level software engineers at Meta currently earn salaries in the mid-six figures — a cost AI could significantly reduce. Zuckerberg’s comments come at a time when other tech giants, such as Google and IBM, are also integrating AI into their operations, raising similar alarms. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, recently announced that over 25 per cent of all new code at Google is now generated by AI, with human engineers stepping in for final reviews. Meanwhile, IBM’s CEO, Arvind Krishna, revealed in 2023 that AI could replace up to 30 per cent of the company’s back-office roles. The trend, seen across different sectors, is sparking a debate about the future of traditional coding jobs.Jobs of human engineers are at risk? Zuckerberg’s latest announcement and Google's recent remark on AI completing coding tasks suggest that the role of human engineers is changing, potentially leading to fewer coding jobs in the traditional sense. Rather than spending time on routine tasks, engineers may need to focus on higher-level problem-solving and oversight of AI-generated code. As AI is more integrated into tech workflows, junior and entry-level coding positions might diminish, forcing aspiring developers to rethink their career paths. However, it’s not all doom and gloom for engineers. AI’s growing role in code generation could actually empower coders to concentrate on more strategic and creative aspects of development. It is important to note that human engineers can't be replaced in the longer run because they can solve complex issues that AI alone cannot handle. As routine tasks are increasingly automated, the importance of these core competencies will grow, placing greater value on skills that complement AI.This tech company has stopped hiring humans Meta isn’t alone in its AI journey. Klarna, a leading fintech company, has also supported AI-driven automation, reducing its workforce by 20 per cent over the past year without hiring replacements. Klarna’s CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, has openly stated that AI now performs nearly all tasks traditionally handled by human employees, signaling yet another shift toward an AI-dominated future. The company, which previously had 4,500 employees, now has 3,500. This reduction happened naturally, according to the CEO, due to the 20 per cent annual attrition rate common in tech firms.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

While the OnePlus 13 is priced starting at Rs 69,999, the 13R comes in at a much more affordable Rs 42,999 asking price — a striking Rs 27,000 difference. Although the OnePlus 13 justifies its premium price, the 13R is an excellent option for those who don’t necessarily need a flagship device or the hefty price tag that comes with it. In this article, we highlight the top 4 reasons why the OnePlus 13R could be your next smartphone, along with one reason why you might want to explore other options.advertisementOnePlus 13R: 4 reasons to buyAll we need is a flat panel with nifty featuresOn paper, the OnePlus 13R appears to use the same display tech as the 12R, i.e., a 6.78-inch screen with 1.5K resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 4,500 nits peak brightness. However, the 13R now features a completely flat display. Unlike the quad-curved panels recently seen on the OnePlus 13 and Vivo X200 series, the 13R’s flat design is more in line with devices like the iPhone 16, Galaxy S24, and iQOO 13. Compared to the 12R’s curved display, the flat panel of the 13R not only matches its brightness but also resolves issues with corner glare and mistouches.

 The Aqua Touch technology from last year is still included, but this time, the 13R introduces a new Glove Mode. Initially, it might sound gimmicky, but in practice, it’s a game-changer, especially in winter. Glove Mode lets you use the touchscreen even while wearing gloves — be it woollen or sheepskin gloves up to 0.5 cm thick. Throughout the review period, during my morning commutes, I never needed to remove my gloves to use the phone. It’s that effective, making it a truly practical addition. Solid performance, good thermal management The OnePlus 13R sees a solid performance upgrade thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Based on benchmark results alone, the 13R demonstrates a noticeable leap over the 12R in raw performance, easily justifying the upgrade. However, the improvements go beyond just numbers — especially when it comes to gaming. The OnePlus 13R delivers two key advantages over its predecessor.

 First, the flat display ensures you don’t experience mistouches during gaming, a common issue with curved displays. Second, while the overall performance of the 12R is excellent, the 13R takes things a step further with superior thermal management. Even under heavy workloads, the device maintained stable temperatures and never became alarmingly hot during my testing — even when used while charging. These improvements make the 13R a more reliable option for extended gaming sessions and heavy multitasking. This one’s a marathoner The OnePlus 12R comes with a 5,500mAh battery and 100W fast charging, while the OnePlus 13R upgrades to a larger 6,000mAh battery with 80W fast charging. At first glance, the slower 80W charging may seem like a downgrade compared to the 100W speed of the 12R, but in reality, it’s a better choice for preserving long-term battery health. The charging times remain impressive, with the phone taking roughly 50 minutes for a full charge.

 When it comes to endurance, the OnePlus 13R easily lasts 1.5 days on a single charge, even with heavy usage — something the 12R struggles to achieve. This improvement is largely due to the 13R's silicon carbon battery, which boasts a higher density than the lithium-ion battery in the 12R. As a result, it holds a longer charge and, on a technical level, offers greater longevity compared to its lithium-ion counterpart.  OxygenOS 15 with all the AI goodness The OnePlus 13R runs OxygenOS 15 atop Android 15 and comes with a solid promise of 4 years of OS updates and 6 years of security patch support. It packs all the latest features and AI tools, including AI Notes, Circle to Search, and AI-powered features in the gallery app like AI Unblur and AI Reflection Eraser, among many others. While it’s true that Android 15 with OxygenOS 15 is also available on the OnePlus 12R, if you want the full-fledged experience of what OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15 has to offer, the OnePlus 13R — and of course, the flagship OnePlus 13 are undoubtedly your best choices.advertisementOnePlus 13R: 1 reason to skipiQOO 12 is currently selling at the same priceThe iQOO 12 is currently selling for Rs 45,999. Moreover, a Rs 3,000 flat coupon discount on Amazon brings it down to the same price as the OnePlus 13R. With roughly the same package, which one offers better value for your money?
 


While the OnePlus 13R impresses with its smooth and feature-rich OxygenOS 15 software, the iQOO 12 takes the upper hand when it comes to hardware, except for the battery. Both devices come with 1.5K resolution displays, but the iQOO 12 offers a 144Hz refresh rate, which is a big plus for gamers. On the other hand, the OnePlus 13R sticks with a 120Hz panel. In terms of memory and storage, both phones start with 12GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage, so there’s no difference there.advertisementWhen it comes to cameras, the iQOO 12 outshines the OnePlus 13R with its flagship-grade setup. It packs three 50 MP sensors — a primary camera, an ultra-wide-angle camera, and a periscope lens with a 3x optical zoom. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13R offers a simpler camera configuration, and its video recording is capped at 4K at 60fps. The iQOO 12, in comparison, can also shoot videos in 8K resolution at 30fps, if the need be.Battery performance is another area to consider. The OnePlus 13R comes with a larger 6,000mAh battery and supports 80W fast charging. In contrast, the iQOO 12 has a smaller 5,000mAh battery but compensates with 120W fast charging, which gets the phone charged much faster. Plus, for gamers, the iQOO 12 offers bypass charging, a feature that keeps the phone cool during long gaming sessions.In the end, choosing between the OnePlus 13R and the iQOO 12 comes down to your priorities. If you value a longer-lasting battery and a smoother software experience, the OnePlus 13R might be the better pick. However, if you’re after better hardware, especially for gaming and photography, the iQOO 12 is hard to beat — especially with the Amazon discount bringing it to the same price.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 15,000 in January 2024: Poco M7 Pro 5G, CMF Phone 1 and more

According to the tipster, Evan Blass, Pei wrote to him, saying this phone is the company's first step toward its AI-powered platform.   ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/nothing-phone-3-may-launch-by-march-2025-confirms-ceo-carl-pei-2664103-2025-01-13,"After launching Nothing Phone (2) in 2023, CEO Carl Pei has finally confirmed that the company will launch its flagship, Nothing Phone (3), in 2025. According to a tipster, Evan Blass, the Pei confirmed the news via mail. He shared that this year would be the company's biggest year so far. This is mostly because of the launch of the Nothing Phone (3), which will mark the company's first step towards its AI-powered platform, he added.  

In the email, shared by Blass (@evleaks) on X, Pei stated that With the Nothing Phone (3), the company is aiming to redefine the user experience of personal computing devices. In other words, it aims to make the user's life easier. 
 


 Lastly, the email also added that the Nothing Phone (3) will debut in the first quarter of 2025. This means that the launch could be witnessed by March-end. Previously, the company was seen in the headlines for delaying the phone. 
 


 The 2025 launch of the Nothing Phone 3 marks a significant departure from the typical annual refresh cycle of high-end smartphones. The Nothing Phone 1 debuted in India in 2022, followed by the flagship Nothing Phone 2 in July 2023. However, the two-year gap before the release of the next iteration suggests substantial upgrades. According to Carl Pei, the Nothing Phone 3 will focus heavily on AI-driven features.Nothing Phone (3): What do we know so far The upcoming Nothing Phone 3 is rumoured to introduce several new features, including an iPhone-inspired Action Button and a 6.5-inch display, according to leaks. Additionally, a Pro variant, the Nothing Phone 3 Pro, is expected to launch alongside it, featuring a larger 6.7-inch screen.   The Action Button, reminiscent of the feature found on iPhones, is anticipated to provide customisable controls, allowing users to launch apps, toggle settings, or create personalised shortcuts. This addition highlights Nothing's commitment to blending user-centric innovation with modern design aesthetics.   According to the video previously shared on X, Pei and his team explained the initial AI features they had discovered. They explained how Nothing Phone 3 will be a hub for a highly personalised experience.  AI will be deeply integrated with the operating system on the upcoming Nothing Phone 3 to deliver a personalised user experience. The re-imaging of the home screen might be the first upgrade to Nothing Phone 3, as per the video. Along with this, the upcoming Nothing Phone (3) is expected to feature a mid-range chipset, such as the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 or MediaTek Dimensity 9200+. For context, the Nothing Phone 2, equipped with the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, entered the premium price segment. This choice hints at a potentially more affordable price point for the Phone 3.   The Nothing Phone 1 launched in India at a starting price of Rs 32,999, while the Phone 2, with its higher specifications, debuted at Rs 44,999 for the base variant. By shifting back to a mid-range focus, the Phone 3 could appeal to a wider audience, while the Pro version is likely to target users seeking top-tier performance and features.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also read |  Nothing Phone 3 to launch next year: Price, specs, features and all we know so farAlso read |  Mark Zuckerberg says AI as good as mid-level software engineers at Meta, rings alarm on developer jobsAlso read |  Apple iPhone 17 Air launch in September seems more likely than everMust Watch

Powered by the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 processor, the Pad 7 is an all-rounder, offering almost everything one needs from a tablet, and that too at a really good price point.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/xiaomi-pad-7-review-lightweight-and-powerful-on-a-budget-2664191-2025-01-13,"The tablet market continues to be a largely one-sided affair. That is it is a market ruled by the iPad. And it is with this context that I say this: The Xiaomi Pad 7 is a welcome sight for sore eyes. The picking in the world of Android tablets are few and far between. But going forward I believe that the Xiaomi Pad 7 should be a standard choice for anyone looking to get an Android tablet, or even a tablet without spending Rs 50,000. Yes, it is that good.  I have been using the Xiaomi Pad 7 for the last 10 days and I must say that I am impressed. The Pad 7 is not only loaded with good hardware but it is available for users at a really competitive price. In fact more than the hardware its the price which is the real deal with the Xiaomi Pad 7.  Xiaomi Pad 7 runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset – the same chipset we have seen in mainstream smartphones. The chipset has proven to be capable so it is a good choice for the tablet. The Pad 7 comes with up to 12GB RAM plus 256GB storage variant. On the software side you have HyperOS 2, which brings a lot more new productivity tools for the larger display and a clean software experience. Inside there is a large 8,850mAh battery, which supports 45W fast charging. On the front, the Pad 7 features an 11.2-inch display with a 3.2K resolution and a pixel density of 345 PPI. The tablet offers a 144Hz AdaptiveSync refresh rate. On the sides, there’s a quad-speaker system with support for Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res Audio. The tablet is also really lightweight. The Pad 7 has a 6.18mm metal shell and weighs approximately 500 grams. To complement the productivity of the Xiaomi Pad 7, Xiaomi has also introduced its improved Focus Keyboard, which now includes a trackpad and backlit option, and the Focus Pen with better 8,132 pressure sensitivity levels for precision in drawing and writing. Of course, they cost extra. Talking of cost, the Pad 7 comes in three flavours. The Pad 7 costs Rs 26,999 for the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant and Rs 29,999 for the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage variant. Then there is the variant that costs Rs 31,999. It offers the Xiaomi Pad 7 with a nano-texture glass on the display, similar to what Apple puts on its iPad Pro M4. The Pad 7 screen with nano-texture reflects less light and consequently displays colours with more contrast, particularly in outdoor settings.  Coming back to the Xiaomi Pad 7, on paper it looks capable with loaded features and a rather superb price. But as I used it I also noticed a few niggles here and there. So, let’s take a closer look in this India Today Tech review.Looks so good, great in hands The Xiaomi Pad 7 is an incredibly lightweight tablet, weighing just 500 grams. It is also extremely slim at 6.18mm. The unit I am reviewing is in Mirage Purple. While the shade isn’t exactly purple, it features an iridescent purple hue that shifts beautifully under light. I really liked the design and colour. It’s stylish, easy to carry around, and fits perfectly in a handbag. The tablet has a metal finish at the back, which not only looks premium but is also fingerprint-resistant. However, the LCD display tends to catch fingerprints easily, so you’ll find yourself needing to clean it frequently. All-in-all it’s comfortable to hold and doesn’t strain your hand, even when carried in one hand.
 


 On the back, similar to the Xiaomi Pad 6, the Pad 7 features a square camera module – that houses a 13-megapixel camera, along with a flashlight and faux-lens shaped pattern. When you look at it, you might believe it has two rear cameras. But no, there is only one camera. On the sides, you’ll find the volume buttons, while the top houses the power button. At the bottom, there’s a Type-C charging port. The Pad 7 also includes quad speakers — two on the top and two on the bottom when the tablet is placed in portrait orientation.  On the front, the selfie camera is placed in a small punch hole cutout in landscape orientation. The bezels aren’t the thinnest but are uniform, giving the tablet a balanced and clean look. Clear LCD display On paper, the Pad 7 — as I noted in the specs above — has a display that checks all the right boxes. In practice, though, there are a few observations I wish to share. The Pad 7, keeping in line with its price, is using an LCD display. It is a good display but it is also not going to dazzle you or wow you like an OLED display in a premium phone, or top class LCD or OLED display in a more expensive tablet.  It’s not that the Pad 7 display is not capable enough. I used the Xiaomi Pad 7 to watch plenty of videos on YouTube and OTT platforms like Netflix, and I absolutely loved the picture quality. The display also comes with Dolby Vision support which makes it easy to watch high-resolution content on platforms like Netflix. With peak brightness of 800nits, it is also bright enough for indoor use.  Having said that, keep two things in mind. One, the Pad 7 screen lacks the ability to show the deepest deep blacks. And that means the colours on the Pad 7 do not have that super vibrant, liquid paint kind of look to them. And two, the brightness, while plenty, is not blindingly bright like the way you would get on a more — rather much more — expensive tablet.  
 


 Gaming on the Pad 7 screen was equally enjoyable. I spent a lot of time playing Netflix games — yes, I tested Netflix games —Minecraft, candy crush, Ludo and others. The large, smooth, and bright display made the experience immersive, lag free and fun especially for simulation games like Minecraft, which are much better on a big screen. I even tried the demanding games like Asphalt 9 and the experience was equally enjoyable with high graphic settings.  I tried some photo editing on the built-in MI Canvas app and worked on a few images. While I’ll cover performance in detail later, I really enjoyed the display's colour fidelity for these tasks. It is not brilliant but it is up to the task.   Of course, if you want a better display you can always step up to the nano-texture variant. Although I didn’t get a chance to use it in details — it will be arriving in India next month — I did get a chance to briefly try it at a media briefing by Xiaomi. In the brief time I used it, the matte display really impressed me as it effectively cut down reflections completely. If you prefer a matte display for a more glare-free experience, this option is worth considering.  However, for most users the standard LCD display also works well and delivers a satisfactory viewing experience.Powerful enough  We have seen Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset in action before in similarly priced smartphones like the OnePlus Nord 4 and Realme GT 6T. It’s a fast and capable chipset that performs well and effectively handles everyday tasks. In the Xiaomi Pad 7 too the  chipset works reliably and delivers smooth and competent performance. While using the Pad 7, not once did I face any lag or stutter. Whether multitasking, switching between apps, playing games, editing, or working on CMS, the device remained cool and quick. Although it gets slightly warm during heavy gaming sessions, it’s manageable and doesn’t affect performance. To figure out the performance of the Pad 7, I ran some benchmarks— you can see the results below — on it and the numbers were impressive.

 



I ran some benchmarks on the newly launched Xiaomi Pad 7
 The performance is further enhanced by HyperOS 2. Let me say, Xiaomi has done a really good job here. Unlike the cluttered OS experience we used to see on Xiaomi devices, HyperOS is clean, and the updated HyperOS 2 is lightweight, user-friendly, and packed with personalisation options. The inclusion of AI features makes it fun and functional. As I primarily used the tablet for entertainment, another standout feature was the speakers. The quad-speaker setup delivers clear and crisp audio with good volume. Although they aren’t bass-heavy, they’re sufficient for streaming or gaming. In fact, during my usage, I never felt the need to pair my earbuds with the Pad 7 — the built-in speakers were more than adequate.
 


 When it comes to performance, the Xiaomi Pad 7 delivers impressively in its segment. However, one area where it could have been better is battery life. With heavy use, such as hours of binge-watching, the battery lasted around 7 hours. While this is decent, a larger battery could have made it even better. The in-box 45W charger managed to fully recharge the battery in about 2 hours, but using any other charger significantly reduced the charging speed. A bit about the cameras Unlike smartphones, tablets aren’t designed for photography, and I didn’t expect much from the Pad 7 in this regard. However, for video calls and scanning documents, the cameras are sufficient. The front camera, in particular, features an ultra-wide angle, providing a great view during video calls.
 


Focus Keyboard and Pen  Along with the Xiaomi Pad 7, the company has also introduced a new and improved Focus Keyboard and Pen. Now, the keyboard this time comes with a trackpad and backlighting, which significantly improves its usability. After setting up the tablet with the keyboard, I even used the Pad 7 as my work device to write stories and file them using our CMS. The trackpad made it easier to control the cursor. While the keyboard is tactile and responsive, the trackpad is relatively small and not always smooth. It often failed to register gestures properly, which could be frustrating at times. Another aspect to note is the tilt. The Focus Keyboard allows you to tilt the tablet to a fixed angle of 124 degrees. While the magnets are sturdy and the tablet attaches securely, the tilt feels a bit restrictive. Especially during work sessions, the limited tilt angle felt slightly inconvenient, and a wider range of adjustment would have made using the tablet more comfortable. Coming to the Focus Pen, it can be magnetically attached to the Pad 7, where it also charges. The pen is easy to use and performs well for casual tasks. While it doesn’t provide a paper-like writing experience, it’s good enough for casual doodling, taking notes, or light writing. For everyday use, it gets the job done without any major issues.
 


Xiaomi Pad 7 review: Should you buy it?  Absolutely. If you’re looking for a good Android tablet under Rs 30,000, or a tablet with a matte display — similar to the iPad Pro —under Rs 35,000, the new Xiaomi Pad 7 is a compelling option. The Pad 7 is powerful and can easily handle your entertainment needs, including hours of binge-watching, casual gaming, and more. It’s lightweight, easy to carry around, and even convenient for casual video or office calls.  And if you opt for the keyboard accessory, you can use it like a laptop for writing reports, mails or just your thoughts.  And if you are someone who likes to doodle or are into digital art you can get the tablet with the pen. The Pen will keep you covered for sketching or note-taking. However, even without the accessories, the Pad 7 holds its own. It’s a capable tablet and arguably the best at its price point.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Also Read |  OnePlus 13R review in 5 points: Flagship-killer for 2025Also Read |  Delhi man loses Rs 9 lakh after getting call from fake electricity department officialsAlso Read |  OnePlus 13R review: Great hardware, loaded with features, and a killer price

TikTok says reports of sale are pure fictionAs TikTok is facing the risk of a ban in the US with the deadline set for January 19, rumours have reached a fever pitch suggest that Elon Musk is in the mix to buy TikTok US operations. TikTok, however, has dismissed the rumours.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-to-buy-tiktok-us-tiktok-says-reports-of-sale-are-pure-fiction-2664394-2025-01-14,"Speculation over the future of TikTok’s US operations has reached a fever pitch, with reports suggesting Elon Musk is being considered as a potential buyer. However, TikTok has vehemently dismissed these claims, calling them “pure fiction.”   A Bloomberg report on Monday revealed that Chinese officials are in preliminary discussions about selling TikTok’s US arm to Musk, should the app face an imminent ban. The proposed move could see Musk’s social media platform X take control of TikTok’s operations in the country, integrating its 170 million US users with X’s extensive advertising infrastructure. The report valued such a deal at between $40 billion and $50 billion.  This development follows growing national security concerns in the United States over TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, and its ties to the Chinese government. ByteDance’s structure includes a ""golden share"" held by China, which grants Beijing significant influence. Several US lawmakers argue that this connection poses a risk to data privacy and security, fueling calls for divestment or a nationwide ban.   TikTok’s future in the US now hinges on a January 19 deadline, by which ByteDance must either sell the app’s US operations or cease its services in the country. Failure to comply would mean users losing access to updates and security patches, even as the app remains functional on existing devices.   Despite the urgency, TikTok has categorically denied any talks involving Musk, ByteDance, or the Chinese government regarding a potential sale. “We can’t be expected to comment on pure fiction,” a TikTok spokesperson said. ByteDance has also reiterated that China’s stake in the company has “no bearing on its global operations outside of China, including TikTok.”   The prospect of Musk’s involvement stems from his existing connections in China through Tesla’s operations and a proven track record in high-profile acquisitions. In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, later rebranding it as X. However, analysts note that a TikTok acquisition would pose unique challenges, including the complex separation of its US business and securing financing, even for the world’s richest man.   The Bloomberg report also indicated that if Musk does not proceed with a deal, other potential bidders could include Microsoft, Oracle, and investor-led consortiums.   Meanwhile, China is reportedly keen on keeping TikTok under ByteDance’s control. Selling to a foreign entity would not only diminish China’s strategic leverage but could also set a precedent for other companies facing scrutiny abroad.   For TikTok creators and users, the stakes are high. A ban would likely force creators to migrate to platforms like YouTube or Instagram Reels, potentially benefiting companies like Meta and Google.   As TikTok faces mounting pressure from both the US government and its looming deadline, all eyes remain on ByteDance, Elon Musk, and the decisions that could shape the future of one of the world’s most popular apps.

d12f05a3-ae8c-4bec-b220-6f1a12a3c419,"US AI chip export restrictions: Impact on India, global tech industry The US government has announced restrictions on AI chip exports to curb China's technological advancement, which could have a significant impact on the global AI chip market, including India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/us-announces-restrictions-on-exporting-ai-chips-how-the-move-can-impact-india-and-global-tech-industry-2664446-2025-01-14,"The United States has introduced sweeping new regulations limiting the export of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, tightening rules for companies like Nvidia, as it aims to curb China's technological advancements. These new restrictions could have a significant impact on the global AI chip market, including in India. The new rules, set to take effect within a year, impose strict limits on the computational power of AI chips sold to most countries. Exceptions are made for allied nations adhering to the US-approved security and human rights standards. These new rules are designed to prevent adversaries, particularly China and Russia, from taking advantage of advanced AI technology for military or surveillance purposes.  “Managing national security risks requires trade-offs. This rule ensures our allies can access cutting-edge technology while safeguarding our interests,” wrote US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo in a blogpost by the White House. The regulations build on previous chip export controls, with the goal of ensuring that AI development aligns with US standards. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in an official statement: “This rule ensures that the infrastructure for frontier AI systems remains in America or allied jurisdictions, preventing offshoring similar to what occurred with chips and batteries.”Nvidia reacts Nvidia voiced strong opposition to the new regulations. Nvidia, a leader in AI chip production, warned that the policy risks undermining America’s global technological dominance. “The rule threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” said Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs. The company highlighted the potential unintended consequences of these restrictions, including driving customers to Chinese competitors like Huawei, which has made significant advancements in AI chips. Nvidia’s concerns align with broader industry fears that regulatory overreach could stifle competition.Global reactions and EU concerns China condemned the US measures, accusing the US government of disrupting international trade and innovation. The European Union also expressed apprehension, noting that the restrictions could strain transatlantic tech collaboration. “It is in the US economic and security interest that the EU buys advanced AI chips without limitations,” EU officials said.The Indian angle India, which has been pushing for AI and semiconductor manufacturing lately, could find itself at an advantage due to its strategic partnerships with the US. The restrictions exclude supply chain activities and gaming chips, but they bar exporting AI chips to nations like China and Russia. This policy could potentially redirect investments and resources toward countries like India, strengthening its position in the global AI and tech ecosystem.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also read |  Elon Musk to buy TikTok US?

However, as more and more people are increasing their footprint in the digital world, scammers have also started employing new tactics, including using the names of government schemes to trick people and steal their money. One such case of this scam comes from Hyderabad, where a 53-year-old man lost â‚¹1.9 lakh to a fake message claiming to offer benefits under the PM Kisan scheme. The victim, who resides in Old Safilguda and works in a private firm, received a WhatsApp message containing a link that appeared genuine but turned out to be fraudulent, as reported by Deccan Chronicle. According to the report, the victim clicked on the link shared in his WhatsApp chat by an unknown individual. Upon clicking, he was directed to a fake website. Believing it to be an official portal, the victim attempted to get more details about the government scheme. Following the instructions, he ended up sharing a one-time password (OTP) provided by the scammers. This lapse allowed the fraudsters to access his bank account and siphon off a significant amount of money. Realizing the scam, the victim promptly reported the incident to the Rachakonda Cybercrime Police, who have since registered a case and initiated an investigation.How to stay safe from such scams  If you are interested in learning more about government schemes, note that the government has established official platforms where citizens can verify information and access legitimate services. For instance, the official PM Kisan website – pmkisan.gov.in–  and the National Portal of India– india.gov.in–  are reliable sources for information on government schemes. If you receive advertisements or messages on platforms like WhatsApp, always cross-check unsolicited messages against these platforms and avoid interacting with unverified links. Additionally, always verify the authenticity of messages, especially those offering financial benefits. Check official government websites or contact helplines for confirmation. If you are unsure or the link appears suspicious, do not click on links sent via unsolicited messages, emails, or social media platforms, as they can be malicious and designed to hack into your devices. Never share OTPs with anyone. Treat OTPs as confidential information and never disclose them, even if someone claims to be from a trusted organization. If you suspect fraud, report it immediately to the local police or cybercrime cell. In India, complaints can also be filed through the Cyber Crime Reporting Portal – cybercrime.gov.in.

Replying to unknown messages enables links and confirms active numbers, making users targets for future scams.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/your-iphone-data-is-at-risk-cybercriminals-have-found-a-way-to-easily-access-your-messages-2664415-2025-01-14,"Cybercriminals have found a new way to exploit iPhone users by bypassing iMessage’s built-in phishing protection, leaving users vulnerable to malicious links and scams. This worrying trend was reported by BleepingComputer, highlighting a tactic that could put many people at risk of fraud. iMessage has a security feature that automatically disables clickable links in messages from unknown senders. It’s a smart tool meant to protect users from phishing attacks. However, scammers have figured out how to turn this feature against the users it’s designed to protect. According to Apple, when you reply to a message or add the sender to your contacts, those disabled links suddenly become clickable. Scammers are taking full advantage of this behaviour, fooling users into engaging with their messages. The fraudulent messages often pretend to be from trusted organisations. They use language that looks official and familiar, such as “reply STOP” or “reply NO,” to make the message seem legitimate. This is similar to the wording used by many real businesses or services, which is why people can be easily tricked. What makes this scam particularly effective is that replying to these messages does more than enable the links. It also gives scammers valuable information — confirmation that the phone number is active, and the recipient is likely to respond to future scams. This puts those users at greater risk of being targeted again. While folks who have a keen interest in technology may spot the signs of a phishing scam, the bigger concern is for older people or those less familiar with these tactics. They are the ones most likely to fall for these tricks, often because they assume the messages are genuine. So how can you protect yourself? The best advice is simple — don’t reply to messages from unknown senders, no matter how convincing they appear. If something feels off, trust your instincts and leave the message alone. Another layer of protection is available on iPhones and iPads through message filtering. This feature moves messages from people who aren’t in your contacts into a separate list. To enable it, go to Settings > Messages > toggle on Filter Unknown Senders. This way, it’s easier to spot unfamiliar messages and decide whether to engage with them. It’s worth noting that this feature might also filter legitimate messages, like delivery updates or notifications from your bank. However, links in messages from unknown senders remain disabled unless you reply or add the sender to your contacts. That’s how the system is designed to work.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

Here are the details.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/alert-hackers-use-apps-like-candy-crush-and-tinder-to-spy-on-you-access-personal-information-2664502-2025-01-14,"Some of the most widely used mobile apps, including Candy Crush and Tinder, are reportedly gathering sensitive user location data without their knowledge, according to a fresh report by 404 Media. The apps, available on both Android and iOS, may be involved in data collection through the advertising ecosystem, raising serious privacy concerns. This data is believed to have ended up with a location data broker, Gravy Analytics, whose subsidiary, Venntel, has previously sold such information to US law enforcement agencies. The report reveals that this data collection likely happens through real-time bidding (RTB) systems, where companies bid to display ads within apps. While these ads run, data brokers like Gravy Analytics are allegedly able to intercept and gather user location data, even without the direct involvement of app developers. This process is not controlled by the app creators themselves, meaning users remain unaware that their location is being monitored. Security experts, including Zach Edwards from cybersecurity firm Silent Push, are alarmed by the scale of this data harvesting. According to the report, Edwards stated that this marks one of the first times the public has concrete evidence showing that some data brokers are acquiring user information from advertising bid streams, rather than from code embedded in the apps themselves. The leaked data reportedly includes over 30 million location points, including sensitive areas like the White House, Kremlin, Vatican City, and several military bases. The list of apps involved in this breach includes popular games like Candy Crush, Subway Surfers, Temple Run, and even dating platforms like Tinder and Grindr. Also mentioned are health-related apps, such as MyFitnessPal and various pregnancy trackers, along with religious and VPN apps, which ironically are often downloaded to enhance privacy. This privacy breach has raised concerns worldwide, particularly after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently imposed a ban on Gravy Analytics and Venntel for selling location data without user consent. While many apps seem safe on the surface, this incident hints at the growing risks associated with the misuse of user data through indirect means like ad ecosystems. How to secure your data on Android phones and iPhones? Experts suggest that smartphone users be cautious when granting location permissions to apps and consider reviewing app privacy policies more carefully. Android users are advised to avoid granting unnecessary permissions, such as location and camera access, to apps that do not require them for basic functionality. iPhone users can enable the ""Ask Apps Not to Track"" feature after installing an app to limit tracking and data collection.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 14, 2025

Meanwhile, for buyers who are in a hurry and want to make a quick decision, here are four reasons to buy the Pixel 9 and one reason you may need to think twice or skip the deal altogether. Reason 1 to buy: Outstanding camera performance Year on year, Google’s Pixel phones are known for their cameras, and the Pixel 9 is no different. The phone is equipped with a 50-megapixel main sensor and a 48-megapixel ultra-wide camera. The camera manages to deliver sharp and vibrant photos in various lighting conditions. The improved HDR pipeline also ensures well-balanced exposure, making it a perfect camera set for capturing sunsets, portraits, and low-light scenes. While it lacks the telephoto lens of its Pro sibling, the Pixel 9’s cameras still outperform many competitors in its class. The cameras are further complemented by features like Magic Editor and Pixel Studio, allowing users to edit and tweak photos using generative AI tools within the phone.  If mobile photography is your top priority in premium phones, then the Pixel 9 is your option and even better with the available discount.Reason 2 to buy: AI integration The Pixel 9 also comes loaded with Google’s latest AI features powered by the Tensor G4 chipset. The Pixel 9 comes integrated with Gemini Live, which is right on one of the smartest AI assistance, bringing human-like voice interactions. It also has features like Call Notes transcribes in real, Screenshots app, Magic Editor, and more features to get your work done quick and in fun way.  Along with AI integration, the new Pixel 9 also offers seven years of Android updates, which means that these AI features will be updated and will only improve over time. This level of software support is rare in the Android ecosystem and adds long-term value to the Pixel 9.advertisementReason 3: Premium build and displayIn our review of Pixel 9, we also highlighted the new refreshed design elements, making the Pixel 9’s minimalist design stand out. Its aluminium frame with a matte finish feels sturdy, and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on both sides adds durability. The 6.3-inch Actua Display offers vibrant colours and excellent brightness. Even under harsh sunlight, the screen remains legible, making it suitable for outdoor use. The compact size and manageable weight – 198 grams – make the Pixel 9 a great option for users who find big smartphones cumbersome.Reason 4: Exceptional battery lifeBattery performance is one of the Pixel 9’s standout features. In our tests, it lasted over 17 hours with 20 per cent battery remaining, making it one of the most enduring phones in its class. For everyday use, you can expect it to easily last a day and a half, or even two days with moderate usage.One reason to skip: dated chipsetNow, although the Tensor G4 inside the Pixel 9 is capable of handling daily use smoothly and powers Google’s AI features, it feels a bit dated compared to newer processors like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. This even made the Pixel 9 fall short in benchmark tests when compared to newer processors during our review, and this might affect performance longevity.Additionally, its charging speed leaves much to be desired. Limited to 34W wired charging, it lags behind competitors like the OnePlus 13, which offers super-fast charging. With no charger included in the box, users will need to purchase a compatible one separately.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also Read |  Hyderabad man gets WhatsApp message about PM Kisan scheme, loses Rs 1.9 lakh after clicking on the fake linkAlso Read |  Xiaomi Pad 7 review: Lightweight and powerfulAlso Read |  OnePlus 13R review in 5 points: Flagship-killer for 2025

This phone packs a serious punch and has all the ingredients to compete as the best performance-focused device in the sub-Rs 30,000 price segment. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chip, the X7 Pro also features a massive 6,550mAh battery with support for 90W fast charging. It is the first phone in India to ship with HyperOS 2.0 software out of the box. With the Poco X7 Pro now on sale in India, the main question is — is it worth your hard-earned cash? In this article, we outline the top 4 reasons to consider the Poco X7 Pro and 1 reason to think twice.Poco X7 Pro 5G: 4 Reasons to Buy Good design and a vibrant display The Poco X7 Pro takes a practical approach to design, and that’s not a bad thing. As noted in our quick review, while the standard X7 features a curvier profile with a curved display — a design trait typically reserved for pricier devices — the X7 Pro opts for a boxier profile that feels more refined in hand. The Poco Yellow colour variant with its two-tone yellow finish is a standout. Polarising as it may be, it’s sure to grab attention. Despite packing a large battery, the X7 Pro is relatively slim and lightweight compared to other devices in its segment.  The 6.67-inch flat AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate is equally impressive. With slim bezels, support for HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, and vibrant colours, the viewing experience is top-notch. The peak brightness of 3,200 nits ensures excellent legibility, even outdoors. MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra is a powerhouse At its core, the Poco X7 Pro runs on the MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset, delivering exceptional performance for its price. Like its predecessor, the Poco X6 Pro, the X7 Pro includes LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage, components typically found in flagship devices. The Poco X6 Pro set a benchmark as the best gaming phone in its price bracket last year. The X7 Pro looks ready to take that title, and we hope this chipset becomes more common in mid-range devices. If your budget is around Rs 24,000, it’s worth stretching a bit further for the X7 Pro, as its performance justifies the extra spending. Massive Battery and Fast Charging The Poco X7 Pro features a massive 6,550mAh battery with 90W fast charging support, the largest battery seen on any current-generation smartphone post-2024. Impressively, it maintains a slim 8.3mm thickness, matching the standard X7 despite its larger battery.  The X7 Pro uses a silicon carbon battery with higher density than conventional lithium-ion batteries, offering greater endurance and longevity. For heavy users, this battery setup makes the X7 Pro a standout choice. HyperOS 2.0 atop Android 15 The Poco X7 Pro is the first phone in India to feature HyperOS 2.0 out of the box, running on Android 15. This software upgrade brings smoother animations, enhanced transitions, and better customisation options compared to its predecessor. In contrast, the standard X7 ships with the older HyperOS atop Android 14, which feels like a missed opportunity. By choosing the X7 Pro, you get the latest software experience.Poco X7 Pro 5G: 1 Reason to Skip Cameras Could Be Better The Poco X7 Pro features a dual-camera setup — a 50-megapixel Sony LYT-600 main sensor with OIS and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, alongside a 20-megapixel front camera. While this setup performs well in most conditions, there are occasional inconsistencies in colour reproduction. The selfie camera, in particular, could use some fine-tuning for low-light performance. While the standard Poco X7 includes an additional 2-megapixel macro lens, the Pro's superior hardware and ISP deliver better overall photos. That said, the camera system is not without flaws, and we’ll reserve our final judgment until we’ve conducted more in-depth testing. Overall, the Poco X7 Pro 5G has a lot going for it — a sleek design, vibrant display, powerful chipset, long-lasting battery, and up-to-date software. However, if cameras are your priority, you may want to explore other options in this price range. To find out more, stay tuned for our detailed review.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also read |  Poco X7, Poco X7 Pro quick review: Potential to reshape the mid-range segmentAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?

Here is the full story in 5 pointsChina is reportedly considering selling TikTok's US operations to Elon Musk if the app fails to avoid a potential ban, raising questions about its future in the American market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/is-elon-musk-buying-tiktok-amid-threat-of-us-ban-here-is-the-full-story-in-5-points-2664580-2025-01-14,"As TikTok faces increasing scrutiny from US lawmakers over national security concerns, Chinese officials are reportedly exploring the possibility of selling the app’s US operations to billionaire Elon Musk. Beijing, while preferring the app to remain under ByteDance’s control, is considering backup plans to ensure the platform's future in the US. Here are five key points on the situation: 1. Chinese officials consider Musk as a potential buyer   With TikTok at risk of being banned in the US, Chinese officials are reportedly considering selling its US operations to Elon Musk. According to Bloomberg, discussions have taken place as a contingency plan if TikTok cannot address US lawmakers' concerns about national security. The Chinese government would rather keep the app under ByteDance, but a sale to Musk is seen as a fallback option. 2. Supreme Court to rule on TikTok ban by January 2025

The matter has now reached the US Supreme Court, which is expected to deliver a ruling by January 19, 2025. Justices have hinted they are likely to uphold the legislation, prioritising national security over TikTok’s argument that the ban would violate First Amendment rights related to free speech. If the ruling favours a ban, TikTok could be forced to sell or shut down its US operations. 3. Elon Musk’s X could manage TikTok US operations  One scenario being considered involves Musk’s social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), taking over the management of TikTok’s US operations. Such a move could lead to an integration between the two platforms, helping X attract more advertisers. Moreover, Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, could leverage TikTok’s vast user data to enhance its AI capabilities. However, no formal talks between Musk, ByteDance, or TikTok have been confirmed, and Musk has not publicly commented on the potential sale. 4. Chinese government’s involvement in TikTok sale ByteDance has long denied any influence from the Chinese government in TikTok’s global operations, asserting that the company operates independently. However, Beijing holds a “golden share” in a ByteDance affiliate, which gives it some control over the company's strategy. Additionally, Chinese export regulations prevent the sale of certain technologies, including TikTok’s prized recommendation algorithm. This means any potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, further complicating the process. 5. TikTok US operations valued at up to $50 billion  Analysts estimate that TikTok’s US operations are worth between $40 billion and $50 billion. Any sale would be highly complex, involving stakeholders in both the US and China. ByteDance has raised concerns about the difficulty of spinning off its US business, describing the process as “extraordinarily difficult” during its Supreme Court arguments. Some reports have also floated the possibility of migrating TikTok’s US users to a similar app under a different brand, although the effectiveness of this approach remains uncertain. As TikTok’s fate in the US remains uncertain, rival platforms like Meta’s Instagram and Google’s YouTube are ramping up their short-video offerings in a bid to capture TikTok’s user base should the platform face a ban.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentals

caf8e2d2-0eb1-476f-916e-f8306e72025c,"Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh review: Compact and multi-device charging  DailyObject recently launched the new Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh. We have tested it with our iPhone 16 Plus for 10 days. Here is India Today Tech's detailed review of the power bank. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/loop-qi2-certified-magsafe-compatible-power-bank-10000-mah-review-compact-and-multi-device-charging-2664649-2025-01-14,"I travel a lot, and my job requires me to carry multiple gadgets and electronic devices. That's why I never leave the house without a power bank — it's an absolute essential. I am also knee deep into the Apple ecosystem, so I am never charging just one device –– I have to track the charge on my iPhone, AirPods and my Apple Watch.  Of course, when given the choice, I would always pick a wired wall charger to fuel up my gadgets, because it’s definitely quicker. But the hassle of carrying all the wires when you are travelling is a bit much sometimes. So, when DailyObjects reached out about their Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible Power Bank, I jumped on the opportunity to review it. I have replaced my wired charger with the power back since the past 10 days to test it, and I must say I am impressed. â€è â€è There are a lot of things that I like about the device, but let me start with talking about the basic specifications of the power bank. The Loop power bank comes in three options –– 5,000mAh, 10,000mAh and 20,000mAh capacity. I reviewed the one with a 10,000 mAh battery. It is priced at Rs 5,999. The charger is Qi2-certified, which means it can allow your MagSafe iPhones to charge at up to 15W charging speeds, which is faster than the regular wireless chargers. â€è â€è In terms of design, it has a tiny LED display at the back, which shows the leftover charge in the powerbank. It also sports a USB-C port with 20W charging support. It also supports two-way charging for devices like iPads or other phones that do not support wireless charging. The 10,000 mAh version also includes a retractable kickstand that lets you keep your iPhone upright while it's magnetically attached to the charger, so that your power bank also doubles as an iPhone stand. â€è â€èThe design is cool and compact, but it’s not perfect â€è â€è The MagSafe power bank is made of an aerospace-grade aluminum body. The unit I received sports titanium colour. There is also a black variant. â€è â€èIt is interesting to see that the power bank follows a bunch of design cues from Apple’s own aesthetics to create a bit of design familiarity, I suppose. Not only does it come in the desert titanium-like colour option, it also features the loop pattern that you see on the retail boxes of iPads.â€è â€è
 


 Talking about portability and in-hand feel, the power bank is compact and fits easily in one palm. It has some weight for sure, which is understandable given the 10,000mAh battery squeezed in that tiny body. The metallic finish gives it a premium touch.â€è â€è Dropping a power bank is never ideal, but if you're as clumsy as I am, it happens sometimes. If you do drop it, the edges will likely get dented. Thankfully, the included pouch offers some extra protection to keep it safer.â€è â€è Besides being compact, the design is also functional. It’s multipurpose and can charge multiple devices at once — more on that in a bit. The 10,000 mAh version comes with a stand, allowing you to use it as a phone stand. So, you can either use it while watching something on your iPhone or enjoy the StandBy mode on your iPhone while the device firmly sticks to the power bank. Additionally, along with the MagSafe ring, the charger on the front also includes a slot to charge your Apple Watch.â€è â€è Here’s the thing: on paper, the device looks fantastic. However, it has minor issues that can be quite irritating in practice. For instance, if you’re using a standard iPhone or an iPhone Pro, you can place it on the charger while also using the watch charging space simultaneously. But if you have the iPhone Plus variant — like my iPhone 16 Plus — there isn’t enough space to charge your Apple Watch wirelessly at the same time.â€è â€è
 


 Also, while the Apple Watch is wirelessly charging on the power bank, if you happen to use the Loop band, placing it on the charging slot is a bit tricky. You might need to figure out how to position it properly or even remove one side of the strap to properly place it on the charger.â€è advertisementCan become your travel essential â€è â€èAs far as performance is concerned, the Loop charger does what it promises well. The power bank charges my iPhone 16 Plus –– which has a bigger battery compared to the vanilla iPhone 16 — from 0 to 100 per cent within an hour, which is impressive. Even the AirPods and Apple Watch charged fairly quickly.â€è â€è
 


Since the charger is MagSafe, it works best with iPhones, AirPods, Apple Watches, and, of course, iPads. However, it also supports wireless charging for other devices like the Pixel 9 and other supported devices, which is quite convenient. Although the box does not include a Type-C cable, I ended up carrying one whenever I needed to use the power bank with a cable.â€è â€èadvertisementThe LED screen also comes in handy to show the remaining power available in the power bank.â€è â€èAll in all, as far as the charging capabilities are concerned, the Loop power bank does its job pretty well and quickly, keeping everything sorted for travel.â€è â€è
 


Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10000 mAh review: Should you buy it? â€è â€èIf you're looking for a wireless power bank with MagSafe, the Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh is definitely worth considering. It can charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods –– though not your MacBook. It also supports other wireless charging-compatible devices, and for those that don’t, simply keep a cord handy, and it will charge them too.â€è â€èAt Rs 6,000, the pricing isn’t exactly cheap, but after using the power bank, I can say it justifies the price tag. The power bank supports multiple charging options, a compact design, wired charging support, and a convenient in-built stand. It has some design limitations, but they are manageable issues. Overall, the charger performs efficiently and it is worth the money.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/moto-razr-60-ultra-may-soon-launch-in-india-could-feature-upcoming-snapdragon-8s-elite-chip-2664630-2025-01-14,"Motorola is highly likely to launch its next-generation foldable smartphone, the Moto Razr 60 Ultra, soon in India. According to a report by 91Mobiles, the upcoming Moto Razr 60 Ultra has been spotted on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) website, hinting at its imminent debut. The new foldable flagship from Motorola has reportedly been listed with the model number XT2551 and the codename ""Orion,"".  The name in the listing has been noted to be consistent with Motorola's naming scheme for its devices. For example, the Razr 50 Ultra, which launched in July 2024, was listed under the model number XT2451. While the listing suggests that the device might arrive in India soon, if Motorola follows the same timeline as its predecessor, the Razr 60 Ultra could be available in the Indian market by mid-2025. As for the new upgrades, an earlier report by 91Mobiles suggested that the new flagship is likely to arrive with the Snapdragon 8s Elite chipset, a processor yet to make its global debut. It is reported that the Razr 60 Ultra could be the first smartphone on the market to feature Qualcomm's latest chipset. The next-gen chipset is also expected to offer performance capabilities similar to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, with upgrades in efficiency and power. If this chipset is indeed confirmed, the Razr 60 Ultra could be among the first devices to include it, promising robust performance for multitasking, gaming, and camera functionality. Paired with the chipset, the Razr 60 Ultra is said to include LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage. These would represent significant upgrades for the upcoming flagship compared to its predecessor, the Razr 50 Ultra. As for other specifications, reports indicate that we can expect significant updates. The Razr 50 Ultra featured a 6.9-inch FHD+ LTPO pOLED inner display with a 165Hz refresh rate. The Razr 60 Ultra is expected to retain a similarly high-quality panel for detailed visuals and smooth scrolling. Additionally, the foldable design of the flagship could see some refinements, potentially resulting in a thinner and more ergonomic device. In the camera department, the Razr 50 Ultra came with a dual-camera setup comprising a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x zoom. While specific details about the Razr 60 Ultra’s camera system remain unknown, Motorola is likely to include enhanced sensors for improved photography and videography. Battery life is another area where the Razr 60 Ultra could improve. The Razr 50 Ultra features a 4,000mAh battery with 45W fast charging. Speculations suggest that the new model might include a larger battery and faster charging capabilities to meet user needs.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Also Read |  Pixel 9 gets Rs 12,000 discount: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skipAlso Read |  Hyderabad man gets WhatsApp message about PM Kisan scheme, loses Rs 1.9 lakh after clicking on the fake linkAlso Read |  Xiaomi Pad 7 review: Lightweight and powerful

Although the OnePlus 13R -- priced much lower -- brings impressive performance to the table, the OnePlus 13 offers a lot more which justifies its higher price tag. If you find it difficult to choose between the two, this article will break down the key differences and help you decide which OnePlus device best fits your needs. -OnePlus 13R price starts at Rs 42,999  
-OnePlus 13 price is set at Rs 69,999OnePlus 13 vs OnePlus 13R: Which one should you buy? If budget constraints are a primary factor for you, then the OnePlus 13R is an excellent choice. However, if you are willing to stretch your budget for the best possible experience, the flagship OnePlus 13 is the smarter option. Why? It’s not just about the price; performance, build quality, and additional features make a big difference in the overall experience.OnePlus 13 vs OnePlus 13R: A big gap in performance Let’s start with performance. While the OnePlus 13R comes equipped with an earlier-generation flagship chipset, the OnePlus 13 is powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. The new chip offers faster, smoother performance, especially for power users who demand top-tier efficiency from their smartphones. 
 


The benchmark numbers clearly show the big performance gap between the two phones. In our Antutu tests, the OnePlus 13 achieved a staggering 1.1 million in GPU score, whereas the 13R recorded a 7.9 lakh score -- commendable but clearly outpaced. Similarly, in CPU performance, the OnePlus 13 hit 2.5 million, while the 13R scored 1.7 million. On Geekbench, the OnePlus 13 scored over 9,000 in the multi-core test compared to the OnePlus 13R's 6,572. In real-world usage, both phones perform well, but the OnePlus 13 is the go-to choice for users who demand peak performance, especially for gaming and intensive multitasking. Having said that, for its price segment, the OnePlus 13R still competes very strongly with rivals like the iQOO 12 and Oppo Reno 13 Pro.Also, the OnePlus 13 offers 100W fast charging, as opposed to the 80W support on the 13R. Though this difference in charging speed may not be a deal breaker for many, those who prioritise the fastest performance in every aspect will appreciate it.OnePlus 13 vs OnePlus 13R: Other key differences The benchmark numbers clearly show the big performance gap between the two phones.

Though this difference in charging speed may not be a deal breaker for many, those who prioritise the fastest performance in every aspect will appreciate it.OnePlus 13 vs OnePlus 13R: Other key differences Beyond performance, there are several features that differentiate the OnePlus 13 from its more affordable sibling. First, the OnePlus 13 carries a higher IP rating (IP68/IP69), offering better dust and water resistance than the OnePlus 13R (IP65). In addition, the flagship model comes with wireless charging support, a premium feature that the 13R lacks.

The company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that roughly 5 per cent of the company’s workforce will be affected, as Meta aims to accelerate its performance management process. In a memo to employees, Zuckerberg explained that the company would be moving more swiftly to remove low-performing staff, Bloomberg reports. This follows Meta’s earlier decision in 2023 to cut 10,000 jobs in its ""year of efficiency"" drive. ""I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster,"" he said in a note shared with an internal message board.  Zuckerberg mentioned that the company usually addresses underperformance over a year but will now implement more extensive cuts. Despite the layoffs, Meta plans to replace the roles in 2025, positioning itself for future growth and innovation. The focus in the coming year will be on areas like artificial intelligence (AI), smart glasses, and evolving social media platforms, as Zuckerberg described the upcoming year as ""intense."" ""We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,"" he said, ""but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle."" Meta, which had around 72,000 employees as of September, is expected to notify impacted US-based staff on February 10. Employees outside the US market working for Meta will be informed later. The company reportedly aims to achieve 10 per cent ""non-regrettable"" attrition by the end of this performance cycle, continuing a similar trend from the previous year.Microsoft is also firing low-performing employees In a similar move, Microsoft is also reportedly preparing to fire employees, targeting those who underperformed. While the company hasn’t revealed the number of employees to be impacted, a recent report from Business Insider claimed that several departments, including critical divisions, will be affected. Microsoft is following its long-standing practice of restructuring under CEO Satya Nadella, with the latest layoffs being done to focus on maintaining a high-performing workforce.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 14, 2025

While this is the right time to buy the iPhone 16, Apple will unveil the iPhone 17 in September this year. Based on the leaks and rumours, the iPhone 17 series is expected to bring a host of upgrades over its predecessor, the iPhone 16, enhancing both performance and user experience.  One of the most notable changes could be the new A17 Bionic chip, offering superior performance and energy efficiency compared to the A16 chip. This would result in smoother multitasking and better overall speed. Design-wise, the iPhone 17 may feature slimmer bezels and a more refined form factor, possibly along with an improved ProMotion display, offering higher refresh rates or better brightness for an enhanced viewing experience.

 Camera improvements are also anticipated, with enhanced sensors, better low-light performance, and new computational photography features. The iPhone 17 might also introduce improvements to zoom capabilities and a more advanced telephoto lens.  Battery life could see improvements as well, thanks to better power optimisation from the A17 chip and potentially a larger battery. Another major upgrade could be the transition to a USB-C port for faster charging and data transfer, aligning with industry trends. Furthermore, the iPhone 17 could introduce new features such as under-display Face ID or enhanced augmented reality capabilities, setting the stage for a more immersive and futuristic experience. Overall, the iPhone 17 is likely to offer incremental but significant improvements over the iPhone 16. Rumours suggest it will feature full integration with Apple Intelligence updates, an enhanced camera system, a redesigned look, and an entirely new model. However, purchasing the iPhone 16 now still comes with its perks, as Apple’s trade-in program next year is likely to offer great deals for upgrading. For those seeking an immediate upgrade, the iPhone 16 series already delivers a cutting-edge experience with iOS 18 and access to the forthcoming Apple Intelligence features.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also read |  Moto Razr 60 Ultra may soon launch in India, could feature upcoming Snapdragon 8s Elite chipAlso read |  Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max available at a discount and this is the right time to buy the phone: Here is whyAlso read |  Pixel 9 gets Rs 12,000 discount: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

These changes include new features designed to make messaging more customisable and efficient, along with updates to its design. One of the standout features is the addition of camera effects for photos and videos shared in chats. Users can now choose from 30 different filters, backgrounds, and visual effects to enhance their images before sending them. This expands on the tools WhatsApp rolled out for video calls last year, offering more creative options directly within messaging. Another new feature that’s bound to get users talking is selfie stickers. As the name suggests, you can now turn your selfies into stickers to share in your chats. All you need to do is tap the create sticker icon > use the camera to snap a selfie, and you have a personalised sticker. Currently, this feature is available on Android, with iOS users expected to get it soon. WhatsApp is also making it easier to share sticker packs. If you come across a sticker pack that you think a friend would enjoy, you can now share it directly in your chats. It’s a small but handy addition that will definitely appeal to sticker lovers who enjoy swapping and sharing their collections. The update also brings a small but useful improvement to message reactions. Users can now double-tap on a message to react, a faster alternative to the previous method of holding down on the message to select a reaction. A scrolling pop-out menu featuring the user’s most-used emojis has also been introduced, allowing for quicker access to frequently used reactions. While the full emoji library is still accessible via the reaction bar’s “+” symbol, the new layout is aimed at streamlining the process. This feature is similar to what platforms like Discord offer, where frequently used reactions are easy to access. It’s worth noting that while Meta’s Messenger app still offers a fixed set of emojis for reactions, this update on WhatsApp adds an extra layer of personalisation that many users will appreciate.  WhatsApp says these changes are just the start of what’s to come in 2025. The company remains focused on improving the messaging experience while continuing to prioritise privacy and security for its users worldwide.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

It's like having a personal assistant to handle daily updates, simple tasks, and even recurring reminders — all managed right in the app.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-gets-a-big-update-can-now-set-reminders-and-perform-some-actions-2664949-2025-01-15,"OpenAI is adding something new to ChatGPT that could make it feel more like a personal assistant. The new feature, called Tasks — currently in beta — lets users set up reminders and schedule actions for the future. Starting today, it’s available for those subscribed to the Plus, Team, or Pro plans. The idea is pretty simple — instead of just answering your questions or helping you in the moment, ChatGPT can now take care of things you want to be done later. For example, you can ask it to send you a daily weather update at 7 AM, remind you about an important deadline, or even share a silly joke before bedtime to lighten the mood. You can set up one-time tasks or make them recur if it’s something you need regularly. To use it, you’ll need to select the 4o with scheduled tasks option in the ChatGPT menu. From there, just type what you want and when you need it done. ChatGPT can even suggest tasks based on what you’ve been chatting about, though you’ll have to confirm them first. While handy, some people might find these suggestions a bit unnecessary or even annoying if they don’t like too much AI interference. You can keep track of everything in two ways — directly in your chat threads or through a new Tasks section, which you’ll find in the profile menu if you’re using ChatGPT on the web. It’s easy to tweak or cancel tasks if your plans change. When a task is done, you’ll get notified on the web, desktop, or mobile. There’s a limit of 10 active tasks at a time, so it doesn’t get too messy. This update feels like a bit of a shift for ChatGPT. Until now, it’s only been used for conversations and answering questions on the spot. But with Tasks, it’s stepping into the role of a helper you can count on for things down the line. Of course, there are still some questions about how reliable it’ll be. Will it always deliver reminders or updates on time? And what happens if it messes up something time-sensitive? Since the feature is still in beta, OpenAI is likely to use this period to work out any issues before a wider release. Looking ahead, OpenAI seems to have even bigger plans. Reports suggest they’re working on something called Operator, which could let ChatGPT control your computer on its own. Another tool, codenamed Caterpillar, might allow ChatGPT to look up specific information, solve problems, or manage documents for you. For now, though, Tasks is here for paying users to try out. It’s a handy new feature, but since it’s still being tested, it’s probably best not to rely on it for anything too critical just yet. At the moment, OpenAI hasn’t said whether this feature will be available to free users. For now, it’s part of the paid plans, which cost $20 (roughly Rs 1,730) to $200 (roughly Rs 17,300) a month.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

If TikTok shuts off for all US users, the outcome would be different from that mandated by the law. The law would mandate a ban only on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores while existing users could still continue using the app for some time. Under TikTok's plan, people attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. TikTok also plans to give users the option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information with them, the report said. TikTok and its Chinese parent ByteDance didn't immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments. President Joe Biden had in April last year signed a law requiring Bytedance to sell its US assets by January 19, 2025 or face a nationwide ban. The companies have sought, at the very least, a delay in implementation of the law, which they say violates the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgement of free speech. TikTok said in a court filing last month that it estimates one-third of the 170 million Americans using its app would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasts a month.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also read |  Is Elon Musk buying TikTok amid threat of US ban?

Here is the full story in 5 points.

According to the SEC, Musk did not report surpassing a 5 percent ownership of Twitter’s stock in March 2022 within the mandated 10-day period.  The SEC stated that because Musk failed to timely disclose his beneficial ownership, ""he was able to make these purchases from the unsuspecting public at artificially low prices, which did not yet reflect the undisclosed material information of Musk’s beneficial ownership of more than five percent of Twitter common stock and investment purpose.” However, Musk's lawyer has a different story to tell. Here is the full story in 5 points. advertisementElon Musk sued for late disclosure of Twitter ownership: Story in 5 points- The billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022. But before he could fully acquire the social media platform, he started accumulating Twitter shares in early 2022. Doing so, Musk had exceeded 5 per cent ownership by March of that year. At this point, he was required by law to disclose his ownership, but he failed to do so.  - The billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022. But before he could fully acquire the social media platform, he started accumulating Twitter shares in early 2022. Doing so, Musk had exceeded 5 per cent ownership by March of that year. At this point, he was required by law to disclose his ownership, but he failed to do so.  - As he did not disclose his stakes, Musk was able to underpay “by at least $150 million” for shares he bought. Musk’s failure to disclose his beneficial ownership in a timely manner allowed him to purchase shares from the public at artificially low prices. These prices did not account for the material information about Musk’s ownership of more than five percent of Twitter’s common stock or his investment intentions, which had not yet been revealed, the securities regulator said. Musk eventually purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X. - Musk delayed disclosing his acquisition until April 4, 11 days past the required reporting deadline. In a complaint filed in federal court in Washington, DC, the SEC accused Musk of violating federal securities laws by failing to disclose his initial purchase of 5 per cent of Twitter's common shares within the mandated timeframe. - Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, in an email called the SEC lawsuit the culmination of the regulator's ""multi-year campaign of harassment"" against his client. ""Today's action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot bring an actual case,"" he said. ""Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone sees this sham for what it is."" He added that the lawsuit addresses a mere ""alleged administrative failure to file a single form--an offense that, even if proven, carries a nominal penalty."" - The SEC has been investigating the Tesla and SpaceX CEO regarding his acquisition of the social media platform. In December, Musk revealed on social media that the agency had requested he pay an unspecified fine to resolve charges related to his purchase of Twitter shares, as noted in a letter from his attorney, Spiro. Additionally, last year, Musk faced issues with the commission for not appearing to testify during the investigation.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Tune InAlso read |  Meta to fire around 3,600 employees, Mark Zuckerberg says he will sack low performersAlso read |  Is Elon Musk buying TikTok amid threat of US ban?

They are telling phone users that their numbers would be discontinued unless they take an immediate action and using the ruse to extort money. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/scammers-now-calling-as-trai-officials-threatening-users-with-account-and-number-suspension-to-extort-money-2665008-2025-01-15,"“Dear user, this call is from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to inform you that your mobile number is being suspended as illegal activity has been registered from your mobile number. To know more details, press 9...”  These were the words from a call I received earlier from the number +977-422478388. The number is obviously not from India. It is from Nepal. The tone of the caller was similar to government alert messages, like those during COVID-19 or the recent awareness calls about digital arrest scams. However, this call was not from the official TRAI. In fact, it was a scam call, one that many users have been receiving recently. In fact, over the past few months, such scam calls have caused significant financial losses to victims. For instance, in a TOI reported case from August 2024, a man in Hyderabad lost approximately Rs 11 lakh after receiving a call from someone posing as a TRAI official. In another case, a 25-year-old IIT-Bombay graduate lost Rs 7 lakh to a similar scam. But how are individuals losing money? Just receiving a call shouldn’t put anyone at risk, right? Yes, that’s true. However, the tone and content of these calls are designed to mimic official government communications, causing the receiver to believe their authenticity and follow the instructions. For example, the call I received asked me to press 9 for more details and follow instructions if I wanted to avoid my number getting deactivated. According to reports, when individuals respond to these calls, they are connected to scammers posing as CBI officers or other officials. Once you have pressed “9” and have connected to another “official” the entire scam starts unfolding. The receiver is then put into a ""digital arrest."" In this so-called digital arrest, scammers instruct targeted individuals to stay on video calls and refrain from sharing anything with family or friends. Victims are then coerced into sharing sensitive information such as ID proofs and bank details, and in some cases, they are harassed into transferring money under the pretext of being involved in money laundering.  In order to threaten the victim, the scammers are even involving fake police, judges, and even ""Supreme Court inspectors"". However, as victims send money or share sensitive information like bank details, to clear their name from all the said charges against them, the fraudsters empty bank accounts and block victims from any further communications. How to stay safe  To protect yourself, it is highly advisable not to fall for such calls. Remember, organisations like TRAI or the police don’t ask for personal or financial information over the phone. Additionally, be aware of the term Digital Arrest as there is no such lawful term and if anyone threatens you with this, disconnect the call — it’s a scam. If you suspect the call might be legitimate, double-check the authenticity of the caller, especially if they are asking for sensitive information or urgent financial transactions. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into taking quick decisions.  Above all, never share your personal, banking, or other sensitive information with unknown callers. If you suspect you are being scammed, contact your local police or cybercrime unit immediately. Reporting such incidents can help protect you and others from falling victim to similar schemes.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Also Read |  Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh review: Compact and multi-device chargingAlso Read |  Moto Razr 60 Ultra may soon launch in India, could feature upcoming Snapdragon 8s Elite chipAlso Read |  Pixel 9 gets Rs 12,000 discount: 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip

Their presence at the ceremony places them among prominent political and business figures, indicating the importance of their connections to the incoming administration. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has expressed excitement over his prominent spot at the event, stating on social media platform X that he felt “honoured” to be part of the proceedings. Musk has been an open supporter of Trump, contributing over a quarter-billion dollars to help with his campaign and aligning closely with the president-elect's policies. He is also co-leading a new advisory body, the Department of Government Efficiency, which will likely see Musk play a major role in shaping the new administration's approach to business and governance. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, is also actively engaging with the Trump administration after years of a strained relationship. Meta contributed $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, and Zuckerberg is co-hosting a reception with Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson. This change in stance is big, as Zuckerberg had previously banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 Capitol riots in 2021. However, he has since revamped Meta’s lobbying and content moderation policies to better align with the incoming Republican government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will also attend the inauguration, despite past tensions between Trump and his Washington Post, which refrained from endorsing a candidate during the 2024 election. Amazon contributed $1 million to the inaugural fund as well, highlighting Bezos' desire to build rapport with the new administration, given his company's major federal contracts through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. These three tech moguls—Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos—have reportedly amassed vast fortunes and global influence through their respective companies, with a combined net worth of $885 billion. Their attendance at Trump’s inauguration hints at a strategic alignment with the incoming administration, as each of their businesses stands to benefit or face challenges depending on how US policies around tech, trade, and regulation evolve during Trump’s second term. With Meta facing an antitrust case, Amazon relying on federal contracts, and SpaceX’s space ambitions closely tied to government projects, the involvement of these business leaders in Trump’s inauguration shows the importance of their relationships with political leaders in keeping up with their companies’ growth.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

An internal memo has outlined how the layoffs would work.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-layoffs-employees-with-these-ratings-will-be-fired-internal-memo-reveals-2665125-2025-01-15,"Meta is preparing to cut jobs in the coming weeks, focusing on employees with lower performance ratings. An internal memo from Hillary Champion, Meta’s Director of People Development Growth Programs, outlined how the layoffs would work, reconfirming the company's intent to push out underperformers more swiftly. The memo, obtained by Business Insider, details the company's goal to reach 10 per cent non-regrettable attrition by the end of this performance cycle. Non-regrettable attrition refers to employees Meta believes the company can afford to lose. The memo reveals that Meta is targeting an additional 5 per cent reduction in staff this year, adding to the 5 percent cuts made last year. Employees whose performance ratings fall under ""Met Some"" or ""Did Not Meet"" expectations will be automatically placed on the list for termination.  ""Anyone who receives a rating of 'Met Some' or 'Did Not Meet' will be automatically added to the performance termination list,"" the memo stated. Those in the ""Met Most"" category may also be at risk, depending on whether Meta reaches its overall attrition target. Champion asserted that Meta's focus is on ensuring the strongest talent remains as the company continues its ambitious plans in areas like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and social media.  ""In the calibration process, your Director and VP will review those with a ""Met Most"" rating to determine who will be terminated to meet the required 10 per cent target. The number of people in the ""Met Most"" category to be terminated will vary, depending on your org's 2024 non-regrettable attrition rate and how many people are rated ""Met Some"" or ""Did Not Meet,"" the memo stated. The layoffs are part of a broader strategy aimed at restructuring Meta’s workforce and driving operational efficiency. Recent moves also include scaling back on diversity and inclusion initiatives, and halting its third-party fact-checking program. Meta plans to refill these roles in 2025, once its performance-driven workforce realignment is complete. ""We have really ambitious goals, so we need to manage our workforce in a way that ensures we have the strongest talent working here and can move faster in managing out low performers so that we can bring new people in. As a result, we are exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers. Those who are terminated for performance will receive generous severance packages, in line with previous cuts,"" Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-rumoured-to-launch-in-may-everything-else-we-know-about-the-upcoming-phone-2665120-2025-01-15,"Samsung is ready to unveil the next-gen Galaxy S25 series this month. The company has confirmed that the Galaxy Unpacked event will take place on January 22, 2025. According to the trends, the event is scheduled to reveal the Galaxy S25 series, and this time, the teaser revealed it will introduce 4 models: Galaxy S25, S25+, S25 Ultra, and a new entry, S25 Slim. While the traditional 3 models are expected to launch in January, the Slim model is rumoured to take its sweet time to enter the market. In a latest leak, the Galaxy S25 Slim is anticipated to be released later in May.  According to tipster Setsuna Digital, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to launch in May this year, suggesting that next week’s Galaxy Unpacked event will likely focus on the debut of the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. However, there remains a chance that Samsung might tease the S25 Slim during the event.
 


 This wouldn’t be unprecedented, as the brand previewed the Galaxy Ring alongside the S24 series last year, even though the smart ring wasn’t available for purchase until June. Adding weight to this speculation, the Galaxy Unpacked launch invite features the outline of four phones. It’s worth noting, however, that it’s unclear if the tipster’s timeline applies exclusively to China or includes the global market.Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim: What to expect As the name suggests, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is sleek and is likely to be the slimmest smartphone in the Samsung-verse. To put that into perspective, it’s significantly thinner than the 7.6mm Galaxy S24. Besides its design, one of the standout features of the S25 Slim is its 4,700 to 5,000mAh battery, an impressive feat for a device this thin. Reports suggest Samsung might be leveraging advanced silicon-carbon anode battery technology, similar to what we've seen in the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro. This would ensure long-lasting performance without compromising the phone’s slim design. Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to pack the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. The Galaxy S25 Slim is tipped to feature a 6.66-inch display, placing it in the same league as the Galaxy S24+ in terms of screen size. On the photography front, the device could sport a 200-megapixel HP5 primary camera, accompanied by a 50-megapixel ultrawide lens, and a 50-megapixel 3.5x telephoto snapper. It is noteworthy that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim will be in direct competition with the upcoming iPhone 17. Both smartphones are to pay special importance to the design. It will be interesting to see how both these phones will play against each other and which will win the battle.

There are a number of devices coming from the company, including the iPhone 17, the iPad Air with M4, the iPhone SE4, and most notably the MacBook Air M4. And if we are lucky, we might even get the new Apple TV. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/apple-may-launch-20-new-devices-this-year-iphone-17-macbook-air-m4-ipad-11-and-more-in-pipeline-2665205-2025-01-15,"New Year, new Apple devices. The rumour mill is churning, Mark Gurman over at Bloomberg is doing his prediction, and the list of devices that Apple is likely to launch in 2025 is growing bigger. While the regular iPhone, Mac, and iPad refreshes are anticipated, several reports by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Jeff Pu, suggest that the Cupertino giant could launch over 20 new devices.  These include three new home products, six highly anticipated next-generation devices, and a series of fresh launches, including five iPhone models. Let’s take a detailed look at everything Apple is expected to bring in 2025.Apple launches expected in March-April 2025 MacBook Air M4: The upcoming M4 MacBook Air is rumoured to be Apple's first product launch of 2025, bringing several significant upgrades. The new-gen MacBook Air is likely to bring better battery life thanks to the M4 chip's efficiency, a substantial RAM boost with 16GB as standard, expanded external display support allowing two displays simultaneously, and an improved 12 megapixel Center Stage camera with features like Desk View for enhanced video conferencing. It is expected that the design will remain the same. But that shouldn’t bother users because the Air design is already quite good. Instead, the Apple fans should look forward to the goodness of the M4 chipset, which we tested a few months ago in the new MacBook Pro 14 and found that is a blazing fast — almost magically fast — processor.  iPhone SE 4: The next iPhone SE is also expected to launch in early 2025, likely in March. This budget-friendly device is rumoured to feature significant upgrades over its predecessor, including an edge-to-edge OLED display with Face ID, the powerful A18 chip, 8GB of RAM so that it can support Apple Intelligence, a 48MP camera, USB-C connectivity, and Apple's first in-house 5G modem. While pricing details are not yet confirmed, it's expected to be more affordable than the flagship iPhone 16 models. iPad 11: This year Apple is also expected to finally refresh its entry-level iPad this spring, that is around March or April. The iPad 11 will likely feature Apple Intelligence, potentially with the A18 chip, improved connectivity with Wi-Fi 6E/7 and Bluetooth 5.3, and possibly 5G support. A new, more traditional Magic Keyboard is also rumoured to be in plans. New iPad Air: The next-gen iPad Air is also expected to arrive in early 2025. According to Gurman, Apple may launch a new iPad Air with ""internal improvements"" as early as spring 2025. The new iPad Air is likely to arrive with a new Magic Keyboard that has a function row. The tablet may potentially sport a 90Hz display, and almost certainly an M3 chip upgrade. Additionally, the new iPad Air could include Wi-Fi 7 support, a better mic array, and potentially Apple's own 5G modems.  HomePad: According to Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to launch a new smart home display or HomePad. He revealed that Apple is developing a new smart home device codenamed J490, which is expected to launch in March. This wall-mounted display, roughly the size of two iPhones, will work as a central hub for home control, integrating Apple apps, Apple Intelligence, and HomeKit. It will feature a camera, speakers, and a rechargeable battery. Apple launches expected between May-June 2025 AirTag 2: Following the early launches, Apple is expected to bring its next-gen AirTag 2, featuring an upgraded Ultra Wideband chip. This upgrade would significantly improve the range of Precision Finding, which might make locating misplaced items much easier and more accurate.  M4 Mac Studio: Apple is also expected to launch a new Mac Studio in the first half of 2025, likely featuring M4 Max and M4 Ultra chips for offering increased performance. The new model will almost certainly include faster Thunderbolt 5 ports for improved connectivity and may also support Wi-Fi 7 for significantly faster wireless speeds. This updated Mac Studio is anticipated to become the most powerful desktop Mac in Apple's lineup.advertisementApple launches expected between September-October 2025iPhone 17: The new Apple flagship phone is likely to arrive in September 2025. The flagship is expected to maintain the current Dynamic Island design while featuring a refined aluminium chassis and higher refresh rate display like the Pro variants. It is also likely to be powered by Apple’s new A19 chip, offering improved performance and efficiency. It is rumoured that Apple would be putting upgrades into the camera system, including a 24 megapixel front camera, and that the phone would use in-house modem for 5G connectivity.iPhone 17 Air: There are rumours that Apple would be ditching the Plus variant of the iPhone for a more slimmer variant, likely the iPhone 17 Air. The new variant is said to be in line with Apple naming system for iPads and MacBooks which include an Air model. This model is expected to be significantly thinner than current iPhones, likely featuring an aluminium or titanium chassis with a 6.55 display. The iPhone 17 Air is also expected to feature only a single rear camera, possibly the same 48 megapixel camera that we have in current iPhones.advertisementiPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max: The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max likely to get several big upgrades in 2025. These include a 24 megapixel front-facing camera, the powerful A19 Pro chip, and an increase in RAM to 12GB. Apple is also expected to improve the connectivity with Apple's in-house Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip. The devices may come with redesigned frame and build materials and a larger rectangular camera bump. The iPhone 17 Pro Max may feature a narrower Dynamic Island. Apple Watch Ultra 3: Year 2025 is when we may see the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra 3. The new Ultra 3 is expected to bring new features, including High blood pressure detection feature, independent satellite messaging, 5G cellular connectivity offering faster speeds and improved connectivity.Apple Watch Series 11: The next-gen Watch 11 is also expected to feature high blood pressure detection. Although on design front, there are unlikely to be any changes. Additionally, there are rumours and hints that Apple is developing a new AI coaching service and a revamped health app, although their release timing is not yet confirmed. And some more gadgetsThe Watch Ultra and regular Apple Watch are also likely to be joined by the Apple Watch SE 3 in 2025. This would be a cheaper and more affordable smartwatch, although it is likely to have revamped internals, including better chipset. advertisementTwo more products that are set to arrive in 2025 are the AirPods Pro 3 and the HomePod mini 2. The new AirPods Pro 3 is expected to arrive with a new H3 chip, redesigned form factor, and improved active noise cancellation. The HomePod mini 2 is likely to have Apple’s own in-house Wi-Fi chip along with internal improvements, but the design may look similar to what we see with the HomePod mini currently. What about the regular full-size HomePod? Well, it seems that the original HomePod was just a one-time deal. It is unlikely that we will see anything new on that front in 2025.Then there is the Apple TV. It is possible that Apple TV, which is sort of due for an update, may get a new-gen device this year. If it happens, expect it to have similar design but there could be a more powerful chipset in it, and Apple may even equip it for Apple Intelligence.Finally, two more ProM5 iPad Pro: In 2024 Apple raised the bars with the M4 iPad with fastest processor, OLED screen and thinnest design. For the next-gen iPads, Apple is expected to launch the device by the end of this year with the M5 chip. According to Ming Chi-Kuo, “The iPad Pro equipped with the M5 processor is expected to enter mass production in 2H25.” That is second half of the year, friends. M5 MacBook Pro: According to Mark Gurman, Apple will also launch a new and totally redesigned MacBook Pro in 2026, featuring OLED displays, a thinner design, and the powerful M6 chip built on the 2nm process. However for the 2025, the M5 MacBooks are expected to have some minor improvements with just a powerful processor.

Here are the details.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-might-roll-back-some-whatsapp-features-in-india-after-antitrust-data-sharing-ban-2665178-2025-01-15,"Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, may have to roll back some features in India due to a recent antitrust ruling, according to inputs from Reuters. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has banned WhatsApp from sharing user data with Meta for advertising purposes. This decision is said to impact Meta’s ability to offer personalised ads across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. The CCI’s November ruling reportedly found that Meta had abused its market dominance by forcing WhatsApp users to accept a new privacy policy. This policy expanded the scope of user data sharing, giving Meta an unfair advantage over its competitors. As part of its order, the CCI imposed a $24.5 million fine and instituted a five-year ban on Meta's data-sharing practices in India, the company's largest market with over 500 million WhatsApp users. Meta, however, is actively challenging the directive. In a recent court filing, the company expressed concerns that the ban on data sharing between WhatsApp and Meta would hurt its ability to deliver personalised advertisements. Meta explained that Indian businesses would face difficulties in targeting users effectively on Facebook and Instagram, especially businesses that interact with customers on WhatsApp. The company’s appeal stresses that the data-sharing policy does not expand Meta’s data collection but only allows for more efficient integration of business features. However, the CCI disagreed, stating that WhatsApp’s policy coerced users into accepting terms they did not fully understand, with no option to opt out. The commission now insists that WhatsApp allow users to choose whether they want their data shared with Meta. In its challenge to the ruling, Meta criticised the CCI for lacking the technical understanding needed to assess the impact of the decision. The company argues that the regulator should have consulted with WhatsApp and Meta before making such an impactful ruling. While Meta continues to contest the order, the outcome of its appeal could take several months. In the meantime, the Indian appeals tribunal is expected to hear the company's plea this Thursday.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

b4e5b0c4-e487-4dd8-97ac-cdafa6030aaf,TikTok prepares to shut down app in US unless Supreme Court overturns ban: ReportTikTok plans to shut down its US operations on January 19 unless the Supreme Court overturns a federal ban tied to ByteDance's failure to divest. President-elect Trump may issue an executive order delaying enforcement. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/tiktok-prepares-to-shut-down-app-in-us-unless-supreme-court-overturns-ban-2665484-2025-01-16,"TikTok plans to shut US operations of its social media app used by 170 million Americans on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported President-elect Donald Trump, whose term begins a day after a ban would start, is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of a shutdown for 60 to 90 days. The newspaper did not say how Trump could legally do so. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if Chinese parent ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, except that the law also bars US companies starting Sunday from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it. The Trump transition team did not have an immediate comment. Trump has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a ""political resolution"" of the issue. ""TikTok itself is a fantastic platform,"" Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News on Wednesday. ""We're going to find a way to preserve it but protect people's data."" A White House official told Reuters Wednesday President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the Supreme Court fails to act and added Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. US Senator Ed Markey on Wednesday sought unanimous consent to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok by 270 days but Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked the proposal. If it is banned, TikTok plans that users attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public. ""We go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,"" TikTok lawyer Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court last week. The company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, the sources said. The US Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Shutting down TikTok in the US could make it unavailable for users in many other countries, the company said in a court filing last month, because hundreds of service providers in the US help make the platform available to TikTok users around the world - and could no longer do so starting Sunday. TikTok said in the court filing an order was needed to ""avoid interruption of services for tens of millions of TikTok users outside the United States."" TikTok had said that the prohibitions would eventually make the app unusable, noting in the filing that ""data centers would almost certainly conclude that they can no longer store"" TikTok code, content, or data. The sources said the shutdown aims to protect TikTok service providers from legal liability and make it easier to resume operations if President-elect Donald Trump opted to roll back any ban. Shutting down such services does not require longer planning, one of the sources said, noting that most operations have been continuing as usual as of this week. If the ban gets reversed later, TikTok would be able to restore service for US users in a relatively short time, sources said. TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. US tech publication The Information first reported the news late on Tuesday. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States. President Joe Biden last April signed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its US assets by January 19, or face a nationwide ban. Last week, the Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline. TikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. TikTok said in the court filing last month it estimated one-third of its 170 million American users would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasted a month.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 16, 2025",technology,2025-01-16T09:07:00,8.2,9.8
d5874786-0217-435b-a596-2de2949c88e2,"Elon Musk is hiring for software engineer role, says there is no need for a degreeElon Musk aims to reshape hiring by prioritising skills over degrees, with the larger goal of transforming X into a unified platform that integrates services like payments, messaging, e-commerce, and multimedia.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-is-hiring-for-software-engineer-role-says-there-is-no-need-for-a-degree-2665483-2025-01-16,"Elon Musk is once again challenging traditional norms, this time by rethinking hiring practices and pushing forward his ambitious Everything app. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk made a global call for hardcore software engineers to join him in building what could become one of the most versatile digital platforms ever created. The message was direct, We dont care where you went to school or even whether you went to school or what 'big name' company you worked at. Just show us your code"", he says.    This isnt the first time Musk has questioned the value of formal education in hiring. Over the years, he has consistently prioritised skills and problem-solving ability over degrees. Back in 2014, he made it clear that a university degree wasnt a requirement to work at Tesla. In his view, its not about credentials but about what a person can deliver. He has often spoken about how education systems should focus on nurturing problem-solving abilities instead of relying on memorisation and standardised tests. This perspective is reflected in his hiring practices at Tesla, SpaceX, and now X. Musks stance has its supporters and critics. While some see it as an opportunity to level the playing field for talented individuals from non-traditional backgrounds, others argue that it could be impractical for larger-scale adoption. Still, the approach aligns with Musks broader philosophy of valuing innovation and results over conventional measures of competency. As for the Everything app, Musks vision for X has started to take shape. The idea is to transform X into a single platform that integrates a variety of services like payments, messaging, e-commerce, and multimedia. Think of this concept as Chinas WeChat, a widely used app that combines social networking, shopping, and payments in one place. Musk sees this as a way to move beyond traditional social media and create something much larger  a one-stop global marketplace for ideas, goods, and services. X is already laying the groundwork for this transformation. The platform plans to roll out several features by 2025, including X Money, a payment service, and X TV, a streaming platform for multimedia content. The AI chatbot Grok, launched in late 2024, is also set to receive significant upgrades. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, hinted at these developments in a recent announcement, calling the upcoming changes a way to connect users in ways never thought possible.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Tune InAlso read |  Snapdragon 8 Elite for just Rs 55,000: Is iQOO 13 too good to be true?Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G review: Strong on the fundamentalsAlso read |  OnePlus 13R at Rs 42,999: Top 4 reasons to buy, 1 to skip ",technology,2025-01-16T09:05:00,11.8,2.0

Microsoft says it will no longer support Office apps on Windows 10 devicesMicrosoft is saying it will stop supporting Windows 10 devices starting October 14. Meanwhile, the company is also offering a free upgrade to Windows 11 to users who are still using Windows 10.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/story/still-using-windows-10-microsoft-says-it-will-no-longer-support-office-apps-on-windows-10-devices-2665492-2025-01-16,"Microsoft has announced that it will end support for Microsoft Office apps on Windows 10 devices after the operating system reaches its end of support on October 14, 2025. Users will need to upgrade to Windows 11 to continue using Microsoft 365 apps without potential issues, the tech giant stated on Tuesday. Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11, the company explained.  This announcement also affects standalone Office versions, including Office 2024, Office 2021, Office 2019, and Office 2016, meaning these versions will no longer receive updates or technical support on Windows 10 devices.  While the applications will still function beyond the support cutoff, Microsoft cautioned users about potential performance and reliability problems. We strongly recommend upgrading to Windows 11 to avoid performance and reliability issues over time, the company advised in a separate support document.  Microsoft has been urging users to migrate to Windows 11 since its launch in October 2021, even dubbing 2025 the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh. However, adoption has been slow, with only 35 per cent of Windows users worldwide running Windows 11 as of now, according to Statcounter Global data. Meanwhile, Windows 10 remains the dominant version, powering 62 per cent of all Windows systems globally. Why users are hesitant to upgrade  A key barrier to Windows 11 adoption has been Microsofts stringent hardware requirements, particularly the need for TPM (Trusted Platform Module) 2.0. The feature, which Microsoft claims enhances resistance to tampering and cyberattacks, has been labelled non-negotiable for Windows 11 installations. Many users with older hardware have found the requirement difficult to meet, prompting the creation of workarounds to bypass it.  In light of the challenges, Microsoft has offered some leeway for users unwilling or unable to upgrade. Home users can delay the switch to Windows 11 for an additional year by purchasing Extended Security Updates (ESU) for $30. Certain enterprise and specialised systems, including those using Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) and Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) editions, will continue to receive updates beyond the October 2025 cutoff. What this means for users  Although users can keep using their Windows 10 PCs and Office apps after support ends, they will no longer receive security updates, exposing them to increased risks over time. Microsoft has also reiterated that the free upgrade to Windows 11 remains available, provided users meet the minimum system requirements.  Margaret Farmer, a representative for Microsoft, emphasised this point: You need to confirm that your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the update, she stated. A looming deadline  The clock is ticking for the millions still on Windows 10. While the operating systems popularity has endured, Microsofts move to cut off Office app support adds another incentive for users to transition. For those who rely heavily on Microsoft 365 or other Office products, the decision to upgrade sooner rather than later is becoming increasingly pressing.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  TikTok prepares to shut down app in US unless Supreme Court overturns ban: ReportAlso read |  Elon Musk is hiring for software engineer role, says there is no need for a degreeAlso read |  Meta might roll back some WhatsApp features in India after antitrust data sharing ban",technology,2025-01-16T09:35:00,9.6,6.5

However, the device is expected to measure just 6.4mm in thickness, making it 1.2mm slimmer than the Galaxy S24. According to OnLeaks and Smartprix, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will have a thickness of 8.2mm, meaning the S25 Slim could be nearly 2mm thinner than Samsung's flagship model. Additionally, the S25 Slim is rumoured to feature a 200-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with 3.5X optical zoom. That said, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is being designed to give direct competition to the rumoured iPhone 17 Air. But which one will be better? Here is a comparison of both the phones based on the leaks. However, the exact difference can only be known after the launch of both the phones.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series details leak ahead of launch next weekAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim rumoured to launch in May: Everything else we know about the upcoming phoneAlso read |  Here is how much the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra could cost in IndiaMust Watch ",technology,2025-01-16T09:36:00,3.9,4.8

Congrats, it is free nowGoogle has made its AI tools, including the Gemini bot, free for Workspace Business and Enterprise plans, removing the Rs 1,500 per month fee. However, subscription costs will rise by Rs 125 per user. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/paid-rs-1500-a-month-for-gemini-in-google-apps-congrats-it-is-free-now-2665517-2025-01-16,"If youve been shelling out extra cash for Googles Gemini-powered AI features in Workspace apps, heres some good news: its now free. Google has announced that starting this week, all its AI tools  formerly locked behind the Rs 1,500 per month Gemini Business plan  are included in standard Workspace Business and Enterprise subscriptions. The move aims to make AI capabilities more accessible as Google races against Microsoft and OpenAI.advertisementThe catch: Slightly higher prices Before you celebrate too much, theres a small caveat. Google is hiking the price of all Workspace plans to cover these new features. Most businesses will now pay about Rs 125 more per user per month. For context, the base subscription that previously cost Rs 900 ($12) will now be priced at Rs 1,050 ($14). Its not exactly a bank-breaker, but its a notable shift for companies managing large teams. Whats in the AI package? With Googles Workspace AI suite, you get tools like email summaries in Gmail, automated meeting notes in Meet, spreadsheet design help in Sheets, and AI writing assistants in Docs. The Gemini bot, Googles flagship AI, acts as a personal assistant capable of summarizing emails, finding data, and even brainstorming ideas.  Before you celebrate too much, theres a small caveat.

Theres also NotebookLM Plus, a research assistant designed to break down complex topics. It lets users upload documents, extract insights, and share customised notebooks for collaboration.Why the freebie move?  Googles decision to scrap the extra fee for Gemini seems strategic. The AI race is heating up, and rival Microsoft recently made its own AI features part of standard subscriptions for certain Microsoft 365 plans. Google is betting that by removing the financial barrier, it can convince more businesses to try its AI tools.  Googles move to make AI a core part of its Workspace plans signals a shift in how businesses approach productivity. The company plans to keep rolling out new AI features over the next year, ensuring its tools remain at the forefront of workplace innovation.  For users, the message is clear: AI isnt an optional add-on anymoreits the future of work. Whether youre excited or skeptical, one thing is certain: Googles Gemini is here to stay, and its now a standard part of doing business in the digital age.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also read |  Still using Windows 10?

This comes shortly after the company announced plans to lay off some employees, with sources indicating that less than 1 per cent of the workforce will be affected. The layoffs are part of Microsoft's efforts to tighten its spending as the company navigates through economic challenges. Alongside these cuts, Microsofts consulting division has paused hiring and will delay filling vacant roles, according to a memo obtained by CNBC. Derek Danois, a senior executive in the consulting unit, asserted in the memo that careful cost management is crucial, adding that internal meetings should be conducted remotely to avoid unnecessary travel expenses. The report says that top executives are asked to approve any travel to customer sites to ensure spending is aligned with the companys priorities. The memo also mentions that Microsoft plans to cut marketing and external resource costs by 35 per cent, further underlining the companys focus on controlling expenses. This wave of layoffs follows an earlier move by Microsoft in early 2023 when it let go of 10,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting strategy under CEO Satya Nadella. The company was responding to broader economic shifts and market conditions. Additionally, in January 2024, Microsofts gaming division, following its $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, laid off 1,900 workers to reduce overlapping roles. Microsoft isnt the only tech giant making such decisions. Meta has also confirmed plans to dismiss certain underperforming employees as part of its restructuring. These cost-saving measures show the growing trend among tech companies to streamline operations amidst the current market challenges. Microsoft is also planning to fire underperforming employees. While the company has confirmed the news, it has not disclosed the exact number of workers affected.A Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged the upcoming layoffs and reiterated the company's focus on high-performance talent. The spokesperson stressed that when employees fail to meet performance expectations, appropriate actions are taken. As part of its strategy, Microsoft evaluates staff performance across multiple levels, even reaching some senior employees at level 80.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Jan 16, 2025 ",technology,2025-01-16T12:14:00,6.3,6.0
ffdc5b41-fe84-42b7-a532-3660ca628746,"Dreame AirStyle review: Smart hair-styler that is high on features and low on priceWe know hair-dryers and stylers can be smart. We have seen some earlier from Dyson. Now, we get one from Dreame. It's called AirStyle and it offers tons of features, performance to match and all of that at a relatively affordable price. In this Dreame AirStyle review we find it can match more expensive hair-stylers. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/dreame-airstyle-review-smart-hair-styler-that-is-high-on-features-and-low-on-price-2665613-2025-01-16,"What do you think of when you hear the word hair-styler? Probably a dumb device that can dry as well as help shape your hair while you are frantically going through your morning on a weekday. That is also probably accurate. But we have seen that companies like Dyson are changing this perception of hair-dryers and hair-stylers. They are giving smarts to these devices. One such company, apart from Dyson, and the products of which we are now starting to see in India, is Dreame. Earlier, at India Today Tech, we reviewed the Dreame L10s Pro Ultra Heat, a robot house-cleaner, and we were quite impressed with it. It was a premium, pricey product and an excellent automatic robot-cleaner for users who could afford it. Now, we are reviewing the Dreame AirStyle, a hair styler. There are a lot of similarities between the product philosophy of Dyson and Dreame. Recently, when Dreame launched its AirStyle  and yes, the name itself gives you deja vu, instantly making you think of the Dyson Airwrap  I was curious to see what Dreame had to offer. More than the name it's the pricing which roused my interest. The Dreame AirtStyle is Rs 24,999, almost half of the price of its more expensive competitor. This raises the obvious question of how. As in how can Dreame price something this low and does this mean it has a lot of cost-cutting? Does the lower price also mean a more cumbersome and ineffective user experience? Well, Ive used the AirStyle for about a week now and Im impressed. The Dreame AirStyle offers multiple attachments, is easy to use and clean, and comes in premium packaging. But of course, there are also areas where it is definitely not as premium as the Dyson one. Lets take a closer look.Premium design, easy to clean The Dreame AirStyle comes in this cream colour option with a metallic brass finish. Of course, it is made of plastic. But the paint job, which is extremely slick and premium, gives it stunning looks. The design of the hair-styler is minimalist. It weighs around 1 kg, which is not too heavy and is similar in weight to the Dyson Airwrap. Although using it with one hand while styling does give a workout for your arm.    In the box, there are five attachments, including a dryer, auto-wrap barrel, smoothing brush, round volumising brush, and flyaway attachment. All of these you can easily attach, remove, and even clean with water after styling your hair. The build quality of the attachments is quite sturdy, although they too are made of plastic. The AirStyler comes in an antique-looking suitcase box, which is easy to carry around and looks quite premium.   Using the Dreame AirStylerWell, it works as intended  effectively and fuss-free. Using the device is a pretty straightforward process. You pick the attachment you want to use, turn on the power, select air pressure and heat, and go.For the air pressure, there are three settings  low, medium, and high  that you can use as per styling requirements. Dreame also includes a user guide to help you set the settings according to your hair type and styling needs. The heat setting is really handy and includes cool air, medium heat, and high heat, which you can use as needed.   In my use, I often used the dryer attachment, which requires air pressure and heat at max. I have thin and long hair, and the AirStyler helped me dry them around 95 per cent in about 1520 minutes, which is quite impressive. However, to style, you need slightly damp hair, so after 5 to 10 minutes of drying, you can switch to the different styler attachments.advertisementNow, given I have thin and somewhat wavy hair, I also used the volumising attachment and the flyaway attachment. Both work extremely well and do the job effectively. Do understand that the AirStyler is not that compact, so it takes quite a while. Also, you need to switch arms to cover both sides. It's quite a workout and can take some time before you are done with it. In other words, on hurried mornings while you are rushing to reach the office quickly, you will not have time to style your hair.While the performance is there, as well as the feature set, I do notice that the AirStyler doesnt feel as refined as Dyson Airwrap. For example, the auto-wrap curler in the AirStyle lacks the option to switch the wrap direction, which makes it slightly cumbersome compared to the Airwrap. Another difference is the carrying box. The Airwarp box is just so much more premium compared to the AirStyler box. One important bit to remember here is the price. The AirStyler sells for less than half the price of the Airwrap, so the differences I talk of feel more like nitpicks and can be overlooked.   Dryer attachment of Dreame AirStyleadvertisementDreame AirStyle review: Is it worth it?If you want a good hair styling tool under Rs 25,000 with multiple attachments that also doesn't damage your hair with heat, the Dreame Airstyler is a good option. It's easy to clean, comes with a portable case, and offers both cool and hot air settings, making it an affordable alternative to more expensive options like the Dyson Airwrap. Additionally, the Airstyler is currently available at a more affordable price on Amazon, making the deal even more attractive. It is selling for Rs 19,999. So, the Dreame Airstyler gets big thumbs up from my side.You see the price is the real deal here.

During an interview on the Table Manners podcast, Cook shared that his first job involved delivering newspapers at the age of 11, followed by flipping burgers at a fast-food chain called Tastee-Freez when he was just 14 years old. Cook, who grew up in the small town of Robertsdale, Alabama, explained that his parents instilled the value of hard work in him, which has remained a guiding principle throughout his career. He said that the lessons from his early jobs have stayed with him, helping him approach challenges with dedication and perseverance. Despite coming from humble beginnings, Cook went on to pursue industrial engineering at Auburn University, and after graduation, he worked at tech firms like IBM. In 1998, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs personally invited Cook to join Apple as Senior Vice President of worldwide operations, marking the beginning of his journey at the tech company. When Jobs passed away in 2011, Cook took over as Apples CEO. In the interview, Cook also discussed his daily routine, talking about the importance of starting his day early. He revealed that he begins working before 5AM, using the early morning hours to focus on key tasks before the day becomes busy. This quiet time, he said, allows him to manage his workload more effectively. While Cook continues to lead Apple with the same dedication he developed in his younger years, he hinted at future retirement plans.

However, after 2022 -- with the launch of iPhone SE3-- Apple seemed to go on a hiatus as far as launching its new generation of iPhone SE is concerned. While nothing official has been announced or hinted at by the Cupertino giant about the future of this affordable series yet, the buzz around the iPhone SE4 has significantly increased in the past few months. This surge in interest follows reports from analysts like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Ming-Chi Kuo, who stated that Apple is likely to launch the new-generation iPhone SE4 in early 2025. Not only is the launch of the iPhone SE4 highly anticipated, but it is also speculated to feature significant upgrades over its predecessor. These upgrades could include Apple's latest A18 series chip, a larger 48-megapixel camera, and the long-awaited transition from Touch ID to Face ID. Recent reports even suggest that the affordable iPhone might be rebranded as the ""iPhone 16E"" to align with Apple's latest flagship naming conventions.iPhone SE4 design and display upgrades One of the most notable upgrades the new iPhone SE4 is expected to bring is its design. Drawing inspiration from the iPhone 14, the new SE is rumoured to feature a 6.1-inch OLED screen, slim bezels, and no physical home button. Apple is reportedly replacing the physical button with Face ID, making the affordable iPhone more secure, akin to its flagship counterparts. There were earlier rumours that the iPhone SE4 might feature the Dynamic Island. However, subsequent reports dismissed these claims, suggesting that Apple will likely reserve this feature for its premium flagships. Still, the iPhone SE4 might include the customisable Action Button feature introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro series, replacing the traditional mute switch. Additionally, in line with these design changes, the iPhone SE4 is expected to weigh slightly less at approximately 165g. Leaked CAD renders and unofficial images suggest a sleeker, more modern design, with colour options including Midnight, Starlight, and Product RED.iPhone SE4 performance upgrades In terms of performance, the iPhone SE4 is rumoured to receive the biggest ever upgrade yet. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the device will likely be powered by the A18 series chipset, bringing it closer to the iPhone 16 series in terms of performance. The phone is also rumoured to debut with Apple's in-house 5G modem, making it the first Apple device to feature the company's proprietary modem technology. The SE4 is expected to receive a power boost with RAM options of up to 8GB and storage configurations ranging from 128GB to 512GB. With the new chipset and increased RAM, the iPhone SE4 might also incorporate Apple Intelligence features, making it the most affordable iPhone to offer Apple's AI suite.iPhone SE4 camera upgrades The iPhone SE4 is also expected to feature significant improvements in the camera department. It may feature a single rear lens with a 48MP sensor, a notable upgrade from the 12MP sensor of the iPhone SE3. Additional features like Cinematic Mode, Smart HDR, AI photography, and Portrait Mode are anticipated. However, the device might not include Night Mode, despite the upgraded sensor.iPhone SE4 battery and charging upgrades Under the hood, the iPhone SE4 is rumoured to house a 3,279mAh battery, a significant increase from the 2,010mAh battery in its predecessor. Charging speeds are expected to reach 20W via cable and 12W wirelessly. In compliance with EU regulations, the iPhone SE4 will reportedly adopt a USB-C charging port.iPhone SE4 pricing in India Pricing will play a crucial role in the success of the iPhone SE4. Reports suggest it could be priced under Rs 50,000 in India (approximately $429 in the US). However, a slight increase to $499 is also predicted. With the rumoured rebranding of the iPhone 16E and its numerous upgrades, a marginally higher price than the iPhone SE3 is anticipated.When is the iPhone SE4 launching? As for the launch timeline, Mark Gurman has hinted at an early 2025 release, stating that mass production began in December 2024. Other analysts, like Jeff Pu, and reports from MacRumors also point to a 2025 launch. Based on Apple's history, the iPhone SE4 could arrive in late March or early April, aligning with the spring launch window of the iPhone SE3 in 2022.Published By: Divya BhatiPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Also Read |  Apple may launch 20 new devices this year: iPhone 17, MacBook Air M4, iPad 11 and more in pipelineAlso Read |  Scammers now calling as TRAI officials, threatening users with account and number suspension to extort moneyAlso Read |  Loop Qi2-certified MagSafe-compatible power bank 10,000 mAh review: Compact and multi-device charging ",technology,2025-01-16T13:04:00,8.3,1.5
