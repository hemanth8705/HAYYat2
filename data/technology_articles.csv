And as usual, in the middle of this transformation, sits a lot of drama. There have been reports for a while now that the Sam Altman-led company has been mulling restructuring its model from a non-profit organisation to a for-profit organisation. However, that transformation “is complicated”, as Altman recently said at The DealBook Summit. The thing is, OpenAI is currently being run by a non-profit organisation. That organisation was also behind the brief firing of Sam Altman from OpenAI. It seems like payback time, because Altman is now trying to remove the non-profit organisation itself, according to a new report in The New York Times.  The nonprofit overseeing OpenAI acts as an internal conscience, tasked with ensuring the company's AI aligns with its original mission of not causing harm to humanity.Sam Altman wants control Sam Altman’s leadership has been pivotal — and polarising. Last fall, the nonprofit board attempted to oust Altman, only for the move to backfire spectacularly. After nearly the entire board resigned, Altman returned with even stronger support. Since then, he has been working to reduce the nonprofit’s grip on OpenAI’s operations, negotiating a fair price for the nonprofit’s reduced role — potentially in the billions of dollars.   Altman himself acknowledged the complexity of the situation at The DealBook Summit, saying, ""We are and have been looking for a while at some changes. It is, as you can imagine, complicated."" With a self-imposed two-year deadline to restructure, the clock is ticking.  Eye on profit  The shift to a for-profit model comes with significant financial incentives. OpenAI is currently valued at around $150 billion, but removing caps on investor returns and securing fresh capital could send its valuation soaring. For Altman, the restructuring could also mean his first equity stake in the company—a clear signal of its pivot towards profit-driven goals.   Founded in 2015 by visionaries like Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman, OpenAI was initially established as a nonprofit focused on advancing AI for the benefit of humanity. The ""open"" in OpenAI symbolised a commitment to transparency and collaboration. Over time, however, the organisation has shifted towards commercial ventures, with popular products like ChatGPT Plus and Sora paving the way for financial growth.   Now, OpenAI’s board of directors is contemplating a move to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) model. This structure blends profit-making with a legal obligation to consider societal impact—a middle ground that mirrors the approach taken by rivals like Anthropic and xAI. If the plan goes through, the nonprofit governing OpenAI will step back, ceding day-to-day control while retaining a minority stake in the for-profit entity.  Controversy and criticism Not everyone is thrilled about OpenAI’s new direction. Elon Musk, a co-founder who has since distanced himself from the company, has been vocal in his criticism. At the Cannes Lions Festival, Musk accused OpenAI of straying from its original mission, saying, ""The ‘open’ in OpenAI was meant to stand for ‘open source’... It has become a ‘maximum-profit AI’ organisation.""   This critique cuts to the heart of the debate: can OpenAI balance its commercial ambitions with its ethical commitments? Skeptics worry that reducing nonprofit oversight could dilute the company’s focus on responsible AI development.  A balancing act OpenAI insists that societal benefit remains central to its mission. ""We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone,"" a spokesperson told Reuters. However, the restructuring raises critical questions about how the company will manage the risks associated with powerful AI technologies under a more corporate governance model.   For now, the nonprofit will continue to exist, but its role in shaping OpenAI’s trajectory remains uncertain. As one of the most influential AI companies globally, OpenAI’s decisions will be closely scrutinised by regulators, investors, and the public.   This unfolding chapter in OpenAI’s story is not just about organisational restructuring; it’s about the future of AI governance. Whether the company can balance profit-making with societal good will define its legacy — and potentially, the future of AI itself.

While the company is yet to notify, a recent leak reveals what the Galaxy S25+ may look like. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-design-leak-ahead-of-launch-2651436-2024-12-18,"As we approach Samsung’s highly anticipated January 2025 launch event, fresh leaks have emerged showcasing the design of the upcoming Galaxy S25+. Previously, we reported the leaked design and specs of the Galaxy S25 Ultra model, showcasing round corners. The latest leak indicates that the Galaxy S25+ will follow the same design language as its predecessor. 
 


 Additionally, another leak has also revealed the colourways of the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. Here is what the colour pallete of the Galaxy S25 series may look like. 
 


Samsung Galaxy S25+ leaked design  Newly leaked images of the Samsung Galaxy S25+ have surfaced, providing a clear view of the device's front, rear, and side design. As anticipated, the Galaxy S25+ appears to retain much of the look of its predecessor, the S24+, with only a few minor tweaks. The leaked images, posted by showcase the device in the previously-revealed Midnight Black colourway. 
 


 From the front, the S25+ largely mirrors its predecessor, maintaining the same rounded edges and thin bezels on all sides. While the bottom of the phone is blurred to hide sensitive information, it’s unlikely that this suggests any significant design changes, such as a larger chin bezel. The top of the phone features a sticker, but it’s expected that Samsung will stick with a pinhole front camera, similar to the S24+.
 


 One noticeable change is on the rear, where the camera rings are now darker, adding a more refined, almost black tone. This change could be specific to the Midnight Black variant or applied across all S25+ colourways. The left side of the device shows a flat design with a volume rocker, and power button, in a similar configuration to the S24+.
 


 The device's model number, SM-S936U, confirms this as the US variant of the Galaxy S25+. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra design leak Before Galaxy S25+, a tipster on Bluesky (a social media platform similar to X) posted dummy images of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It might carry slightly rounded corners instead of the sharp edges seen in previous models. The overall design remains boxy, but the softer corners give it a more refined and modern look. The rear panel houses a distinctive camera setup, with three large rings and two smaller ones, containing four image sensors. The camera rings have a texture similar to the Fold 6, with the outer ring maintaining a polished look. While these leaks provide an insightful preview, it’s important to wait for Samsung’s official reveal at the Unpacked event likely scheduled for January 22, 2025.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

While it doesn’t bring any big changes, there are some interesting tweaks and bug fixes worth mentioning. Developers got their hands on the first beta on December 16, and if Apple’s past schedules are any indication, the public release should arrive in late January. For example, iOS 17.3 was launched on January 22, 2024, iOS 16.3 on January 23, 2023, and iOS 15.3 on January 26, 2022. So, late January seems like a safe bet for iOS 18.3’s rollout. Unlike the previous updates, iOS 18.3 focuses on smaller improvements rather than introducing big features. One of the standout additions is support for robot vacuums in the Home app. This means you’ll soon be able to add your smart vacuum to HomeKit, letting you control it with Siri, set up automation, and monitor its status. For instance, you could tell Siri to clean a specific room or schedule cleaning as part of your daily routine. Apple explains that the Home app will support core functions like turning the vacuum on and off, switching between cleaning modes, and checking its charge status. While the exact timeline for robot vacuum manufacturers to jump on board isn’t clear yet, iOS 18.3 is laying the groundwork for smoother integration. As usual, bug fixes are also part of the iOS 18.3 update. Apple has addressed two notable issues related to Apple Intelligence. The first fix resolves a problem where personalised Genmojis wouldn’t generate properly unless you selected a different person first. The second fix ensures third-party apps using the Writing Tools API can now provide the full inline experience, even when their first responder isn’t a UIView. There are also some minor changes sprinkled into the update. For instance, the icon for the Image Playground app has been slightly tweaked. In the Feedback app, you can now log in using Face ID or Touch ID instead of typing in your password every time. Accessibility settings got a tiny update too, as the Camera Control menu icon now works better with dark mode.  It’s still early days for iOS 18.3, and there’s always a chance Apple might add more features as the beta testing continues. But for now, this update seems to focus on refining the small details that make the iPhone experience smoother. Apple is expected to save its bigger features for iOS 18.4, but iOS 18.3 still has some charm for those paying attention.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and moreAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

a134a036-f55b-430c-bb81-fa49abc44e26,"Apple needs to make Apple TV that can run AAA games, challenge Xbox and PlaystationApple needs a gaming boost for its devices. Until now, it might have been the case that its devices were not powerful enough for AAA games. Now they are, and Apple might do well to create a new Apple TV that can challenge Xbox and PlayStation in gaming. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/talking-points/story/apple-needs-to-make-apple-tv-that-can-run-aaa-games-challenge-xbox-and-playstation-2651840-2024-12-18,"Technology journalists who keep a close eye on Apple know one thing with certainty every time they cover the company's call analysts after its quarterly results. They know that Gene Munster, an analyst, would ask Apple when the company is releasing its television. Munster has done that for years, quarter after quarter. But so far no television from Apple has appeared. Now, there are reports again that an Apple TV — the actual big-screen television and not the streaming box that Apple already sells — is in work again. Possibly, we will see an Apple television come out of the company's labs and factories in a few months, or more likely in a few years. But I believe that instead of a television it should create a different Apple TV.  A different Apple TV, which is more than a streaming box, is now such a low-hanging fruit that it would be almost a sacrilege on the part of Apple to not do it. All the ingredients are there for Apple to create an Apple TV that is not only a streaming box but is also a gaming console similar to the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.  Look at it from this angle: for a device like the Xbox Series X or the PlayStation 5 Pro, there are three essential components. One, is the chipset that gives these consoles the ability to run games. Two, the gaming ecosystem and availability of games people would want to play. And three, people willing to buy it. Apple already, I believe, has two of these components. The M4 is powerful enough In terms of hardware, Apple is already at the level of the latest Xbox and Playstation. The Xbox Series X has a chip made by AMD. It has a performance of around 12 Tflops. The PlayStation 5 Pro, which is a slightly beefed up variant of PS5, also has a chip made by AMD and that chip performs at around 16 Tflops. These numbers are in line with what the M4 Pro and the M4 Max, the latest Apple chips, can offer through their graphics units. The numbers for Apple chips range from 8 Tflops to 17 Tflops depending on the variant but it is safe to say that if Apple wants to have a chip that is equivalent to the chips in the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X  it can do so tomorrow just by tuning and binning one of the M4s. 

 



M4 Max is already as powerful as chipsets in the latest Xbox and PlayStation 5.
 In fact, Apple has chips that are significantly faster. The Ultra variant of the M3 has a graphics core that is already over 20 Tflops. And some variants of the M4 Ultra, which is bound to come out in 2025, are likely to be close to 30 Tflops, offering almost double the horsepower that PlayStation or Xbox can manage.  Apple has also, by putting these chips in the MacBook Pro and Mac Mini, demonstrated that they can go into small boxes without requiring elaborate cooling. In other words, except the economics that I am not privy to, nothing is stopping Apple from putting one of these ultra-fast M series chips in Apple TV and then turning that into a gaming console.  The third part of the equation — consumers — too I believe are there. According to some research firms, there are around 34 million Apple TVs in use in the US in 2024. Even if we are a little more conservative in estimates, it is safe to say that there would easily be around 55-60 million active Apple TVs worldwide, which is not a small number for a device that is not ""essential"" like an iPhone or Mac. In fact, Apple rarely promotes Apple TV and so far has been happy keeping it almost like a side project, updating it every two or three years. If this small box, apart from performing its streaming and entertainment duties, can also help people play AAA games, I am certain that it would find more favour among consumers. AAA games needed The tricky for Apple, however, is the second component: the availability of AAA games. But this too, I believe, can be solved by a more robust Apple TV. In recent years it has become important for Apple to crack the AAA games puzzle. The company is trying — hence Hideo Kojima at last year's WWDC in Cupertino — but so far the games haven't appeared. Nowadays whenever I am reviewing something with the M series chipset in it, I find that it is missing AAA games that hold it back. Something like a MacBook Pro M4 is an incredibly powerful laptop, but for a lot of regular consumers, it is an overkill. Less than stellar availability of top games is keeping a lot of consumers away from the MacBook Pro. A lot of people want to work and play. And not just work on their Rs 2 lakh laptop. Unless they are editing videos, or doing programming or running simulations, they don't need the power that chips like M4 Pro or the M4 Max offer.  An incredible list of AAA games — think the latest Call of Duty — will make Apple computers even more attractive than they are. And an Apple TV, which has a robust graphics chip, might entice more game developers to come to Apple camp and create games for it.  In a way — but not entirely because I think matters of business, Apple's cut in purchase and the entire cost-benefit ratio are also there — the lack of AAA games on Apple platforms could be a chicken and egg problem for game developers. What comes first? Games or the devices that can play them? Previously, Apple didn't have chipsets that could be used for serious gaming, and while it could always use a graphics chip by AMD or Nvidia to make its platform more gaming-friendly, probably the math never worked out. Now, however, Apple has an opportunity to do so.  Personally, in my drawing room under the TV I will love a device that can be a do-it-all box. Apple, I believe, has an opportunity to create one such box. The company can potentially call it Apple TV Pro. The price, obviously, will go up because such a box would also need a bigger chip and associated gaming hardware such as more storage. But if it competes with Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 Pro, which are priced above Rs 50,000, I am not sure if consumers would mind a reasonable hike in price.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

The company has finally confirmed the existence of this device and revealed the launch date as well. The mid-range premium phone will debut on January 7, 2025, alongside the flagship OnePlus 13 smartphone and OnePlus Buds Pro 3 earphones.  With the new 13R model, OnePlus is promising to offer ""flagship-level performance, super adaptable cameras, a lighter than air operating system and a massive battery.""  Ahead of the official launch event, the company has confirmed that the OnePlus 13R will feature a bigger 6,000mAh battery under the hood. For your reference, the OnePlus 12R packs a 5,500mAh battery unit. According to the details revealed by OnePlus, the device has a slim design and features the newly developed Gorilla Glass 7i on the front and back to provide better protection against screen scratches. It has an aluminum frame and a flat screen within an 8mm thin body. You will see a triple camera system at the back of the device. OnePlus promises to offer a much better camera experience with the latest OnePlus 13 devices, a claim we will test when we receive the devices for review. ""Both OnePlus 13 Series devices are equipped with versatile triple camera systems on the rear, designed for capturing stunning snapshots. Users are able to take sharp and detailed photos of fleeting moments, whether it's a child at play or a pet running around, without any blur,"" the company said.  The rest of the details are officially unknown. But, we know that the OnePlus 13R will likely use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset because its predecessor used the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC. OnePlus usually offers a year older flagship chip with its R series phones. If leaks are to be believed, the OnePlus 13R could feature a 6,300mAh battery with support for 100W fast charging tech. OnePlus is one of the few brands that bundle a charger in the retail box, so the new phone will also likely have it. The device is also tipped to pack a 6.78-inch 1.5K LTPO display and a 50-megapixel triple rear camera setup.  The OnePlus 13R isn't expected to receive a massive price hike. The OnePlus 12R was announced with a starting price tag of Rs 39,999, so the next generation is expected to be priced under Rs 45,000. Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

We have reviewed the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ and the Redmi Buds 6. We have also been testing the Xiaomi speakers and it is such a fun device. At Rs 3,499, the speaker looks good, they are portable, they sound great, and of course, they are priced very well. Yes, the speaker has some issues, but they are smaller things that aren't ignorable –– for most people. Let’s get into the details. advertisementXiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: The good thingsThe Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is a total green flag at this price segment. It is equipped with a 30W driver with dual subwoofer. Weighing 597g, the device is light and easily portable. The speaker is enveloped with a grille structure that helps grip the device easily. Additionally, it has an in-built loop to make it easier to carry. By the looks of it, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor design is similar to the Sony ULT Field 1, which is priced at Rs 16,990. The Xiaomi speaker is cylindrical and sleek –– a design that quickly catches the eye. We received the black variant, but it is also available in blue and red.

 



The Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker’s body has a running grille pattern with its branding etched on the face.
While other colours feature a monochromatic pattern, this one has an orange strap in contrast. The strap runs along the back of the device like a spine and sports three buttons: power, Bluetooth and linking. All these buttons require a long press to function. For instance, you have to long press the power button for 3 seconds to switch the speakers on or off. It goes the same for Bluetooth settings as well. There are three additional buttons placed on the mesh of the speakers that are dedicated for play/pause, increasing and decreasing volume. The buttons are clicky and offer good haptic feedback. 

 



The connect button can only be used with multiple Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. Long press the connect button on the strap for 3s on each speaker, and all speakers will pair automatically playing the same content. The Type-C charging port is also placed on the strap.
For durability, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor comes with IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Overall, Xiaomi's latest speaker offers a solid, well-built design that stands out in both form and function. advertisementBut this is not its best part. The best part is its “big speaker energy”. For its size and price, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is capable of filling small to medium-sized rooms pretty well. It delivers a clear and consistent sound quality. The bass delivers a strong punch without overshadowing the mids and highs, maintaining a well-balanced sound profile. This ensures that the audio output remains clear and detailed across different frequencies and a wide range of music genres. 
 


At a price of Rs 3,499, it is equipped with dual large subwoofer radiators on both the sides for a fuller and richer bass sound. Whether you're listening to bass-heavy tracks or more vocal-centric tunes, the sound is dynamic and full, with no one element dominating.The speaker is also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, offering stable connections. It is super easy to connect to the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker. Additionally, the speaker includes a 3.5mm audio jack, providing the flexibility for wired connections, further enhancing its versatility. advertisementComing to the battery life, this speaker does a good job. With a full charge and volume set between 80-90 percent, the speaker offers up to 10 hours of playback, making it ideal for most scenarios such as parties, day outings, or even an entire workday. I took the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker to a party and it played music for 4 hours non-stop. In that time, its battery dropped only 20 per cent. 
 


Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: Things that could be betterAs we mentioned above, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is great, but it has a few drawbacks. The speakers are missing LED indicators. Sure, it isn’t a critical feature, but it definitely adds more functionality to the design. And since we are talking about what could be, some RGB lights on it would be a cool addition.

Scammers are tricking users into scanning fraudulent QR codes, leading to the loss of large sums of money in seconds. Here is how QR code scams work and how you can protect yourself from them.advertisementHow do QR code scams work?QR codes are typically seen as a quick and easy way to make payments, but they have become a tool for scammers. In a QR code scam, the victim is presented with a fake or malicious QR code, often in places where trust is assumed, such as local shops, delivery services, or social media platforms. A scammer generates a QR code that appears to be linked to a legitimate transaction but instead triggers a money transfer to the scammer’s account. The victim scans the code, thinking they are paying for a product or service, but unknowingly authorises a transfer of funds to the scammer. A QR code could also include a fake APK link, which can ask you to download a malicious app or software to gain access to your bank details and other personal data. In some cases, this automatically downloads onto your device once you click on the fake URL present in the QR codes.

Do this to avoid QR code scams in online payments When making a UPI payment, it is better to transfer money directly to the recipient's verified UPI ID or mobile number instead of relying on QR codes, especially if you are unsure of the source. Scammers often exploit the trust people place in QR codes to disguise fraudulent transactions. Be cautious of scanning QR codes in unfamiliar locations or businesses that seem suspicious. Scammers can easily place fake QR codes in public places like restaurants, kiosks, or markets. Always ensure that the QR code belongs to a legitimate and trusted merchant before proceeding with the payment. For additional safety, consider creating a separate bank account that you link solely to your UPI platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe, or Paytm. Keep only a minimal amount (e.g., Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000) in this account. Even if a scam occurs, this measure limits the amount of money you can lose. This approach adds an extra layer of protection to your main savings account, ensuring larger amounts remain untouched in case of fraud. If you receive any suspicious payment requests or links, be sure to cross-check the URL or payment details. Fraudulent links often contain minor spelling errors or unusual domain names that differ from official websites. Taking a moment to verify can save you from falling into a scam.

Here are the details.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/scan-qr-code-to-get-your-package-dhl-delivery-scam-goes-viral-2651624-2024-12-18,"As India continues to embrace online payments, particularly through UPI, QR code scams are on the rise, with fraudsters finding new ways to trick unsuspecting users. Recently, there have been multiple incidents of scams involving QR codes, including a case where a police officer lost Rs 2.3 lakh after scanning a fraudulent QR code at a bakery. Now, a new scam involving DHL package delivery has surfaced, causing concerns among citizens who are receiving suspicious notifications. A DHL package delivery notice has been circulating on WhatsApp and X (previously Twitter), warning people not to scan the QR code printed on the paper. The message reads, ""New scam. They will leave this at the door. Do not scan the QR code.""  According to people who have received this poster, this notice is being delivered to their doorstep, which includes a QR code and a prompt to ""re-arrange your delivery now by following 3 simple steps."" The first step asks recipients to scan the QR code to visit the DHL website, followed by entering their DHL Waybill number to choose delivery options.  However, DHL has cleared up the confusion. The company's official DHL Express India account on X (formerly Twitter) responded to a tweet about the so-called scam, clarifying that this notice is legitimate. While this may not be a scam, it is important to remember that QR code scams are the easiest way for scammers to dupe people because these codes could include a malicious link, which a user can click and lose big money in any other scam. ""The paper in the shared image is a legitimate Customer Notification document issued by DHL Express and is commonly referred to as a Not Home (NH) card,"" DHL stated, explaining that the notice is from DHL Singapore and is not a scam. While the paper notice is authentic, a separate scam involving a fake DHL SMS is also making rounds. The fraudulent text message claims, ""Your package is currently processing at our facility. For the most up-to-date information on import charges, please visit our website: http://dhlhub.com.""   The URL in the SMS is not an official DHL link, suggesting that this is a scam aimed at deceiving users into clicking on a malicious link. To protect themselves, users are advised to be cautious when interacting with QR codes, links, and messages from unknown sources. Checking for minor details such as incorrect URLs, poorly written English, or unusual fonts can help identify a scam. It is always safer to verify the legitimacy of such messages directly through official channels or customer service to avoid falling victim to these schemes.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

For anyone looking to get a stylish, feature-packed phone without burning a hole in their pocket, this one might just be worth your consideration. Poco has always focused on delivering speed, power, and value, and this phone seems to stick to that winning formula. Here's a quick look at the 4 reasons why you should consider buying the Poco M7 Pro and one reason you might want to think twice.advertisementPoco M7 Pro 5G: 4 reasons to buyA stunning 120Hz displayThe Poco M7 Pro 5G comes with a 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED display that is not only smooth, thanks to its 120Hz refresh rate, but also incredibly bright for a phone in the sub-Rs 15,000 price segment. With a peak brightness of 2,100 nits, Poco claims this to be one of the brightest displays in its price segment. That means you can comfortably use the phone outdoors in bright sunlight without any issues (though I’ll have to wait for a sunny day to test it myself!). Rest assured, the colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and the overall experience is top-notch for streaming, gaming, and everyday use.

Rest assured, the colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and the overall experience is top-notch for streaming, gaming, and everyday use. Sleek and lightweight design Poco has nailed the design with this phone. The M7 Pro feels great to hold, thanks to its lightweight build and slim profile. It doesn’t have a glass back like its predecessor, but the plastic back with a pastel two-tone finish still looks gorgeous. The Lavender shade, in particular, stands out without being flashy. It’s a phone you’d enjoy carrying around. It feels comfortable, easy to handle, and doesn’t weigh you down like some bulky devices in this range. Reliable performance and battery life Under the hood, the Poco M7 Pro 5G packs the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra processor, which delivers good performance for daily tasks. Whether you’re scrolling through social media, messaging, or running basic apps, the phone runs smoothly. It also has up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which ensures multitasking is hassle-free. On the battery front, Poco has included a 5110mAh battery that easily lasts over a day with moderate usage. The icing on the cake is the 45W fast charging support, and yes, the charger is included in the box! 50MP camera with OIS Cameras are often a deciding factor when buying a phone, and Poco delivers well here. The M7 Pro has a 50MP Sony LYTIA LYT-600 primary camera with OIS (optical image stabilisation), which is a rare feature in this price range. This means steadier photos and videos, especially in low-light conditions. There’s also a 2MP macro camera for close-up shots and a 20MP selfie camera that does a decent job for video calls and selfies.Poco M7 Pro 5G: 1 reason to skip Limited software support Now, here’s the catch — while the Poco M7 Pro 5G runs on Android 14 with HyperOS, Poco is only promising two years of OS updates along with four years of security patches. That means the phone will get main OS updates only up to Android 16. In a world where brands like Samsung offer longer update cycles even on budget phones, this feels like a missed opportunity. To make matters worse, the phone doesn’t come with Android 15 out of the box, which would have been a nice touch for a brand-new device.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

You don't need them anymore, at least on X, and the company CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-says-stop-using-hashtags-on-x-because-you-dont-need-them-and-they-look-ugly-2651563-2024-12-18,"If you’ve been sprinkling hashtags like #blessed and #justgirlythings across your posts on X (formerly Twitter), it might be time to rethink your strategy. Elon Musk, CEO of X, has officially declared that hashtags are not only unnecessary but downright unattractive. In a recent response to a Grok reply (which roasted hashtags with brutal sarcasm) to the question if hashtags are still relevant, Musk chimed in with his trademark bluntness: “Please stop using hashtags. The system doesn’t need them anymore and they look ugly.”   The comment adds to growing chatter that hashtags — the once-mighty tools of digital discovery — have lost their relevance on X. Originally created to help users find trending topics and engage with specific conversations, hashtags are now being mocked as outdated relics of a bygone internet era.   A hashtag-less future?   The shift aligns with Musk’s broader push to streamline X’s user experience and algorithms. Under the hood, X’s systems are now smart enough to surface relevant content without needing users to slap a dozen hashtags onto their posts. Whether it’s breaking news, viral trends, or niche discussions, X’s algorithms can detect and promote content organically, making hashtags more of a “try-hard” cry for attention than a useful tool.   This evolution reflects a larger trend: as platforms get smarter, users get lazier. Why waste time typing out hashtags when the system already knows what you’re talking about? Still, for many creators and brands who’ve relied on hashtags to boost visibility, Musk’s comments signal a major culture shift.   Of course, Musk isn’t alone in calling out hashtags. The post he replied to hilariously compared hashtag-heavy tweets to “a desperate cry into the void,” suggesting they’re more likely to drive engagement into the ground than elevate content. Adding fuel to the fire, the Grok reply quipped that hashtags are about as useful as “a screen door on a submarine.” Ouch.   For those worried about falling into the abyss of digital obscurity, Musk’s message is clear: trust the system. Hashtags aren’t helping your engagement; they’re just making your posts look cluttered and outdated.   So, should you stop using hashtags? If you’re chasing trends on X, the answer seems to be a resounding yes. As Musk continues to reshape the platform, it’s probably best to leave the #blessed life behind and let your content do the talking. And if you’re still holding on to hashtags? Well, as Grok would probably say — enjoy the silence.

They save time, let you skip long token queues, and offer a quick way to access the trains. But there’s always that occasional moment of panic when you realise you’ve forgotten your metro card, especially when you’re in a rush. That’s when you’re left with no choice but to wait in line for a token, wasting time and energy. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has come up with a solution to this common problem. They’ve introduced an app called Momentum 2.0 Delhi Sarthi, available for both Android and iOS users. This app is designed to make metro travel smoother for everyone — whether you’re a regular commuter or an occasional traveller. With this app, there’s no need to stand in queues, and you don’t even have to carry a metro card anymore. What sets Momentum 2.0 apart from the usual metro card is its convenience. Metro cards come with the requirement of maintaining a minimum balance of Rs 50. But with this app, there are no such conditions. Once you sign up using your mobile number, the app works like a digital wallet. You can load money into it and use it to purchase metro tickets, including QR tickets for multiple trips. This means you can enter the metro station just by scanning your phone. Apart from ticketing, the Momentum 2.0 app offers many other useful features. For instance, it helps you locate the nearest metro station, check the first and last train timings, and provides detailed information about metro lines. You’ll also find maps of the entire Delhi metro network on the app, which is a helpful guide if you’re unsure of your route. Recharging the app’s wallet is quick and simple. You can add funds using a credit card, debit card, or UPI. However, keep in mind that once you buy a ticket through the app, it cannot be cancelled or refunded. But Momentum 2.0 isn’t just a metro ticketing app. It’s like a one-stop super-app for commuters. It offers additional services like booking bike taxis (including options for women), reserving event tickets, booking IRCTC train tickets, mobile recharges, and even paying credit card bills. And if you’re bored while waiting for a train, the app has games to pass the time. For Delhi-NCR residents, this app is a handy tool that makes daily travel easier.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and moreAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The platform is teaming up with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to roll out tools that allow creators and celebrities to detect AI-generated content that uses their image, face, or voice. This partnership aims to give individuals more control over how their digital likeness is used, especially as artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and widespread. Starting early next year, YouTube will test these tools with celebrities and athletes. The idea is to let them find videos on the platform that mimic their face, voice, or other aspects of their identity using AI and make it easier to request that such content be removed. Once this initial phase is complete, YouTube plans to expand the program to include top creators on the platform, creative professionals, and other influential figures. This move is expected to protect YouTube's most prominent users, who often have to deal with issues like impersonation and misuse of their image. In September, YouTube had already announced plans to develop tools that help manage AI-generated depictions of creators, including their voices. Now, the company is building on that commitment by giving celebrities the ability to deal with these issues on a larger scale. This is especially relevant as AI tools can now create hyperrealistic versions of someone's face, voice, or body, which can then be used in ways that the original person never agreed to. One major player in this effort is the CAA. The agency represents many of the world’s biggest stars and has already been preparing for this kind of situation. Last year, CAA introduced a system called CAAVault. This tool scans and stores detailed digital records of its clients' likenesses, including their faces, bodies, and voices. By combining this technology with YouTube’s platform-wide tools, the partnership aims to make it easier for creators and celebrities to monitor and control how their digital identity is used online. YouTube is also taking steps to address another growing issue — the misuse of AI to replicate creators' or artists' singing voices. The company is working on a new ""synthetic-singing identification technology"" designed to detect AI-generated content that mimics someone’s singing. Music labels have already started requesting the removal of AI-generated songs that sound like their artists. YouTube’s new tools will further strengthen these efforts. Earlier this year, YouTube began requiring creators to label videos that include AI-generated content to ensure transparency. This means anyone uploading AI-created work must disclose it in the video’s description or metadata.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Also read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and moreAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

This is somewhat ironic given that a few years ago when he lost elections in 2020, he was quickly shunned by the tech industry. In early 2021, Trump was reportedly booted out of Facebook platforms after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg approved the ban. He also fell from favour with Google and Twitter, a service now renamed X by Elon Musk. But, it seems that after his big win in the 2024 election, Trump is now too powerful to be ignored or given a cold shoulder by the tech industry.  In fact, it seems that the tech industry suddenly loves him. At least that is the impression one gets if one looks at the guest list at Mar-a-Lago, where Donald Trump lives in Florida. Now not only Elon Musk, the man credited with orchestrating a win for Trump, is almost a permanent resident at Mar-a-Lago but the house is also seeing tech biggies like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook marking their presence with private dinners with Trump. And even Zuckerberg, whose platforms turned kind of hostile to Trump four years ago, has met the upcoming president privately.  So adoringly tech CEOs and the tech industry are looking towards Trump that the upcoming US president himself — in his typical style — boasted about it in a recent speech. ""I had dinner with Apple's Tim Cook, almost all of them. The rest are coming,"" Trump said. ""In my first term, everyone was fighting me. Now, everyone wants to be my friend — maybe my personality changed or something!"" With the tech industry bracing for potential policy changes, these meetings hint at Big Tech's desire to stay in Trump's good graces. From regulatory scrutiny to trade issues and data privacy, a second Trump term could have serious implications for the tech world. Here is a quick look at what happened when Trump met the big tech CEOs at dinner.Apple CEO Tim Cook Ahead of Donald Trump's upcoming presidency in January 2025, he hosted Apple CEO Tim Cook for a private dinner at his Mar-a-Lago estate on December 13, 2024. According to the Associated Press, the primary focus of their discussion revolved around Apple's ongoing tax disputes with the European Union. Recently, Apple lost a big appeal over a 13 billion euro tax payment owed to Ireland, an issue that has drawn considerable attention. This meeting came after a previous phone conversation between Trump and Cook, where they reportedly discussed the impact of these EU financial penalties on Apple. It appears that Cook's goal was to seek support or clarification on the US administration's stance on such matters, given Trump's past criticism of international trade and tax policies. The dinner was said to be part of a broader effort by Apple CEO to engage with Trump's administration before his presidency officially begins.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg's meeting with Trump is perhaps the most notable, given their historically bad relationship. After the January 2021 Capitol riots, Meta (then Facebook) banned Trump from its platforms, causing a big fallout. During the dinner, Zuckerberg gave Trump Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses as a gesture, hinting at improving their strained ties. Though the exact details of their talks are not clear, Zuckerberg's decision to meet with Trump now suggests an attempt to lessen past tensions and avoid future regulatory hurdles. Meta has long been under scrutiny for its handling of political content, privacy concerns, and its monopoly-like control over social media. By engaging Trump, Zuckerberg might be trying to avoid harsh regulatory measures that could be introduced during Trump's presidency. Meta also reportedly donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, further showing its interest in improving relations with the new administration. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Google's CEO Sundar Pichai has also met with Donald Trump ahead of his second presidential term. While the details of their discussion remain unclear, reports suggest the meeting focused on Google's operations and potential regulatory concerns, notably after the Department of Justice recently suggested to the court that Google should be broken up and that Chrome should be set up as a separate company. Google has also faced ongoing debates over content moderation, accusations of bias against conservative views, and antitrust investigations. These issues could intensify under the Trump administration, which has previously criticised the company for alleged censorship. Pichai's meeting with Trump could be to manage any potential fallout.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Although Jeff Bezos stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021, his influence on the company remains strong. Bezos is reportedly meeting Trump sometime this week. While the exact topics of their discussion are not clear, it's expected that they will talk about Amazon's operations, regulatory concerns, and ways to build a positive relationship between Amazon and the new administration.  Bezos has previously expressed hope that Trump's second term could reduce regulations, and Amazon has donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund as well. Under Trump's previous administration, Amazon faced scrutiny over its labour practices and dominance in the e-commerce space. Bezos' meeting with Trump could be aimed at ensuring that the company avoids further regulatory intervention, especially as it continues to expand globally.advertisementBut there is moreThe meetings with big tech CEOs have been publicised but apparently, these reported private dinners are not the only time the tech industry is trying to understand and possibly influence the upcoming Trump presidency. Just a day ago, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son publicly, and with Trump by his side, announced that his company would be investing a whopping $100 billion in the US. Softbank, which is essentially a venture capitalist and investment firm, often invests in tech startups.At the same time, there is Elon Musk and his friends, including David Sacks. Musk has played a pivotal role in the election of Trump and he is now reportedly spending days at a stretch at Mar-a-Lago. Not only is he said to be involved in the shaping of the Trump administration but he is also reportedly part of the meetings when tech CEOs are holding their private dinner with the upcoming president. All-in-all it seems that unlike the first Trump presidency that was marked by unease between Trump and the tech industry — Google’s Sergey Brin, amongst other tech execs, was in a march against Trump's directive called Travel Ban — the second one is going to be different. If in the first one, the tech industry believed that it could take on Trump and still survive, in the second one it seems that Big Tech is looking to play nicer with him with the hope that Trump 2.0 will ease their regulatory woes not just in the US but also in other parts of the world.

647ba6fe-4ad9-4b19-bb19-597fc32a74c1,"Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?In the budget smartphone market, the Poco M7 Pro really stands out, especially for its design and build. It has a sleek and modern look that makes it feel much more premium than its price would suggest.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/poco-m7-pro-5g-quick-review-can-it-shake-up-the-budget-price-segment-2651090-2024-12-17,"Poco seems to understand what people want — speed, power, and value but at an affordable price point — and it’s sticking to that formula with its newest phone, the Poco M7 Pro 5G. At first glance, this phone feels like a great package. It has a nice design, and more importantly, it feels comfortable to hold, which matters a lot when you’re using a phone every day. Under the hood, the Poco M7 Pro comes with the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 processor, which is built for good performance on a budget. There’s also a dual-camera system at the back, and while it’s too early to give a full verdict, the phone does seem capable of capturing some nice shots.  Of course, there’s a lot more to check out before I can say for sure how good this phone really is. I’m still working on my full review, where I’ll dive into the performance, camera quality, battery life, and everything else that matters. But for now, my first impression is this — the Poco M7 Pro looks like a phone that delivers on its promise — a stylish, performance-focused phone at an affordable price. Here’s my quick review.Poco M7 Pro 5G: Design and display I have got the Poco M7 Pro in the Lavender Frost colourway and I have to say, the device looks gorgeous with its two-tone design at the rear. The understated gradient finish makes the phone feel like it stands out without being flashy. Now, some might find it odd that Poco replaced the glass back finish with a plastic one, but again, the in-hand feel is as good as it gets and that matters most. The phone sits comfortably in your hand, it’s lightweight, and it’s super easy to carry around. You won’t feel like you’re holding a brick, which is always a win.
 


 Now, about the cameras. The Poco M7 Pro has a dual-camera setup on the back with a raised camera island. The phone is also IP64 rated, which means it can handle a little bit of dust and water. Just like the M6 Pro, Poco has once again included the wet touch display tech, which is pretty smart. Basically, if there’s a water droplet on the screen, it won’t mess up the display or cause accidental touches.  Speaking of the display, this is one of the phone’s strong points. It has a 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED screen, now with a smooth 120 Hz refresh rate. That means scrolling and watching videos feel smooth and enjoyable. Poco claims it to be one of the brightest in the segment. Again, in the short time I’ve used it, the display has been pretty impressive. The colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and whether I was watching a show or browsing Instagram, the screen made the experience enjoyable. There’s also Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 protection up top. 
 


The only thing I couldn’t test yet is how the display performs under direct sunlight. Since it’s winter here in Delhi, the weather has been cloudy over the past few days. So, I’ll have to wait for some sunshine to check that out properly. The only thing I couldn’t test yet is how the display performs under direct sunlight. Since it’s winter here in Delhi, the weather has been cloudy over the past few days. So, I’ll have to wait for some sunshine to check that out properly. So far, the Poco M7 Pro feels like a well-thought-out device. It’s stylish, easy to carry, and packed with little features that make life easier. I’m looking forward to spending more time with it to see how it performs in other areas like battery life, camera quality, and overall speed.Poco M7 Pro 5G: Performance, battery and camera The Poco M7 Pro is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra chipset, which sounds promising on paper. I’m still testing the phone, so I can’t give you a full picture of how it performs in day-to-day use just yet. But if you look at the benchmark scores, they’re pretty much on par with other phones in this price range. From what I’ve seen so far, the chipset handles regular tasks like scrolling, messaging, and opening apps quite smoothly. There is a hint of lag and frame drop here and there, but, as I said — for the most part, the phone operates smoothly. If you’re someone who uses their phone for basic tasks, I don’t think you’ll face any issues here.
 


 For those curious about gaming and more demanding tasks, I’ll share those details in the full review soon, so keep an eye out for that. Also, the phone comes with UFS 2.2 storage and LPDDR4X RAM, which is what you typically find in a lot of phones in this price bracket. My unit has 6GB of RAM paired with 128GB of storage. It’s a reliable combo, so multitasking and app performance should feel decent overall. There's also a top variant with 8GB of RAM paired with 256GB of storage. On the software side, the Poco M7 Pro runs HyperOS on top of Android 14. Now, here’s where I think Poco could’ve done better. The company is offering two years of OS updates, which is fine, but they could have launched the phone with Android 15 out of the box. That would have been a nice touch, especially for a brand-new device. Another thing worth noting is that the phone comes with some bloatware — you know, those pre-installed apps you don’t always need. But the good news is that most of these apps can be uninstalled, so it’s not a huge problem. Let’s talk about battery life. The Poco M7 Pro packs a 5110mAh battery, which, from my early usage, seems like it’ll easily last more than a day for most people. If you’re someone who uses their phone moderately — like checking social media, watching videos, and taking calls — you’ll likely end the day with some juice left. The phone also supports 45W fast charging, and Poco includes a 45W charger in the box, which is always a plus. I haven’t had the chance to test how fast it charges yet, but I’ll share those details in the full review.
 


 Now, onto the cameras. The Poco M7 Pro has a dual-camera setup on the back. The main camera is a 50-megapixel Sony LYTIA LYT-600 sensor with OIS (optical image stabilisation), which is impressive at this price point. This should help with steadier shots, especially in low-light situations. The second sensor is a 2-megapixel macro camera, which is handy if you like capturing close-up shots. For selfies, Poco has included a 20-megapixel front camera, which is quite a solid choice for a phone in this segment. I haven’t spent enough time testing out the cameras fully yet, but from what I’ve seen so far, they seem capable. I’ll dive deeper into camera quality, battery performance, and everything else in the detailed review, so stay tuned for that. Overall, the Poco M7 Pro is shaping up to be a well-rounded phone for its price. It’s got a capable processor, a big battery, fast charging, and some good camera specs. I’ll share more thoughts once I’m done testing it fully, but for now, things are looking pretty good.Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Conclusion In the budget smartphone market, the Poco M7 Pro stands out, especially for its design and build. It has a sleek and modern look that makes it feel much more premium than its price would suggest. Plus, it’s not just about looks — Poco has managed to fit a 5,110mAh battery into this slim design, which is pretty impressive. 
 


 But here’s the thing — the budget segment is super competitive, and there are a lot of other phones that promise great value too. So, while my initial experience with the Poco M7 Pro has been quite positive, I’ll need to spend more time with it to see how it really performs in areas like camera quality, battery life, and gaming. If you’re thinking about getting this phone, I’d say it definitely has potential. But to really know if it’s the best option out there, I’ll be putting it through its paces and comparing it with other phones in the same price range. So stay tuned for my full review where I’ll share all the details!Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 17, 2024Also read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 moreAlso read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best flagship mobile phones in December 2024: Vivo X200 Pro 5G, iPhone 16 and more

But, the company is using the word series with it, which means that there are more phones. This will likely be the OnePlus 13R, something which the rumour mill has been suggesting for some time now.  The OnePlus 13 series will be introduced on January 7, which basically means that the device will debut in about two weeks. Alongside this device, the company will also unveil its flagship earbuds, OnePlus Buds Pro 3. Interestingly, these TWS earphones are already available in India, which suggests that the new version could just be a new variant with some extra features. OnePlus has also confirmed some features of the OnePlus 13, which confirms that the device will feature specs similar to the Chinese model. Here is everything you need to know.OnePlus 13: Specs, features The OnePlus 13, launched in China, comes with a 6.82-inch display, maintaining the same size as its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. The screen offers a 120Hz refresh rate and a QHD+ resolution, ensuring smooth visuals. It retains high brightness capabilities, reaching up to 1,600 nits in regular mode and an impressive 4,500 nits of peak brightness. Notably, two new features enhance the user experience: glove-friendly usability and a dynamic local high refresh rate. The glove compatibility feature is particularly beneficial for users in colder climates, such as Delhi during winter, allowing them to operate the device without removing their gloves. The local high refresh rate technology dynamically adjusts the screen’s refresh rate based on activity. For instance, when watching a video, the refresh rate may drop, while activities like scrolling through comments can trigger higher rates of 60Hz, 90Hz, or 120Hz for a smoother experience. At the heart of the OnePlus 13 is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. A significant upgrade in the OnePlus 13 is its battery capacity, which has been increased to 6,000mAh from the OnePlus 12’s 5,400mAh. OnePlus claims that this larger battery can provide nearly two days of use on a single charge. The device supports 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, and this year introduces magnetic wireless charging via compatible cases. On the camera front, the OnePlus 13 continues with the 50-megapixel LYT-808 primary sensor from its predecessor but sees an upgrade in its telephoto and ultrawide lenses, both of which now feature 50-megapixel sensors. The camera system, which bears Hasselblad branding, also supports 4K/60fps Dolby Vision video recording for enhanced video quality. The OnePlus 13 holds an IP68 and IP69 rating, meaning it is both water-resistant and capable of withstanding high-pressure water jets. Additional features include an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which offers more reliable unlocking even with wet hands, and a new advanced vibration motor for better gaming experience.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 17, 2024
