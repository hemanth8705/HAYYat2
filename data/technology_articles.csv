But, the 1800-ChatGPT feature is free for only 15 minutes. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-is-now-available-on-call-but-here-is-the-catch-2652073-2024-12-19,"OpenAI is offering users a new way to interact with its popular chatbot through a dedicated phone line: 1-800-CHATGPT. By dialing the US number (1-800-242-8478) or messaging via WhatsApp, users can now easily access the AI assistant through familiar communication channels. OpenAI announced the feature on Wednesday, emphasising that it provides a convenient and affordable way to explore ChatGPT. Initially, users will receive 15 minutes of free usage per month.
 


advertisement1800-ChatGPT: How does it work? Calls to the 1-800 number does not require an account, although OpenAI mentioned in a livestream that it is working on integrating WhatsApp messages with individual ChatGPT credentials for a more personalised experience. The tool was developed by the OpenAI team in just a few weeks, according to a company representative during the livestream. And the company has clearly stated that the phone calls will not be used to train the chatbot.
 


OpenAI views this new feature as a key step in making AI more accessible to newcomers, offering a simplified version of ChatGPT compared to its web-based platform. It provides an affordable way for users to experience technology through familiar channels. However, the company advises existing users who need more advanced features, higher usage limits, and personalisation options to continue using their regular ChatGPT accounts via traditional methods. The feature is currently exclusive for US users. 
 


Interestingly, Google launched a similar service in 2007 called GOOG-411, which provided free voice-based directory assistance. The service was discontinued in 2010 without an official explanation, but some speculate it was shut down once Google had collected enough voice data to improve its speech recognition technology. ChatGPT search can now be your default search engine In a similar development, ChatGPT Search will now be accessible to all users with an account on OpenAI's mobile apps and website. By offering an AI-driven alternative to traditional search engines, OpenAI aims to redefine the search experience, positioning itself as a formidable competitor to Google and other established players in the space. The integration of advanced natural language processing tools promises to enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results, making ChatGPT Search an appealing option for users looking for more than just a list of links. mbedded entity widgetmbedded entity mbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetEmbedded entity widgetPublished By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Trending Reel

In a recent post on Weibo, Instant Digital shared that their source confirmed the iPhone 17 Pro’s three-camera setup will remain in the triangular arrangement, even though the back of the phone will look different from earlier models. This directly challenges other recent reports coming out from China that claimed the new design would feature a horizontal bar or an elongated oval-shaped module. Apple’s triangular camera layout first appeared on the iPhone 11 Pro and was a big shift from the traditional vertical designs seen on earlier iPhones. The move to this layout wasn’t just about looks; it allowed Apple to fit in a third camera, which introduced the Ultra Wide lens, along with improved sensors and better overall performance. Since then, this triangular camera design has stuck around, shaping the look of every iPhone model up to the current iPhone 16 Pro. However, while the triangular layout might not be going away, the iPhone 17 Pro's design could still bring some big changes. According to Wayne Ma of The Information, the back of the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max may feature a new rectangular camera bump made out of aluminium instead of the usual 3D glass. The bottom half of the phone will reportedly remain glass to support wireless charging. If this is true, it would mark a big departure from Apple's traditional design choices. As mentioned above, Instant Digital has a mixed record when it comes to Apple leaks, but they’ve been right about some big details in the past. For example, they correctly predicted the 2023 launch of the Yellow iPhone 14, the frosted glass design of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and even the spatial video feature on the iPhone 15 Pro. They’ve also nailed details about the Apple Watch Series 9 and future iPads. While they’ve got things wrong before, their track record makes their insights worth paying attention to. So, while it seems clear that the iPhone 17 Pro’s design is changing, the exact details remain uncertain. For now, fans of the triangular camera layout can probably rest easy — or at least until Apple officially unveils the device. As with all rumours, it’s best to stay sceptical but curious.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

This flagship lineup will include the high-end OnePlus 13, the mid-range OnePlus 13R, and the new OnePlus Buds Pro 3 earbuds. Since the OnePlus 13 has already launched in the China market, ahead of the launch, we have a pretty good idea about what we can expect from the smartphone. There could be some little tweaks here and there, but we already know a lot about the OnePlus 13. Let’s dive into it.advertisementOnePlus 13: Specs and Features  DisplayThe OnePlus 13 features a 6.82-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and QHD+ resolution. It offers a peak brightness of 4,500 nits. There are also 2 standout upgrades to the OnePlus 13 over its predecessor. It includes:

- Dynamic local high refresh rate: The screen adjusts its refresh rate intelligently, conserving battery during less intensive tasks and ramping up for smoother performance during actions like scrolling.   Performance and battery Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The phone also packs a large 6,000mAh battery, a notable upgrade from the 5,400mAh unit in its predecessor, the OnePlus 12. OnePlus claims the battery can last nearly two days on a single charge.   For charging, the device supports 100W wired and 50W wireless charging, along with a new magnetic wireless charging feature via compatible cases. Camera specifications

While the 50-megapixel LYT-808 primary sensor remains unchanged, the telephoto and ultrawide cameras on the OnePlus 13 now feature 50-megapixel sensors as well.  The Hasselblad camera system also supports 4K/60fps Dolby Vision video recording. Build and other features

OnePlus 13’s durability gets a boost with IP68 and IP69 ratings. This means that the device is protected against dust and high-pressure water jets. Additional features include:  
- Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor: Allows unlocking the device even with wet hands.  
- Enhanced vibration motor: Designed for an immersive gaming experience.  OnePlus 13R and OnePlus Buds Pro 3 The OnePlus 13R will also be launching alongside the OnePlus 13 on January 7. The R-series by OnePlus caters to a more budget-friendly yet premium smartphone experience. While details about its specifications are scarce, it is expected to share some design and performance elements with the flagship model, albeit with scaled-down features. There are also rumours that the OnePlus Ace 5, which is scheduled to launch in China next week, will be rebranded as OnePlus 13R in India. Additionally, OnePlus will also be bringing the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 to the Indian market at the same event. These earbuds, already available in India, are likely to introduce a new variant with added features.OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R price and availability   While OnePlus hasn’t officially disclosed the pricing for the OnePlus 13, it is expected to stay under Rs 70,000, considering the OnePlus 12 was launched in India at Rs 64,999. The mid-range OnePlus 13R will likely offer a more affordable alternative. All devices will be available across major online and offline platforms post-launch.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

Here is everything we know about Nothing's next flagship phone, so far. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/nothing-phone-3-to-launch-next-year-price-specs-features-and-all-we-know-so-far-2652377-2024-12-19,"The Nothing Phone 3 has been delayed quite a bit. It was supposed to be launched earlier this year. It was then rumoured to be delayed by a few months, and then the company CEO Carl Pei clarified that we shouldn’t expect the Nothing flagship until 2025. All this delay was largely credited to an artificial intelligence (AI) integration that the company was working on. They said they wanted to get it right and not rush it. Fair point. However, we are now just days away from 2025, and the excitement for the Nothing Phone 3 is building once again.  Nothing has been fairly quiet about the Nothing Phone 3, but considering all the AI that has been teased for the phone, and that it is going to be the company’s next big flagship, there have been several reports that give us some idea what to expect from the phone.  The Nothing Phone 3 is expected to come with a bunch of new features, including an iPhone-like Action Button, and a 6.5-inch display, according to leaks. The Nothing Phone 3 is also expected to be accompanied by a Pro version –– the Nothing Phone 3 Pro –– which is believed to sport a larger 6.7-inch screen. The Action Button, inspired by a similar feature on the iPhone, is expected to offer customisable controls, enabling users to launch apps, switch settings, or create personalised shortcuts. This new feature underscores Nothing’s focus on user-centric innovations, and contemporary design trends.  While the Nothing Phone 2 uses a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset on a more premiumly-priced phone, the Phone 3 is anticipated to feature a more mid-range chipset, like the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 or MediaTek Dimensity 9200+. Which also gives us context about the possible pricing of the phone. The Nothing Phone 1 debuted in India at a starting price of Rs 32,999, while the Phone 2 missed the ball with a slightly higher price tag, where its base variant was priced starting Rs 44,999. The potential shift back to a mid-range offering could make the Phone 3 more accessible to a broader audience, while the Pro variant could cater to users seeking higher-end specifications. As per rumours, there is also going to be a third phone –– likely called the Nothing Phone 3a –– but rumours about it are still scarce. But the rumour does sound likely, considering Nothing launched the Nothing Phone 2a in India just earlier this year. You can also read our review of the Nothing Phone 2a.

According to the authorities, the company offered vague or insufficient information. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/netflix-fined-rs-423-crore-for-not-being-transparent-about-how-they-were-using-user-data-2652354-2024-12-19,"The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) has imposed a €4.75 million (Rs 42.35 crore) fine on Netflix for failing to adequately inform its customers about how their personal data was used between 2018 and 2020. The fine follows an investigation that began in 2019, revealing that the streaming giant did not meet the requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The DPA's investigation found that Netflix’s privacy policy lacked clarity, particularly in explaining how the company handled customer data. According to the authorities, the streaming service did not provide enough information in its privacy statement regarding the use and collection of personal data. Moreover, when customers enquired about the specifics of the data collected by Netflix, they were not given sufficient details. This lack of transparency constitutes a violation of the GDPR, which mandates that businesses must be clear about how personal information is handled and must respond appropriately when customers request data information.Netflix has objected to the fine The Dutch regulator emphasised that these shortcomings in Netflix’s data protection practices occurred between 2018 and 2020. The fine is a result of Netflix’s failure to meet its obligations under EU privacy laws during that period. In response to the fine, Netflix stated that it had been fully cooperative with the DPA throughout the investigation and had made significant improvements to its privacy policies. The company acknowledged that it had updated its privacy statement to offer greater transparency regarding how customer data is collected and used. Additionally, Netflix stressed that these changes were made proactively, long before the fine was issued. A spokesperson for Netflix informed Reuters, “Since the investigation began over five years ago, we have worked closely with the Dutch Data Protection Authority and continuously evolved our privacy information to provide greater clarity for our members. We have objected to this decision.”DPA against Netflix In a statement to another news agency, AFP, DPA chairman Aleid Wolfsen said: “A company like that, with a turnover of billions and millions of customers worldwide, has to explain properly to its customers how it handles their personal data. That must be crystal clear. Especially if the customer asks about this. And that was not in order.”  The data protection authority also noted that Netflix offered vague or insufficient information in various aspects. The regulator pointed out that Netflix was not clear about the purposes for collecting personal data, the sharing of data with third parties, the duration of data retention, and the security measures in place for data transfers outside of Europe. While Netflix has improved its transparency and compliance with GDPR regulations, the fine underscores the growing scrutiny of companies' handling of personal data, especially as data privacy continues to be a key issue in the digital age. This penalty marks a significant move by European regulators, who have been increasingly vigilant in enforcing GDPR rules against companies operating within the EU. The fine serves as a reminder that businesses must remain diligent in protecting personal data and providing customers with clear and comprehensive privacy policies.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  EU asks Apple to make more changes to the way iOS worksAlso read |  Apple has reportedly cancelled plans to launch an iPhone hardware subscription serviceAlso read |  Elon Musk says stop using hashtags on X because you don't need them and they look uglyMust Watch

This update is now gradually making its way to Nothing Phone 2 and Phone 2a users. If you own one of these devices, you may not see the update immediately as it’s being released in stages, so some users might have to wait several days or even weeks before it shows up. The company has mentioned that the rollout process could take until the end of the year to reach every device. To check if the update is available for your Nothing smartphone, you can manually look for it by heading to Settings > System Update. If it’s not there yet, don’t worry — it should arrive on your phone soon. The Nothing OS 3.0 stable update brings a lot of exciting features that aim to make the user experience smoother and more personal. One of the standout additions is the new Nothing Gallery app. It’s designed to help you find photos more easily with improved search options. You can also make quick edits to your pictures using simple tools like filters, markup, and smart suggestions. The lock screen has also been given a fresh look. You can now customise it to make it feel more like your own. One cool feature is the ability to add Shared Widgets to the lock screen, which lets you stay connected with friends and family. There’s also a Countdown Widget, so you can keep track of important events right from your lock screen. Another handy addition is the Smart Drawer, which uses AI to automatically organise your apps into folders. This can save you time by making it easier to find what you need. Other updates include revamped Quick Settings for faster access to controls, an improved Pop-up View for multitasking, and new system fonts that are cleaner and easier to read. While Nothing has revealed a lot of these features, they’ve hinted at other performance and visual improvements that haven’t been detailed yet. For those using other Nothing devices, there’s good news too. The update will roll out to the Nothing Phone 1, Nothing Phone 2a Plus, and CMF Phone 1 in early 2025.

The lineup includes the OnePlus Ace 5, which is expected to debut in India as the OnePlus 13R on January 7, 2025. While the Ace 5 Pro will also be unveiled in the series, the focus for Indian fans remains on the Ace 5, which will succeed the popular 12R model. This also puts the rumours to rest that suggested that OnePlus could be working on a ""mini"" smartphone, which was expected to launch as part of the Ace 5 series.  The OnePlus Ace 5 features an impressive set of features, making it an exciting device for gaming enthusiasts and power users alike. It is expected to come with a 6.78-inch BOE X2 8T LTPO display, offering a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Under the hood, the Ace 5 will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. But according to official China teasers, OnePlus is taking it up a notch by optimising the chip with its in-house “Fengchi Game Core” (translated from Chinese via Google Translate) technology. According to the company, this fine-tuning pushes the SoC’s performance to a level comparable to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.5, providing a smoother gaming experience with better power efficiency and heat management. In fact, the company claims the phone can maintain a steady 120fps frame rate even after five hours of heavy gaming. In terms of memory and storage, the OnePlus Ace 5 is expected to offer up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. A massive 6,000mAh battery is also rumoured, which should keep the phone going all day long. Charging won’t be an issue either, as the Ace 5 supports 100W fast-wired charging. For photos and videos, there could be a triple-camera setup on the back. The phone is expected to feature a 50-megapixel primary camera with OIS, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 2-megapixel macro lens. On the front, there will likely be a 16-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. The OnePlus Ace 5 will run on ColorOS 15 based on Android 15. However, the Indian version of the phone, i.e. the OnePlus 13R, is expected to boot OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15. Other features include an IR blaster along with the classic alert slider that many OnePlus fans love.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The rumour indicates that Apple plans to include the SE 4 in the iPhone 16 lineup and, might call it the iPhone 16e. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/iphone-se-4-may-be-called-the-iphone-16e-launch-timeline-price-and-all-we-know-2652121-2024-12-19,"A recent leak suggests that Apple might rebrand the upcoming toned-down version, iPhone SE 4, as the iPhone 16e. The speculations are that the phone could debut in March 2025. The Weibo tipster Fixed focus digital posted that the company may be dropping the SE branding altogether, and instead, it will add the SE 4 to the iPhone 16 line-up. The rumour has it that the phone is expected to carry several iPhone 16 features, including camera and display specs. If this holds to be true, the iPhone 16e makes a lot of sense. Let's delve deeper into the details of the upcoming iPhone 16e. advertisementiPhone SE 4 rebranding as iPhone 16e: What to expect It looks like the iPhone SE 4 or 16e is shaping up to be a significant upgrade compared to its predecessors. The shift from the iPhone 8-inspired design to one more in line with the iPhone XR or iPhone 12 will provide a more modern and immersive user experience. The larger 6.06-inch OLED display, compared to the previous 4.7-inch LCD, will enhance the overall viewing quality, making it more comparable to the high-end iPhones. The move away from the Touch ID home button in favour of Face ID is another major change, modernising the device further by slimming down the bezels. This will make the phone more in line with Apple's design language in their latest models. Additionally, the Weibo tipster also reveals that the iPhone 16e will have the same screen size as the standard iPhone 16 and will feature a full-screen design.

Additionally, the Weibo tipster also reveals that the iPhone 16e will have the same screen size as the standard iPhone 16 and will feature a full-screen design. With the rumoured A18 chipset, the 16e will have a substantial performance boost, bringing it closer to the iPhone 16 series in terms of processing power. The increase to 8GB of RAM (up from 4GB) is especially notable, offering better multitasking capabilities and support for more demanding apps, including Apple's latest AI and machine learning features. Combined with 128GB of storage, this represents a substantial upgrade in terms of performance and user experience. This update suggests that the iPhone 16e will be positioned as a more affordable but still powerful alternative for users who want the latest hardware in a more compact and budget-friendly package. The inclusion of a 48-megapixel rear camera in the iPhone 16e would be a major upgrade, aligning it with the capabilities of the iPhone 16. If the SE 4 or 16e indeed adopts the same camera setup, it would mark a significant leap for Apple’s budget-friendly lineup, offering a similar level of photography performance to the higher-end models. The 48-megapixel ""Fusion"" lens, as seen in the iPhone 16, allows for both high-quality standard and 2x zoom photos without sacrificing detail, which would be a notable feature for the 16e. This camera system could enable much sharper, more versatile photography, especially for users who are upgrading from older SE models that have more basic camera setups. Additionally, the 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera would improve selfies and video calls, further enhancing the device's overall imaging capabilities. This front camera is likely to bring improved depth-sensing and portrait mode features, thanks to its advanced technology. iPhone 16e or SE 4: India price (Expected) Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has revealed that Apple will begin mass production of the fourth-generation iPhone SE in December. The company plans to manufacture approximately 8.6 million units of the new model during the first quarter of 2025, with a possible launch in March or April, according to Kuo's recent blog post.  Leaks indicate that the iPhone SE 4 will be priced between $499 and $549, reflecting an increase from the iPhone SE 3’s starting price of $429. In India, where the SE 3 was launched at Rs 43,900, the iPhone 16e or SE 4 is expected to be priced between Rs 51,000 and Rs 56,000.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  iPhone 17 Pro design details leaked online, will Apple make changes to it?Also read |  Apple has reportedly cancelled plans to launch an iPhone hardware subscription serviceAlso read |  EU asks Apple to make more changes to the way iOS worksMust Watch

The JioTag Go is designed to help users track their belongings, such as keys, wallets, luggage, and more. It features Bluetooth v5.3 connectivity, and is powered by a CR2032 battery, which promises up to one year of usage.   When within Bluetooth range, users can activate the Play Sound option via the Find My Device app, prompting the tracker to emit a beeping noise for easy identification. If the tracker is outside Bluetooth range, the app uses the Find My Device network to show its last known location on a map, along with navigation assistance to reach the spot.   The compact device measures 38.2 x 38.2 x 7.2mm and weighs just 9g. However, the JioTag Go is only compatible with Android smartphones running Android 9 or later, excluding iPhone users.  Jio’s tracker evolution The JioTag Go is Reliance Jio's second foray into Bluetooth trackers this year. In July, the company launched the JioTag Air, which is compatible with Apple’s Find My network and supports both iPhones (iOS 14 and later) and Android devices. With these two trackers, Jio has strategically catered to users of both major ecosystems, broadening its market appeal.  JioTag Go: How it stacks up against Apple AirTag At Rs 1,499, the JioTag Go is significantly more affordable than Apple’s AirTag, which is priced at Rs 3,490 in India. While the AirTag offers advanced features like ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for precision tracking and seamless integration with Apple devices, the JioTag Go stands out as a cost-effective solution for Android users with reliable Bluetooth tracking and Find My Device network support.

This law aims to stop large tech companies from using their power unfairly. However, the European Union (EU) now wants Apple to do even more. The EU is asking Apple to make iOS work better with other platforms and to share features and technologies that are currently exclusive to Apple. According to Bloomberg, the European Commission released a document on Wednesday as part of its antitrust investigation into Apple. In the document, the EU lists specific changes it wants Apple to make. For example, it asks Apple to allow users to easily connect devices like smartwatches and headphones from other brands with iPhones. Right now, it’s often easier to use Apple accessories like AirPods and Apple Watches. The EU also wants Apple to let third-party apps work fully in the background. Currently, only Apple’s first-party apps can do this. The document also mentions that features like AirPlay and AirDrop should be open to devices that aren’t made by Apple. The EU has set a deadline of January 9, 2025, to review this case. If Apple doesn’t comply, the EU could start a formal investigation. This could lead to Apple paying fines of up to 10 per cent of its global annual revenue. That’s a huge amount of money for the company. Apple has responded by pushing back against the EU’s demands. In an online document, Apple argued that the DMA rules could harm user privacy and security. The company said it’s being unfairly targeted and claimed that opening up its technologies would make iPhones less safe. Apple also pointed out that companies like Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) have been asking for access to sensitive iOS features. Apple argues that if it grants all of Meta’s requests, it could allow apps like Facebook to track users’ calls, messages, and activities. The company said it has deliberately chosen not to collect this kind of data to protect its users. Meanwhile, Meta says it needs access to Apple’s features to improve products like Ray-Ban smart glasses and Meta Quest headsets. Apple counters by saying its current system already allows these devices to work with iPhones without any special permissions. This isn’t just an EU issue. In Brazil, regulators are also pushing Apple to open up its ecosystem. Apple is fighting that decision but might have to allow sideloading there as well. As the January 2025 deadline approaches, Apple’s next steps will be closely watched by regulators, developers, and users worldwide.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

However, reports suggest that Apple is no longer working on the project. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-has-reportedly-cancelled-plans-to-launch-its-iphone-hardware-subscription-service-2652085-2024-12-19,"Apple has reportedly stopped developing its much-anticipated iPhone hardware subscription service, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Initially unveiled in early 2022, the program was designed to offer users an alternative way to access Apple’s flagship devices by paying a recurring fee, enabling subscribers to receive a new iPhone each year. Despite its promising concept, the project has faced multiple delays and is now officially discontinued.   The service, which was part of Apple’s growing subscription ecosystem, was delayed due to technical challenges, including software bugs, and regulatory concerns. Originally slated for launch the same year, it was announced, which was 2022, the project has since been deprioritised, with team resources reportedly redirected to other initiatives within the company.   This decision comes on the heels of Apple’s discontinuation of Apple Pay Later , a feature that allowed users to split payments into instalments. Despite its recent launch, Apple Pay Later was shuttered after a brief run, signalling a potential shift in Apple’s approach to financial services tied to its hardware ecosystem.  Alternative payment options remain  While the hardware subscription service will not move forward, Apple continues to offer various payment plans for customers seeking flexibility in purchasing its devices. The iPhone Upgrade Program allows users to finance a new iPhone and AppleCare+ coverage over 24 months. Subscribers can upgrade to a new iPhone after making payments equivalent to 12 months.   For those with an Apple Card, Apple Card Monthly Installments provide another way to spread out the cost of new Apple products, including iPhones, over time. These options remain part of Apple’s strategy to make its devices accessible while maintaining customer loyalty.   The iPhone hardware subscription service represented a bold move to solidify Apple’s dominance in the smartphone market. By tying customers to a recurring payment model, the company could have ensured a steady revenue stream and reinforced user retention. However, the challenges of launching such a service in an increasingly scrutinized regulatory landscape may have outweighed its potential benefits.   Apple’s focus now appears to lean more heavily on its suite of digital subscription services, such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple One bundles. These offerings have proven successful in building a recurring revenue model while complementing the company’s hardware business.   Despite this strategic shift, Apple’s existing payment plans provide consumers with flexible alternatives, ensuring that its devices remain within reach for a broad audience. However, the shelving of the hardware subscription service may leave some wondering what could have been for the Cupertino tech giant.

Until now, it might have been the case that its devices were not powerful enough for AAA games. Now they are, and Apple might do well to create a new Apple TV that can challenge Xbox and PlayStation in gaming. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/talking-points/story/apple-needs-to-make-apple-tv-that-can-run-aaa-games-challenge-xbox-and-playstation-2651840-2024-12-18,"Technology journalists who keep a close eye on Apple know one thing with certainty every time they cover the company's call analysts after its quarterly results. They know that Gene Munster, an analyst, would ask Apple when the company is releasing its television. Munster has done that for years, quarter after quarter. But so far no television from Apple has appeared. Now, there are reports again that an Apple TV — the actual big-screen television and not the streaming box that Apple already sells — is in work again. Possibly, we will see an Apple television come out of the company's labs and factories in a few months, or more likely in a few years. But I believe that instead of a television it should create a different Apple TV.  A different Apple TV, which is more than a streaming box, is now such a low-hanging fruit that it would be almost a sacrilege on the part of Apple to not do it. All the ingredients are there for Apple to create an Apple TV that is not only a streaming box but is also a gaming console similar to the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.  Look at it from this angle: for a device like the Xbox Series X or the PlayStation 5 Pro, there are three essential components. One, is the chipset that gives these consoles the ability to run games. Two, the gaming ecosystem and availability of games people would want to play. And three, people willing to buy it. Apple already, I believe, has two of these components. The M4 is powerful enough In terms of hardware, Apple is already at the level of the latest Xbox and Playstation. The Xbox Series X has a chip made by AMD. It has a performance of around 12 Tflops. The PlayStation 5 Pro, which is a slightly beefed up variant of PS5, also has a chip made by AMD and that chip performs at around 16 Tflops. These numbers are in line with what the M4 Pro and the M4 Max, the latest Apple chips, can offer through their graphics units. The numbers for Apple chips range from 8 Tflops to 17 Tflops depending on the variant but it is safe to say that if Apple wants to have a chip that is equivalent to the chips in the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X  it can do so tomorrow just by tuning and binning one of the M4s. 

 



M4 Max is already as powerful as chipsets in the latest Xbox and PlayStation 5.
 In fact, Apple has chips that are significantly faster. The Ultra variant of the M3 has a graphics core that is already over 20 Tflops. And some variants of the M4 Ultra, which is bound to come out in 2025, are likely to be close to 30 Tflops, offering almost double the horsepower that PlayStation or Xbox can manage.  Apple has also, by putting these chips in the MacBook Pro and Mac Mini, demonstrated that they can go into small boxes without requiring elaborate cooling. In other words, except the economics that I am not privy to, nothing is stopping Apple from putting one of these ultra-fast M series chips in Apple TV and then turning that into a gaming console.  The third part of the equation — consumers — too I believe are there. According to some research firms, there are around 34 million Apple TVs in use in the US in 2024. Even if we are a little more conservative in estimates, it is safe to say that there would easily be around 55-60 million active Apple TVs worldwide, which is not a small number for a device that is not ""essential"" like an iPhone or Mac. In fact, Apple rarely promotes Apple TV and so far has been happy keeping it almost like a side project, updating it every two or three years. If this small box, apart from performing its streaming and entertainment duties, can also help people play AAA games, I am certain that it would find more favour among consumers. AAA games needed The tricky for Apple, however, is the second component: the availability of AAA games. But this too, I believe, can be solved by a more robust Apple TV. In recent years it has become important for Apple to crack the AAA games puzzle. The company is trying — hence Hideo Kojima at last year's WWDC in Cupertino — but so far the games haven't appeared. Nowadays whenever I am reviewing something with the M series chipset in it, I find that it is missing AAA games that hold it back. Something like a MacBook Pro M4 is an incredibly powerful laptop, but for a lot of regular consumers, it is an overkill. Less than stellar availability of top games is keeping a lot of consumers away from the MacBook Pro. A lot of people want to work and play. And not just work on their Rs 2 lakh laptop. Unless they are editing videos, or doing programming or running simulations, they don't need the power that chips like M4 Pro or the M4 Max offer.  An incredible list of AAA games — think the latest Call of Duty — will make Apple computers even more attractive than they are. And an Apple TV, which has a robust graphics chip, might entice more game developers to come to Apple camp and create games for it.  In a way — but not entirely because I think matters of business, Apple's cut in purchase and the entire cost-benefit ratio are also there — the lack of AAA games on Apple platforms could be a chicken and egg problem for game developers. What comes first? Games or the devices that can play them? Previously, Apple didn't have chipsets that could be used for serious gaming, and while it could always use a graphics chip by AMD or Nvidia to make its platform more gaming-friendly, probably the math never worked out. Now, however, Apple has an opportunity to do so.  Personally, in my drawing room under the TV I will love a device that can be a do-it-all box. Apple, I believe, has an opportunity to create one such box. The company can potentially call it Apple TV Pro. The price, obviously, will go up because such a box would also need a bigger chip and associated gaming hardware such as more storage. But if it competes with Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 Pro, which are priced above Rs 50,000, I am not sure if consumers would mind a reasonable hike in price.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

Priced at Rs 3,499, these outdoor speakers look cool and sound great. More details on it in this review by India Today Tech. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/xiaomi-sound-outdoor-speaker-review-affordable-price-great-sound-cool-design-2651719-2024-12-18,"Xiaomi recently launched a range of mid-budget devices in India, including the Redmi Note 14 series, Redmi Buds 6, and Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. We have reviewed the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ and the Redmi Buds 6. We have also been testing the Xiaomi speakers and it is such a fun device. At Rs 3,499, the speaker looks good, they are portable, they sound great, and of course, they are priced very well. Yes, the speaker has some issues, but they are smaller things that aren't ignorable –– for most people. Let’s get into the details. advertisementXiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: The good thingsThe Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is a total green flag at this price segment. It is equipped with a 30W driver with dual subwoofer. Weighing 597g, the device is light and easily portable. The speaker is enveloped with a grille structure that helps grip the device easily. Additionally, it has an in-built loop to make it easier to carry. By the looks of it, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor design is similar to the Sony ULT Field 1, which is priced at Rs 16,990. The Xiaomi speaker is cylindrical and sleek –– a design that quickly catches the eye. We received the black variant, but it is also available in blue and red.

 



The Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker’s body has a running grille pattern with its branding etched on the face.
While other colours feature a monochromatic pattern, this one has an orange strap in contrast. The strap runs along the back of the device like a spine and sports three buttons: power, Bluetooth and linking. All these buttons require a long press to function. For instance, you have to long press the power button for 3 seconds to switch the speakers on or off. It goes the same for Bluetooth settings as well. There are three additional buttons placed on the mesh of the speakers that are dedicated for play/pause, increasing and decreasing volume. The buttons are clicky and offer good haptic feedback. 

 



The connect button can only be used with multiple Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. Long press the connect button on the strap for 3s on each speaker, and all speakers will pair automatically playing the same content. The Type-C charging port is also placed on the strap.
For durability, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor comes with IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Overall, Xiaomi's latest speaker offers a solid, well-built design that stands out in both form and function. advertisementBut this is not its best part. The best part is its “big speaker energy”. For its size and price, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is capable of filling small to medium-sized rooms pretty well. It delivers a clear and consistent sound quality. The bass delivers a strong punch without overshadowing the mids and highs, maintaining a well-balanced sound profile. This ensures that the audio output remains clear and detailed across different frequencies and a wide range of music genres. 
 


At a price of Rs 3,499, it is equipped with dual large subwoofer radiators on both the sides for a fuller and richer bass sound. Whether you're listening to bass-heavy tracks or more vocal-centric tunes, the sound is dynamic and full, with no one element dominating.The speaker is also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, offering stable connections. It is super easy to connect to the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker. Additionally, the speaker includes a 3.5mm audio jack, providing the flexibility for wired connections, further enhancing its versatility. advertisementComing to the battery life, this speaker does a good job. With a full charge and volume set between 80-90 percent, the speaker offers up to 10 hours of playback, making it ideal for most scenarios such as parties, day outings, or even an entire workday. I took the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker to a party and it played music for 4 hours non-stop. In that time, its battery dropped only 20 per cent. 
 


Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: Things that could be betterAs we mentioned above, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is great, but it has a few drawbacks. The speakers are missing LED indicators. Sure, it isn’t a critical feature, but it definitely adds more functionality to the design. And since we are talking about what could be, some RGB lights on it would be a cool addition. And no, at its price, expecting RGB lights isn’t outrageous. Boat Stone Spinx Pro sports dynamic RGB lights, and the speaker is priced at Rs 2,499. advertisementA subjectively bigger flaw in the speaker is that it only connects via Bluetooth. There are no AUX or other connectivity options.  Xiaomi Sound Outdoor: Should you buy it? For fear of repeating ourselves a third time, Xiaomi Sound Outdoor isn't perfect, but its list of Pros is definitely longer than the Cons. The speaker has great design and sound quality, a solid battery life, and it’s water-resistant. With all that, at Rs 3,499, the speaker comes highly recommended from our side.

The strap runs along the back of the device like a spine and sports three buttons: power, Bluetooth and linking. All these buttons require a long press to function. For instance, you have to long press the power button for 3 seconds to switch the speakers on or off. It goes the same for Bluetooth settings as well. There are three additional buttons placed on the mesh of the speakers that are dedicated for play/pause, increasing and decreasing volume. The buttons are clicky and offer good haptic feedback. 

 



The connect button can only be used with multiple Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speakers. Long press the connect button on the strap for 3s on each speaker, and all speakers will pair automatically playing the same content. The Type-C charging port is also placed on the strap.

 For durability, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor comes with IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Overall, Xiaomi's latest speaker offers a solid, well-built design that stands out in both form and function.  But this is not its best part. The best part is its “big speaker energy”.  For its size and price, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is capable of filling small to medium-sized rooms pretty well. It delivers a clear and consistent sound quality. The bass delivers a strong punch without overshadowing the mids and highs, maintaining a well-balanced sound profile. This ensures that the audio output remains clear and detailed across different frequencies and a wide range of music genres. 
 


 At a price of Rs 3,499, it is equipped with dual large subwoofer radiators on both the sides for a fuller and richer bass sound. Whether you're listening to bass-heavy tracks or more vocal-centric tunes, the sound is dynamic and full, with no one element dominating. The speaker is also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, offering stable connections. It is super easy to connect to the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker. Additionally, the speaker includes a 3.5mm audio jack, providing the flexibility for wired connections, further enhancing its versatility.  Coming to the battery life, this speaker does a good job. With a full charge and volume set between 80-90 percent, the speaker offers up to 10 hours of playback, making it ideal for most scenarios such as parties, day outings, or even an entire workday. I took the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker to a party and it played music for 4 hours non-stop. In that time, its battery dropped only 20 per cent. 
 


Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker: Things that could be better As we mentioned above, the Xiaomi Sound Outdoor speaker is great, but it has a few drawbacks.  The speakers are missing LED indicators. Sure, it isn’t a critical feature, but it definitely adds more functionality to the design. And since we are talking about what could be, some RGB lights on it would be a cool addition. And no, at its price, expecting RGB lights isn’t outrageous. Boat Stone Spinx Pro sports dynamic RGB lights, and the speaker is priced at Rs 2,499.  A subjectively bigger flaw in the speaker is that it only connects via Bluetooth. There are no AUX or other connectivity options.  Xiaomi Sound Outdoor: Should you buy it?  For fear of repeating ourselves a third time, Xiaomi Sound Outdoor isn't perfect, but its list of Pros is definitely longer than the Cons. The speaker has great design and sound quality, a solid battery life, and it’s water-resistant. With all that, at Rs 3,499, the speaker comes highly recommended from our side.

One of the rising concerns is the increasing number of QR code scams, which are catching people off-guard. Scammers are tricking users into scanning fraudulent QR codes, leading to the loss of large sums of money in seconds. Here is how QR code scams work and how you can protect yourself from them.advertisementHow do QR code scams work?QR codes are typically seen as a quick and easy way to make payments, but they have become a tool for scammers. In a QR code scam, the victim is presented with a fake or malicious QR code, often in places where trust is assumed, such as local shops, delivery services, or social media platforms. A scammer generates a QR code that appears to be linked to a legitimate transaction but instead triggers a money transfer to the scammer’s account. The victim scans the code, thinking they are paying for a product or service, but unknowingly authorises a transfer of funds to the scammer. A QR code could also include a fake APK link, which can ask you to download a malicious app or software to gain access to your bank details and other personal data. In some cases, this automatically downloads onto your device once you click on the fake URL present in the QR codes.

Do this to avoid QR code scams in online payments When making a UPI payment, it is better to transfer money directly to the recipient's verified UPI ID or mobile number instead of relying on QR codes, especially if you are unsure of the source. Scammers often exploit the trust people place in QR codes to disguise fraudulent transactions. Be cautious of scanning QR codes in unfamiliar locations or businesses that seem suspicious. Scammers can easily place fake QR codes in public places like restaurants, kiosks, or markets. Always ensure that the QR code belongs to a legitimate and trusted merchant before proceeding with the payment. For additional safety, consider creating a separate bank account that you link solely to your UPI platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe, or Paytm. Keep only a minimal amount (e.g., Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000) in this account. Even if a scam occurs, this measure limits the amount of money you can lose. This approach adds an extra layer of protection to your main savings account, ensuring larger amounts remain untouched in case of fraud. If you receive any suspicious payment requests or links, be sure to cross-check the URL or payment details. Fraudulent links often contain minor spelling errors or unusual domain names that differ from official websites. Taking a moment to verify can save you from falling into a scam.

Recently, there have been multiple incidents of scams involving QR codes, including a case where a police officer lost Rs 2.3 lakh after scanning a fraudulent QR code at a bakery. Now, a new scam involving DHL package delivery has surfaced, causing concerns among citizens who are receiving suspicious notifications. A DHL package delivery notice has been circulating on WhatsApp and X (previously Twitter), warning people not to scan the QR code printed on the paper. The message reads, ""New scam. They will leave this at the door. Do not scan the QR code.""  According to people who have received this poster, this notice is being delivered to their doorstep, which includes a QR code and a prompt to ""re-arrange your delivery now by following 3 simple steps."" The first step asks recipients to scan the QR code to visit the DHL website, followed by entering their DHL Waybill number to choose delivery options.  However, DHL has cleared up the confusion. The company's official DHL Express India account on X (formerly Twitter) responded to a tweet about the so-called scam, clarifying that this notice is legitimate. While this may not be a scam, it is important to remember that QR code scams are the easiest way for scammers to dupe people because these codes could include a malicious link, which a user can click and lose big money in any other scam. ""The paper in the shared image is a legitimate Customer Notification document issued by DHL Express and is commonly referred to as a Not Home (NH) card,"" DHL stated, explaining that the notice is from DHL Singapore and is not a scam. While the paper notice is authentic, a separate scam involving a fake DHL SMS is also making rounds. The fraudulent text message claims, ""Your package is currently processing at our facility. For the most up-to-date information on import charges, please visit our website: http://dhlhub.com.""   The URL in the SMS is not an official DHL link, suggesting that this is a scam aimed at deceiving users into clicking on a malicious link. To protect themselves, users are advised to be cautious when interacting with QR codes, links, and messages from unknown sources. Checking for minor details such as incorrect URLs, poorly written English, or unusual fonts can help identify a scam. It is always safer to verify the legitimacy of such messages directly through official channels or customer service to avoid falling victim to these schemes.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

For anyone looking to get a stylish, feature-packed phone without burning a hole in their pocket, this one might just be worth your consideration. Poco has always focused on delivering speed, power, and value, and this phone seems to stick to that winning formula. Here's a quick look at the 4 reasons why you should consider buying the Poco M7 Pro and one reason you might want to think twice.advertisementPoco M7 Pro 5G: 4 reasons to buyA stunning 120Hz displayThe Poco M7 Pro 5G comes with a 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED display that is not only smooth, thanks to its 120Hz refresh rate, but also incredibly bright for a phone in the sub-Rs 15,000 price segment. With a peak brightness of 2,100 nits, Poco claims this to be one of the brightest displays in its price segment. That means you can comfortably use the phone outdoors in bright sunlight without any issues (though I’ll have to wait for a sunny day to test it myself!). Rest assured, the colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and the overall experience is top-notch for streaming, gaming, and everyday use.

Rest assured, the colours are vibrant, the videos look sharp, and the overall experience is top-notch for streaming, gaming, and everyday use. Sleek and lightweight design Poco has nailed the design with this phone. The M7 Pro feels great to hold, thanks to its lightweight build and slim profile. It doesn’t have a glass back like its predecessor, but the plastic back with a pastel two-tone finish still looks gorgeous. The Lavender shade, in particular, stands out without being flashy. It’s a phone you’d enjoy carrying around. It feels comfortable, easy to handle, and doesn’t weigh you down like some bulky devices in this range. Reliable performance and battery life Under the hood, the Poco M7 Pro 5G packs the MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra processor, which delivers good performance for daily tasks. Whether you’re scrolling through social media, messaging, or running basic apps, the phone runs smoothly. It also has up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which ensures multitasking is hassle-free. On the battery front, Poco has included a 5110mAh battery that easily lasts over a day with moderate usage. The icing on the cake is the 45W fast charging support, and yes, the charger is included in the box! 50MP camera with OIS Cameras are often a deciding factor when buying a phone, and Poco delivers well here. The M7 Pro has a 50MP Sony LYTIA LYT-600 primary camera with OIS (optical image stabilisation), which is a rare feature in this price range. This means steadier photos and videos, especially in low-light conditions. There’s also a 2MP macro camera for close-up shots and a 20MP selfie camera that does a decent job for video calls and selfies.Poco M7 Pro 5G: 1 reason to skip Limited software support Now, here’s the catch — while the Poco M7 Pro 5G runs on Android 14 with HyperOS, Poco is only promising two years of OS updates along with four years of security patches. That means the phone will get main OS updates only up to Android 16. In a world where brands like Samsung offer longer update cycles even on budget phones, this feels like a missed opportunity. To make matters worse, the phone doesn’t come with Android 15 out of the box, which would have been a nice touch for a brand-new device.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

They can mislead people into clicking on videos, only to find content that doesn't match their expectations.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/new-youtube-rules-in-india-as-platform-bans-videos-with-clickbait-titles-2652709-2024-12-20,"YouTube is stepping up its fight against misleading content, especially in India. The platform recently announced that it will be cracking down on videos with misleading titles and thumbnails, often called ""egregious clickbait."" This is part of YouTube's ongoing effort to ensure viewers have a trustworthy experience when they visit the platform, particularly for news and current events. What does this mean for creators? Essentially, YouTube plans to increase enforcement against videos whose title or thumbnail promises something the actual video does not deliver. For instance, a video titled ""The President Has Resigned!"" might attract attention. However, if the video itself doesn't discuss such a resignation, it would fall under the category of ""egregious clickbait."" Similarly, a thumbnail that claims ""Top Political News"" but features no real news would also be flagged. Clickbait titles and thumbnails have long been a frustration for YouTube viewers. They can mislead people into clicking on videos, only to find content that doesn't match their expectations. This not only wastes time but also erodes trust in the platform. YouTube says that this issue becomes even more serious when it involves breaking news or current events, as people often rely on the platform to get timely and accurate information during important moments. To address this, YouTube will start rolling out stricter measures in India over the coming months. The company explained that this gradual rollout will give creators time to adapt to the new rules. Initially, YouTube will focus on removing videos that violate the new policy without issuing strikes against creators' channels. The goal is to educate creators and help them adjust their content to align with the updated guidelines. One of the reasons for starting this enforcement in India is the high volume of news and current events-related content uploaded by Indian creators. As YouTube's user base in India continues to grow, the platform wants to ensure that viewers are not being misled by sensational or dishonest titles and thumbnails. The new policy will prioritise recent uploads, meaning older videos that violate the rules may not be the immediate focus of enforcement. However, creators are encouraged to review their existing content and make the necessary adjustments to avoid future issues. YouTube is also planning to offer educational resources to help creators understand what qualifies as ""egregious clickbait"" and how to stay compliant with the platform's policies. For viewers, this is a welcome move. Misleading titles and thumbnails often leave people feeling tricked or frustrated. By enforcing these new rules, YouTube hopes to create a better experience for its users, where they can trust the videos they click on to deliver the content they were promised. As these changes are rolled out, it will be interesting to see how creators in India respond and adapt to the new guidelines.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

 The teaser gave us a glimpse of how the AI preserves details, even during rapid movements. For instance, when Mosseri moved his arms or face, the edited elements like his outfit and added objects remained impressively intact. But as polished as these previews look, we've seen similarly dazzling demos from competitors like OpenAI’s Sora, which when released, didn’t fully meet expectations.

The Movie Gen AI model was unveiled in October. At the time of launch, the company had said that the AI model aims to “preserve human identity and motion”. While the timeline for its wider availability remains unclear, Instagram’s Adam Mosseri says it will roll out sometime next year. The feature enters a competitive space, going head-to-head with other AI video tools like Adobe’s Firefly, which is already making waves with beta text-to-video editing in Premiere Pro.When is the big launch? Adman Mosseri revealed in his Instagram announcement that the AI tool is expected to roll out in 2025. The exact timeline for the launch has not been revealed. We are hoping the tool will start rolling out soon because if the final product lives up to its teaser, creators could soon edit videos with unprecedented ease, making Instagram a more dynamic playground for creativity.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Trending Reel

With online scams becoming more frequent, this initiative is a step toward ensuring safer digital transactions for everyone. Shield offers a comprehensive protection plan that safeguards users from fraud, phishing attempts, and unauthorised transactions, even if the user loses their phone. What makes Shield appealing is its accessibility and affordability. For the first 30 days, users can enjoy the service for free. After the trial period, it costs just Rs 19 per month, which is a small price to pay for peace of mind. The plan provides coverage of up to Rs 5,000 against fraudulent activities. Getting started with Shield is easy. The service is available on the BharatPe app, which can be downloaded on both Android and iOS devices. Users can activate Shield directly from the app’s homepage by clicking on the relevant banner. However, first-time users must make a payment of at least Rs 1 to any contact or business to activate the feature. If a user faces a fraudulent situation, registering a claim is also straightforward. BharatPe has partnered with OneAssist to streamline the process. Users can either download the OneAssist app or call their toll-free number, 1800-123-3330, to report the incident. However, there’s a crucial requirement — users must report the fraud within 10 days of it happening to be eligible for a claim. Depending on the situation, certain documents may need to be submitted, such as a UPI transaction statement, a copy of the police report or FIR, a claim form, and proof of blocking the UPI account. Additional documents might be required, depending on the nature of the fraud. In today’s world, where digital payments have become a part of daily life, initiatives like Shield are a much-needed safety net. While this service provides valuable protection, users must still stay vigilant. Avoid clicking on unknown links, downloading apps from unverified sources, or sharing sensitive payment information with strangers. BharatPe’s Shield is a timely and thoughtful addition to the digital payment ecosystem. With an increasing number of people like you and me relying on UPI for everything from grocery shopping to bill payments, having a safety net like Shield is reassuring. While it can’t eliminate the risk entirely, it’s a practical step toward making digital transactions safer for everyone.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

A live image of the Oppo Reno 13 has surfaced, showcasing a deep blue or purple colour that looks nothing short of stunning. This new shade, which isn’t available in China, is likely aimed at grabbing attention in India, where unique colour options often create a buzz amongst buyers. The leaked image shows the Reno 13 with its signature triple-camera setup labelled “AI” and a ring-shaped flashlight positioned next to the lenses. What makes this design stand out is how the camera bump seamlessly blends with the phone’s glass back, giving it a premium, unified look. The edges of the phone feature visible antenna bands, hinting at a metal frame. Another interesting detail is the subtle glow around the camera setup, which adds to the phone's charm.

It's somewhat of a crackdown, but not as harsh as Netflix’s rule for piggybackers. Essentially, Amazon says that starting January 2025, Amazon Prime subscribers will only be able to login to 5 devices per account, of which only two devices can be televisions. Which means, you can only be running your Prime video account on two TVs simultaneously, the minute you login to a third, you will be prompted to log out of your other devices.  “As part of your Prime membership, you and your household are entitled to enjoy Prime Video on up to five devices. Starting January 2025, we are updating our usage terms in India to include up to two TVs as part of your five devices entitlement. You can manage your devices on your Settings page or buy another Prime membership to watch Prime Video on more devices,” Amazon’s new policy note reads. Currently, the Prime subscribers are allowed to be logged into 10 devices at a time. As for the devices, these include phones, laptops, tablets, and TVs. The account will be supported on all devices as usual, however, at one time, Prime subscribers will only be able to access Prime Video on 5 devices, which includes 2 TVs.  Amazon’s new policy also states that you can “remove, and replace, up to 2 existing devices in any 30 day period”. Basically, if you have devices registered to your account (example, for streaming or using Amazon services), you are allowed to deregister or delete up to two devices from your account within a 30-day period. You can also replace or add 2 new devices to your account in place of the ones you removed during the same 30-day window. Essentially, you can manage or swap out two devices every 30 days. This likely aims to limit frequent changes, ensuring better control over device registration and account security. Amazon Prime membership plans in India start at Rs 299 per month, Rs 599 for a quarterly subscription, and Rs 1499 for an annual membership. Additional options include the Annual Prime Lite plan priced at Rs 799 and the Prime Shopping Edition available for Rs 399 per year. After the policy change, which will be applicable in January 2025, membership benefits for Prime Video will include unlimited ad-free streaming and access on up to five devices, with support for up to two TVs.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also read |  YouTube says it will remove videos in India that have clickbait titles and thumbnailsAlso read |  Instagram teases AI video editing tool that will change backgrounds, outfits with a simple text promptAlso read |  Nvidia's most affordable Gen AI supercomputer, Jetson Orin Nano, is here: What is it and how it works

This time, the company plans to cut 10 per cent of the managerial roles. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-layoffs-ceo-sundar-pichai-announces-10-per-cent-job-cuts-says-it-is-to-boost-efficiency-2652915-2024-12-20,"In a significant development at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai has announced a reduction of 10 per cent in management and vice president-level roles. The decision is part of a broader organisational restructuring aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and aligning resources with the company's strategic priorities. According to a report by Business Insider, this move underscores Google's commitment to streamlining its workforce amid ongoing economic challenges.   According to two individuals familiar with the matter, Pichai stated that Google has implemented changes over the past few years to streamline operations and improve efficiency, as per the report. It also stated that Pichai highlighted a 10 per cent reduction in managerial, director, and vice president roles as part of these efforts. The recent changes emphasise Google’s ongoing efforts to optimise its operations in response to growing competition, especially from AI-focused companies like OpenAI, which are posing a challenge to its leadership in the search market. During the same meeting, Pichai discussed the evolution of Google’s corporate culture, recognising the need to reassess the company’s defining value of “Googleyness.” This cultural transformation is designed to better align with the demands of today’s business environment and respond to competitive pressures, particularly those arising from the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. The changes underscore Google’s dedication to cultivating a culture that promotes agility and innovation in an ever-evolving industry. The restructuring comes on the heels of broader cost-cutting measures implemented by major tech companies over the past year. Google, despite its robust market position and strong revenue streams, is not immune to the economic headwinds facing the tech industry. Rising inflation, slowing ad revenues, and global uncertainties have prompted the company to reassess its workforce and operational strategies.   Google’s restructuring follows a trend seen among other tech giants. Amazon, for example, has focused on reducing middle management layers under CEO Andy Jassy, with an emphasis on empowering individual contributors and speeding up decision-making. These approaches, widely adopted across the tech sector, are intended to foster innovation and enable companies to adapt more rapidly to technological progress. This is not the first time Google has resorted to layoffs in recent months. Google has been focused on improving efficiency for over two years. In September 2022, Pichai set a goal for the company to become 20 per cent more efficient. The following January, this initiative led to a historic round of layoffs, resulting in the elimination of 12,000 jobs. As Google implements these changes, the tech giant is also exploring ways to optimise its operations further, including investments in automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity.

This new sharing option bridges the gap between creating and connecting, allowing users to quickly show off their creations or collaborate on ideas. While these updates are rolling out across all platforms, mobile users will need to wait a little longer to access the redesigned homepage. Despite this slight delay, the improved features are already making a big impact for desktop users, with many appreciating the speed and convenience the latest updates bring.  If you’re curious about trying AI-powered image creation, these updates make Bing Image Creator much easier to use. Whether you’re playing around with AI art for fun, working on a project, or just seeing what it can do, these changes help make the process quicker and less complicated.

This new integration allows users to chat with ChatGPT directly through WhatsApp, without needing to open a separate app or website. If you’re wondering how to get started, the process is simple and user-friendly. OpenAI has made it very easy for anyone to connect with ChatGPT on WhatsApp. All it takes is a few quick steps, and you’re ready to chat. To begin, you’ll need to scan a QR code attached in the image below. This QR code is also available on OpenAI’s official website.   Once you scan it, you’ll be redirected to WhatsApp, where you can start chatting with ChatGPT. It’s important to make sure you’re interacting with the official ChatGPT account. How can you check? The official account will have a blue verification badge next to its name, and the phone number will be 1-800-242-8478. These details confirm that you’re chatting with the real ChatGPT and not a fake account. Once you’ve verified these details, you can start typing your messages and enjoy the experience. Using ChatGPT on WhatsApp is as straightforward as chatting with a friend. You simply type your questions or requests, and the chatbot responds almost instantly. Whether you’re looking for answers to specific questions, help with writing, or general information, ChatGPT is there to assist you. The convenience of having this powerful AI tool in a platform you already use daily is a game-changer for many users. However, there are some limitations to keep in mind. Currently, you can’t link your paid ChatGPT Plus account to WhatsApp. The integration is free for everyone to use, but there are daily limits on the number of messages you can send. If you hit these limits, you’ll receive a notification letting you know. For those who need more extensive use or access to additional features, the ChatGPT app or website remains an option. It’s also worth noting that the version of ChatGPT available on WhatsApp is powered by the GPT-4o mini model. This ensures efficient and accurate interactions, but it’s slightly scaled down compared to the full GPT-4 model available through OpenAI’s other platforms. Despite this, the chatbot is more than capable of handling a wide range of queries and tasks.

At the heart of this conflict lies Qualcomm's strategy to reduce its reliance on Arm’s technology, with the potential for billions in savings if successful. However, the case also holds major implications for Qualcomm’s future in the laptop market, its relationship with Arm, and the broader chip ecosystem that relies heavily on Arm’s architecture.advertisementThe Case: Qualcomm’s Nuvia acquisitionIn 2021, Qualcomm acquired Nuvia, a chip startup founded by former Apple engineers, for a substantial $1.4 billion. The acquisition was part of Qualcomm's strategy to challenge Intel and reduce its dependence on Arm, which has long provided the foundation for Qualcomm's chip designs. Qualcomm believed that by acquiring Nuvia, it could create custom chip designs more optimised for mobile and computing devices, particularly in the competitive laptop market.However, Arm, which licenses the architecture for most mobile and computing chips, objected to Qualcomm’s use of Nuvia’s designs, claiming that Qualcomm’s acquisition of the startup violated their licensing agreement. The core of the dispute hinges on whether Nuvia's technology is sufficiently independent of Arm’s architecture or if it is derivative, and therefore subject to Arm's licensing terms. Arm is arguing that Qualcomm should destroy all Nuvia technology developed under a license that it terminated, which Qualcomm disputes.

The core of the dispute hinges on whether Nuvia's technology is sufficiently independent of Arm’s architecture or if it is derivative, and therefore subject to Arm's licensing terms. Arm is arguing that Qualcomm should destroy all Nuvia technology developed under a license that it terminated, which Qualcomm disputes. According to industry analyst Prakash Sangam, who is covering the trial on grounds, the case currently focuses on three key questions that must be resolved unanimously by the jury: 1. Whether Nuvia breached section 15.1(a) of Nuvia's Agreement with Arm (ALA) — a provision relating to the protection of Arm's confidential information after the agreement’s termination.
2. Whether Qualcomm itself has breached this provision — despite the fact that Qualcomm was never a party to the Nuvia ALA, Arm claims that since Qualcomm benefits from the technology, it should be held liable.
3. Whether Qualcomm’s products are covered under Qualcomm’s own license with Arm — Qualcomm’s counterclaim aims to protect itself from any future legal actions regarding the use of Nuvia’s technology. At the heart of this battle is the potential for Qualcomm to save significant sums on royalty payments to Arm — estimated at $1.4 billion annually — by moving away from Arm’s designs. This savings would come from Qualcomm’s reliance on Nuvia’s custom computing cores, developed by a team that previously worked on Apple’s iconic chip designs.There is also a Qualcomm vs Apple angle here  Apple's custom silicon is a major player in this legal battle. With the introduction of the M1 and M2 chips, Apple transformed its entire product lineup, leaving traditional chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm scrambling to keep up. Which is why, Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia is a huge driving force behind the company’s ambition to challenge Apple’s dominance in the laptop and mobile chip markets. This also forced Qualcomm to enter the PC chip market so it could counter Apple's investments in its own custom silicon.  The acquisition of Nuvia and the use of its technology could allow Qualcomm to create chips tailored for Windows devices, offering an alternative to Intel’s x86 architecture and Apple’s ARM-based silicon. Qualcomm's CEO, Cristiano Amon, testified that this move was essential for Qualcomm to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving market, and the $1.4 billion savings projected from moving away from Arm royalties would be critical in funding this push. Basically, if Qulcomm succeeds in defending its use of Nuvia's tech, it could create a more diverse and competitive market for PC chips, giving Microsoft an alternative to Apple’s tight ecosystem. However, if Arm prevails, Qualcomm may be forced to abandon its plans to use Nuvia’s designs, which would further cement Apple’s dominance in the chip market.The larger picture: Implications in the global chip market The outcome of the Qualcomm vs Arm battle could have significant ripple effects across the chip industry. Arm’s architecture is the foundation for billions of devices, from smartphones to servers, and any shift in the relationship between Qualcomm and Arm could alter the dynamics of the entire market. Qualcomm’s efforts to develop its own computing cores could open the door for other companies to follow suit, reducing their reliance on Arm and potentially leading to more competition in chip design. At the same time, if Qualcomm is forced to comply with Arm’s demands and destroy Nuvia’s technology, it could create a precedent that limits the ability of chipmakers to innovate independently of their licensing agreements.  But what’s most interesting here is that the Qualcomm vs Arm battle is not just about one company's acquisition of a startup — it’s a fight for the future of chip design, with profound implications for the competition between Apple, Qualcomm, and other major players in the tech industry. We don’t know what direction this trial will take, but the outcome could (re)shape the global chip market and the devices that we use.

This new feature lets users get real-time assistance directly within their favourite apps, enhancing productivity and workflow.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/chatgpt-for-macos-now-compatible-with-apple-notes-and-other-apps-2653472-2024-12-21,"OpenAI has introduced a new update for the ChatGPT app on macOS. On Thursday, the company announced that its popular AI chatbot now works with several note-taking and coding applications. This new feature, described by OpenAI as agentic, allows ChatGPT to access on-screen information in these supported apps and assist users with their queries in real time. Currently, this feature is available only to paid subscribers of ChatGPT, including those on the Plus, Pro, Teams, Enterprise, and Edu plans. However, OpenAI has reassured users on the free tier and Windows users that they won’t be left behind for long. The update will roll out to them sometime next year.  OpenAI revealed this update as part of its 12-day shipping event, where the company has been releasing new features and improvements for its platforms daily. The announcement was made on day 11 through a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Kevin Weil, the Chief Product Officer at OpenAI, shared additional details about the feature, emphasising that ChatGPT can now work with approximately 30 macOS apps. The supported ones include Apple Notes, BBEdit, VSCode Insiders, Notion, Quip, and more specialised coding apps like MatLab, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.  So, whether you’re jotting down ideas in a note-taking app or debugging code in a developer tool, ChatGPT can now assist without users needing to switch between applications. Here’s how it works — once the feature is activated, users can open any supported app and use the shortcut Option + Space. This opens a compact ChatGPT window that appears over the app. The AI can then see the same information the user sees on the screen. From there, users can interact with ChatGPT by typing queries or using the Advanced Voice Mode. For example, if a user highlights a specific section of text or code in the app, they can ask ChatGPT for help by using natural language commands like “how can I improve this?” or “what does this code do?” The chatbot understands the context and responds accordingly. This makes it easier for users to get real-time feedback or explanations without disrupting their workflow. While OpenAI calls this feature “agentic,” the technology behind it is more vision-based. ChatGPT doesn’t actually interact with the apps themselves — it can’t write new text, edit code, or make changes to any existing content. Its role is purely advisory, based on what it sees on the screen. Privacy has been a top concern for OpenAI with this update. Users will have full control over when and which apps ChatGPT can access. OpenAI has also assured users that the data collected during these interactions will be handled just like any other data in their conversation history.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The news comes from the French website iPhoneSoft.fr, which cites a source within Apple. If true, this means Apple won’t be dropping support for any iPhone models for the second year in a row. This would be great news for anyone still holding onto older devices, as iOS 18 already supports many models. Based on the report, iOS 19 will be compatible with the following iPhones: — iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max
— iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max
— iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max
— iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max
— iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max
— iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max
— iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max
— iPhone SE (2nd generation and later) The oldest iPhones on this list are the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max, first released in September 2018. While it’s exciting to see these models still being supported, it’s worth mentioning that some of the newer iOS 19 features may not be available on older devices due to hardware limitations.  Apple’s decision to maintain compatibility for older iPhones could be seen as part of a larger trend. iOS 18 didn’t drop support for any models either, sticking to the same list as iOS 17, which had removed the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X from the lineup. This move might make it easier for users to hold onto their devices longer without feeling left behind. However, there is slightly less good news for iPad users. The same report claims that iPadOS 19 will drop support for the iPad 7, which was released in 2019. However, all other iPads that can run iPadOS 18 will reportedly be compatible with the new update. For those eagerly waiting to try iOS 19, the first public beta is expected to roll out during Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2025. The final version of iOS 19 will likely be released in September 2025, in line with Apple’s usual schedule. Not much is known yet about the features iOS 19 will bring, but one exciting rumour is that Siri will become more conversational, similar to ChatGPT, in a later iOS 19.4 update, which could arrive around March 2026.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Slated for a potential release by late 2025, the device could change the way we use home security devices. As per Gurman, the smart doorbell would function similarly to Face ID on iPhones, unlocking the door automatically when it recognises you or other residents. Like other Apple devices, it is expected to feature the Secure Enclave chip, which processes and stores biometric data independently from the main hardware, ensuring better privacy.   Mark Gurman suggests the doorbell could be compatible with existing third-party HomeKit smart locks, offering flexibility for Apple users already invested in the ecosystem. Alternatively, Apple may collaborate with a smart lock manufacturer to deliver a comprehensive system at launch. The device will likely leverage Apple’s in-house “Proxima” chip, a hybrid Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology rumoured to power next-generation HomePod Mini and Apple TV products.   This ambitious smart doorbell project is part of a larger effort by Apple to expand its smart home ecosystem under the umbrella of Apple Intelligence. Beyond the doorbell, the company is also working on a range of innovative smart home products. These include a new smart home hub with a 6-inch display for controlling devices, FaceTime calls, and video playback. Additionally, Apple is reportedly developing a security camera to complement the hub, further integrating privacy-focused features into its offerings.   While the Face ID-equipped doorbell aims to rival established players like Amazon’s Ring, it also raises potential security concerns. Critics point out that any malfunction or exploitation of the system could lead to significant risks, such as unauthorised access to homes. Apple, however, has a strong track record of prioritising user privacy, which could give it an edge in this space.   The doorbell camera remains in early development stages, meaning its final features and release date are still uncertain. If successful, this device could bring a new level of convenience and security to Apple users while seamlessly integrating with the company’s broader ecosystem.   Apple’s vision for the smart home doesn’t stop at doorbells.

According to the Wall Street Journal, there are two reasons for it: lack of quality data and financial demands. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openais-next-flagship-model-is-running-late-researchers-blame-low-quality-data-2653924-2024-12-23,"OpenAI’s highly anticipated GPT 5 model, which was expected to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, is reportedly behind schedule and incurring significant development costs. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the AI powerhouse is grappling with the dual challenges of advancing its technology and managing its financial demands. The delay in GPT 5’s release has sparked speculation across the tech industry, given OpenAI’s track record of timely launches for its language models. The report suggests that the complexity of training and scaling large language models (LLMs) like GPT 5 is one of the primary reasons for the setback. These models require enormous computational resources, specialised hardware, and vast datasets, all contributing to spiralling expenses. To recap, the GPT 4 model was released in March 2023 and since then, OpenAI has been working on its next flagship level model, GPT 5.  The Wall Street Journal highlights that OpenAI’s goals for GPT 5 include improving reasoning capabilities, enhancing factual accuracy, and addressing biases. However, meeting these objectives has proven to be more challenging than initially anticipated. And it also includes details about the 18-month development of GPT-5, code-named Orion.GPT 4: Reasons why it is running late A key challenge for Orion lies in data scarcity. OpenAI researchers have determined that the public internet no longer offers the high-quality, diverse datasets required for the model's advancement. To tackle this issue, the company has begun generating synthetic data, enlisting software engineers, mathematicians, and theoretical physicists to produce original content.  Another reason is on the financial side as OpenAI’s expenditures have been a growing concern. Training GPT 4 reportedly costs tens of millions of dollars, and industry analysts estimate that GPT 5’s development could surpass these figures significantly, the report stated. The company has been exploring ways to offset these costs, including partnerships, subscription models for its products, and new investment rounds. Microsoft, a key investor, has played a vital role in supporting OpenAI’s infrastructure through Azure cloud services, but even with such backing, the financial strain remains substantial. Despite these challenges, OpenAI is still pushing forward with its plans to redefine AI capabilities. Experts believe that the delay could ultimately benefit the company by allowing more rigorous testing and refinement of the model, ensuring it meets user expectations and industry standards. The delay in GPT 5’s release also reflects broader trends in the AI industry, where companies are facing mounting pressure to deliver advancements while addressing ethical, technical, and financial challenges. As the tech world eagerly awaits GPT 5, OpenAI’s ability to overcome these hurdles will likely determine its future leadership in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. While a few previous reports have pointed out that the GPT 5 will be out by December 2024, the launch date of the flagship model is still under wrap.

The discontinuation of support means that WhatsApp will no longer provide updates, bug fixes, or security patches for affected devices.  The decision impacts several devices, including some models from prominent brands like Samsung, LG, and Sony, that were released over a decade ago. Users are encouraged to upgrade to devices running newer Android versions to continue accessing WhatsApp services. Here is the full list of Android phones that will not be able to access WhatsApp in a few days. 
Samsung: Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy Ace 3, Galaxy S4 Mini
Motorola: Moto G (1st Gen), Razr HD, Moto E 2014
HTC: One X, One X+, Desire 500, Desire 601
LG: Optimus G, Nexus 4, G2 Mini, L90
Sony: Xperia Z, Xperia SP, Xperia T, Xperia V
 This is not the first time Meta has ended support for older operating systems. The company periodically reviews its minimum requirements for Android and iOS to ensure the app remains compatible with current security standards and features. In recent years, similar moves have been made to phase out older iOS devices and earlier Android versions.  WhatsApp will end support for these iPhones WhatsApp has announced that it will stop supporting older iOS versions starting in 2025. From May 5 onwards, devices running iOS versions earlier than 15.1 will no longer be able to access the app, including through older beta versions on TestFlight. While WhatsApp currently supports iOS 12 and above, the upcoming changes will require iOS 15.1 as the minimum version for continued functionality. To give users time to adapt, WhatsApp is providing a five-month notice period, allowing them to update their devices or explore other options if their hardware cannot support the latest iOS versions.   This update will mainly affect users of older iPhones, specifically the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which are limited to iOS 12.5.7. These models, released over a decade ago, represent a small segment of WhatsApp’s user base. For users with newer iPhones still running older software, upgrading to iOS 15.1 or higher will ensure uninterrupted access to WhatsApp.   The changes will impact both the standard WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business, as both rely on the same system requirements. With this move, WhatsApp aims to enhance performance, security, and compatibility for users on modern devices.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Qualcomm has won the battle against Arm: Here is what it means for the future of laptops and phonesAlso read |  OpenAI's next flagship model is running late, researchers blame low quality dataAlso read |  WhatsApp will soon end support for iPhone 6, iPhone 5s and more: All details hereTrending Reel

Qualcomm says the results affirmed its right to innovate, however, Arm has vowed to seek a new trial.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/qualcomm-has-finally-won-the-battle-against-arm-here-is-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-laptops-and-phones-2653946-2024-12-23,"Qualcomm's central processors are properly licenced under an agreement with Arm Holdings, a jury found in a trial in US federal court that removed some, but not all, uncertainty around the mobile chipmaker's expansion into the laptop market. A week of courtroom arguments and deliberations ended in a mistrial after the jury failed to resolve one of three questions put before it in the trial between the two chip giants. Qualcomm said the result affirmed its right to innovate, but Arm vowed to seek a new trial. Arm's shares were down 1.8 per cent in extended trading after the news, and Qualcomm's opens new tab shares were up 1.8 per cent. The outcome means the case could be tried again in the future - something Arm vowed to pursue in a statement following the verdict. Judge Maryellen Noreika, who presided over the case in US federal court in Delaware, encouraged Arm and Qualcomm to mediate their dispute. ""I don't think either side had a clear victory or would have had a clear victory if this case is tried again,"" Noreika told the parties. After more than nine hours of deliberations over two days, the eight-person jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on the question of whether startup Nuvia breached the terms of its license with Arm. But the jury found that Qualcomm - which purchased Nuvia for $1.4 billion in 2021 - did not breach that licence. The jury also found that Qualcomm's chips, created using Nuvia technology and central to Qualcomm's push into the personal computer market, are properly licenced under its own agreement with Arm, clearing the way for Qualcomm to continue selling them. ""The jury has vindicated Qualcomm's right to innovate and affirmed that all the Qualcomm products at issue in the case are protected by Qualcomm's contract with Arm,"" Qualcomm said in a statement. An Arm spokesperson said the company was ""disappointed"" that the jury was unable to ""reach consensus"" about the company's claims and said from the outset the goal has been to protect the company's intellectual property. For now, the outcome paves the way for Qualcomm to continue to push what it calls the ""AI PC"" in laptop chips that are aimed at handling tasks such as chatbots and image generators. That is a market where Nvidia, opens new tab, Advanced Micro Devices, and MediaTek are also planning to make Arm-based processors. ""My biggest worry was what happens to the future roadmap if they (Qualcomm) no longer have access to Nuvia (computing) cores,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. ""At this point, that risk is a lot closer to being off the table."" The dispute between Arm and Qualcomm centred on what royalty rate Qualcomm should pay for each chip. Nuvia was set to pay higher rates than Qualcomm before Qualcomm bought the startup firm and wove its technology into chips under its own license with Arm at lower royalty rates. Ben Bajarin, chief executive of tech consulting firm Creative Strategies, said that Arm's current growth projections have not depended on reaping higher rates from Qualcomm as Arm chips enter the PC market. ""They haven't factored in, via their quarterly (earnings) calls, a win,"" Bajarin said. ""So none of this changes their economic upside. It's really just a matter of contractual argument."" However, the trial's outcome leaves open the question of where Arm's technology begins and ends. Arm licenses its computing architecture to firms but also sells designs for computing cores as off-the-shelf products. Some of Arm's more sophisticated customers, such as Apple, Qualcomm and Nuvia, licence Arm's architectures but develop their own custom cores. During the trial this week, Arm's attorneys insisted its architecture license terms with Nuvia gave it rights to demand the destruction of Nuvia's custom core designs. ""This does have ramifications for the entire industry,"" Jim McGregor of Tirias Research said in an interview. ""Whether you're using a standard Arm core, or developing your own Arm core, it has been the rock of everything from electric toothbrushes to satellites.""Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  OpenAI's next flagship model is running late, researchers blame low quality dataAlso read |  Forget keys, Face ID may soon lock and unlock your house doors: Apple exploring smart doorbellsAlso read |  Next-gen AirPods Pro could sport health features like heart rate and temperature monitoring

The company has yet to reveal the exact date of launch, but it has confirmed that it will take place in January 2025. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oppo-reno-13-series-confirmed-to-launch-in-india-next-month-design-details-revealed-2654010-2024-12-23,"The next round of flagship smartphones are ready to roll. Oppo has confirmed the launch of its flagship series –– the Reno 13 series 5G. As with this year’s Reno 12 series, we expect the Reno 13 series to also include two smartphones, the Reno 13 5G and Reno 13 Pro 5G. Oppo has yet to confirm the exact date of launch, however, the company has revealed that the launch in India will take place in January 2025. This was confirmed in a post shared by the company on X.  Oppo has also revealed in the teaser that the Reno 13 series 5G will feature an aluminium frame, and a sculpted rear-panel, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for protection. The post says, the Reno 13 series will use “aerospace-grade aluminium Frames, One-Piece Sculpted Glass Backs, and Corning Gorilla Glass 7i for unrivalled elegance and durability”.
 


 Additionally, the image accompanied by the teaser post also confirms that the Reno 13 series will sport a triple camera setup, and a flat display. If we look at last year’s Reno 12 series, the Reno 13 series’ camera setup has been slightly redesigned. Based on the image, the phone will have three cameras, of which two will be aligned vertically, with the third placed on the right to make a triangle. The image also shows an LED flash inside the camera house, which will likely be a ring light, looking at the camera design trends lately.  The teasers from Oppo only reveal so much for now. However, the Reno 13 series has already been launched in the China market, which gives us a bit of an idea about what to expect from the smartphones. In China, the Reno 13 series boasts a 6.59-inch flat AMOLED display with a sharp resolution of 2760x1256 pixels and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, ensuring vibrant visuals and fluid performance. It’s powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8350 chipset, an upgrade over its predecessor with an enhanced GPU for improved gaming experiences and faster app loading times. Backing this power is a robust 5,600mAh battery that supports 80W fast wired charging, promising quick top-ups and long-lasting usage.   Camera performance has always been a strong suit for the Reno series, and the Reno 13 continues the tradition. It features a 50-megapixel primary sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) for sharp and stable shots, paired with an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens for expansive captures. On the front, there’s a 50-megapixel selfie camera, ensuring stunning self-portraits and video calls.   Running on ColorOS 15, based on Android 15, the Reno 13 offers a refined software experience with the latest features and optimisations. Durability is another standout feature, with the device boasting IP66, IP68, and IP69 certifications, making it resistant to dust and capable of withstanding various water exposure scenarios.   As for pricing, the Reno 13 series starts at CNY 2,699 (approximately Rs 31,400) in China. While official India pricing hasn’t been confirmed, the Reno 12 launched at Rs 32,999 in the country, hinting that the Reno 13 could be priced similarly when it debuts in India.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Oppo Reno 12 Pro review: It makes premium AI experience more accessibleAlso read |  OPPO Reno 13 live image leak reveals exclusive blue colour for India

In short, the iPhone 15 Pro offers great value for money, especially for those looking to experience the iPhone Pro series without spending extra on the latest model.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Apple, Google, OnePlus, Samsung, Oppo, and several other tech giants will follow their usual routine of unveiling their ""best phone ever."" However, a few devices always manage to stand out from the crowd. While other notable devices may grab our attention next year, based on what we know so far, two smartphones scheduled for launch in 2025 are already generating significant interest. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim and Apple iPhone 17 Air are both already among the most exciting phones of 2025.  Why is that? It’s all in the name. Samsung and Apple are once again moving back to a more compact design with these phones –– well, sort of. While the iPhone 17 Air is rumoured to be just 6.25mm thick, and is touted as Apple sleekest iPhone ever, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is rumoured to be just 6mm in thickness. For perspective, the Galaxy S24 is 7.6mm thick. There is, of course, more to the phones than their dimensions.  Let’s have a look at what you can expect from the two of the most exciting phones of 2025. What to expect from Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim According to multiple tipsters, Samsung’s ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Slim will launch in Q2 2025. While this brings the phone’s launch timeline around the same time as the annual iPhone launch –– where we can expect the iPhone 17 Air to launch –– it deviates from the traditional January debut of the Galaxy S series. Reports, however, suggest that Samsung will align the S25 Slim's release with the Galaxy A and FE lineups. Design and form factor As the name suggests, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is sleek. In fact, it will likely be Samsung's slimmest smartphone yet. To put that into perspective, it’s significantly thinner than the 7.6mm Galaxy S24 and even slimmer than the anticipated 6.25mm iPhone 17 Air.  Battery and performance Besides its design, one of the standout features of the S25 Slim is its 4,700 to 5,000mAh battery*, an impressive feat for a device this thin. Reports suggest Samsung might be leveraging advanced silicon-carbon anode battery technology, similar to what we've seen in the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro. This would ensure long-lasting performance without compromising the phone’s slim design. Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Slim is expected to pack the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.  Display and camera capabilities The Galaxy S25 Slim is tipped to feature a 6.66-inch display, placing it in the same league as the Galaxy S24+ in terms of screen size. On the photography front, the device could sport a 200-megapixel HP5 primary camera, accompanied by a 50-megapixel ultrawide lens, and a 50-megapixel 3.5x telephoto snapper.What to expect from the iPhone 17 Air   The iPhone 17 Air is slated for a potential September 2025 launch. As a successor to the iPhone 16 Plus, this device is expected to deliver premium features with a refreshed design, all while maintaining a competitive price point. Based on current trends, the iPhone 17 Air could start around Rs 85,000, positioning it slightly below the iPhone 16 Pro, which is priced starting Rs 1,19,900 in India.  Design and display   Apple is rumoured to introduce a titanium frame in the iPhone 17 Air, a feature that promises to enhance both durability and weight reduction. The phone is likely to sport a 6.6-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, delivering vibrant colours, deep contrasts, and an immersive viewing experience. In a much-anticipated upgrade, the device might finally adopt a 120Hz refresh rate. Performance and efficiency   At the heart of the iPhone 17 Air will be Apple’s new A19 chip, which is expected to deliver notable gains in performance and energy efficiency, making multitasking, gaming, and graphics-heavy applications a breeze. Enhanced machine learning capabilities could further improve features like photography, augmented reality (AR), and on-device intelligence. Camera enhancements   Photography enthusiasts can look forward to significant upgrades, including a 48-megapixel primary sensor for sharper and more detailed photos. On the front, a 24-megapixel selfie camera is rumoured. As we inch closer to the anticipated Q2 2025 launch for both the smartphones, more details about the Galaxy S25 Slim and the iPhone 17 Air are likely to emerge. While it seems like the two devices could set a new standard for slim smartphones, it will also be fascinating to see how the two will fare against each other.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also read |  Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai geek out over Google's new quantum chip WillowAlso read |  Why has the Indian government issued a notice to Wikipedia?

It delivers up to 50 TOPS NPU with premium features. At Rs 1,49,990, the laptop has some great specs and features, but is it worth it? Let's find out in this review by India Today Tech. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/asus-zenbook-s16-review-powerful-lightweight-and-gets-most-things-right-2654079-2024-12-23,"The Asus ZenBook S16 debuts as the company's first CoPilot+ PC featuring an AMD Ryzen AI processor. The device retains a similar design as its predecessor, the ZenBook S14, but it takes a significant leap when it comes to specs and features. Powered by AMD's newly launched Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, the ZenBook S16 aims to deliver a boost in AI performance and daily tasks. Priced at Rs 1,49,900, the Asus ZenBook S16 comes with a 3k OLED display, an ultra-thin profile and a powerful chipset, but is it worth it? Let’s find out in this review. 
 


advertisementAsus ZenBook S16: The best partsThe Asus ZenBook S16 carries a similar design language as the ZenBook S14. The laptop features an innovative Ceraluminum –– a blend of aluminium and ceramic –– finish on its lid. This material gives the laptop a premium, matte look that is both visually appealing and durable. It stands out for its lightweight design, weighing just 1.5kg, which makes it highly portable and ideal for users who are always on the move. I have been using the laptop as my primary work device for 2 weeks. This means that I carry it everywhere with me, including to work, where I travel in a Metro. It even accompanied me during a recent work trip to Bangalore. Whether it was daily travel or a longer flight to another city I took, the device always felt comfortably portable. 
 


Another highlight of the Zenbook S16’s build is its ultra-thin lid. Despite being just a couple of millimetres in thickness, it feels sturdy. It is also supported by a good hinge mechanism that allows you to easily open the lid with just one hand. The keyboard is also well-designed with decent spacing between the keys. Moreover, the keys offer snappy feedback. While the keys make a clicky sound, it is not too loud. Nothing compared to a mechanical keyboard, at least. 
 


Additionally, the ergonomic pad, just below the keyboard, is now bigger than ever. According to Asus, the ZenBook S16’s mouse pad is 40 per cent larger than its predecessor. The Asus ZenBook S16 is a 10 on 10 when it comes to the design. It is light but sturdy, stylish but functional, and is quite portable.

The experience is just as good when it comes to the laptop’s display. The Asus ZenBook S16 features a huge 16-inch 3k OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The display is a visual treat, offering vivid and crisp colours. With a brightness of 400nits (peaking at 500nits in HDR mode), the display looks attractive when indoors. The huge display makes multitasking very easy. Even after splitting the screen into two, it did not feel cluttered. Furthermore, binge watching Christmas movies has been a delight on this laptop. But that is not it. The speakers make it a complete entertainment box. The audio system is impressive in the ZenBook S16. It features 6 built-in speakers. Despite the laptop’s compact size, the sound quality is surprisingly good. It can produce a clear and full sound, with a bit of bass. 
 


The user-friendly nature peaks with its touch display. I generally use a mouse while working on a laptop but the smooth touch makes it easier to use. The touch interface offers a seamless and intuitive navigation experience, making tasks like web browsing, file management, and creative projects easy. With 120Hz refresh rate, the touch screen is quick to respond and simplifies interactions. 
 


advertisementComing to the performance, the laptop is a cool combination of style and functionality. It features a geometric grille design with over 3,500 CNC-machined cooling vents.

For a device that sports a powerful AMD Ryzen AI chipset –– which is apparently able to offer three times the processing power of previous AMD laptop processors –– it does not heat up easily.

The ZenBook S16 has been a wonderful machine so far. It runs all tasks smoothly and does not complain. Over the period of 2 weeks, it did not give me a hard time, even when I opened over 10 tabs and was working on two browsers simultaneously. Asus claims the ZenBook S16 can achieve a peak of 50 tops (trillion operations per second) in neural processing power. As a number that’s impressive, but what does it mean in real life? Before we explain that, here are some more numbers we got when we did our own benchmark test for the laptop. advertisementThe Zenbook S16 scored 12,305 on Geekbench (multicore score) and 503 on Cinebench. The AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor gives a tough competition to the Apple’s M3 chip, going by the benchmark scores. But big, powerful processors also mean big battery consumption. Asus claims that the ZenBook S16’s 78 Whr battery can easily last a day. After testing the device, we can say Asus’ claim stands true. I used the ZenBook S16 for 6 hours straight after charging it to 100 per cent. For context, my daily tasks include using Google Docs, opening several tabs, switching between work and Apple Music, watching YouTube videos, scrolling X posts and more. And after all of it, the laptop still had 30 per cent battery left.
 


advertisementIt is true that while performing heavy tasks the battery will drain faster, but for me one 100 per cent charge was good to get me through my entire work day.That said, as we mentioned before, the Zenbook S16 is impressive in many departments, but it’s surely not perfect. Let’s look at some of the drawback of the device.Asus ZenBook S16: Drawbacks The ZenBook S16 not only carries ZenBook S14’s design language, it has also inherited some of its flaws. The lack of fingerprint sensor makes the login process a bit tardy. The Asus ZenBook S16 is equipped with a face-lock biometric tech and I found it hard to work with. On paper, a face-lock makes more sense for a laptop. Ideally, it should unlock as soon as you sit in front of the screen. But the ZenBook S16’s biometric is unpredictable. Sometimes, it unlocks within a few seconds, but many-a-times, I found myself adjusting my face and still ending up typing the password.Another issue I encountered, despite loving the display, the glossy finish causes significant reflection in bright environments. Throughout the testing period, I found myself constantly adjusting the screen to improve visibility, especially when working outdoors. 
 


Additionally, the glossy surface is also highly prone to smudges and fingerprints. As someone who enjoyed the touch screen feature, this drawback hindered the overall viewing experience. The third issue I encountered was noticeable lag when the laptop was charging. The ZenBook S16 supports Type-C charging, and while the battery performance is commendable, plugging in the charger causes a significant delay, with the screen briefly blacking out for a few seconds. This interruption was quite noticeable during use.Verdict: Should you buy the Asus ZenBook S16? If you are looking for a laptop with great performance skills, stylish and good battery backup, the Asus ZenBook S16 is a solid choice. While it has its demerits, the list of Pros is much longer. At Rs 1,49,900, the laptop is on the expensive side, but also delivers all premium specs and features. It offers top-notch performance, giving a tough competition to Apple’s M3 MacBook Air.

 The user-friendly nature peaks with its touch display. I generally use a mouse while working on a laptop but the smooth touch makes it easier to use. The touch interface offers a seamless and intuitive navigation experience, making tasks like web browsing, file management, and creative projects easy. With 120Hz refresh rate, the touch screen is quick to respond and simplifies interactions.

Here is what we know about it Xiaomi 15 Ultra has recently been listed on the BIS certification website, which suggests that the smartphone may soon be launched in the Indian market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/xiaomi-15-ultra-launching-in-india-soon-here-is-what-we-know-about-it-2654440-2024-12-24,"Soon after the Xiaomi 15 was listed on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification website in November, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has now been spotted on the same certification website. A listing on the BIS website usually means that the company is now just going through the process of getting all the approval for a phone, before launching it in the market. Interestingly, unlike the Xiaomi 15, which has already been launched (along with the Xiaomi 15 Pro) in the market, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has yet to be unveiled even in the China market. For the uninitiated, Xiaomi phones usually always launch in its home market in China first.  Coming back to the Xiaomi 15 Ultra listing that has surfaced on the BIS certification website. The handset, identified by the model number 25010PN30I, reportedly received approval on December 20, hinting at its imminent arrival in India.   While the BIS listing does not explicitly confirm the device’s name, earlier reports from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) associate this model number with the Indian variant of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. The global version of the device is expected to carry a similar model number, with the final letter changed to ‘G.’  Xiaomi 15 Ultra: What to expect The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is rumored to feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. This aligns with Xiaomi’s tradition of equipping its Ultra-series devices with cutting-edge hardware. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is also expected to feature 90W wired charging, and a 2K quad-curved display. On the camera front, it is expected to boast a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto sensor with a large aperture, alongside a 1-inch main sensor with an f/1.63 aperture.   The device might also come with IP68 and IP69 certifications, providing protection against water and dust. Wireless charging is anticipated to be part of its feature set, while the battery capacity is likely to remain unchanged from its predecessor, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra –– which was a 5,000mAh battery.Xiaomi 15 Ultra: India price expected Although Xiaomi has yet to announce an official launch date, the appearance of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra on BIS suggests that the Indian debut might not be far off. If we consider past trends, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra made its global debut in February 2024 at Mobile World Congress Barcelona, followed by its Indian release in March 2024. The device was priced at Rs. 99,999 for the single 16GB RAM and 512GB storage variant.

The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16 per cent jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalisation. The latest rally in Apple shares reflects ""investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades,"" said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a ""hold"" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800 per cent over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase ""low- to mid-single digits"" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. ""Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's ""top pick"" heading into 2025.  The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. ""I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today,"" said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if US President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10 per cent on goods coming from China. ""We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018,"" Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. ""Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action ""could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology."" ""Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

This design integrates key components like the CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) into a single chip. Apple has improved performance and power efficiency across its devices by combining these components and tuning them in tandem. However, a recent report by well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests a major shift with the upcoming M5 Pro chip. Apple might step away from its fully integrated SoC design and instead adopt a new approach that separates the CPU and GPU. This change is reportedly being made for two key reasons — better performance and improved production yields. By separating the CPU and GPU, Apple can take advantage of TSMC’s latest chip-packaging technology, known as SoIC-mH (System-on-Integrated-Chips-Molding-Horizontal). This advanced method of packaging chipsets is said to significantly improve thermal performance, which means the chip can run at full power for longer periods without overheating. Additionally, the SoIC-mH process reportedly reduces manufacturing defects, resulting in higher-quality chips and fewer production losses. According to Kuo, this new design will not only be used in the M5 Pro but also the M5 Max and M5 Ultra variants. These high-end chips will be built on TSMC’s N3P node, an advanced chip-manufacturing process. Mass production timelines suggest the base M5 chip will roll out in the first half of 2025, followed by the M5 Pro and M5 Max later that year, and the M5 Ultra in 2026. Interestingly, the report also ties this development to Apple’s plans for artificial intelligence (AI). The M5 Pro chip is expected to power Apple Intelligence servers, part of the company’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC) infrastructure. These servers are designed for AI inferencing, a critical function for processing AI-driven tasks. Once these high-end chips are ready, Apple plans to ramp up its AI infrastructure, furthering its ambitions in the AI space. This potential shift in design is a significant departure from Apple’s usual approach. While Apple hasn’t confirmed these plans, the rumoured changes show that the company wants to adapt and innovate with time. It also highlights the growing complexity of balancing performance, efficiency, and production challenges in the tech industry.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Now, all eyes are on the company’s second generation foldable phone, the OnePlus Open 2. For a while now, there were rumours suggesting that the Open 2 will be launching by the first quarter of 2025. However, the launch timeline seems to have been revised. Latest reports suggest that the OnePlus Open 2 will now only launch by the second half of 2025. Of course, an early release would have been great, but OnePlus has traditionally done its big launches in August, and maybe that’s the timeline it is going to stick to in 2025.  As to what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2, the foldable is expected to be a rebranded Oppo Find N5. Now, to just get things in perspective, the Find N5 will obviously be launched before the OnePlus Open 2. But we don’t know when the Find N5 will launch. However, Oppo’s product manager, Zhou Yibao, confirmed in a social media interaction with a user that it will launch before the Find X8 Ultra. There is no official launch date for the latter either, but it is rumoured to be released in Q1 2025. Some reports also suggest that the Oppo Find N5 could be released in February next year.  There have also been several leaks around the Oppo Find N5 aka the OnePlus Open 2. From what the reports suggest so far, the OnePlus Open 2 is expected to feature the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Which could be a big leap over the OnePlus Open, which sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset.  The OnePlus Open 2 is also rumored to feature foldable displays with 2K+ resolution. The foldable phone is also believed to come with a 50-megapixel triple-lens setup, possibly featuring a circular periscope telephoto lens, building on the 3x optical zoom offered by its forerunner. The Open 2 might also support 3-stage wireless charging, complementing their large form factors. In terms of design, the foldable phone may adopt a slimmer, lighter frame with a choice of plain leather and glass materials for a refined aesthetic.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Oppo Find X8 Ultra battery and camera specs surface in latest leakAlso read |  Apple approaches historic $4 trillion valuation, it is now also ahead of Nvidia and MicrosoftAlso read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

 While the battery capacity of the Oppo Find X8 Ultra is certainly impressive, the real excitement lies in the camera specifications. As per Digital Chat Station, the Find X8 Ultra is expected to feature a 50MP Sony IMX906 periscope zoom camera with 3X optical zoom. Alongside it, there will be another 50MP Sony IMX882 periscope zoom camera, offering 6X optical zoom. This dual periscope setup is a big upgrade from its predecessor, the Find X7 Ultra. Rumours also suggest that the Find X8 Ultra will sport a 50MP primary camera with a 1-inch Sony LYTIA LYT-900 sensor. This is also a step up from the Find X7 Ultra, which used a slightly smaller sensor for its main camera. Additionally, the new model is said to have a 50MP ultra-wide camera, though it’s unclear whether it will use the same 1/1.95-inch Sony LYTIA LYT-600 sensor as the Find X7 Ultra or a new sensor altogether. While these specs look promising, it’s unclear if the Oppo Find X8 Ultra will launch in India. The Find X8 and Find X8 Pro have made their way to the Indian market, but the Find X7 Ultra never did. If Oppo decides to skip India again with the Ultra model, it could disappoint fans who are excited about the high-end flagship smartphone.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

Another intriguing part of the rumour is that the Dutch company BE Semiconductor will be supplying the technology for the aperture blades—the mechanical components that will allow the aperture to change size. This technology will make it possible for the iPhone 18 Pro's camera to adapt its light intake for different shooting conditions. While this feature was also rumoured for the iPhone 17 models previously, it seems Apple will reserve it for the iPhone 18 Pro, which is expected to debut in September 2026. Whether or not Apple will also upgrade the iPhone 18 Pro’s sensor size is still unclear, but such an enhancement could pave the way for even more natural and dynamic bokeh effects in photos. As the story of the iPhone’s camera capabilities continues to evolve, the addition of variable aperture stands out as one of the most exciting rumours to date, promising a new level of control and creativity for iPhone photographers. Since the iPhone 18 series is speculated to come in 2026, there are still several months to go before the launch. Hence, we advise you to take this information with a pinch of salt. The exact details will be released during the launch. Published By: Unnati GusainPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

The upcoming model follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, the Galaxy M15 5G, with some notable design and feature upgrades. While the M16 is still part of the budget M series, it brings a few fresh touches to its design, along with improvements under the hood. Leaked renders of the Samsung Galaxy M16 5G indicate a few design changes over the last generation model. The M16 will be available in three new colours — a dark grey, a minty green reminiscent of the Galaxy S23 FE green colour, and a light pink shade reminiscent of the iPhone 13 Mini pink shade. As seen in the renders, the rear panel of the phone — while expected to be plastic — gets a new glass-like reflective finish, replacing the textured finish seen on the M15. One of the most noticeable updates is the redesigned rear camera island. The camera setup has been modified, with the bottommost sensor separated from the other two lenses, which gives the phone a slightly more distinct look. The rear flash is still placed separately next to the lenses, staying true to the M-series design. When we look at the front of the phone, we can see that the Galaxy M16 5G keeps the familiar Infinity-U cutout for the front camera, just like the M15. However, the thick chin on the bottom still suggests that the M16 is targeting the budget segment. While the design may not be as sleek as some high-end models, the M16 offers a modern feel thanks to its flatter sides with metallic finish and rounded corners. However, the frame will likely be plastic, just like the back of the phone. The power button and volume rocker are placed on the right side, with a SIM card slot on the left side. 

Source: Android Headlines
 On the inside, the Samsung Galaxy M16 5G brings a performance boost. According to a recent Geekbench listing, the phone will run on a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 SoC. This chipset includes two powerful Cortex A76 cores, clocked at 2.4 GHz, and six efficiency-focused Cortex A55 cores at 2 GHz. The M16 also features the Arm Mali-G57 MC2 GPU, which promises improved graphical performance compared to the Dimensity 6100+ chip in the M15. Samsung will likely ship the M16 with Android 14, and the phone will come with 8GB of RAM. In terms of performance, the M16 scored 552 in the single-core CPU test and 1,611 in the multi-core test. The Samsung Galaxy M16 5G appears to be a rebranded version of the Galaxy A16 5G, a mid-range device in Samsung’s A-series lineup. This similarity in specifications suggests that the M16 will be targeting budget-conscious buyers who want good performance without the high price tag. Samsung has already listed the device on India’s BIS website, confirming that it will be launched in the country. If it follows the same timeline as the M15, we can expect the Galaxy M16 5G to hit the shelves in early 2025.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

With this addition, WhatsApp users can quickly capture a document using their device’s camera without needing external scanning tools or apps. The rollout is happening gradually, with more users expected to gain access over the coming weeks, as confirmed by the latest WhatsApp changelog, reported by WABetaInfo.advertisementWhatsApp scanning: How to use This innovation is a significant leap for WhatsApp, particularly for those who need to share documents quickly while on the go.

Moreover, the quality of the scan is optimised for clarity and readability, ensuring that the scanned documents are presented in a professional manner. This makes the feature ideal for both personal and business-related needs, whether for sharing receipts, contracts, or notes. WABetaInfo first reported this feature as part of the WhatsApp iOS 24.25.80 update, and the company has continued to refine and expand access to the feature. By including it in the app’s document-sharing menu, WhatsApp is positioning itself as a comprehensive platform for communication and document exchange, further streamlining the user experience. As this feature continues to roll out, more users will benefit from the convenience it offers, saving time and reducing the need for third-party applications.WhatsApp withdraws support for these iPhones WhatsApp has announced that it will discontinue support for older iOS versions starting in 2025. Beginning May 5, devices running iOS versions earlier than 15.1 will no longer have access to the app, including older beta versions available on TestFlight. Currently compatible with iOS 12 and later, WhatsApp will soon require iOS 15.1 as the minimum version for continued use. To help users prepare, the company is offering a five-month notice period, allowing time to update devices or explore alternatives if their hardware cannot support the newer iOS versions. This update will primarily affect older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which are limited to iOS 12.5.7. These models, released over 10 years ago, account for a small portion of WhatsApp’s user base. Users with newer iPhones running outdated software can maintain access by upgrading to iOS 15.1 or later.

While the date is yet to be made official by the company, another report claims to reveal the day the new smartphones will hit the shelves. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-is-expected-to-go-on-sale-on-this-date-2654555-2024-12-24,"Samsung is set to launch its flagship smartphones in 2025. The launch date has yet to be made official by the company, but there have been several reports that suggest that the launch will take place on January 22. Now, as we wait for Samsung to confirm the launch date, another leak suggests that the Galaxy S25 series will launch in Samsung’s home market, South Korea, on February 7, 2025. This would be two weeks after the rumoured Galaxy Unpacked event. This timeline aligns with Samsung’s typical two-week pre-order period for new Galaxy devices.
 


 Pre-orders for the Galaxy S25 in South Korea are reportedly set to run from January 24 to February 3, 2025, with deliveries and in-store availability starting on February 7. For international markets, including the US, pre-order dates are expected to be similar, possibly starting around January 22 or 23 and closing in early February. For context, Samsung followed a similar schedule for the Galaxy S24, which was announced on January 17, 2024, with pre-orders opening immediately and the phone hitting shelves by January 31. Traditionally, the flagship Galaxy series is launched the same day as the global release takes place, which is generally around the first week of February. The leaked timeline seems to be in line with it, making it seem credible.  The latest leak also confirms that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will come with 16GB RAM, but this will be exclusive to the 512GB and 1TB storage variants. The base 256GB model will feature 12GB RAM instead. Meanwhile, the standard Galaxy S25 and S25+ are rumoured to offer 12GB RAM as a default, a noticeable improvement over the Galaxy S24, which only came with 8GB RAM in its base configuration. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to include four smartphones: the Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Slim, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, the Galaxy S25 Slim –– Samsung’s slimmest phone ever, with a waistline of about 6mm –– is believed to only be showcased at the event. Its availability is rumoured to be scheduled for sometime in the second half of 2025.  Along with the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung is also expected to unveil the next-generation Galaxy Ring at the Galaxy Unpacked event next month. The ring is also expected to be made available a few months after the official launch.

The rumour has it that the OnePlus 13 in India will mimic the Chinese variant, launched in October 2024. In this article, let's look at what the OnePlus 13 is expected to bring. OnePlus 13: Expected India price While official pricing is yet to be announced, rumours suggest that the OnePlus 13 could be priced starting at Rs 59,999 for the base variant, with higher configurations costing more.

The smartphone is expected to go on sale by mid-January through both online platforms and offline retail stores in India.OnePlus 13: Specs and features According to leaks and early reports, the OnePlus 13 is expected to feature a refined design with slimmer bezels and a sturdier build.

Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 is confirmed to be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, promising top-tier performance and energy efficiency.  OnePlus has consistently focused on improving its camera technology, and the OnePlus 13 appears to be no exception. The smartphone is rumoured to sport a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, a name synonymous with premium photography. The primary sensor could be a 50-megapixel LYT-808 with optical image stabilisation (OIS), accompanied by telephoto and ultrawide lenses, both of which now feature 50-megapixel sensors. This setup is expected to deliver exceptional photography and videography capabilities, including 4K video recording and advanced night mode. On the front, the device may house a 32-megapixel selfie camera with AI enhancements for sharper and more vibrant portraits. The OnePlus 13 is confirmed to pack a 6,000mAh battery, supporting 100W fast wired charging and 50W wireless charging. Reverse wireless charging is also rumoured to be included, allowing users to charge accessories like earbuds. With cutting-edge technology and premium features, the OnePlus 13 is poised to be a strong contender in the flagship smartphone segment.

However, the M4-powered MacBook Air is yet to make its debut. So far, there is no official communication from Apple regarding when the M4 MacBook Air will be launched. However, according to Apple analyst Mark Gurman, who writes for Bloomberg, the MacBook Air with M4 chip may launch sooner than we expect.  In a post shared on X, Gurman has once again confirmed that the iPhone SE 4, iPad 11, and the next-generation iPad Air will be launched in Spring 2025. This means, around May or June 2025 –– closer to Apple’s annual WWDC or may be at the event –– the three devices could be expected. However, for the MacBook Air M4, Gurman suggests that it could launch even earlier than the iPhone SE 4, iPad 11, and the upgraded iPad Air.  Considering, the timeline Gurman is hinting at isn’t Apple’s usual launch event timeline –– WWDC in June, iPhone hardware event in September, and a Mac event later in the year –– the MacBook Air M4 could be announced in a press announcement.  Apple is expected to release a 13-inch and a 15-inch MacBook Air, powered by an M4 chip. The launch of the MacBook Air was recently also revealed by Apple accidentally. In the macOS 15.2 release, the company had accidentally confirmed that new MacBook Air models are coming in 2025.  A recent report also suggests that Apple is “deep” in manufacturing the new MacBook Air. Based on this report, Apple could possibly start selling the laptop in the first quarter of 2025. As for what to expect from the new MacBook Air, it is unlikely to see significant design updates, with most rumours pointing to the inclusion of the M4 chip and a few minor enhancements. Potential upgrades might feature a Center Stage camera for improved video calls and a shift from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 4 ports.   Apple has already refreshed the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini with M4 chip options earlier this year. According to Geekbench results, the M4 chip delivers approximately a 25 per cent boost in multi-core CPU performance compared to the M3 chip.Published By: Nandini YadavPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also read |  OnePlus 12 price drops just two weeks before OnePlus 13 India launch eventAlso read |  Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to go on sale on this dateAlso read |  Xiaomi 15 Ultra launching in India soon?

Now, imagine describing that dream and watching it transform into a high-definition video. Sounds impossible? Not anymore. Enter Veo2, Google DeepMind’s latest text-to-video platform, which creates realistic 4K videos from simple text prompts. Its capabilities have stunned the internet with mesmerising demo videos, leaving many in awe — and some video creators worried about their jobs. But Veo2 isn’t alone. OpenAI’s Sora is another challenger in the fray, bringing its approach to this exciting new age of AI-generated video creation. So, how do these platforms compare? Which one is better? And what does this mean for the future of video creation?Veo 2 vs Sora Sora, launched in early December this year, is available to ChatGPT Plus users globally. While the OpenAI video maker has gained a headstart with general users being able to use the platform, Google’s Veo2 is still in its beta testing. Seemingly, Google’s Veo2 has an advantage over Sora thanks to multiple reasons: 
4K video resolution: Veo2 offers users video resolution up to 4K which means better quality videos. In contrast, Sora offers a maximum resolution of 1080p which isn’t bad but still 4K is 4K.
Video duration: Veo2 renders videos up to 2 minutes in length. Compared to this, Sora creates shorter videos of up to 20 seconds.
Cinematic control: Veo2 offers virtual camera control with options for adding cinematic movements like pan, tilts, etc. Its accuracy has stunned many users online. You can even play around with the lighting for a particular scene. This helps enhance storytelling. Sora focuses more on style presets and storyboarding. It’s similar to editing photos on your phone. You can choose between each adjustment manually or use the presets that phones offer.

Despite the prompt telling the camera to rotate, the output in Sora has rendered a static camera shot. This stifles a creator’s vision in many ways.
Realism: Some Veo2 renders online show its true ability to output photorealistic videos. This is also true in the case of physics-based motion accuracy which makes animations look more natural. This is an area where Sora struggles.
 The following video by X user Ruben Hassid shows the differences between the two video engines. There are several inconsistencies in the results Sora has generated whereas Veo2 has been able to render more lifelike results.

Google’s DeepMind has made the tool available only to a select few users, with no clarity on when the final version will be rolled out. Sora, on the other hand, is available for commercial use with a ChatGPT Plus subscription that costs around Rs 1676 in India.Room for improvement Many X users have posted similar renders comparing the two and most feel that Sora is losing the battle in many departments. While Sora might not be the most refined version of itself, there’s still room for improvement. It is still in the initial stages of its release and I believe that an improved version of this platform will be released in the coming days, especially after Veo2’s superior performance. Right now, it feels that Sora focuses more on motion rather than physics and accuracy, a sentiment echoed by an X user.
Sora vs. Veo 2:

I spent a few hours running prompts on both models and wanted to share some comparisons â¬‡ï¸.

IMO - Sora biases towards more motion, whereas Veo focuses more on accuracy / physics. And a larger % of clips from Veo are usable.

— Justine Moore (@venturetwins) December 18, 2024 The company recently launched a rebranded version of the platform called Sora Turbo but had to halt new signups due to an avalanche of users overwhelming the servers. This is also an issue that online video platforms will face in the coming days. Google has set a high benchmark for OpenAI to improve upon, but the real challenge is the time at hand. With 2024 almost over, OpenAI will now have to shift focus to 2025 on how it can beat Google at its own game. No matter who takes the crown in the end, eventually, it’s the users who win.A boon or threat? Now to address the elephant in the room. The possibility of these AI tools eating up the jobs of people who create (shoot or edit) video content for a living. This pickle is the same as ChatGPT killing writing jobs. Gradual improvements to Veo2, Sora and other similar tools will result in a substantial decrease in requirements for conventional video-creation methods. Why would anyone pay for a cameraperson, equipment, travel and logistics when they can just write a prompt on a computer and generate a 4K video with specific details about lighting, environment and colour accuracy? This would cater more to industries or creators that require more stock footage. It would be more cost-effective to ask Veo2 or Sora to generate stock videos instead of creating them from scratch or paying stock video platforms like Envato, Adobe or iStock. However, some videos cannot be created (for commercial use) by AI due to copyright issues. Videos of celebrities, interviews with politicians, sports events and live TV. All of these profiles still need people to function within the ecosystem. However, you can make similar videos like this awesome Game Of Thrones trailer made using Veo2.

In fact, thanks to these tools, more high-quality content will be created, which means more consumption and that will lead to more creators cropping up shortly. Rest assured, the future of video creation is about to be transformed with tools like Veo2 and Sora at the helm of it.

The iPhone 16 is selling at a discount of up to Rs 16,000. But there is a catch. The deal is part of a Christmas Carnival sale by Apple’s exclusive retail seller Imagine, and the sale ends today, December 26. Which means, you have only until today to avail the offer, if you are interested.  As for the deal, the iPhone 16 was launched at a starting price of Rs 79,900. During the ongoing sale at Imagine, you can get a discount of Rs 3,500, which brings the price of the phone down to Rs 76,400. Additionally, SBI, ICICI and Kotak Bank users can also get a discount of Rs 4,000 on the purchase. Which means, a further price reduction of Rs 72,400. On top of that, you can also get further discounts by trading-in or exchanging a smartphone. According to the Imagine website, you can get up to Rs 8,000 on exchange. If you do get the highest value for exchange (which is honestly rare) you can get the iPhone 16 for around Rs 64,400. Which is a great deal.Why is the iPhone 16 deal so good? The iPhone 16 is arguably one of the best smartphones in the new iPhone lineup this year. The Pros are great, but the iPhone 16 sits in the goldilocks zone. It has the new chipsets, and Apple hasn’t cut corners with the vanilla model this time by excluding the good stuff (like a camera capture button or Apple Intelligence). And if you are someone who loves a compact device, the iPhone 16’s form factor is an added bonus.  The iPhone 16 features a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits and the innovative Dynamic Island for an enhanced user experience. At its core lies the powerful 3nm A18 chipset, comprising a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core neural engine, delivering top-notch performance. It supports dual SIM functionality and runs iOS 18 out of the box, complete with Apple Intelligence features for a seamless smart experience.   Photography enthusiasts will appreciate the dual-camera setup, which includes a 48-megapixel wide-angle lens with 2x in-sensor zoom and an f/1.6 aperture, alongside a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with an f/2.2 aperture and autofocus. For selfies and video calls, the 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera ensures sharp and detailed captures.   On the connectivity front, the iPhone 16 offers support for 5G, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, and a USB Type-C port, ensuring modern and versatile usage. The device is also built to withstand challenging environments, boasting an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The iPhone 16 comes in three storage options—128GB, 256GB, and 512GB—with ongoing offers applicable to all variants. It is available in five striking colors: Black, Pink, Teal, Ultramarine, and White, catering to diverse aesthetic preferences.

Priced at Rs 601, the new mobile plan offers unlimited 5G data for a whole year. What’s even better? You can buy it for yourself or gift it to your friends or family. Here’s how it works: — To enjoy unlimited 5G, you must already be on a Jio recharge plan that offers at least 1.5 GB of 4G data per day. 
— Plans like Rs 199, Rs 239, Rs 299, and others in this range are eligible. 
— Unfortunately, if you’re using Jio’s more basic 1 GB per day plan or the Rs 1,899 annual recharge plan, this voucher won’t work for you.What you get with the Rs 601 voucher When you purchase the Rs 601 Jio True 5G gift voucher, you’ll receive 12 upgrade vouchers. These can be redeemed one by one through the My Jio app. Once activated, users can enjoy unlimited 5G data and an increased 4G daily data limit of 3 GB per day. It’s important to note that the validity of this voucher aligns with your existing base plan’s validity, with a maximum limit of 30 days per voucher. This means if your base plan has 28 days of validity, the unlimited 5G benefits will last the same number of days for that period. However, the annual voucher provides a total of 12 such vouchers, giving you the freedom to activate them when needed over 12 months.Who Can Use This Plan? Jio’s unlimited 5G voucher will work with several popular recharge plans, like Rs 199, Rs 239, Rs 299, Rs 319, Rs 329, Rs 579, Rs 666, Rs 769, and Rs 899. If you’re already on one of these plans, you’re good to go. Just make sure your base plan is valid when you activate a voucher.How to Gift It to Someone Else The Rs 601 plan is designed not just for yourself but also as a gift option. You can purchase it for family or friends directly through the My Jio app. But before you gift it, make sure the recipient is on an eligible plan so they can enjoy the unlimited 5G benefits.Other 5G Plans from Jio Apart from the Rs 601 voucher, Jio also offers smaller 5G upgrade plans. These are priced at Rs 51, Rs 101, and Rs 151, with validity lasting one, two, and three months respectively. These are great for short-term needs or for those looking to try out Jio’s 5G services without a long-term commitment.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

7cff180b-2882-407e-a296-3c774db98888,TRAI directs telcos to provide call and SMS-only tariff plansThe latest TRAI mandate directs telecom operators to now also offer mobile tariff plans that focus only on SMS and voice calls.,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/trai-directs-telecom-operators-to-provide-non-data-tariff-plans-2655486-2024-12-26,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has announced new regulations to make telecom services more affordable and consumer-friendly. The Telecom Consumers Protection (Twelfth Amendment) Regulations, 2024, issued on Monday, include several key changes to benefit users, especially those who rely heavily on basic calling and SMS or use secondary SIM cards for specific purposes like calls and SMS. One of the biggest changes is that telecom operators must now offer tariff plans that focus only on SMS and voice calls. This is a big relief for millions of users, particularly the estimated 150 million (15 crores) people in India who still use basic mobile services. Many of these users don’t need data services but are forced to buy expensive plans that bundle data along with calls and SMS. These new SMS-and-call-only plans will allow such users to pay only for the services they actually use. The change is also expected to benefit users who keep a secondary SIM card exclusively for making calls or sending messages. Until now, these users had no choice but to pay for data benefits they didn’t want. TRAI’s new rules aim to fix this imbalance and make telecom plans more tailored to user needs. However, this move could impact telecom companies like Airtel and Vi. Reliance Jio, which operates only 4G and 5G networks, is unlikely to be directly affected by this regulation. Telecom companies have been focusing on increasing their Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by offering bundled plans that include a mix of data, calling, SMS, and even benefits like subscriptions to OTT platforms. This new mandate might force them to rethink their strategies. The regulations also bring another consumer-friendly change — increasing the validity of Special Tariff Vouchers (STVs). These vouchers, which are usually more affordable than standard plans, will now have a validity of up to 365 days, compared to the earlier limit of 90 days. This means users can enjoy the benefits of these special plans for a longer period without frequent recharges. In addition, TRAI has instructed telecom operators to ensure that top-up vouchers are available in various denominations, starting from as low as Rs 10. This step is aimed at making small-value recharges more accessible and convenient for consumers, especially those with limited budgets. TRAI’s decisions are based on extensive consumer surveys and stakeholder feedback. The telecom authority has emphasised that these changes are designed to ensure users get the best value for their money and aren’t forced to pay for services they don’t use.Published By: Aman rashidPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also read |  Poco M7 Pro 5G quick review: Can it shake up the budget price segment?Also read |  Best mobile phones under Rs 35,000 in December 2024: Vivo T3 Ultra 5G, OnePlus Nord 4 5G and moreAlso read |  Best Mobile Phones under Rs 25,000 in December 2024: Lava Agni 3 5G and 3 more

The outage has hit both Airtel mobile and broadband users because of which they are unable to place calls or access the internet. As per Downdetector, the complaints for the network outage surged around 10.30 am this morning. Several Airtel users have also taken to X (formerly Twitter) to report the outage. Many users have also reported that their device running on Airtel SIM went on ‘No Network’ for quite some time. 
 



 



 


 The outage caused significant disruptions, particularly for mobile internet users, who made up 40 per cent of the complaints. Nearly an equal percentage reported a complete blackout of Airtel services, while 22 per cent cited a total lack of signal. These issues spanned multiple cities, pointing to a widespread problem.  Airtel commands a significant presence in India’s telecom market. As of October 2024, the company boasted a massive user base of 385.41 million, capturing 33.5 per cent of the market share. Notably, its 5G user base alone reached 90 million by the end of the first quarter of the 2024-25 financial year.
