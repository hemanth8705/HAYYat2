Amara’s appointment has been approved for a period of three years. The decision was made by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), which is headed by the Prime Minister. This appointment comes after Amara was recommended for the role by the Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB), the official headhunter for directors in state-owned banks and institutions, earlier in September. Amara will take over the position vacated by CS Setty, the outgoing MD of SBI. This appointment fills the key vacancy in SBI's leadership team, which includes the Chairman and four Managing Directors who oversee the bank's vast operations. The FSIB had interviewed nine candidates for the role of SBI Managing Director. “Keeping in view their performance in the interface, overall experience and the extant parameters, the Bureau recommends Rama Mohan Rao Amara for the position of MD in SBI,"" the FSIB said in a statement earlier.  The selection process was based on a combination of factors, including the candidates’ experience, qualifications, and suitability for the role. Rama Mohan Rao Amara is a seasoned banker with extensive experience in various roles within SBI. Although specific details about his career background were not provided in the report, appointments to such senior positions usually consider years of experience in banking, leadership skills, and familiarity with SBI’s operations.

To address widespread confusion, the Income Tax Department has released a detailed brochure on December 11, 2024, to help taxpayers navigate their disclosure obligations. With penalties and prosecution on the line, timely compliance is essential.advertisementWHO NEEDS TO REPORT AND WHAT TO DISCLOSE?All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
 The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES Taxpayers must declare foreign income and assets in the applicable ITR for the assessment year they were a resident in India. The deadlines are as follows: Original returns: File by July 31, 2024. Belated or revised returns: File by December 31, 2024. If a return has already been filed without these disclosures, taxpayers can revise their ITR using the correct form and schedules before the December deadline. Accurate documentation, such as acquisition details and income generated, is critical.CONSEQUENCES OF NON-DISCLOSURE Non-compliance can result in penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh if foreign assets exceed Rs 20 lakh (excluding immovable property). Further, prosecution under the Black Money Act could be initiated for false or incomplete disclosures. Late filers have until December 31, 2024, to submit belated or revised returns to avoid legal repercussions. Disclosing foreign income and assets not only ensures compliance with Indian tax laws but also avoids double taxation under international agreements. The Income Tax Department has simplified the process through a brochure that explains the steps to disclose and claim relief. Taxpayers should take this opportunity to file accurate returns and align with both the Income Tax Act and the Black Money Act. With heavy penalties and legal actions looming, timely disclosure isn’t just advisable—it’s indispensable for financial integrity.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

But on Dalal Street, the mood seems more 'bearish' with the bears taking control than holiday cheer. Instead of ringing in gains, the markets are grappling with losses, leaving investors questioning whether 2024 will wrap up in the red. Dalal Street has faced a rough patch over the past few trading sessions. The benchmark indices, the S&P BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty50, extended their losses today, leaving investors worried about their year-end performance. The Sensex dropped by 502.25 points to close at 80,182.20, while the Nifty50 declined by 137.15 points to settle at 24,198.85. Financial and banking heavyweights were among the major losers, dragging the indices down further. ""The Indian market is experiencing a breakdown in the early Santa Claus rally, with the impact being more pronounced in India compared to developed markets due to the rapid appreciation of the dollar. Market sentiment remains cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting and potential policy and tariff shifts from the incoming US administration,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.INVESTORS’ WEALTH TAKES A HIT The market has been under pressure for three consecutive days, with the Sensex losing 1,951 points during this period. The market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms has shrunk significantly, falling from Rs 459 lakh crore on December 13 to Rs 453 lakh crore today, marking a loss of Rs 6 lakh crore in just three sessions. Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking Ltd, said, “Foreign fund outflows and caution ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy decision have kept investors on edge. Banking, metals, and energy sectors have been the top losers, while the broader indices have also seen selling pressure, ending lower by 0.6% to 0.9%.”WILL THE MARKETS END THE YEAR IN RED? The recent slump has raised questions about whether the markets will close the year in negative territory.  VLA Ambala, Sebi Registered Research Analyst and Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, said, “The current major support level for the market is at 23,000, while we are trading at 24,200. If the price fails to hold this range, participants may see further bearishness. Additional factors, such as the weakening of the Indian rupee against the US dollar, could also contribute to market volatility.” Ambala added that market participants are closely monitoring the US Federal Reserve’s policy decision. “Signals from the Fed, whether hawkish or dovish, will play a significant role in determining market direction. A dovish stance could lift sentiment and potentially lead to a strong rebound, while a hawkish stance could further weigh on the markets,” she said. Satish Chandra Aluri from Lemonn Markets Desk also pointed out that the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections and Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference could provide crucial insights into interest rate decisions for 2025. “Markets are pricing in a pause in January and expecting a cumulative rate cut of around 50 basis points in 2025. Any surprises could either lift or drag markets further,” he explained.OUTLOOK FOR 2025 Despite the current downturn, there is optimism for 2025. ICICI Securities predicts a strong upside for the Nifty50 index, with potential gains of up to 20% in the coming year. The brokerage firm believes the Nifty could climb to 28,800, marking the upper range of a long-term rising channel. “Buying near the 52-week EMA (exponential moving average) has historically offered favourable returns, with a median gain of 23% over the next 12 months,” said ICICI Securities. The brokerage also highlighted historical trends, noting that on five occasions when foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold over Rs 30,000 crore worth of equities in a single quarter, the average one-year forward return was 28%. Additionally, markets have seen a double-digit rally in election years 82% of the time over the past four decades.

""Additionally, market sentiment remained cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later in the day, with investors wary of a possible slowdown in rate cuts that could impact global liquidity.

On the other hand, hawkish signals may trigger further downside in the markets,"" said Satish Chandra Aluri, Lemonn Markets Desk.

The shares plunged over 16% in the morning trade after the company announced the cancellation of a major tender it had secured earlier this year for a 300 million litre per day (MLD) seawater desalination plant in Saudi Arabia. As of 2:50 PM, the shares were trading at Rs 1,655.15, down 12.20% from the previous close. Earlier in the day, the stock dropped to Rs 1,586.50 on the NSE, marking a 15.8% decline. This steep fall wiped out a huge portion of the company’s recent market gains. Over the past year, Va Tech Wabag shares had surged by over 193%, outperforming the NSE Nifty 50 index, which gained 14% during the same period. However, the latest development has dented investor confidence, resulting in heavy selling pressure.REASON FOR THE DECLINE The sharp fall in Va Tech Wabag shares followed the company’s announcement that the Saudi Water Authority had cancelled the tender for the Rs 2,700 crore desalination project. This project, awarded to the company in September, was a major contract on an engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (EPCC) basis. The company said that the cancellation was due to ""internal administrative procedures"" within the Saudi Water Authority. Va Tech Wabag is currently in discussions with the authority to understand the reasons behind the decision. The now-cancelled project was a 300 MLD mega seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. It was expected to be completed within 30 months and was designed to incorporate state-of-the-art desalination technologies for energy efficiency and compliance with Saudi Arabia’s environmental regulations. Va Tech Wabag had described the project as a significant milestone, highlighting its expertise in desalination technology and its long-standing presence in Saudi Arabia. The company has been active in the region for over four decades, constructing and operating water and wastewater treatment plants. Globally, since 1995, Va Tech Wabag has built over 60 desalination plants across 17 countries, catering to both municipal and industrial clients. The cancellation of the project has raised concerns about the company’s growth prospects, given the size and importance of the order. The Rs 2,700 crore project was seen as a key driver of Va Tech Wabag’s revenue in the coming years.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

The Karnataka Cabinet recently approved the Karnataka (Mineral Rights and Mineral Bearing Land) Tax Bill, 2024, aimed at levying taxes on mineral rights and mineral-bearing land. This decision is particularly significant for NMDC, as Karnataka accounts for 35% of its production. The proposed Bill allows for taxes ranging between Rs 20 and Rs 100 per tonne of minerals, which could generate annual revenue of Rs 4,207.95 crore for the state. Additionally, land-bearing mineral taxes are expected to add another Rs 505.9 crore annually. The Bill comes after the Supreme Court's earlier approval for states to retrospectively collect mining taxes from 2005. Higher iron ore costs resulting from the tax are likely to affect the profitability of steelmakers and miners alike. As Karnataka’s proposed mining tax reshapes the cost structure for steel and mining companies, stakeholders and investors will closely monitor its implementation and broader implications for the sector.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 18, 2024

LIC has also implemented various measures, including media campaigns and regular follow-ups by agents, to reduce unclaimed claims.WHAT HAPPENS TO LONG-UNCLAIMED AMOUNTS? If money remains unclaimed for over 10 years, it is transferred to the Senior Citizen Welfare Fund (SCWF). These funds are utilised for senior citizens' welfare. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) mandates insurers to display unclaimed amounts of Rs 1,000 or more on their websites. Unclaimed amounts can arise due to litigation, rival claims, blocked policies, or policyholders being out of reach, such as residing abroad or delaying claims for pensions or annuities. Unclaimed deposits are more than forgotten amounts; they reflect missed opportunities for financial security. LIC’s efforts to streamline settlements and spread awareness aim to ensure rightful policyholders or beneficiaries receive their dues promptly.

While the Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, uncertainty looms over its future policy stance.

Analysts at Nomura noted that the Fed's post-meeting commentary is likely to be hawkish, with projections suggesting a slower pace of rate cuts in 2025 and an increase in the long-term median rate to 3%. Adding to the jitters, the US Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the ninth straight session on Tuesday, marking its longest losing streak since February 1978. Rising US Treasury yields and continued strength in the US dollar are also dampening market sentiment globally. Banking stocks plunge - Private banking stocks led the decline as markets tanked on Wednesday. Heavyweights like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank together dragged the Sensex down by over 250 points. Other major losers included Power Grid, which fell 2.23% to Rs 322.65, and Tata Motors, NTPC, and Bharti Airtel, which declined by up to 1.9%. Record low rupee and FPI outflows - The rupee hit a record low against the US dollar, driven by rising US interest rates and global currency market dynamics. A weaker rupee often triggers foreign portfolio investor (FPI) outflows, and data shows that FPIs sold Indian equities worth Rs 6,409.86 crore on Wednesday alone. ""The external pressure on the rupee is becoming more intense due to high US interest rates, idiosyncratic euro weakness, and tariff risks for the yuan,"" HSBC said. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, highlighted that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have turned sellers during market rallies, contributing to the downward pressure. He pointed out that the trend of FII buying seen earlier in December was short-lived, as FIIs are now favouring the US market, which has outperformed India. Despite the weakness in the benchmarks, the broader market has shown resilience. Vijayakumar said that stocks delivering strong quarterly results are being rewarded, and there is less concern about FII selling in this segment. On a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 in the US has gained 27.5%, outperforming the Nifty, which has risen only 12%. This divergence in performance is causing concern among investors, with fears that the trend may continue unless Indian economic indicators show a recovery in GDP growth and corporate earnings in the upcoming quarter.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

Yesterday’s massive FII sell figure of Rs 6410 crores in the cash market indicates that more selling is in store on market bounces.

The fear is that this huge variation in relative performances may continue, given the strength of the US economy and the weakness in the Indian economy.

Global markets are closely watching the Federal Reserve's decision, which is anticipated later today.

Ireland's Data Protection Commission issued the penalties after wrapping up its inquiry into the breach, when hackers gained access to user accounts by exploiting bugs in the platform's code that allowed them to steal digital keys, known as ""access tokens"". Under the 27-nation EU's strict privacy regime, the Irish watchdog is Meta's lead privacy regulator because the company's regional headquarters are based in Dublin. The watchdog issued reprimands and ""administrative penalties"" worth 251 million euros ($264 million) after it found multiple infringements of the rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. The company said it would appeal the decision. ""This decision relates to an incident from 2018. We took immediate action to fix the problem as soon as it was identified,"" Meta said in a statement. The company said it ""proactively informed people impacted"" as well as the Irish watchdog. When it first disclosed the problem, Facebook said 50 million user accounts were affected. But the actual number was around 29 million, including 3 million in Europe, the Irish watchdog said on Tuesday. The company has said that after discovering the bug, it alerted the FBI and regulators in the US and Europe. The hack involved three distinct bugs in Facebook's ""View As"" feature, which let people see how their profiles appear to others. The attackers used the vulnerability to steal access tokens from the accounts of people whose profiles came up in searches using the ""View As"" feature. The attack then moved from one user's Facebook friend to another. Possession of those tokens would allow attackers to control those accounts.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Dec 17, 2024

It ruled that cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are capital assets, meaning profits from their sale are to be treated as capital gains instead of income from other sources. This decision applies to transactions made before April 1, 2022, when the government introduced specific cryptocurrency tax rules.advertisementTAXATION BEFORE AND AFTER 2022Pre-2022 transactions: Before the Virtual Digital Assets (VDA) regulations came into effect in 2022, profits from crypto sales were categorised as capital gains, much like profits from stocks or real estate. Investors holding cryptocurrencies for more than three years could classify their gains as long-term capital gains, often resulting in lower taxes. The ITAT’s ruling confirms this treatment and provides clarity for those who sold cryptocurrencies during this period. Pre-2022 transactions: Before the Virtual Digital Assets (VDA) regulations came into effect in 2022, profits from crypto sales were categorised as capital gains, much like profits from stocks or real estate. Investors holding cryptocurrencies for more than three years could classify their gains as long-term capital gains, often resulting in lower taxes. The ITAT’s ruling confirms this treatment and provides clarity for those who sold cryptocurrencies during this period. Post-2022 transactions: Starting April 1, 2022, the government imposed a flat 30% tax on all cryptocurrency profits, regardless of the holding period. Unlike earlier rules, no deductions or exemptions are allowed under this regime. Whether you hold your crypto for a few months or several years, the same tax rate applies.WHAT THIS MEANS FOR CRYPTO INVESTORS The ITAT ruling offers clarity and a fair approach for crypto investors: Profits before 2022: Must be reported as capital gains. Long-term holdings (over three years) qualify for reduced tax rates under long-term capital gains rules. Profits after 2022: Will be taxed at a fixed rate of 30%, with no deductions. Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, a tax expert, highlighted that this ruling not only recognises cryptocurrencies as capital assets but also provides much-needed clarity for transactions before 2022. Investors must maintain detailed records of all transactions, including purchase and sale dates, and profit calculations, to meet tax compliance requirements. This decision simplifies cryptocurrency taxation and ensures investors treat their profits correctly based on when the transactions occurred.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 17, 2024Must Watch

Taxpayers can declare 6% or 8% of their gross receipts as income without requiring an audit. However, those exceeding Rs 2 crore in turnover must adhere to stricter compliance, including tax audits, said Mihir Tanna of SK Patodia & Associates, while speaking to The Economic Times. While the recall was a relief, it left taxpayers who filed revised ITRs in response to the defective notices in a bind. Experts like Tanna warn that revised ITRs supersede original filings, even if the original notices were erroneous. “Those who didn’t contest the notice may now face processing issues with their revised returns,” he said.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 17, 2024Trending Reel

She acknowledged that July to September was a challenging period for the economy but called the slowdown a ""temporary blip"". India’s GDP growth for the July-September quarter fell sharply to 5.4% from 6.7% in the previous quarter, marking an 18-month low, as per data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in November.  Addressing the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, she highlighted the challenges faced during Q2 but maintained a positive outlook for the upcoming quarters. “At 5.4%, the Q2 rate is slower than expected. Q2 of this financial year has been a challenging quarter for India and for most economies around the world,” she said. However, Sitharaman pointed out that India’s GDP growth has averaged 8.3% over the last three years, which she described as a remarkable achievement on a global scale. Sitharaman said, “India has been the fastest-growing major economy in the world, and the credit goes to the people of India and to the leadership.” She reiterated her confidence that the economy will bounce back soon, stating, “The second quarter growth dip is only a temporary blip; the economy will see healthy growth in coming quarters.” The Finance Minister made these remarks while replying to a debate in the Lok Sabha on the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants. She also assured the House that India remains the fastest-growing economy in the world, despite global economic pressures. She dismissed concerns about a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, saying there is no broad-based decline and explained that half of the sectors within the overall manufacturing basket remain strong. This indicates that while some sectors may have faced challenges, the manufacturing industry as a whole continues to perform well. Talking about inflation, Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted that it remains better controlled now compared to previous years. She compared the current situation with the inflation levels during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, when it had touched double digits. According to the Finance Minister, retail inflation in April-October 2024-25 stood at 4.8%, which is the lowest level recorded since the Covid pandemic. She said this shows that prices are under control despite global challenges, which include rising oil prices and disruptions in supply chains. The Finance Minister also spoke about the improvement in employment levels in recent years. She said that the unemployment rate in the country has fallen. The rate, which was 6% in 2017-18, has now come down to 3.2%. The Union Minister highlighted this as a sign of the economy’s recovery and growth, as more jobs are being created across various sectors.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 17, 2024Tune InMust Watch
