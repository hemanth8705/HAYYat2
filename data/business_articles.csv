Check detailsWhile a low credit score may present challenges, using strategies like reduced DTI, and showing income stability, etc. can help secure a personal loan and improve your credit for the future.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/can-you-get-a-personal-loan-with-low-credit-score-follow-these-tips-check-details-2652396-2024-12-19,"Getting a personal loan with a low credit score might seem challenging, but it’s not impossible. While most lenders prefer a credit score of 750 or above, individuals with lower scores can still secure a loan by strengthening their case in other ways.HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR OBTAINING A PERSONAL LOAN WITH A LOW CREDIT SCORE Bring in a guarantor or co-applicant
Personal loans are unsecured, meaning no collateral is required. If your credit score is below the lender’s threshold, consider involving a guarantor or co-applicant with a stable income and good credit score. This boosts your credibility and enhances your chances of approval. Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio (DTI) Your DTI ratio shows how much of your income goes toward loan repayments. If your credit score is low, keep your DTI low to show strong repayment capacity. Prove income stability
Highlight recent salary hikes or additional income sources to reassure lenders of your repayment capacity. Sharing these details can help convince them of your financial stability. Opt for a smaller loan amount
Applying for a smaller loan amount reduces the lender’s risk and increases your chances of approval. Discuss with the bank if a reduced amount aligns with your needs and eligibility. Explore secured credit options
If traditional loans seem out of reach, consider taking a secured credit card against a fixed deposit. This not only meets your credit needs but also helps build your credit score over time.WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT SCORE Make timely payments on EMIs and credit card bills. Maintain a low credit utilisation ratio. Retain old credit cards for their positive impact on your credit history. Avoid multiple credit applications simultaneously, as it signals credit-hungry behaviour. While a low credit score can be a hurdle, it’s not a deal-breaker. By leveraging strategies like involving a guarantor, reducing DTI, or showcasing income stability, you can secure a personal loan. Additionally, focus on improving your credit score to access better financial opportunities in the future. Stay proactive, and don't let a low score hold you back from reaching your financial goals!Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

This comes after reports that the coffee chain is pushing back plans for some new Starbucks store openings until later in its existing schedule. In a stock exchange filing, the company said, “This is with reference to the news article titled - “Starbucks to Exit India Due to High Costs, Bad Taste, and Mounting Losses”. The Company would like to state that the information in the said article is baseless.” According to a separate report earlier this week by news agency Reuters, fewer customers are walking into cafes, which has coerced Starbucks to recalibrate its plan to open more stores.  Tata Consumer CEO Sunil D'Souza told the news agency last week: “We will calibrate for the short term — maybe instead of opening 100, we will open 80 now, and next year we will open 120 instead of 100.” However, Starbucks is still focussed on its goal to open 1,000 stores by 2028. ""In India, good quality real estate with traffic... is a challenge,"" he said, contrasting that to the ""massive development of malls"" in China. Despite the challenges, Tata Consumer's CEO remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of their investment in coffee. In the last financial year, Starbucks reported a 12% increase in sales, reaching $143.6 million, however its net loss widened. The company's revenue in the first half of this year showed only a slight increase. According to data from business insights provider Tofler, Starbucks' revenue in the last financial year had more than doubled compared to four years ago.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

The Sensex ended 964.15 points lower at 79,218.05, while the Nifty50 settled 247.15 points lower at 23,951.70. All broader market indices finished in the red, mirroring the global market rout triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish rate stance. Sectoral indices faced intense selling pressure, with Nifty IT, Nifty Bank, and Nifty Financial Services logging steep losses. However, Nifty Pharma emerged as the session’s bright spot, gaining nearly 2% as investors sought refuge in defensive stocks amid the volatile market environment. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the market downturn to heightened concerns following the Fed's indication of prolonged higher interest rates. “The Indian market saw a widespread decline following a global sell-off driven by the US Fed’s hawkish stance on interest rates. Sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as banking and real estate, significantly bore the brunt.” Adding a note of relief, he highlighted the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) unexpected decision to keep its interest rate unchanged, which helped ease selling pressure. “Despite this, investor caution persisted amid ongoing FII selling, with a strategic shift towards defensive sectors like pharma as evidenced by their outperformance,” Nair added. As global cues remain uncertain, market participants are likely to keep a close watch on upcoming central bank announcements and inflation data to gauge future market direction.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

Mamata Machinery’s unlisted shares are trading at a premium of Rs 200 or 82.3% in the grey market as it continued to garner strong demand from investors after opening today. This sharp rise in GMP suggests that the market is optimistic about the company’s future prospects. Mamata Machinery, a leading manufacturer of packaging machines, seeks to raise Rs 179.39 crore from its offer for sale, with promoters selling up to 73.82 lakh equity shares at a face value of Rs 10 each. The price band for the IPO is set at Rs 230-243 per share, with a lot size of 61 shares. Retail investors will need a minimum of Rs 14,823 to apply for one lot, while the maximum bid will require Rs 1,92,699 for 134 lots. The subscription window will remain open until December 23, 2024, with shares expected to list on the BSE and NSE on December 27, 2024. Anand Rathi Research and Bajaj Broking have both recommended subscribing to the IPO. Analysts at Anand Rathi are confident about the company's future, citing its strong R&D investments, innovative leadership, and a healthy return on net worth of 27.4% for FY24. They believe the IPO is fairly priced relative to its peers, giving it a competitive edge. Bajaj Broking also supports the IPO from a long-term perspective. The company’s diversified revenue streams, particularly its presence across the polyester, cotton, and technical textile sectors, reduce its reliance on any single segment. Mamata Machinery’s solid financial health, consistent revenue growth, and focus on innovation and sustainability are expected to drive future growth. While Mamata Machinery’s IPO is generating strong interest, investors should consider its long-term growth potential and solid fundamentals when making a decision. The sharp rise in GMP reflects positive market sentiment, but as with any investment, careful evaluation is key.

In early trade, the S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 1,153.17 points to 79,029.03, while the Nifty also fell sharply over 200 points. At around 12:05 pm, Sensex was down 896.84 points to 79,288.13 and Nifty was trading 232.70 points lower at 23,966.25.  All the other broader market indices were also trading in negative territory. WHAT TRIGGERED THE MARKET BLOODBATH? The US Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate cut met market expectations but failed to comfort investors due to its cautious guidance. The Fed indicated only two more rate cuts in 2025, dashing hopes for a more aggressive easing cycle. This announcement triggered a Wall Street meltdown, with the Dow Jones plunging 1,123.03 points (2.6%) to 42,326.87. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also nosedived 3.6% and 3% respectively. Asian markets followed suit, with indices in Japan, China, and South Korea losing up to 1.2%. This was the key factor behind today's meltdown on Dalal Street. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital, said, ""The US Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25-point rate cut, coupled with signals of reduced future cuts, has led to a significant sell-off in global markets. This rate cut could make Indian assets less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to capital outflows."" In addition, the rupee also hit a record low today, further hurting market sentiments.  ""Additionally, the rupee's continued decline to new lows has further soured sentiment. A prolonged depreciation of the rupee could exacerbate the trade deficit and heighten inflationary pressures in the future,"" Aggarwal said. ""The higher import bill stemming from a weaker rupee adds to these concerns,"" he added.  Rising US bond yields and a stronger dollar also exacerbated concerns about capital outflows from emerging markets, including India. The dollar index surged to 108, while the US 10-year bond yield climbed to 4.5%. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out Rs 1,316.81 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday, adding pressure on the rupee, which risks further depreciation. Domestic investors stepped in, buying Rs 4,084.08 crore worth of shares, cushioning the market to some extent.WHAT NEXT?  Technical experts highlighted 23,900 on the Nifty as a crucial support level, aligning with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Analysts expect the index to stabilize between 23,800 and 23,900, with the Put-Call Ratio at 0.55 signaling an oversold market. Investor wealth eroded by Rs 6.57 lakh crore, shrinking the total market valuation to Rs 446.03 lakh crore from Rs 452.60 lakh crore the previous session, reflecting the day’s severe market carnage. ""The reduction in global growth and demand presents another challenge, with potential negative implications for pricing across key sectors. In the short term, heightened market volatility is expected,"" Aggarwal said.  He, however, highlighted that investors ""should avoid panic selling during these fluctuations and focus on fundamentally strong securities with minimal exposure to global factors"".

This decline comes after the US Federal Reserve cut key interest rates by 25 bps and signalled fewer rate cuts in 2025, putting additional strain on the currency, which has already been under pressure due to weak capital inflows and other economic challenges. The rupee dropped to 85.0650 against the US dollar in early trade, compared to 84.9525 on Wednesday. The pace of the rupee’s depreciation has accelerated recently, with the fall from Rs 84 to Rs 85 taking just two months. In contrast, the slide from Rs 83 to Rs 84 took 14 months, and it took 10 months for the rupee to weaken from Rs 82 to Rs 83. The rupee’s decline is not an isolated event, as other Asian currencies also weakened on Thursday. The Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indonesian rupiah all fell by 0.8%-1.2% during the day. The sell-off in Asian currencies followed the Federal Reserve’s latest policy guidance. The Fed’s ""dot plot,"" which outlines its rate expectations, now projects only two rate cuts in 2025, half of what was previously signalled in September. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments further added to the market’s caution. He said, ""From here, it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts.""WHAT'S DRIVING THE FALL  The rupee’s weakening has been driven by a combination of global and domestic factors. India’s economic growth slowed to a seven-quarter low in the July-September period, while the merchandise trade deficit has been widening. Capital inflows into the country have also remained subdued. Persistent strength in the US dollar has added to the rupee’s troubles. Expectations of robust US economic policies have kept the dollar strong, and the Fed’s latest guidance is expected to further boost the greenback’s value. India’s slowing economic growth has also led to speculation that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may need to cut rates soon, adding to downward pressure on the rupee. Akshay Kumar, Head of Global Markets at BNP Paribas India, noted, ""In the short term, we can expect upward pressure on USD/INR to remain."" The challenging environment for the rupee has prompted investors to raise their short positions on the currency to a two-year high, according to a recent Reuters poll. The rupee has already weakened by 2% so far this year, placing it in the middle of the performance pack among Asian currencies. Despite routine interventions by the Reserve Bank of India to stabilise the currency, analysts believe the rupee’s muted volatility of recent years may not continue in 2025.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/market-crash-dalal-street-bloodbath-3-reasons-behind-today-fall-us-fed-rate-cut-weak-rupee-2652125-2024-12-19,"The stock markets tanked in early trade on Thursday, mirroring losses in global markets, extending their losses for the fourth consecutive session. This drop followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points for the third time in a row. While the rate cut was anticipated, the Fed’s cautious outlook on further cuts disappointed investors, dampening hopes for a year-end rally. The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 1,153.17 points, or 1.44%, to 79,029.03, while the Nifty declined by 213.10 points, or 0.88%, to 23,985.75. This marked the fourth consecutive day of losses for the benchmark indices. Leading the slide, Wipro dropped 2.64% to Rs 304.35, making it the worst-performing stock on the Nifty. Other significant losers included Shriram Finance, Asian Paints, Hindalco, ONGC, Infosys, and Tata Steel, which all declined by more than 2%.GLOBAL SELL-OFF The US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates to the range of 4.25%-4.50% was in line with market expectations. However, the Fed’s guidance for only two more rate cuts in 2025—against market hopes for three or four—spooked investors. This triggered a sell-off in Wall Street, with the Dow Jones dropping 1,123.03 points (2.6%) to 42,326.87, the Nasdaq falling 716.37 points (3.6%) to 19,392.69, and the S&P 500 tumbling 178.45 points (3.0%) to 5,872.16. The cautious outlook also impacted Asian markets. Indices in Japan, China, and South Korea fell by up to 1.2%, and the sentiment carried over to Indian markets. Analysts suggest that the sharp correction may end hopes of a ""Santa rally"" in the final weeks of December.DOMESTIC CONCERNS Weak data on the domestic front added to the selling pressure. The rise in the US dollar and bond yields led to concerns about foreign outflows from Indian markets. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, reached 108. Meanwhile, the 10-year US bond yield increased to 4.5%. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers, pulling out Rs 1,316.81 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday. Analysts noted that a stronger dollar and higher bond yields typically lead to capital outflows from emerging markets, adding pressure on local currencies. The rupee is now at risk of further depreciation against the dollar, which could make Indian assets less attractive to global investors.KEY LEVELS Technical analysts highlighted critical support levels for the Nifty. Rajesh Bhosale from Angel One stated that 24,000 would act as a psychological level, while 23,900—aligned with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement—would serve as key support zones. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd, said that the Put-Call Ratio (PCR) of 0.55 indicates an oversold market. This suggests that Nifty might stabilise in the 23,800–23,900 range and trade sideways in the short term. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services explained that high market valuations require only a small trigger for a sharp correction. The Fed’s guidance, which indicated slower rate cuts in 2025, provided that trigger. Vijayakumar added that while the Fed chief’s comments about the US economy and labour market were positive, markets reacted negatively as expectations were not met. Nomura analysts had also predicted a hawkish Fed stance, expecting the pace of rate cuts to slow in the coming year. Their prediction materialised, with market sentiment turning cautious globally.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

At one point of time, the Sensex was down over 1,100 points in early trade but swiftly recovered to settle down below 900 points.  Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that when valuations are high the market needs only a trigger to correct sharply. ""This trigger was provided by the Fed guidance of fewer rate cuts in 2025, which went against market expectations. Even though the  rate cut of 25 bp was in tune with the market’s expectation, the indication of only two cuts of 25 bp each in 2025 against market expectation of three or even four cuts spooked the market resulting in a sharp sell-off in Wall Street. The Fed chief’s comments regarding the economy and the labour market are, in fact, positive, suggesting a resilient US economy. But always the market gets spooked when the reality falls short of expectations,"" he added.  India VIX, which measures market volatility, rose by 3.70%.The Nifty Midcap100 index fell 0.84%, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index declined 1.02%.  The dollar index rising above 108 and the 10-year bond yield spiking to 4.52 % are clearly negatives from the perspective of FII fund flows. But this is likely to be only temporary. ""Sharp cuts in the market today will provide opportunities for investors to buy. The broader market will be impacted less despite high valuations since the FII impact will be negligible in this segment. Therefore, there can be a sharp bounce back in growth stocks in this segment. Long-term investors, who can ignore short-term gyrations, should focus on fairly valued large-caps which will provide buying opportunities for investors who are prepared to wait,"" said Vijayakumar.

The Fed’s decision, along with its forecast of fewer rate cuts in 2025, rattled investors across the globe, leading to widespread sell-offs in equities. The US Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, bringing it to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. The move was widely anticipated; however, the Fed surprised markets by signalling a slower pace of rate cuts in the coming year. In its latest projections, the Fed halved the number of quarter-point cuts it expects in 2025, reducing them from four to just two. This unexpected shift has raised concerns that higher interest rates may persist longer than previously thought. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation has ""eased significantly"" but remains ""somewhat elevated"" compared to the central bank's target of 2%. Powell expressed optimism about the US economy, adding that the Fed is ""significantly closer"" to ending its current rate-cutting cycle.GLOBAL MARKET REACTIONS Wall Street reacted negatively to the Fed’s announcement, with all three major US indices—Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq—posting their biggest single-day losses in months. Yields on US Treasurys surged as investors adjusted to the prospect of prolonged higher interest rates. Asian markets followed suit, with major indices in the region also trading lower. Gift Nifty, an indicator for the Indian markets, was trading around 23,935—about 320 points below Nifty futures’ previous close—suggesting a gap-down opening for Indian equities.IMPACT ON SENSEX AND NIFTY The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to mirror global trends and open in the red. Market participants remain cautious about the broader implications of the Fed’s slower pace of easing, especially as inflation and global economic uncertainties persist. “Bullish sentiments took a hit after the Fed reduced its projections for rate cuts in 2025. While the 25 basis point rate cut was expected, the trimmed outlook for future cuts has upset market sentiment. Nifty’s 200-day moving average at 23,816 may come under pressure as the indices look poised for a negative opening,"" said Mehta Equities in its theme of the day for the markets. WHAT TO EXPECT Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd said that a sharp sell-off has been witnessed in global markets following a hawkish rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. ""Gift Nifty indicates a gap-down opening, continuing the three-day losing streak. The first major support to watch is the low of the December series at 23,923, with the 200-DMA around 23,800 serving as a critical support level. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) at 0.55 reflects an extremely oversold market, suggesting a possibility that Nifty could find support in the 23,923–23,800 zone and trade sideways. Overall, the market remains largely range-bound, with a focus on sector-specific and stock-specific movements,"" he added.  Investors in the Indian markets will be closely monitoring global cues, including the performance of US stock futures and Asian indices. The impact of the Fed’s decisions on foreign institutional investments (FIIs) in Indian equities will also be a key factor. While the Fed's move is seen as a step closer to ending its current rate-cutting cycle, its cautious approach has cast uncertainty over the pace of global economic recovery. Indian markets, like their global counterparts, will remain on edge as they navigate this evolving economic landscape. Dalal Street has faced a rough patch over the past few trading sessions. The benchmark indices, the S&P BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty50, extended their losses on Wednesday, leaving investors worried about their year-end performance. The Sensex dropped by 502.25 points to close at 80,182.20, while the Nifty50 declined by 137.15 points to settle at 24,198.85. Financial and banking heavyweights were among the major losers, dragging the indices down further. ""The Indian market is experiencing a breakdown in the early Santa Claus rally, with the impact being more pronounced in India compared to developed markets due to the rapid appreciation of the dollar. Market sentiment remains cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting and potential policy and tariff shifts from the incoming US administration,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

To address widespread confusion, the Income Tax Department has released a detailed brochure on December 11, 2024, to help taxpayers navigate their disclosure obligations. With penalties and prosecution on the line, timely compliance is essential.advertisementWHO NEEDS TO REPORT AND WHAT TO DISCLOSE?All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
 The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES Taxpayers must declare foreign income and assets in the applicable ITR for the assessment year they were a resident in India. The deadlines are as follows: Original returns: File by July 31, 2024. Belated or revised returns: File by December 31, 2024. If a return has already been filed without these disclosures, taxpayers can revise their ITR using the correct form and schedules before the December deadline. Accurate documentation, such as acquisition details and income generated, is critical.CONSEQUENCES OF NON-DISCLOSURE Non-compliance can result in penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh if foreign assets exceed Rs 20 lakh (excluding immovable property). Further, prosecution under the Black Money Act could be initiated for false or incomplete disclosures. Late filers have until December 31, 2024, to submit belated or revised returns to avoid legal repercussions. Disclosing foreign income and assets not only ensures compliance with Indian tax laws but also avoids double taxation under international agreements. The Income Tax Department has simplified the process through a brochure that explains the steps to disclose and claim relief. Taxpayers should take this opportunity to file accurate returns and align with both the Income Tax Act and the Black Money Act. With heavy penalties and legal actions looming, timely disclosure isn’t just advisable—it’s indispensable for financial integrity.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

At 10:28 am, the S&P BSE Sensex fell 274.86 points to 78,943.19, while the NSE Nifty50 dropped 67.90 points to 23,883.80. Broader market indices also traded in the red as volatility spiked, pressuring blue-chip stocks. Nifty50’s top losers included Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra, Ultratech Cement, M&M, and Shriram Finance. Meanwhile, Dr Reddy’s, Titan, NTPC, Hindalco, and Power Grid emerged as the session’s top gainers. Meanwhile, the rupee hit a fresh record low of 85.10 against the US dollar, raising concerns about potential foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “FII buying seen in early December is reversing, with this week’s selling reaching Rs 12,229 crore. This shift is impacting large-cap stocks, particularly in the financial sector.” He advised retail investors to adopt a contrarian strategy, noting, “Quality large-caps will likely bounce back soon.” He also highlighted the resilience of pharma stocks and projected strength in IT, citing positive results from Accenture and the growing profitability of generative AI services. The recent sell-off comes after the Fed’s 25-basis-point rate cut and a reduced forecast for interest rate reductions in 2025.

The rupee surpassed its previous low of 85.0850 reached on Thursday and settled at 85.10 by 10:00 am. Traders reported state-run banks offering dollars, likely on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which helped limit further depreciation. Despite the intervention, the rupee remained under pressure due to several domestic and global factors.WHAT'S BEHIND THE RUPEE'S DECLINE?  India's economic growth slowing to a seven-quarter low and a widened merchandise trade deficit have raised concerns among investors. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve’s projection of fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid sticky inflation has strengthened the US dollar, making emerging market currencies like the rupee more vulnerable. “Higher trade deficit along with slow growth figures puts the rupee on test with outflows from domestic equity markets. For USD/INR, positionally 84.70 now acts as a good base while the door remains open for 85.50 levels,"" Kunal Sodhani, Vice President at Shinhan Bank India, told news agency Reuters.  The dollar index hovered near a two-year high of 108.4 after stronger-than-expected US GDP growth and a sharp decline in weekly jobless claims boosted confidence in the US economy. Foreign investors also contributed to the rupee's woes, selling nearly $500 million worth of Indian stocks on Thursday. However, routine interventions by the RBI have kept the rupee’s volatility relatively lower than that of its Asian counterparts. Investors now await the US core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation data, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, due later on Friday, which could further influence currency markets.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Must Watch

Despite initial reservations about market timing and potential risks for customers, Kamath emphasised the growing demand and the business need to offer MTF. Sharing the news on X, Nithin Kamath said, “I don't know if it is a good time with the fall in the markets, but we are finally launching MTF, which allows you to buy stocks for delivery by borrowing money from us.” He added, “I haven't been sure about this product for a long time because of obvious reasons. Customers who trade for delivery tend to ignore the impact of the cost of borrowing, and there's always the risk of the trade going against them, which leads to a bigger loss.” Talking about the growth of MTF in the last few years, he said, ""But in the last 3 to 4 years, MTF has grown tremendously, with pretty much everyone offering it. Considering the number of customers asking us for the feature, it didn't make business sense for us to not offer it.""
 


WHAT IS MTF?The Margin Trading Facility (MTF) enables investors to trade with leverage, allowing them to buy stocks for delivery even if they don’t have the full amount upfront. Investors can borrow up to 80% of the stock's value, depending on the stock.In simpler words, through MTF, investors pay only a portion of the total stock value, with the broker funding the remainder as a loan. Interest is charged on the borrowed amount, making MTF a strategic yet cost-sensitive trading option.HOW DOES MTF WORK? The Margin Trading Facility (MTF) enables investors to trade with leverage, allowing them to buy stocks for delivery even if they don’t have the full amount upfront. Investors can borrow up to 80% of the stock's value, depending on the stock. In simpler words, through MTF, investors pay only a portion of the total stock value, with the broker funding the remainder as a loan. Interest is charged on the borrowed amount, making MTF a strategic yet cost-sensitive trading option.HOW DOES MTF WORK? MTF allows investors to purchase stocks for delivery with leverage, enabling them to trade even if they don’t have the full amount. Up to 80% of the stock value can be borrowed, subject to an interest rate of 0.04% per day (Rs. 40 per lakh). For example, if you want to buy shares worth Rs. 400 but have only Rs. 100, you can use MTF. Providing 25% of the total value as your initial investment, the broker funds the remaining Rs. 300, allowing you to purchase shares worth Rs. 400. The stocks must be pledged with the broker as per Sebi guidelines.WEIGHING THE REWARDS AND RISKS MTF can amplify your returns. If a stock you buy for Rs. 400 rises to Rs. 450, your profit of Rs. 50 translates to a 50% return on your Rs. 100 investment. However, if the price drops to Rs. 350, you lose Rs. 50, eroding 50% of your investment. While MTF offers the potential for higher gains, it also comes with increased risks due to leveraged trading and borrowing costs. The Margin Trading Facility can be a powerful tool for maximising limited funds, but it demands responsible usage. Stay informed, diversify your investments, monitor balances, and have a clear exit strategy to navigate risks effectively and unlock the full potential of this feature.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Higher returns often come with elevated risks, while safer options yield modest rewards. For those willing to embrace calculated risks, market-linked investments like equities offer a promising route to wealth creation over time. Amongst all asset classes, equities have historically delivered inflation-beating returns, making them a preferred choice for long-term investors. Alternatives like real estate and gold can also offer substantial returns, but factors such as low liquidity and transactional complexities often give equities an edge. Here are five high-return investment avenues to consider: Direct equity
Buying stocks directly on exchanges like BSE or NSE lets investors participate in corporate growth. Diversification across sectors and market caps is crucial to mitigate risks.
However, high volatility and the potential for significant capital loss demand thorough research. Initial public offerings (IPOs)
IPOs allow investors to purchase shares during a company’s debut on the stock market. After listing, these shares trade in the secondary market.
However, IPO allotment is uncertain, and listing prices can be unpredictable due to market dynamics. Mid- and small-cap equity funds
These funds focus on smaller companies with growth potential. SEBI mandates a minimum of 65% allocation to equities for such schemes.
However, higher market volatility and limited liquidity make these funds suitable for risk-tolerant investors. Equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS)
ELSS combines equity investments with tax-saving benefits, featuring a mandatory three-year lock-in period.
However, performance post-lock-in can vary, requiring periodic reviews. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending
This digital platform connects borrowers and investors, offering attractive interest rates.
However, loans are unsecured, increasing the chance of defaults. Navigating the world of investments is about aligning your financial goals with your risk appetite. Whether you choose equities, real estate, or innovative options like P2P lending, staying informed and diversifying your portfolio can help you turn risks into rewards.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Benchmark stock market indices fell sharply during Friday’s trading session, extending their weak run throughout the week. The sharp decline was driven by weak global cues, persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) selling, and a steep slide in information technology (IT) stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex ended 1,176.46 points lower at 78,041.59, while the NSE Nifty50 settled 364.20 points lower at 23,587.50. All broader market indices also fell as volatility spiked following the US Federal Reserve’s recent commentary on rate cuts. Renewed FII selling further weighed on sentiment, with this week’s outflows reaching Rs 12,229 crore. The Nifty IT index tumbled nearly 2.7% and emerged as the top loser among sectoral indices. Major IT stocks such as Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and TCS declined in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Other key sectoral indices like Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services also saw sharp losses. The top five losers on the Nifty50 were Tech Mahindra, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, M&M, and Trent. On the flip side, the top gainers included Dr Reddy’s, JSW Steel, ICICI Bank, Nestle India, and HDFC Life. Broader weakness in Asian markets, triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s downward revision of its 2025 interest rate-cut forecast, added to the pressure on domestic stocks. The Fed's decision dampened market sentiment, particularly impacting IT stocks, which have significant exposure to US clients. “The negative reaction to the Fed’s commentary is temporary,” said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “Quality large-cap stocks are likely to bounce back soon, offering a buying opportunity for retail investors.” While market volatility may persist in the near term due to global uncertainties and continued FII selling, experts believe a recovery led by large-cap stocks is possible in the coming sessions.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Must Watch

The BSE Sensex plummeted over 4,000 points across five consecutive sessions, while the NSE Nifty50 fell approximately 1,200 points, representing a nearly 5% loss within the week. The ongoing selloff has been fuelled by several factors, including hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve, aggressive selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), and concerns over high valuations in the Indian stock market. Adding to investor unease, sluggish corporate earnings growth has further dampened market sentiment, reducing hopes for a quick recovery. On December 20, the NSE Nifty dropped more than 400 points before closing at 23,587, down 1.5%. The BSE Sensex, which fell about 1,350 points intraday, ended the session 1,176 points lower at 78,042. Since its recent swing high on December 13, the Nifty has lost nearly 5% of its value.US FED'S HAWKISH SIGNALS  The US Federal Reserve implemented a 25 basis points rate cut this week, a move widely anticipated by the markets. However, its guidance for only two rate cuts in 2025 fell short of expectations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted persistent inflationary risks, revising the 2025 inflation forecast upward. This cautious outlook sent shockwaves through global markets, including India’s. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said, “Disappointment over slower-than-expected rate cuts by the Fed has affected global sentiment. This bearish view is amplified in India, where high valuations and low earnings growth are already concerns.”FII SELLING RESUMES Foreign institutional investors, who had been net buyers earlier this month, sold Rs 12,230 crore worth of Indian equities over the past four sessions. A strong US dollar, coupled with attractive US bond yields at around 4.52%, has diverted funds away from emerging markets. ""With weak earnings growth, FIIs have few incentives to invest in India for now,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit.CONCERNS OVER TECHNICAL LEVELS  The Nifty fell below its 200-day moving average (23,870) on Thursday, intensifying the selling pressure. On Friday, the breach of support at 23,850 opened the door for further downside, with analysts eyeing levels of 23,500.WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO?  While the ongoing correction has made select large-cap stocks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank more attractive, experts advise caution. The FMCG sector remains expensive, and broader sentiment is expected to stay subdued until February’s RBI policy meeting. Investors are urged to focus on quality stocks and wait for greater market stability.

With this scheme, taxpayers can clear pending tax liabilities by paying the disputed amount along with a specified additional percentage, while enjoying the waiver of interest and penalties. Designed to reduce litigation and streamline tax resolution, the Income Tax Department has issued new FAQs to clarify eligibility and procedures. Let’s have a closer look at some of these FAQs. Can a taxpayer file a declaration under the DTVSV (Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme), 2024 if their appeal was disposed of on merits or dismissed as withdrawn before filing the declaration, for the purposes of the scheme?
Yes, such cases are eligible for settlement under the scheme, as the appeal was pending on 22nd July 2024. The disputed tax will be calculated as if the appeal had not yet been disposed of on that date. Is a case eligible for settlement if a taxpayer has filed a declaration in Form-I, and the appeal is disposed of by the concerned authority after the declaration?
Yes, this case is also eligible for settlement. If the time limit for filing an appeal expired before July 22, 2024, but an appeal with an application for condonation of delay was filed after this date, can the taxpayer opt for the scheme in this case?
No, the appeal must be pending as of July 22, 2024, for a taxpayer to be eligible for the scheme. Therefore, such cases will not be eligible. If an appeal and an application for condonation of delay were both filed before July 22, 2024, and the appeal was admitted after the condonation of delay before filing the declaration under the scheme, can the taxpayer opt for the scheme?
Yes, the taxpayer can opt for settlement under the scheme in such cases. Is an appeal filed against intimation under section 143(1) of the Act and pending as of July 22, 2024, eligible for the DTVSV Scheme 2024?
Yes, any appeal filed against intimation under section 143(1) of the Act and pending as of July 22, 2024, is eligible for settlement under the scheme. Are cases with pending review petitions before the High Courts or Supreme Court eligible for settlement under the DTVSV Scheme 2024?
No, the pendency of a review petition does not equate to the pendency of an appeal before the High Courts, and therefore, it does not count as an appeal pending for the purposes of the scheme. Can the DTVSV Scheme 2024 be availed in cases where proceedings are pending before the Income Tax Settlement Commission (ITSC) or where a writ has been filed against an order of the ITSC?
No, the scheme cannot be availed in these cases. The Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme 2024 offers a unique opportunity for taxpayers to settle their pending income tax disputes in a streamlined manner, helping to reduce litigation and providing financial relief. By addressing key questions about eligibility, the Income Tax Department has provided much-needed clarity. However, taxpayers should carefully assess their individual circumstances and stay informed about the specific requirements to make the most of this valuable scheme. With the right guidance, this initiative could pave the way for quicker, stress-free resolutions of tax disputes.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

A wide range of proposals, from essential services to luxury items, are under discussion, some of which could significantly impact consumers and businesses.LUXURY ITEMS UNDER SPOTLIGHT Luxury items are under the spotlight, with a proposal to increase GST on high-end products. Wristwatches priced above Rs 25,000 and shoes costing over Rs 15,000 per pair may soon attract a 28% GST, up from the current 18%. Additionally, changes in the tax structure for readymade garments have been proposed. Garments priced below â‚¹1,500 are expected to remain at 5%, while those priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 10,000 may see a jump to 18%. Premium garments above Rs 10,000 could face a steep 28% tax. These changes aim to rationalise rates and align taxation with the pricing structure of luxury goods.FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS In a move to ease costs for food delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato, the GST rate may be reduced from 18% with input tax credit (ITC) to a simpler 5% without ITC. This could lower delivery charges, benefiting end consumers. The measure also seeks to address the disparity in tax burdens between dining in and ordering food.GST ON INSURANCE PLATFORMS The meeting has taken up proposals to reform GST on insurance premiums, especially to benefit senior citizens and essential health cover. The Group of Ministers (GoM) has recommended exempting health insurance plans with â‚¹5 lakh coverage, term life insurance, and certain senior citizen-focused policies from GST. Currently, health and life insurance premiums attract an 18% GST rate, while endowment and annuity plans face differential rates. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has underscored the need for exemptions, citing international practices where insurance products are largely tax-free. The proposed reforms could make health and term insurance more accessible, particularly for marginalized groups.AVIATION TURBINE FUEL UNDER GST The council is also considering bringing Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) under the GST regime. This longstanding demand from the aviation industry would allow airlines to claim input tax credit, potentially reducing operational costs. However, this proposal may face resistance from states due to revenue concerns. Meanwhile, a broad set of 148 items, including compact vehicles and pre-owned electric vehicles, may see tax increases. These items are proposed to move from the 12% to the 18% GST bracket, aligning with ongoing efforts to rationalise rates.OTHER POSSIBLE DELIBERATIONS The four-tier GST structure will remain unchanged, but discussions on introducing a 35% rate for sin goods, alongside extensions to the GST compensation cess regime, signal the council’s intent to fine-tune the tax system. While the council's decisions are expected to balance revenue generation with consumer relief, consensus remains critical to implementing these sweeping changes. The meeting's outcomes could reshape taxation across sectors, influencing consumer choices and industry practices in the coming months.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

One of the key items on the agenda is the proposal to reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on insurance premiums, a move that could bring relief to policyholders. A Group of Ministers (GoM) set up by the Council, led by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, has already made progress on this matter. In its meeting last month, the GoM recommended exempting term life insurance premiums from GST, a proposal that has garnered support from several states. Additionally, the GoM has suggested that premiums paid by senior citizens for health insurance should be exempt from the tax, which could benefit a significant portion of the population. There is also a proposal to exempt GST on health insurance premiums of up to Rs 5 lakh, paid by individuals who are not senior citizens. This move, if approved, would make health insurance more affordable for a broader section of the population, especially as medical costs continue to rise.WHAT ELSE IS ON THE AGENDA?  While these changes seem to have strong backing, the Council may defer decisions on other major tax reforms, such as a higher tax on so-called sin goods like tobacco and alcohol. States are still divided on the proposal to increase taxes on these products, and a final decision may take more time. The upcoming decision on insurance premiums is significant not only for policyholders but also for the broader insurance sector. A lower tax burden could encourage more people to opt for insurance, increasing the penetration of life and health coverage in India. As the GST Council continues to evaluate various options, the focus on insurance premiums reflects the government’s ongoing efforts to make essential services more affordable, especially for vulnerable groups like senior citizens. With most states in favor of tax reductions, a positive outcome for policyholders seems likely.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

During the 55th meeting held on Saturday, technical considerations led to the deferral, with the Group of Ministers (GoM) tasked to conduct further deliberations. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman chaired the meeting, which concluded that additional discussions were needed before finalising any changes. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, who leads the GoM on insurance, stated that more time is required to resolve outstanding issues, particularly regarding the taxation of group policies, individual policies, and senior citizens' plans. A subsequent GoM meeting is scheduled for January to finalise these discussions. In November, the GoM recommended certain reforms, including exempting premiums paid for term life insurance policies from GST. Similarly, health insurance premiums paid by senior citizens were proposed for exemption, alongside those up to Rs 5 lakh for non-senior citizens. However, premiums exceeding Rs 5 lakh will continue to be taxed at 18%. The delay reflects the need for further technical assessment, as there are varying opinions among states about these proposed changes. With most states supporting the notion of reducing the tax burden, a positive resolution remains a likely outcome, albeit requiring additional time for consensus.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

The GST Council in its 55th meeting also decided to clarify on taxability of popcorn, saying caramelised popcorn will continue to attract tax at the rate of 18 per cent. However, pre-packed and spiced popcorn will attract 12 per cent, while 5 per cent will be levied on unpacked and unlabelled ones. It has been decided to regularise the issues for the past on ""as is where is"" basis... ""It is a clarification being recommended by the GST Council to settle the disputes arising out of interpretation,"" an official statement said. The panel, headed by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising representatives of all states and UTs, deferred decisions on reducing tax rate on insurance products as also on levy of the tax on food delivery by app-based platforms. The panel cut the tax rate on fortified rice kernels used for public distribution to 5 per cent from 18 per cent, Sitharaman told reporters after the meeting of the Council here. The Council also decided that no GST will be payable on penal charges levied and collected by banks and NBFCs from borrowers for non-compliance with loan terms. The panel deferred a decision on reducing the rate of tax on insurance premium, pending comments of the sector regulator, she said. A group of ministers examining the issue had recommended exempting insurance premiums paid for term life insurance policies from GST and premium paid by senior citizens for health insurance cover. It had also suggested GST exemption on premium paid by individuals, other than senior citizens, for health insurance with coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh. Alongside, the GoM on rate rationalisation, which is looking at tweaking rates on 148 items, will be given more time to arrive at a decision. The finance minister said the council decided to raise the rate of tax to 18 per cent from 12 per cent on all used EV sales, just as in case of non-electric vehicles, and it will be applicable only on the value that represents margin - the difference between the purchase price and selling price (depreciated value if depreciation is claimed) - by businesses. Sale and purchase of used vehicles by individuals will continue to be exempt from GST. Without naming any state, she said the states wanted to continue to keep aviation turbine fuel (ATF), used in aircraft, out of the goods and services tax (GST). When the GST subsumed more than a dozen central and state levies into GST in July 2017, five products - crude oil, petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas - were kept out of its purview. The central government levies excise duty on them and states levy VAT. ""Every state clearly said that ATF should not come into GST... States did not feel comfortable"" to include ATF under the GST, she said. She said black pepper and raisins when supplied by an agriculturalist is not liable to GST payment. GoM on health insurance requires more work, she said, adding the same was the case with rate rationalisation GoM. ""No report (on rate rationalisation) has been finalised,"" she said. The GoM on GST compensation cess, under Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, has been given an extended deadline to submit its report. The earlier deadline was December 31, 2024. On small companies facing registration problems, she said a concept note has received in-principle approvals. This may require amendments to be made to the GST Acts to make it easier for small companies to register. The Council also decided to set up a Group of Ministers to mull over allowing states to levy cess under GST to overcome financial distress after natural calamities. Finance ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal would be part of the GoM. The Council decided to form the GoM after Andhra Pradesh sought Council's approval to levy 1 per cent cess to overcome financial distress post flood in the state. No decision was taken on levy of tax on delivery charges by quick commerce and food delivery platforms. ""This has been deferred,"" she said, adding the Fitment Committee will again review it and the issue being debated is if the tax should be equivalent to 5 per cent GST levied on food or more.Published By: Vivek Published On: Dec 21, 2024ALSO READ |  Paytm Money launches 'Pay Later' Margin Trading. 3 things to knowMust Watch

These decisions aim to streamline tax processes, provide relief in certain areas, and align taxation policies with emerging needs.WHAT’S GETTING CHEAPER? Several items and services will see a reduction in GST rates, offering financial relief: Fortified Rice Kernels (FRK): The GST rate on FRK has been reduced to 5% when supplied through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This move is targeted at ensuring affordable nutrition for economically weaker sections of society. Gene Therapy: In a step toward making advanced medical treatments more accessible, gene therapy has been fully exempted from GST. Food Preparations for Free Distribution: Inputs supplied for food distribution under government schemes for the economically weaker sections will now attract a concessional 5% GST rate. Systems for Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile (LRSAM) Assembly: The Council has exempted Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on systems, sub-systems, and tools used for LRSAM manufacturing, a move likely to benefit the defense sector. Inspection Equipment for IAEA: Imports of equipment and consumable samples for inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will now be exempt from IGST, supporting international regulatory compliance. Pepper and Raisins (Direct Sales): Pepper and raisins sold directly by agriculturists have been clarified as not liable to GST, ensuring relief for agricultural producers.WHAT’S GETTING COSTLIER? On the other hand, some items and services will see higher GST rates, increasing costs for consumers: Old and Used Vehicles (Including EVs): The GST rate has been increased from 12% to 18% on the sale of old and used vehicles, except for certain petrol and diesel variants. This change will impact the resale market for automobiles. Ready-to-Eat Popcorn: Pre-packaged and labelled ready-to-eat popcorn will now attract a 12% GST, while caramelised popcorn will be taxed at 18%. Non-pre-packaged and labelled popcorn with the character of “namkeens” will continue to attract 5% GST. Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (ACC) Blocks: ACC blocks containing more than 50% fly ash will now be taxed at 12%, affecting construction costs. Corporate Sponsorship Services: These services have been brought under the Forward Charge Mechanism, potentially increasing costs for corporate sponsors.OTHER POLICY UPDATES The Council also announced several updates aimed at clarifying existing policies and addressing long-standing ambiguities: Vouchers: Transactions involving vouchers have been clarified as neither a supply of goods nor services, making them exempt from GST. Penal Charges: Penalties collected by banks and NBFCs for non-compliance with loan terms will not attract GST, providing relief to borrowers. Definition of ‘Pre-Packaged and Labelled’: The definition has been updated to align with the Legal Metrology Act. It now covers commodities intended for retail sale, containing not more than 25 kg or 25 liters, and requiring mandatory labeling under the Act. These decisions are expected to have a varied impact across sectors, from healthcare and agriculture to automobiles and retail.  While some changes aim to reduce costs and boost affordability, others align with the government’s focus on revenue optimization and compliance.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Must Watch

Mirchandani had often spoken about his motivation to innovate in India’s FMCG sector, inspired by a lecture during business school. His plans included scaling Epigamia's revenue to Rs 250 crore by FY25 and increasing the brand’s presence in quick commerce channels. His death is among several recent losses in India’s startup ecosystem, including those of Pepperfry co-founder Ambareesh Murty and Good Capital’s Rohan Malhotra.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Dec 22, 2024ALSO READ |  Padma Shri awardee environmentalist Tulsi Gowda dies at 86 in Karnataka

This change, part of the benchmark index's planned rebalancing, will take effect on December 23, replacing steel major JSW Steel. The index reshuffle is expected to result in changes in fund flows. Brokerage firm Nuvama has estimated inflows of $513 million into Zomato due to its inclusion in the Sensex, while JSW Steel may see outflows of $252 million. This rebalancing underscores the evolving dynamics of the stock market as tech-focused companies like Zomato gain prominence. Zomato’s inclusion in the Sensex comes after an impressive performance in the past year. The company’s stock has surged nearly 43% over the last six months and approximately 126% over the past year, far outpacing the Sensex’s one-year return of 10.7%. In contrast, JSW Steel has delivered around 9% returns over the same period. Brokerage firm UBS attributed Zomato’s rally of nearly 150% over the past 18 months to its ability to improve unit economics and move closer to profitability, particularly in its quick commerce (qcom) segment. Zomato reported strong financial results for the July-September quarter, with a 69% year-on-year increase in consolidated revenue from operations, reaching Rs 4,799 crore. The company also recorded a five-fold jump in net profit to Rs 176 crore. The relaunch of its subscription program, Zomato Gold, earlier this year has played a key role in driving growth. The program has helped increase ordering frequency among the company’s top customers, contributing to its robust financial performance. As of December 21, Zomato’s market capitalisation stood at Rs 2.72 lakh crore, surpassing JSW Steel’s Rs 2.24 lakh crore. According to UBS, Zomato is trading at a forecasted FY27 EV/EBITDA (adjusted) of 39 times, which translates to an FY27 EV/Sales multiple of 6.3 times. These metrics highlight investor confidence in the company’s future growth potential. The rebalancing extends beyond the Sensex to the BSE 100 index, which will see the addition of six new stocks: Jio Financial Services, Suzlon Energy, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, Samvardhana Motherson International, and PB Fintech (Policybazaar). These companies will replace Ashok Leyland, P.I.

Unlike in the US, where brokerage fees are negligible and there are no transaction taxes, Indian traders face multiple layers of charges.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/5-reasons-why-options-trading-is-a-losing-game-for-retail-traders-2653990-2024-12-23,"India’s derivatives market has been witnessing unprecedented growth, with retail participation soaring from 5.1 million in FY22 to 9.6 million in FY24. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) recorded over 8.5 billion F&O contracts worth $1.1 trillion in April 2024 alone. However, beneath this surge lies a grim reality for retail investors. Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury, Professor of Financial Analytics at Great Lakes Institute of Management, cited a recent study conducted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to highlight the fact that “for most retail traders, options trading is a losing game”. It may be noted that the Sebi study revealed the stark odds faced by retail traders, with 93% incurring net losses between FY22 and FY24, collectively losing over Rs 1.8 lakh crore ($21.6 billion) in three years. “Despite their enthusiasm and growing numbers, structural and systemic challenges in India’s options market have made consistent profitability elusive for retail participants,” Chaudhury said. In this article, Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury highlights 5 major hurdles faced by retail investors.CRUSHING WEIGHT OF TRANSACTION COSTS One of the biggest challenges retail traders face in India is the prohibitively high transaction costs. Unlike in the US, where brokerage fees are negligible and there are no transaction taxes, Indian traders face multiple layers of charges: Securities Transaction Tax (STT): Levied at 0.125% of the premium on option sales, STT disproportionately affects small-scale, high-frequency trades. Brokerage Fees: Flat rates of Rs 20 per trade may seem minor but can represent a significant cost for low-value trades. Exchange Turnover Fees and GST: NSE/BSE turnover fees and an 18% GST on brokerage fees further inflate costs. For example, a Rs 100 premium option trade in India can incur Rs 37.67 (~4%) in transaction costs, compared to less than $1 (<1%) in the U.S. for a similar trade. Over three years, retail traders in India collectively spent Rs 50,000 crore ($6 billion) on transaction costs, creating an insurmountable break-even point for many.VOLATILITY AND LIMITED GAINS The Indian market’s inherent volatility adds another layer of complexity. While the Nifty Index’s average monthly return (2022–2024) was 1.2%, its standard deviation—a measure of risk—was two to three times that. This heightened variability makes both buying and selling index options risky propositions. Furthermore, options premiums plummet sharply just a few percentage points away from the current market price, leaving retail traders with minimal room for gains. In such a volatile environment, consistent profitability requires precise timing and advanced strategies, skills that most retail traders lack.KNOWLEDGE GAP A lack of understanding of options Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) and advanced trading strategies like spreads or straddles hampers retail traders' ability to manage risk effectively. Instead of treating options trading as a strategic investment, many—particularly the younger demographic—approach it as speculation. The Sebi study found that 43% of retail traders were under 30 years old in FY24, up from 31% in FY23. Many of these young traders are swayed by ""finfluencers,"" who often oversimplify options trading to sell courses, leaving inexperienced traders with unrealistic expectations.THE INSTITUTIONAL EDGE While retail traders struggle, institutional players thrive. Leveraging algorithmic trading systems, they execute high-frequency trades with precision, exploiting inefficiencies that retail traders cannot. In FY24 alone: Proprietary traders recorded gross trading profits of Rs 33,000 crore ($3.96 billion). Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) earned Rs 28,000 crore ($3.36 billion). A staggering 96–97% of these profits were attributed to algorithmic trading, highlighting the technological gap between retail and institutional players. Retail traders, lacking access to similar tools and data, are at a significant disadvantage.DEMOGRAPHIC DISADVANTAGE The Sebi report also highlighted that 75% of retail traders in the F&O segment had annual incomes below Rs 5 lakh ($6,000). For this demographic, trading beyond their financial capacity amplifies risks. Younger, inexperienced traders are particularly vulnerable, often enduring repeated losses in the hope of eventual success. Alarmingly, over 75% of losing traders persisted in trading despite consecutive losses, underscoring a dangerous cycle of overconfidence and lack of financial literacy.WHY RETAIL TRADERS RARELY WIN For retail traders, the odds of success are stacked against them due to: High Costs: Annual transaction costs per trader average Rs 26,000 ($310), significantly eroding potential profits. Time Decay (Theta): Options lose value as expiration nears, with over 70% expiring worthless. Wide Bid-Ask Spreads: These spreads further increase implicit trading costs. High Leverage Risks: While options provide leverage, they amplify losses, particularly in volatile markets. Lack of Education and Tools: Without sophisticated tools or a solid understanding of market dynamics, retail traders are at a perpetual disadvantage.WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE? Recognising these challenges, Sebi has proposed measures to curb speculative trading and protect retail participants, including: Increasing minimum contract sizes: To deter small-capital speculative trades. Regulating weekly expiries: To reduce high-frequency trading pressure. While these steps are commendable, Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury said robust investor education initiatives must complement these. “Retail traders need access to better tools, data, and training to navigate the complexities of options trading effectively,"" he said. ""Unless structural reforms are implemented to reduce costs and level the playing field, options trading will continue to be a losing game for most retail investors in India. For now, the allure of quick riches remains a dangerous illusion for the average trader,” he added.

UltraTech Cement plans to acquire 10,13,91,231 equity shares of India Cements, each valued at Rs 10. This represents a 32.72% stake in the company, held by its promoters, members of the promoter group, and another shareholder. In addition to the stake purchase, UltraTech Cement will make an open offer to acquire up to 8,05,73,273 equity shares from public shareholders. This open offer, which represents 26% of India Cements’ equity, is priced at Rs 390 per share. The offer price is a 15% premium over India Cements’ closing price of Rs 339 on Friday. The news sparked a rally in India Cements shares, which climbed 11% to reach Rs 376.30 during Monday’s trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). UltraTech Cement also saw a modest gain of 1.14%, with its shares trading at Rs 11,555 during the day. At the time the article was being written, India Cements shares were trading at Rs 368.50, up 8.65%.  The acquisition deal was first announced on July 28, 2024, with UltraTech Cement revealing plans to invest Rs 3,950 crore to acquire a significant stake in India Cements. UltraTech Cement had previously acquired a 23% stake in India Cements at Rs 268 per share. Market experts see this acquisition as a move that could lead to better price discipline in the cement industry. Consolidation in the sector is expected to improve profitability and enhance return ratios over the long term. For UltraTech Cement, the acquisition aligns with its growth strategy. The company aims to achieve a global production capacity of 200 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by FY2027. UltraTech Cement's management reiterated its goal of double-digit volume growth for the second half of FY2025. This growth is expected to be driven by government spending on infrastructure projects, consistent demand from urban housing, and increased rural demand following good monsoons. Analysts have also highlighted UltraTech's continued focus on efficiency improvement, which supports its expansion plans. UltraTech Cement's acquisition of India Cements, along with its planned acquisition of Kesoram, is expected to be completed by the end of FY2025. Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 23, 2024

Despite his immense wealth, the French billionaire has slipped to fifth place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $176 billion after losing $32 billion year-to-date.advertisementTHE RISE AND FALL OF A LUXURY MOGULArnault first claimed the title of the world’s richest person in August 2021, fuelled by soaring luxury goods sales in Asia. Since then, his ranking has fluctuated, regaining the top spot briefly in 2022, 2023, and again in May 2024. Arnault first claimed the title of the world’s richest person in August 2021, fuelled by soaring luxury goods sales in Asia. Since then, his ranking has fluctuated, regaining the top spot briefly in 2022, 2023, and again in May 2024. However, a significant downturn followed in September 2024, when LVMH shares dropped 20%, translating to a $54 billion loss due to declining revenues. The company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, attributed the revenue slump to geopolitical tensions affecting global markets. Arnault’s fall marks a stark contrast to the tech-dominated top billionaire list. He is the sole representative of the luxury goods industry in the top five, which is otherwise populated by tech tycoons like Elon Musk ($444 billion), Jeff Bezos ($244 billion), Mark Zuckerberg ($207 billion), and Larry Ellison ($190 billion). Even in the top 10, Warren Buffett, a non-tech mogul, is the only other exception.THE LEGACY OF LVMH Despite these setbacks, LVMH remains a powerhouse in the luxury market, with around 75 iconic brands spanning wines, spirits, fashion, leather goods, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, and jewellery. Some renowned names include Christian Dior, Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Hublot, Tiffany & Co., and Sephora. Even as geopolitical tensions and market challenges persist, Arnault’s empire continues to set the standard in luxury, proving that wealth, like luxury, often comes with its own ups and downs.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Trending Reel

Popcorn gets stuck in GST mazeThe GST Council's decision to impose different tax rates on salted, pre-packaged, and caramelised popcorn has faced criticism, with economists, industry experts, and former government officials arguing that the new tax structure adds complexity for consumers.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/popcorn-gst-salted-prepackaged-caramalised-faces-crticism-experts-heres-why-2654025-2024-12-23,"Popcorn, a timeless snack enjoyed at movie nights, parties, and as a casual treat, has recently found itself at the heart of a complicated tax debate that’s stirring confusion and frustration across the country. The GST Council’s decision to impose different tax rates on salted, pre-packaged, and caramelised popcorn has faced criticism, with economists, industry experts, and former government officials arguing that the new tax structure adds complexity for consumers while failing to make a significant contribution to the government’s coffers. The tax structure is as follows: 5% GST on salted popcorn, 12% on pre-packaged and labeled popcorn, and a hefty 18% on caramelised popcorn. At first glance, the distinction between these varieties seems straightforward, but critics are questioning the logic behind it, especially when the potential revenue impact appears to be negligible. Former Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian is among those who have raised concerns about the new tax rates. Subramanian, known for his outspoken views, pointed out that the revenue generated from this differentiation would be minimal and hardly worth the hassle it could cause to ordinary citizens. In a social media post on X, Subramanian explained, “Estimated popcorn sales in 2025 (estimated from GlobalData) = Rs 1700 crore. Assuming the entire amount is taxed at 18%, GST collection from popcorn = Rs 300 crore. Total GST collection (estimated 2025) = Rs 22,00,000 crore. Max revenue contribution of popcorn decision = 300/2200000 = 0.013%!” He went on to question, “What is the rationale for a decision that can max contribute 0.013% to revenue but inconvenience citizens?” The debate over the popcorn tax has since snowballed, with some prominent voices chiming in, criticising the move as both “silly and complex.” Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai was quick to weigh in, calling the new rates “silly and complex” and warning that they could lead to what he described as “tax terrorism.” Pai raised alarm over how such policies could affect ordinary citizens and called for a simplification of the GST system. “This is silly and complex. Will lead to tax terrorism. Citizens are becoming victims of bad policy which will make them hostages to rent-seeking officials and create disputes. GST needs to be simplified, not this,” Pai said. Arvind Subramanian, another former CFO, added his voice to the chorus of critics, calling the decision a “national tragedy” and arguing that it went against the very spirit of the Goods and Services Tax, which was originally designed to simplify taxation across the country. However, the finance ministry has clarified that the GST Council’s recommendation wasn’t introducing a new tax, but rather offering clarification to resolve disputes that had arisen from the interpretation of existing tax rates. Despite the clarification, the damage had already been done. What started as a seemingly harmless tweak to the tax structure has become a focal point for critics, highlighting the complexities of India’s taxation system. Social media has exploded with memes and jokes about how popcorn—of all things—has become a symbol of the country’s complicated GST framework. But beyond the memes and the public outrage, the popcorn tax sheds light on a far bigger issue: the struggle to maintain a tax system that is both simple and effective. While policymakers are pushing for clarity, the real question remains: will popcorn be the tipping point that forces a serious overhaul of India’s convoluted tax structure?Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 23, 2024

Ujjivan SFB went public in December 2019 with a $1.36 billion valuation, but has since dropped to $0.81 billion. Operational challenges, market corrections, and sector-specific headwinds have significantly eroded these valuations. Similarly, Powergrid Infrastructure Investment Trust and Chemplast Sanmar, which debuted with $1.28 billion and $1.14 billion market caps, respectively, now hover below the billion-dollar mark. Other names in this list include Juniper Hotels, TVS Supply Chain Solutions, and TN Mercantile Bank.IPO MARKET RESILIENCE AMID SETBACKS Despite these setbacks, the Indian IPO market has continued to thrive. This year alone, companies raised a record Rs 1.8 lakh crore through 317 IPOs, surpassing the Rs 1.3 lakh crore raised in CY21. The contribution of IPOs to market capitalisation increased to 2.9% in CY24 from 1.4% in CY23, although it still lags behind the highs of CY17 (3.7%) and CY21 (3.4%). E-commerce, telecom, and retail sectors have driven recent IPO success, reflecting India’s growing digital economy and consumer base. Meanwhile, cyclical sectors like capital goods and real estate have seen fluctuating participation due to market dynamics.THE DUALITY OF SUCCESS India’s IPO market showcases both immense potential and inherent risks. While the record fundraising highlights investor confidence, the struggles of once-billion-dollar IPOs remind us that market dynamics can quickly change fortunes. Investors must tread cautiously, balancing optimism with vigilance.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Must Watch

Report reveals truthPeople don't just put in money but trust when they buy insurance policies to cover for medical emergencies or motor accidents. A report by the Insurance Brokers Association of India reveals how many such claims have been accepted or rejected by insurance companies in 2022-23.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/irdai-report-indian-best-insurance-company-india-policies-medical-vehicle-claim-rejection-rate-data-2654475-2024-12-24,"People buy general insurance to cover for emergencies so that they do not have to make out-of-pocket hefty payments. They do not just put their money in, but trust while paying premiums. However, not all claims get approved. A recent report reveals that the claim-to-settlement ratio, which shows how many claims were honoured by insurers, in 2022-23 at 86%, which is down from the 87% in FY22. The detailed report by the Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI) from data presented by insurance companies reveals that claims repudiation ratio rose to 6% for general insurance, which includes coverage for motor, health, fire and marine cargo. This is the claim rejected by an insurance company as a proportion of the total claims made by its policy buyers. Public sector insurer New India Assurance has the lowest claims repudiation ratio of 0.2%. Other big private insurers with lower rates of claims rejection are HDFC Ergo, Future Generali, Aditya Birla Health and Shriram. Insurance watchdog IRDAI makes it mandatory for insurance companies to put out settlements and rejection data on their websites. The IBAI has collated the data from insurers and put it in a report, which could help people make informed choices about a company's track record while buying insurance policies. In the Policyholder's Handbook, the IBAI has classified the general insurers into four categories -- Public Sector General Insurers, Large Private Sector General Insurers, Other Private Sector Insurers, and Standalone Health Insurers. In the health insurance category too, New India Assurance came on top among the public insurers with a claim-settlement ratio of 95%. Aditya Birla Health, with a claim settlement ratio of 95%, was the best among standalone health insurers. Iffco Tokio and Bajaj Allianz were among the top large private sector general insurers with the best claims-to-settlement ratio of 90% or more, according to the IBAI handbook. What has to be remembered in the case of health insurance is that it is combined data for group (corporate) and individual policies. Claim-rejection rates are historically lower in the case of corporate policies. ""Irdai does not give data for individual and group claims separately. Why not? Who is it protecting,"" asked author-influencer Monika Halan. The real picture will emerge when separate claim-settlement data is available for individual health insurance policies. According to experts, incomplete or false disclosure, consciously or unconsciously, at the time of purchase of policies also contribute to rejection of claims.   In settling motor vehicle own-damage claims too, New India Assurance was the best public insurer with a claim-settlement ratio of 92%. Among large private sector insurers when it came to own-damage claim settlement, Royal Sundaram, Go Digit and SBI General came on top. Future Generali was the top among small insurers. The insurance coverage, be it life or general, is low in India but the tax on insurance premiums, at 18%, is high. In India, insurance penetration is at 30%, and low in comparison to developed countries, like the US, where it is over 90%. Though there is no social security net and government medical infrastructure is rickety, the high 18% GST on insurance premiums defies logic. Many users settle for a smaller cover due to high premiums, experts have told India Today Digital. Several reform measures are needed for the growth of the insurance industry and relief for people so that they can get better cover for themselves. Not just in terms of reduction of tax, there is a need for segregated data on claim-settlement ratios for individual and group policies for people to make an informed choice.Published By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

The stock also marked a fresh 52-week high, continuing its strong post-listing performance since debuting in November this year. The rally followed a bullish note from global brokerage JP Morgan, which initiated coverage on Sagility India with an 'overweight' rating and a target price of â‚¹54. This target implies a potential upside of 16% from the previous close. JP Morgan highlighted the company's robust fundamentals, citing an 18% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in adjusted earnings over FY24-27E, driven by increasing outsourcing in the U.S. healthcare sector. The brokerage noted that Sagility India benefits from deep domain expertise and solid client relationships, which are expected to boost revenue growth. Additionally, the company's strong structural EBIT margins, supported by a higher offshore mix, make it competitive among mid-cap peers. JP Morgan also underlined Sagility’s strategic position in the under-penetrated U.S. healthcare outsourcing market, which stands at just 22% penetration. The brokerage sees Sagility growing its market share by 15%, outperforming the broader healthcare outsourcing market growth rate of 9%. It added that Sagility's focus on non-discretionary operations spending provides a stable revenue profile compared to larger IT and BPO service providers. However, the note flagged key risks, including high client concentration, potential in-sourcing by top clients, regulatory changes in the U.S. healthcare sector, and aggressive adoption of generative AI that could disrupt the market. Sagility India debuted on the stock market with an issue price of Rs 30 per share. At its current level, the stock has surged over 63% from the IPO price, underscoring strong investor interest. The IPO itself saw robust demand, being subscribed 3.2 times, with retail investors leading the charge. Earlier, Jefferies Equity Research also initiated coverage on the company, citing its strong positioning as a leading U.S.-focused business process management firm specialising in healthcare services. Since listing on November 12, Sagility India shares have risen 59%, reflecting optimism over its growth prospects. Analysts tracking the stock have a 'buy' rating, with Bloomberg data indicating an average 12-month price target suggesting a further 13.7% upside.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

Investor confidence in the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) advancements and expectations of a new iPhone upgrade cycle have fuelled a 16% surge in its stock since November, adding $500 billion to its market capitalisation. Currently valued at $3.86 trillion, Apple’s market cap surpasses the combined worth of the leading stock indices of Germany and Switzerland. The strong rally reflects the growing optimism about Apple’s evolving AI strategy and its potential to reinvigorate product demand.advertisementAPPLE'S AI PUSHIn December, Apple began incorporating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its devices, part of its broader initiative to integrate generative AI into its app ecosystem—a strategy announced earlier in June. Analysts view this move as pivotal, particularly in addressing lackluster demand for the iPhone 16 series during the holiday season. In December, Apple began incorporating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its devices, part of its broader initiative to integrate generative AI into its app ecosystem—a strategy announced earlier in June. Analysts view this move as pivotal, particularly in addressing lackluster demand for the iPhone 16 series during the holiday season. Speaking to news agency Reuters, Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, attributed the market’s enthusiasm to Apple’s AI progress and the possibility of a “supercycle” of iPhone upgrades. Similarly, Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring forecasted a recovery in iPhone sales by 2025, driven by the expanded rollout of Apple’s AI features. Woodring reiterated Apple as Morgan Stanley’s top investment pick for the year ahead. Despite these advancements, Apple’s immediate revenue growth for the fiscal first quarter is projected to remain modest. Meanwhile, its price-to-earnings ratio has reached 33.5, the highest in nearly three years, eclipsing major tech competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia. This elevated valuation has sparked concerns over inflated stock prices, prompting Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to reduce its Apple holdings. Even with potential headwinds, such as the possibility of new tariffs on Chinese imports under the incoming U.S. administration, analysts remain optimistic. Past exemptions secured by Apple during prior tariff rounds provide hope for minimal disruptions.

At 11:53 am, shares of Tata Investment were up 11.51% to Rs 7,284 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The surge followed reports that Tata Capital is gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO) worth Rs 15,000 crore. The IPO will aim to comply with regulatory norms and is expected to be one of the largest public offerings in the Indian market. Law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and investment bank Kotak Mahindra Capital have reportedly been appointed as advisors for the proposed deal. In October, the RBI approved the merger of Tata Capital with Tata Motors Finance Limited (TMFL), creating India’s 12th-largest NBFC. This no-objection approval by the central bank sets the stage for Tata Capital’s public listing. Regulatory filings suggest that Tata Capital could list by September 2024, well ahead of the 2025 deadline. Tata Investment Corporation is one of the largest shareholders of Tata Sons, the holding company for Tata Capital. TICL’s close association with Tata Sons explains the strong investor interest in its shares, given the anticipated value unlock from the Tata Capital IPO. The Tata Group’s most recent IPO, Tata Technologies, delivered a stellar performance in the secondary market. Listed on November 30, 2023, Tata Technologies’ shares debuted with a 140% premium to their issue price of Rs 500. The IPO, entirely an offer for sale (OFS), was subscribed 69.43 times, reflecting robust investor appetite for Tata Group offerings. Tata Technologies was the first IPO from the group in nearly two decades, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) being the previous IPO in 2004. The Tata Capital IPO marks another milestone for the conglomerate, highlighting its commitment to enhancing transparency and unlocking value for investors. As preparations for the Tata Capital IPO advance, market participants remain optimistic about the potential impact on Tata Group entities. The rally in TICL shares underscores growing anticipation for what could be one of India’s most significant IPOs in recent years.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

Many believe the move aims to tap into the rapidly expanding sector to boost government revenue.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/18-percent-gst-on-used-cars-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-leave-you-paying-more-amit-malviya-2654625-2024-12-24,"The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council's decision to increase the GST rate on old and used vehicles to 18% has stirred discussions across the country. The revised rate, announced at the 55th GST Council meeting, applies to all old and used vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), sold by registered businesses. However, individuals who are not registered under GST remain unaffected by this change. The decision has sparked debates as it comes at a time when India’s used car market is poised for growth. Many believe the move aims to tap into the rapidly expanding sector to boost government revenue.FINANCE MINISTER'S CLARIFICATION SPARKS CONFUSION While the increase in GST aims to streamline tax rates across different types of vehicles, earlier clarification by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the issue left buyers and sellers unsure about how the new rates would affect them. The Finance Minister said that GST is calculated on the difference between the actual price and the resale price. ""It is on that margin, the value between purchased price and resale price. Bought it for Rs 12 lakh, selling it for Rs 9 lakh in the name of a second-hand used vehicle; on the margin only this 18% has been put,"" the Finance Minister said.  However, the explanation raised questions about how the margin would be determined and whether the increase in GST would ultimately lead to losses for sellers.WHY WAS 18% GST LEVIED ON SALE OF USED CARS Explaining the decision, Amit Malviya, In-charge of the BJP’s National Information & Technology Department, clarified that the 18% GST is calculated only on the margin earned by dealers—the difference between the sale price and purchase price of the vehicle—and not on the total value of the vehicle. “If the margin is negative, no GST is payable. This approach ensures that the tax reflects the value addition by the dealer, which is considered a service under the GST framework,” Malviya said on X. He further added that taxing the dealer’s margin is not new. “This method was also in place during the UPA era as ‘Service Tax’ and continued until 2017.” Previously, old and used petrol, LPG, or CNG vehicles with an engine capacity of 1200 cc or more, as well as diesel vehicles with engines of 1500 cc or more, were already subject to 18% GST since 2018. Similarly, old and used EVs were taxed at 12%. The latest move standardises the GST rate for all old and used vehicles, including EVs, at 18%.BOOMING USED CAR MARKET The timing of this decision aligns with the rapid growth of India’s used car market. According to the Indian Blue Book 2023 report by Das Welt Auto and Car&Bike, the used car market in India was valued at USD 31.33 billion in 2022-23 and is projected to grow to USD 70.48 billion by 2027-28. The report highlights that the market’s average growth rate, which was 6% between FY2017 and FY2022, is expected to jump to 16% between FY2023 and FY2028. Comparatively, the new car market is expected to grow at a much slower pace of 1% to 6% during the same period. Factors such as a growing middle class, higher disposable incomes, and an increasing demand for personal mobility have contributed to the sector’s rapid expansion. The GST increase is expected to impact businesses involved in the sale of old and used vehicles, particularly dealers who claim depreciation on purchased vehicles. While the tax will not affect individuals buying or selling vehicles privately, businesses will need to factor the higher rate into their pricing strategies.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

An article on the 'State of the Economy' in the December bulletin noted that the global economy continues to exhibit resilience with steady growth and moderating inflation. ""High frequency indicators (HFIs) for the third quarter of 2024-25 indicate that the Indian economy is recovering from the slowdown in momentum witnessed in Q2, driven by strong festival activity and a sustained upswing in rural demand,"" it said. The article further said the growth trajectory is poised to lift in the second half of 2024-25, driven mainly by resilient domestic private consumption demand. ""Supported by record level foodgrains production, rural demand, in particular, is gaining momentum. Sustained government spending on infrastructure is expected to further stimulate economic activity and investment,"" the authors said. Global headwinds, however, pose risks to the evolving outlook for growth and inflation, said the article authored by a team led by RBI Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra. India's GDP growth slowed to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent during the July-September period of the current fiscal year. The article said that from the expenditure side, the major factor contributing to the decline in the growth rate of the economy is fixed capital formation and from the production side, the main concern is manufacturing. ""Undermining both is inflation. The erosion of purchasing power due to repeated inflation shocks and persisting price pressures is starkly reflected in weakening sales growth of listed non-financial nongovernment corporations,"" it said. Their outlook on demand conditions also remains subdued as no let-up in the incidence of price shocks seems to be in sight; they will increasingly be inclined to pass on input costs to selling prices. Consequently, there is no robust capacity creation by investing in fixed assets. Instead, corporations are churning and utilising existing capacity to meet the inflation-dented consumer demand, the article said. ""The result is lacklustre private investment. The slowdown in consumer demand seems to be associated with slower corporate wage growth,"" it said. 'The authors further said another headwind emerging is the slowing rate of nominal GDP growth, which could hinder fiscal spending, including on capex, to achieve budgetary deficit and debt targets. The article also noted that as per the projections based on the in-house Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE), real GDP growth is likely to recover to 6.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent in Q3 and Q4 of 2024-25, respectively. Growth for 2025-26 is projected at 6.7 per cent while headline CPI inflation (retail) is projected to average 3.8 per cent in 2025-26. In the December monetary policy, the RBI had projected the GDP growth for 2024-25 at 6.6 per cent with Q3 at 6.8 per cent; and Q4 at 7.2 per cent. GDP growth for the April quarter of 2025-26 was projected at 6.9 per cent; and Q2 at 7.3 per cent.

A uniform GST rate of 18 per cent now applies to such sales, replacing the previous variable rates. Importantly, no new taxes have been introduced for these transactions. GST on the sale of old and used vehicles is applicable only to people or businesses registered for GST and engaged in the purchase and resale of such vehicles. Those not registered for GST are not required to pay the tax.advertisementGST CALCULATION ON USED VEHICLE SALESThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) on old and used vehicles is calculated solely on the seller's margin, not the entire sale price. The margin is determined as the difference between the sale price and the vehicle's depreciated or purchase value, according to guidelines issued by the GST Council. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) on old and used vehicles is calculated solely on the seller's margin, not the entire sale price. The margin is determined as the difference between the sale price and the vehicle's depreciated or purchase value, according to guidelines issued by the GST Council. For sellers who have claimed depreciation under Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, GST is applied only on the margin between the sale price and the depreciated value of the vehicle. In cases where the sale price is lower than the depreciated or purchase value, creating a negative margin, no GST is applicable.EXAMPLES OF GST CALCULATION Officials have outlined clear examples to demonstrate how GST is applied under different scenarios: - Negative margin with depreciation Purchase Price: Rs 20 lakhs
Depreciated Value: Rs 12 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 10 lakhs
Margin: Negative (Rs 10 lakhs - Rs 12 lakhs = -Rs 2 lakhs)
GST Payable: None.
When the sale price is lower than the depreciated value, no GST is payable. - Negative margin without depreciation Purchase Price: Rs 12 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 10 lakhs
Margin: Negative (Rs 10 lakhs - Rs 12 lakhs = -Rs 2 lakhs)
GST Payable: None.
Even when depreciation is not claimed, GST is not applicable on a negative margin. - Positive margin Purchase Price: Rs 20 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 22 lakhs
Margin: Rs 2 lakhs (Rs 22 lakhs - Rs 20 lakhs)
GST Payable: 18 per cent of Rs 2 lakhs = Rs 36,000.
GST is applied at a standard rate of 18 per cent when the margin is positive.  KEY TAKEAWAYS A standard 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies to the sale of used vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), simplifying the taxation process for such transactions. GST is payable only by sellers registered under GST laws, such as businesses involved in the purchase and resale of vehicles. Private sales between individuals are exempt from GST, ensuring that the tax burden applies only to commercial transactions. The tax is calculated solely on the seller's margin, defined as the difference between the selling price and the vehicle’s depreciated or purchase value. If the margin is negative — meaning the sale price is lower than the vehicle’s depreciated or purchase value — no GST is payable.Published By: Vadapalli Nithin KumarPublished On: Dec 25, 2024READ |  18% GST on used cars: Do you have to pay tax on selling your car?Must Watch

Economists push for cuts to help save moreEconomists argued that reducing the tax burden would increase disposable income, enabling citizens to save more and spend on essentials. This, in turn, could help revive demand in sectors impacted by weak consumption.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/budget-2025-income-tax-relief-economists-meet-pm-modi-high-inflation-money-save-low-gdp-2655173-2024-12-25,"Economists have urged the government to reduce income tax rates and introduce reforms to support savings and economic growth in the upcoming Union Budget 2025, reported The Economic Times. These suggestions were shared during a pre-budget interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where several prominent economists and experts discussed strategies for navigating economic challenges. One of the key recommendations was to lower income tax rates. Economists argued that reducing the tax burden would increase disposable income, enabling citizens to save more and spend on essentials. This, in turn, could help revive demand in sectors impacted by weak consumption. Suggestions also included rationalising customs tariffs and providing targeted benefits to vulnerable groups. Lower tax rates for lower-income groups, they noted, would directly impact household budgets, improve financial stability, and potentially lift overall consumption levels.ECONOMIC URGE TAX RELIEF WITH PM MODI During the meeting, the Prime Minister reportedly highlighted employment generation as a central focus for government policy. Economists emphasised the importance of improving data quality for better policy decisions and suggested targeted interventions to address weak consumption, inflation, and global uncertainties. The Prime Minister reiterated the government’s vision of a “Viksit Bharat” or a developed India by 2047. He stressed the need for transformative thinking to keep India on a sustainable growth path, particularly during periods of global economic volatility.WEAK CONSUMPTION AND INFLATION Economists said that India’s domestic consumption has struggled to match growth expectations. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.4% in the July-September quarter, its slowest pace in two years, falling short of the central bank’s 7% target for the period. Rising inflation remains a key concern. Inflation in November was above the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) medium-term target of 4%, putting pressure on household budgets. High prices have reduced disposable income and limited discretionary spending, which economists fear could lead to a demand slowdown. To manage inflation while sustaining growth, economists recommended measures such as direct benefit transfers, public expenditure in rural areas, and incentives for job creation outside the agricultural sector.INCOME TAX REFORMS IN THE PAST The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced significant changes to the income tax regime, offering relief to many taxpayers: Income tax slabs were relaxed for earnings up to Rs 10 lakh. The standard deduction for salaried and pensioners was increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Family pensioners saw their standard deduction rise from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. The employer’s NPS contribution deduction for private-sector employees was increased from 10% to 14%. Industry representatives, including major groups like CII, FICCI, and PHDCCI, have presented several recommendations for the upcoming Budget 2025. They called for comprehensive tax reforms, including the simplification of capital gains tax and streamlined compliance procedures. A reduction in TDS provisions and the establishment of a dedicated dispute resolution mechanism were also proposed. For GST, suggestions included the introduction of a simplified three-rate GST structure, referred to as GST 2.0, and the inclusion of all expenses in the input tax credit chain. Additionally, industry bodies urged for adjustments in direct taxes, such as reduced tax rates for partnership firms and LLPs, the removal of the dividend distribution tax, and relief for share buybacks by treating them as capital gains while allowing deductions for the cost of shares. Customs-related proposals included introducing a single certificate of origin for multiple bills of entry, simplifying the appeal process, and imposing zero customs duty on critical raw materials. These recommendations aim to simplify tax processes, reduce compliance burdens, and boost the ease of doing business in India.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Must Watch

This is against the global trend. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) report shows growth in premium collection in 2023-24. Insurance companies rejected 11% of all claims in FY24.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/insurance-policy-penetration-india-dipped-premium-collection-grew-irdai-report-claim-settlement-ratio-gst-rate-cut-2655158-2024-12-25,"The latest report by India's insurance industry watchdog has revealed that insurance penetration in the country, which was already low, has dipped further to 2.8% in the last financial year. This is in sharp contrast with the global trend. However, there was a 6% increase in premium collection by life insurance companies despite a dip in penetration. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) released its annual report this week which showed that India's insurance penetration dipped to 3.7% in 2023-24 as compared to 4% in 2022-23. ""The insurance penetration for the life insurance industry marginally declined from 3% in the previous year to 2.8% during 2023-24,"" the IRDAI report said. In the non-life or general insurance industry, the penetration remained at 1%, according to the report. Insurance penetration, a measure of the total amount of premiums paid in a year by the gross domestic product (GDP), shows the popularity of insurance products and the extent to which people are covered.   This dip is worrying as India is a country with already low insurance penetration when compared to developed countries or the global average. This is, in fact, the second successive year of dip in insurance penetration in India. Insurance penetration touched a high of 4.2% in 2021-22 on the back of the Covid pandemic. Globally, insurance penetration has gone up from 6.8% in 2022 to 7% in 2023.INSURANCE COMPANIES SETTLED 83% OF CLAIMS IN 2023-24 What has been the performance of Indian insurers in settling claims in FY24? Going by the IRDAI report, insurers settled about 83% of the total number of claims and rejected about 11% of them. The remaining about 6% were pending for settlement as on March 31, 2024. ""The life insurance industry paid total benefits of Rs 5.77 lakh crore in 2023-24, which constitutes 70.22% of the net premium,"" it said. General and health insurers settled 2.69 crore health insurance claims and paid Rs 83,493 crore towards settlement of health insurance claims. The average amount paid per claim was Rs 31,086.GROWTH IN PREMIUM COLLECTION FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES Though insurance penetration dipped in India, insurance density (per capita premium) grew to $95 in 2023-24 from $92 in 2022-23, according to the IRDAI report.  For the world, it stood at $889. The non-life insurance density increased from $22 to $25, while life insurance density remained stable at
$70, according to the IRDAI report. Despite the negative growth in penetration in India, insurance premium collection saw growth in 2023-24. ""The life insurance market in India has recorded consistent premium growth over the years. During 2023-24, the life insurance industry recorded a premium income of Rs 8.30 lakh crore, registering 6.06% growth,"" said the IRDAI report. Going by the trend, IRDAI expects health insurance premiums to grow by 3% in real terms in 2024.  ""With wages and healthcare expenses exceeding CPI
inflation, health insurance pricing is likely to remain elevated,"" the insurance regulator says.  Private-sector players clocked a growth of 15% in premiums in 2023-24 while public sector life insurers saw a growth of 0.23%.CUT GST RATE TO IMPROVE INSURANCE PENETRATION: PANEL The low penetration and a high 18% GST on insurance premiums has been a worry. A Standing Committee on Finance, headed by Jayant Sinha, recommended that the GST rate on insurance products, especially term and health, should be reduced. The high rate of GST results in a high premium burden, which acts as a deterrent to getting insurance policies, it said in its report, submitted in February. The committee noted there was a need to create mass awareness about the need and benefits of having insurance protection and diverse insurance products. However, in its December meeting, the GST Council postponed any call on reducing tax rates for life and health insurance premiums. There is no two ways about the fact that India needs to better its insurance penetration, which is low and dipping. For this, there needs to be a reduction in taxes and premium rates, and information about insurance products spread among the population.Published By: Yudhajit Published On: Dec 25, 2024Must Watch

The Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI) report also predicts that health insurance premiums are ""likely to remain elevated"" this year.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/health-insurance-claims-rejected-pending-irdai-report-premiums-to-remain-high-india-insurers-2655186-2024-12-26,"Insurance companies in India rejected 11% of all health insurance claims in 2023-24 with another 6% of claims still pending as of March 2024, according to the latest report of India's insurance regulator. The Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI) report also predicts that health insurance premiums are ""likely to remain elevated"" this year. The IRDAI report released this week gives a broader picture of the entire insurance industry, life and general.  The insurance penetration in India dipped in 2023-24 for a second consecutive year to 3.7%. It was 4% in the year-ago period, and at an all-time high of 4.2% in 2021-22 on the back of the Covid pandemic. The dip was contrary to the global trend. In non-life or general insurance, health insurance contributes close to half of global nonlife insurance premiums, according to the report.  Going by the trend, IRDAI expects health insurance premiums to grow by 3% in real terms in 2024.  ""With wages and healthcare expenses exceeding CPI inflation, health insurance pricing is likely to remain elevated,"" the insurance regulator says. Premium prices are important as just 10% of the total health insurance policies have been taken out by individuals. What was the claim-settlement ratio of insurance companies? This is important as it reveals the proportion of claims they have honoured against the total claims made. ""During 2023-24, insurers have settled about 83% of the total number of claims registered in their books,"" says IRDAI. The companies rejected 11% of the total claims while about 6% were pending for settlement as on March 31, 2024. It is important to note that the rejection and settlement data is combined for groups and individuals. This doesn't provide a clear picture as cases of rejection of group insurance, generally taken out by corporates, are close to zero. According to experts, incomplete or false disclosure, consciously or unconsciously, at the time of purchase of policies also contribute to rejection of claims. The average amount paid per claim was a little over Rs 31,000 in 2023-24. In the last financial year, the insurers settled 2.69 crore health insurance claims and paid a total of Rs 83,493 crore.  In terms of number of health insurance claims settled, a lion's share of 72% was through Third Party Agencies (TPAs).  In non-life insurance, earnings from the health insurance business was the largest segment with a contribution of 40.29% of the total premium. It has increased from 38.02% in 2022-23.  In 2023-24, insurance companies saw a growth of 20.32% in health insurance premium collection from the last fiscal, according to the report. The health insurance business is classified into three classes -- government sponsored, group and individual.  Of the total lives covered, about 45% each are in government-sponsored schemes and group policies, while just 10% are health insurance cover taken out by individuals. The insurance coverage, be it life or general, is low in India but the tax on insurance premiums, at 18%, is high. While insurance penetration dipped in India, globally, it went up from 6.8% in 2022 to 7% in 2023. Though there is no social security net and government medical infrastructure is rickety, the high 18% GST on insurance premiums defies logic. Many users settle for a smaller cover due to high premiums, experts have told India Today Digital. To get more Indians covered under health insurance so that they don't need to make hefty out-of-pocket payments, tax rates need to be reduced and premiums made affordable.Published By: Yudhajit Published On: Dec 26, 2024

This landmark initiative, utilising drone technology for surveying and demarcating properties in rural areas, aims to unlock the economic potential of villages and improve financial inclusion.advertisementTRANSFORMING RURAL ECONOMIES WITH PROPERTY CARDSLaunched in 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) scheme addresses the long-standing issue of unmapped rural properties in several states. The lack of clear land ownership records had previously denied rural residents access to institutional credit. Launched in 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) scheme addresses the long-standing issue of unmapped rural properties in several states. The lack of clear land ownership records had previously denied rural residents access to institutional credit. By issuing legally-backed property cards, the scheme enables property owners to secure loans, spurring economic activity in rural areas. So far, 317,000 villages—92% of the targeted 344,000—have been surveyed, with 136,000 villages already receiving property cards. On December 27, PM Modi is set to distribute five million additional property cards across India.BENEFITS AMID CHALLENGES Beyond financial inclusion, the SVAMITVA scheme has resolved disputes, empowered women through joint property ownership, and helped gram panchayats tackle encroachments. However, challenges persist, particularly in tribal areas where communal land ownership and family disputes complicate title claims. The parliamentary standing committee on Panchayati Raj has urged the government to address these issues within the legal framework. States like Jharkhand have resisted implementation, while Tamil Nadu, Bihar, and Odisha, having updated rural land records, opted out of the scheme. Despite hurdles, the ministry aims to complete the project by FY 2026.PAVING THE WAY FOR RURAL PROSPERITY By granting clear ownership of residential properties, the SVAMITVA scheme lays the foundation for rural economic growth.

The stock rose 4.72% to an intraday high of Rs 4848.40, compared to its previous close of Rs 4629.50. However, Mazagon Dock shares pared some gains to trade just 1.5% higher at Rs 4,698.85 on the BSE at 12:49 pm.

Speaking on Lenny’s Podcast, Benioff revealed how Jobs’ enigmatic guidance during a creative slump in his entrepreneurial journey led to the creation of Salesforce’s groundbreaking AppExchange.JOBS’ TRANSFORMATIVE CHALLENGE During their conversation, Jobs gave Benioff three directives that were as ambitious as they were cryptic. The first was a bold challenge: “Your company, it better get 10 times larger in 24 months, or it’s over.” He also advised securing a key client, like Avon, and concluded with a cryptic suggestion: “You better go build an application economy.” Perplexed by the last directive, Benioff sought clarification, but Jobs replied with characteristic mystique, “I don’t know, but you’re going to go figure it out.” For Benioff, the exchange felt like a Zen koan—a riddle meant to inspire deeper insight. Determined to unravel the puzzle, Benioff revisited his notes repeatedly until he identified the solution: creating an app store for business applications. This vision materialised in 2006 with the launch of Salesforce’s AppExchange, a platform that transformed the company’s ecosystem and enabled third-party developers to offer apps and services to Salesforce customers. Two years later, in 2008, Apple debuted its App Store, forever changing the mobile technology landscape and validating Jobs’ prescience. As a gesture of gratitude, Benioff gifted Apple the App Store trademark and the appstore.com domain, acknowledging Jobs' role in sparking his breakthrough.A LEGACY OF VISION AND MENTORSHIP Reflecting on his relationship with Jobs, Benioff expressed deep appreciation, stating, “I’m very grateful to have had that relationship. It dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.” This remarkable mentorship moment highlights the profound impact of visionary advice and reinforces the value of bold thinking in shaping the future of technology and innovation.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024

Activating your UAN is essential to access the EPFO’s wide range of online services. The UAN is a unique 12-digit number assigned to employees by EPFO, offering a convenient way to manage Provident Fund (PF) accounts. Once activated, employees can view and download their PF passbooks, file claims for withdrawals, advances, or transfers, and update personal information—all from the comfort of their homes. This eliminates the need for in-person visits to EPFO offices. To activate the UAN, employees need to follow these steps: Visit the EPFO Member Portal. Click on ‘Activate UAN’ under the ‘Important Links’ section. Provide the UAN, Aadhaar number, full name, date of birth, and Aadhaar-linked mobile number. Consent to Aadhaar OTP verification. Enter the OTP sent to the registered mobile number. Upon successful activation, a password will be sent to the registered mobile number, completing the process.ELI SCHEME: A BOOST FOR EMPLOYMENT AND JOB CREATION The ELI scheme, part of the Union Budget 2024-25, aims to stimulate job growth and incentivise both employers and employees.

The three components of the scheme include: Scheme A: Offers a one-month wage (up to Rs 15,000) for first-time employees. Scheme B: Incentivises job creation in the manufacturing sector with EPFO contribution benefits. Scheme C: Reimburses employers for their EPFO contributions for new hires.

The move, likely to be announced in the upcoming Budget 2025 on February 1, aims to boost consumption and address concerns over rising living costs amid a slowing economy, according to government sources cited in a Reuters report. If implemented, the measure could benefit millions, particularly urban taxpayers grappling with high expenses. Under the current regime introduced in 2020, incomes ranging from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 10.5 lakh are taxed at rates between 5% and 20%. In contrast, incomes exceeding Rs 10.5 lakh face a 30% tax rate. As of now, taxpayers can choose between two systems: the traditional structure, which provides exemptions for expenses like housing rentals and insurance, or the newer regime, which offers lower tax rates but eliminates most exemptions. The proposed cut is expected to encourage more individuals to adopt the simplified 2020 regime. Although the government has not finalised the size of any reductions, sources noted that the decision would likely be made closer to the budget date. The finance ministry has yet to comment on the proposal or its potential impact on revenue. One source suggested that reducing tax rates could offset revenue losses by increasing adoption of the streamlined tax system. The proposal comes as India navigates economic challenges, with GDP growth slowing to its weakest pace in seven quarters between July and September 2024. Rising food inflation is eroding household budgets, particularly in urban areas, and dampening demand for goods like vehicles, household items, and personal care products. The political implications of high taxes on the middle class, coupled with wage growth failing to keep up with inflation, have further intensified pressure on the government.

What it means for youThe Supreme Court has ruled that banks charging high credit card interest rates is lawful, placing responsibility on consumers to manage dues efficiently.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/banks-can-charge-over-30-percent-interest-on-credit-card-dues-says-supreme-court-what-it-means-for-you-2655722-2024-12-26,"The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of banks charging interest rates over 30% on credit card dues, overturning a 2008 decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This landmark judgment clarifies that such charges are not unfair trade practices but rather fall within the ambit of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) regulatory framework. The Supreme Court has ruled that banks can charge over 30% interest on credit card dues, overturning a 2008 decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) that had called such high rates unfair.advertisementWHY THE SUPREME COURT OVERRULED NCDRC’S VERDICTA bench of Justices Bela M. Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma observed that the NCDRC's earlier ruling, which deemed high credit card interest rates exploitative, lacked legal backing. The court stated that the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, grants banks the autonomy to set interest rates in line with RBI directives. A bench of Justices Bela M. Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma observed that the NCDRC's earlier ruling, which deemed high credit card interest rates exploitative, lacked legal backing. The court stated that the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, grants banks the autonomy to set interest rates in line with RBI directives. The bench further noted that credit card holders are well-informed about interest rates and penalties during the application process. Therefore, the terms of the agreement, mutually accepted by both parties, cannot be deemed unconscionable or unfair. Importantly, the court held that NCDRC had no jurisdiction to rewrite the terms of such contracts.HOW THIS DECISION IMPACTS CREDIT CARD USERS Transparency in credit card terms
Banks are obligated to disclose all terms, including interest rates, to credit card applicants. Customers are made aware of penalties for delayed payments and high-interest charges on unpaid dues. No relief for defaulting borrowers
Cardholders struggling with overdue payments may feel the pinch, as the ruling empowers banks to levy steep interest rates—sometimes exceeding 36%. This underscores the importance of timely payments to avoid financial strain. RBI's role remains intact
The court clarified that the RBI is the sole authority to regulate bank interest rates. There’s no evidence that banks violated RBI’s policies, reaffirming the central bank’s oversight.WHAT’S NEXT FOR CREDIT CARD USERS? While the judgment secures banks’ autonomy, it serves as a wake-up call for consumers to better manage their credit card spending. Avoiding interest accumulation and paying dues on time can mitigate the impact of high rates. This ruling highlights the balance between financial institution autonomy and consumer awareness. While banks gain legal backing for high interest rates, the onus lies on customers to remain financially disciplined and make informed decisions.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

This change, decided by the GST Council under Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, applies to old and used vehicles, including electric cars (EVs). Here's everything you need to know about this significant development.advertisementFAQS ON GST FOR USED CARSDo I have to pay GST when selling my used car to an individual?
No, GST is not applicable if you sell your car directly to another individual. Do I have to pay GST when selling my used car to an individual?
No, GST is not applicable if you sell your car directly to another individual. Will the GST hike increase used car prices?
If you purchase a car from an individual, the GST hike won’t affect the price. However, buying from dealers or platforms like OLX or CarDekho may lead to higher prices, as GST applies to the dealer’s margin. What is the GST on used EVs?
A standard 18% GST now applies to all used vehicles, including EVs and SUVs. How is GST calculated on used cars?
GST applies only to the margin—the difference between the selling price and depreciated value. For instance, if a car is bought for Rs 10 lakh and sold for Rs 15 lakh with a depreciated value of Rs 12 lakh, GST will be charged on the Rs 3 lakh margin. Who is most affected by this GST hike?
Dealers and platforms selling used cars are most impacted, as the higher tax reduces margins. Some businesses may absorb the cost, while others might pass it on to buyers.IMPACT OF THE GST HIKE For buyers: If you’re buying from an individual, prices remain unaffected. Purchases from dealers may cost more. For sellers: Individuals selling directly face no impact. For dealers: The hike increases costs, with startups and dealers in the used car market feeling the pinch. The GST rate hike on used cars aims to streamline tax slabs but brings mixed implications. While it may raise costs for businesses and buyers using platforms, it could reduce second-hand EV costs in some cases, providing a potential upside for green mobility enthusiasts.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

In an interview with news agency ANI, Adani shared his insight on the work-life balance and said, ""If you like what you do, you will have work-life balance."" However, he also emphasised that one must not impose their idea of work-life balance onto others.  ""Your work-life balance should not be imposed on me, and my work-life balance shouldn't be imposed on you. However, one must ensure they spend at least four hours with their families,"" the Adani Group Chairperson said. 
 
 On a lighter note, the industrialist said, ""For instance, if someone spends eight hours with family, their wife may run away,"" to which people around could be heard laughing.  ""The thing is, you should see how much time can you take out for family and if you are happy, and your family is happy with it, it should be fine,"" Adani concluded. The industrialist's remarks come at a time when the issue of extended work hours is a raging debate in India and there is chatter about work-life balance. Last year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy had sparked a big debate after he suggested that Indians should work 70 hours a week to help the nation progress. In November this year, he reiterated his remarks and said he didn't agree with the idea of ""work-life balance"". Narayana Murthy expressed disappointment over India’s transition from a six-day to a five-day work week in 1986. “I am sorry, I have not changed my view. I will take this with me to my grave,” he said. The thought was echoed by Daksh Gupta, an Indian-origin CEO who runs the artificial intelligence startup Greptile in San Francisco. He said that his company operates on an 84-hour workweek with “no work-life balance.”Published By: Poorva JoshiPublished On: Dec 26, 2024

These words resonate deeply today as the nation mourns the loss of its former Prime Minister and Finance Minister, who died at the age of 92 in New Delhi.  The former PM widely regarded as the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, played a pivotal role in transforming the country’s economy during a time of severe crisis. His tenure as Finance Minister in the early 1990s and later as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014 introduced policies that continue to influence India’s growth. Known for his humility and academic brilliance, Singh’s economic reforms and social welfare programmes remain his enduring legacy.INDIA’S 1991 ECONOMIC CRISIS

 



Manmohan Sigh was elected as Finance Minister in 1991.
 When Singh was appointed Finance Minister in 1991 by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, India was on the brink of an economic collapse. The foreign exchange reserves had dwindled to levels that could barely cover a few weeks of essential imports like oil and fertilisers. Inflation was rising, the fiscal deficit was widening, and India faced a balance of payments crisis. Adding to the challenge, the Soviet Union, a key trading partner, had collapsed, cutting off a major source of cheap oil and raw materials. The situation demanded urgent and bold action. Singh, with his deep understanding of economics, introduced a series of sweeping reforms to stabilise the economy and pave the way for long-term growth.THE 1991 ECONOMIC REFORMS Manmohan Singh’s reforms were centred around liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation, which fundamentally changed the Indian economy. Some of the key reforms were: Devaluation of the Rupee and trade liberalisation - In July 1991, the Reserve Bank of India pledged 46.91 tonnes of gold with the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan to raise $400 million, stabilising the immediate crisis. Singh then devalued the rupee to make Indian exports more competitive in global markets. He also reduced import tariffs and dismantled restrictions on foreign trade, allowing India to integrate with the global economy. Industrial policy reforms: Abolishing the Licence Raj - On July 24, 1991, Singh presented a new industrial policy that ended the ‘Licence Raj.’ Previously, industries required government approval for most operations, including expansion and production. The new policy deregulated nearly 80% of the industrial sector, reducing the number of industries reserved exclusively for the public sector from 17 to 8. This move encouraged private enterprises and foreign investment, fostering industrial growth and job creation. Banking and financial sector reforms - The financial sector underwent significant changes under his leadership. Following the Narasimham Committee’s recommendations, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) was reduced from 38.5% to 25%, and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was lowered from 25% to 10% over a few years. These measures allowed banks to lend more freely, supporting economic expansion. Licensing requirements for bank branches were eased, and interest rates were deregulated, creating a more competitive and efficient banking system. His reforms not only saved India from the brink of collapse but also laid the foundation for sustained economic growth. The policies attracted foreign investments, boosted exports, and created new industries. Millions of Indians were lifted out of poverty as job opportunities expanded. By dismantling socialist controls, India transitioned into a market-driven economy, setting the stage for its rise as one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.LEGACY AS PRIME MINISTER

 Singh’s contributions went beyond his tenure as Finance Minister. As Prime Minister, he championed initiatives that targeted India’s rural and underprivileged population, recognising that economic growth alone could not bridge the gap between urban and rural India. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) - Launched in 2005, this programme guaranteed 100 days of wage employment annually to rural households. It addressed poverty, underemployment, and rural distress, becoming a cornerstone of his government. Right to Information (RTI) and Right to Education (RTE) - Singh’s government introduced the RTI Act, empowering citizens with access to government information. The RTE Act aimed to provide free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14, ensuring education as a fundamental right. Manmohan Singh was not only a politician but also a distinguished economist. He held roles at the Reserve Bank of India, Planning Commission, and International Monetary Fund (IMF) before entering politics. His expertise earned him respect globally, with many recognising his efforts to integrate India into the global economy. His economic liberalisation policies transformed India into one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. He dismantled socialist regulations, attracting foreign investment and creating jobs. His legacy includes a modernised industrial sector, a strengthened banking system, and policies that uplifted millions from poverty. As India mourns his loss, history indeed remembers Dr Manmohan Singh kindly—as the architect of modern India’s economic journey and a leader whose policies continue to shape the nation’s future.

The listing comes after the company’s initial public offering (IPO) witnessed robust demand, with subscriptions exceeding 36 times the total shares on offer. The IPO, open between December 19 and December 24, aimed to raise Rs 550 crore, comprising a Rs 400 crore fresh issue and a Rs 150 crore Offer for Sale (OFS). The proceeds will be used to repay debts (Rs 160 crore), fund investments in its subsidiary, Sanathan Polycot Pvt. Ltd. (Rs 140 crore), and for general corporate purposes (Rs 100 crore). Investor interest was led by institutional buyers, with their portion subscribed 75.62 times, while non-institutional and retail investors subscribed 42.18 times and 8.84 times, respectively. The IPO drew bids worth over Rs 14,000 crore, a testament to the market’s enthusiasm. Sanathan Textiles operates in three verticals: polyester yarn products, cotton yarn products, and technical and industrial textile yarns. It caters to a diverse customer base, including multinational and local companies. The polyester yarn segment is its largest contributor, accounting for 76.8% of revenue in the first quarter of FY25. Financially, the company has faced a slight decline in performance. In FY24, Sanathan Textiles reported revenue of Rs 2,957 crore, down from Rs 3,329 crore in FY23. Its profit after tax (PAT) also dropped to Rs 134 crore from Rs 152.7 crore. Margins have narrowed slightly, with an EBITDA margin of 7.6% in FY24 compared to 7.8% in FY23. SHOULD YOU HOLD OR SELL? Analysts remain cautious despite the strong listing. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, noted the company's shrinking margins and declining profitability as concerns. While the IPO was reasonably priced, Nyati suggests investors consider booking profits given the attractive 31% listing gains. “Company made a quiet stock market debut, listing at a significant 31% premium over its issue price of Rs. 321. Those who took part in the initial public offering (IPO) may take listing gains profit,” Nyati said. With a focus on reducing debt and expanding its business verticals, Sanathan Textiles aims for steady growth. However, investors must weigh the company’s fundamentals against broader market conditions before deciding to hold or sell.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

The sharp drop surprised many investors, but the apparent plunge was due to the stock split, which adjusted the face value from Rs 10 to Rs 5 per share. Certain trading apps may be displaying the unadjusted previous closing price, leading to the perception of a 50% fall. Adjusted for the split, Mazagon Dock shares were trading 2.13% lower on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at 11:09 am. In the previous session, the stock registered gains as more people bought it before the stock split adjustment.  The stock split aligns with the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) guidelines on capital restructuring. According to the company, the move aims to enhance liquidity and encourage broader participation from retail investors. Mazagon Dock is a leading shipbuilder in India and specialises in constructing advanced vessels for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard. Since its inception, it has built 802 vessels, including warships, submarines, and commercial ships. It is on track to complete significant projects by December 2024, such as the 6th Scorpene submarine, the final 15B destroyer, and the first 17A frigate. The company also competes for additional defense projects, including three Scorpene submarines under Project 75I, in partnership with a German designer. It has outlined plans to double its capacity by acquiring 55 acres of land near its existing facilities, with a capex of Rs 5,000 crore spread over the next five years. Mazagon Dock maintains strong financial health, with Rs 4,000 crore in reserves earmarked for capacity expansion. The company has reduced dividend payouts to prioritize growth. Arihant Capital Markets highlighted that Mazagon Dock's profit margins are benefiting from cost efficiencies and timely project completions. Margins are expected to normalize between 12% and 15% in the long term. Despite minor delays, Mazagon Dock remains optimistic about its schedule, with its strategic expansion plans solidifying its position in the defense shipbuilding industry.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

The company announced that he succumbed to lymphoma on December 25. Born Osamu Matsuda on January 30, 1930, in Gero, Japan, Suzuki joined the automaker in 1958 after marrying into the founding family. Taking on his wife’s surname, he began a transformative journey that would see Suzuki Motor become a household name in small cars and motorcycles worldwide. Suzuki’s leadership, which spanned decades, included two terms as president, making him the longest-serving head of a global automaker. Under his guidance, Suzuki Motor formed strategic alliances with General Motors and Volkswagen, leveraging partnerships to expand its footprint across North America and Europe. His boldest move, however, was entering the Indian market in the 1980s. In 1982, Suzuki forged a joint venture with the Indian government, leading to the creation of Maruti Udyog. The partnership introduced the Maruti 800, a small car that became an instant hit and cemented Suzuki’s dominance in the Indian market. Today, Maruti Suzuki remains the largest carmaker in India, contributing significantly to the company’s global sales. Suzuki’s tenure was not without challenges. He faced a fuel-economy testing scandal in Japan, which led to his resignation as CEO in 2016. Yet, his commitment to the company’s resilience and growth remained unwavering. Even in his later years, Suzuki played an advisory role, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and market leadership in the automotive world. His contributions to the industry and his leadership in expanding Suzuki Motor’s global presence remain unparalleled.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

I suggest to this August House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea. Let the whole world hear it loud and clear,” said Dr Manmohan Singh during his first budget speech on July 24, 1991, as India embarked on its journey of economic liberalisation. And rightly so, since India has not looked back and scaled new heights to emerge as an economic powerhouse and ranks fifth globally in GDP for 2024.  The foundation for this growth was laid by Former Finance and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, known as the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, who died in Delhi at the age of 92, leaving behind a lasting legacy. His policies, introduced during a time of economic crisis in the early 1990s, reshaped India’s economy and transformed the Indian stock markets. Singh’s policies came at a time of deep financial distress for India, with foreign reserves nearly depleted and the country on the brink of economic collapse. The reforms he introduced were historic, dismantling decades of restrictive controls and opening the economy to global markets.TRANSFORMATIVE ECONOMIC REFORMS Manmohan Singh’s tenure as Finance Minister saw the implementation of bold measures that liberalised India’s economy. The most notable among them were the abolition of the Licence Raj, opening the economy to foreign investment, reducing import tariffs, and introducing fiscal discipline. ""Singh also led various institutional reforms, including the formation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) as the regulatory authority, which marked a critical step in ensuring transparency and accountability in the stock market,"" said Palka Arora Chopra. Director, Master Capital Services.  The reforms introduced back then laid the groundwork for the India we know today. They transformed India’s economic structure, making it more competitive and globally integrated. This also created a strong foundation for the Indian stock market to flourish.A REMARKABLE RISE IN THE STOCK MARKET The liberalisation measures had a direct and long-lasting impact on the Indian stock market. In 1991, the Sensex was trading at around 1,000 points. Today, it has surged past the 78,000 mark, delivering exponential returns to investors over three decades. ""As the nation pays homage to Manmohan Singh, the architect of liberalisation in India, investors must be acknowledging with gratitude the wealth created by the Indian stock market after the initiation of liberalisation in 1991. Sensex which was around 1000 in 1991 has multiplied about 780 times since then to trade above 78000 now delivering excellent returns to long-term investors. The market will continue to deliver superior returns to investors in the years to come since the India Growth Story, which liberalisation triggered, is very much intact,"" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.  ""Singh also took steps to strengthen Sebi in 1992, enhancing transparency and regulatory oversight, which in turn helped build trust among investors. By opening the market to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), he not only attracted essential capital but also positioned India as a key investment destination, laying the groundwork for sustained market growth,"" said Trivesh, COO Tradejini. ECONOMIC BOOM DURING HIS PRIME MINISTERIAL TENURE Manmohan Singh’s contributions were not limited to his tenure as Finance Minister. As Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014, he oversaw a period of robust economic growth, with GDP growing at an average of 6.9% annually. His government’s focus on infrastructure development, increased foreign investment, and policy stability further boosted investor confidence. ""India’s GDP growth averaged around 6.9% during Singh’s first term as India’s Prime Minister, underpinned by a boom in major sectors and increased infrastructure spending. The stock market soared as businesses expanded and foreign investors began to view India as an attractive destination. The period witnessed one of the strongest bull runs in Indian stock market history, driven by a combination of economic growth, structural reforms and rapid expansion,"" said Chopra.  The boom during this period saw increased participation from foreign institutional investors, significant growth in key sectors like IT, banking, and manufacturing, and the emergence of Indian companies as global players. ""Manmohan Singh's contribution to the Indian economy, particularly in terms of GDP growth, has been extraordinary. His financial expertise in particular was crucial in devaluing the Indian rupee, which helped stabilise our economy. To us, he will always be a leader whose policies prioritise social equity and inclusive development,"" said VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today Explained.  As the nation mourns the loss of one of its greatest economic architects, his words, “India is now wide awake. We shall prevail. We shall overcome,” continues to resonate.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/15-income-tax-changes-in-2024-what-you-need-to-know-for-filing-itr-in-2025-income-tax-rules-stmp-2656139-2024-12-27,"The year 2024 brought significant changes to income tax laws, altering how taxpayers will approach filing their Income Tax Returns (ITRs) in 2025. With the backdrop of general elections earlier in the year, the government introduced sweeping changes to income tax laws, many of which are already in effect for FY 2024-25. These reforms—ranging from revamped tax slabs to new rules for capital gains and TDS—promise to impact how you plan, save, and file your Income Tax Return (ITR) in 2025. Confused about how these changes affect you? Here’s a concise breakdown of the 10 most significant updates and their implications on your finances. Get ready to plan smarter and save better!REVISED INCOME TAX SLABS UNDER THE NEW REGIME The new tax regime has introduced revised income tax slabs designed to benefit individual taxpayers. Under the updated structure, income up to Rs 3,00,000 is exempt from tax, while earnings between Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000 are taxed at 5%. Income from Rs 7,00,001 to Rs 10,00,000 is taxed at 10%, and the next bracket, Rs 10,00,001 to Rs 12,00,000, is taxed at 15%. For earnings between Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000, the tax rate is 20%, and any income above Rs 15,00,000 is taxed at 30%. These changes offer taxpayers opting for the new regime the opportunity to save up to Rs 17,500 annually.INCREASED STANDARD DEDUCTION LIMIT For those under the new tax regime, the standard deduction limit has risen to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000. Family pensioners, too, see a hike to Rs 25,000 from Rs 15,000. The old tax regime retains the existing Rs 50,000 limit for salaried individuals and Rs 15,000 for family pensioners. This increase in deductions under the new regime effectively lowers taxable income, enhancing its appeal to a broader range of taxpayers.ENHANCED NPS DEDUCTION FOR EMPLOYERS’ CONTRIBUTION Under the new tax regime, individuals can now claim deductions of up to 14% of their basic salary for employer contributions to the National Pension System (NPS), up from 10%. However, contributions exceeding Rs 7.5 lakh across EPF, NPS, and superannuation funds remain taxable, ensuring balanced benefits within specified limits.SIMPLIFIED CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION Capital gains taxation has been simplified under the new framework. Short-term capital gains (STCG) on equity and equity-oriented funds are now taxed at 20%, up from 15%, while long-term capital gains (LTCG) on all assets are uniformly taxed at 12.5%. Equity and equity-oriented funds continue to enjoy an annual exemption of up to Rs 1.25 lakh. However, these changes simplify tax calculations but limit indexation benefits for certain assets.RATIONALISED TDS RATES To reduce complexity, TDS (tax deducted at source) rates have been rationalised for various payments, such as insurance commissions (2%), rent (2%), and e-commerce payments (0.1%). This rationalisation reduces upfront tax deductions, allowing taxpayers to retain more money initially.CLAIMING TDS AND TCS CREDIT AGAINST SALARY Salaried individuals can now adjust TDS or TCS (tax collected at source) deductions from other sources of income against TDS on their salary, easing cash flow concerns and ensuring higher monthly take-home pay.CHANGES IN TDS ON PROPERTY SALES For property sales exceeding Rs 50 lakh, TDS is now applicable on the entire sale value, irrespective of individual sellers’ shares, enhancing compliance and preventing TDS evasion.VIVAD SE VISHWAS SCHEME 2.0 The Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme 2.0 has been reintroduced to help resolve ongoing tax disputes amicably. This provides taxpayers with an opportunity to settle their cases efficiently, reducing uncertainties.AADHAAR MANDATORY FOR ITR AND PAN APPLICATIONS Starting October 2024, individuals will no longer be able to use their Aadhaar enrolment numbers for filing ITR or applying for PAN. Aadhaar itself will be mandatory for these processes. Now, those without Aadhaar will face difficulties in completing these tasks.REDUCED TIME LIMIT FOR OLD ITR REVISIONS The time limit for reopening old ITRs has been reduced to five years for cases involving income escaping assessments above Rs 50 lakh. This change aims to minimise prolonged litigation and provide greater certainty for taxpayers. The tax changes in 2024 aim to simplify processes, enhance compliance, and offer select benefits. Taxpayers should evaluate old versus new regimes and stay informed to optimise savings while meeting their obligations. The evolving tax landscape underscores the need for careful planning and timely action.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Trending Reel

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, remarked on the remarkable listing, stating, “Such a strong debut was expected, given the reasonable valuations and massive subscription across investor categories. For conservative investors, booking profits at this level is advisable. However, long-term investors could hold onto their shares, considering Mamata Machinery’s position in the automation and flexible packaging space.” Tapse highlighted the company’s robust customer relationships, global distribution network, and focus on after-sales service as key strengths, enabling it to capitalize on growth opportunities in the evolving packaging industry. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart Ltd, echoed similar sentiments, advising investors to partially book profits while keeping a stop loss at Rs 550.

The company has established itself as a trusted partner in the packaging industry, supported by its emphasis on innovation and customer satisfaction. With a massive subscription to its IPO and a stellar market debut, Mamata Machinery’s performance has validated investor confidence.

All you need to knowCentral government employees await a potential DA hike in January 2025, which could offer modest relief amid rising costs",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/will-dearness-allowance-da-rise-again-in-2025-check-details-how-it-is-calculated-all-you-need-to-know-2656247-2024-12-27,"As the new year approaches, central government employees eagerly await updates on the next dearness allowance (DA) revision. Scheduled for January 2025, this potential hike could bring welcome relief amid rising living costs. However, with the process hinging on the All-India Consumer Price Index (AICPI) numbers, the official announcement may face delays.HOW DA IS DETERMINED Dearness Allowance is revised biannually, reflecting the cost of living based on AICPI data. The Centre reviews the index for January-June and July-December periods, announcing revisions after evaluating the 12-month average AICPI. The DA percentage is based on a 12-month AICPI increase, concluding in June annually. Though revised biannually, announcements often lag. On October 16, 2024, the Union Cabinet approved a 3% DA hike to 53%, aiding over one crore employees and pensioners. Earlier, a 4% hike raised DA to 50% in January 2024, announced in March. The formula for calculating DA is straightforward. For general employees, DA Percentage = ((Average AICPI for the past 12 months - 115.76) / 115.76) x 100. Adjustments vary slightly for central public sector employees, but the basic principle remains consistent.EXPECTED DA HIKE IN JANUARY 2025 Projections suggest a further 3% increase in DA for January 2025, based on current AICPI trends. With the index reaching 144.5 in October 2024 and expected to rise further, the DA may climb to 56%. If approved, this will translate into significant financial benefits. For instance, an employee with a minimum salary of Rs18,000 would see an increase of Rs 540, while those earning the maximum salary of Rs 2,50,000 could gain Rs 7,500. Pensioners, too, stand to benefit, with hikes ranging from Rs 270 to Rs 3,750 depending on their pension.FUTURE PAY REFORMS While employee unions are pushing for the establishment of the 8th Pay Commission, the government has clarified there are no immediate plans. Minister of State Pankaj Chaudhary recently confirmed in Parliament that no proposals are under review, leaving employees and retirees uncertain about future reforms. The anticipated DA hike in 2025 offers much-needed financial relief, but the delay in establishing the 8th Pay Commission underscores the growing demands for a comprehensive overhaul of the pay structure.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

5a12d874-5463-4802-b778-c25de487bb77,Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu revives debate on 70-hour work weekZoho CEO Sridhar Vembu weighs in on the 70-hour work week debate initiated by Infosys founder Narayana Murthy. Here's his perspective.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/zoho-ceo-sridhar-vembu-revives-debate-on-70-hour-work-week-advocated-by-infosys-founder-narayana-murthy-2656318-2024-12-27,"Zoho’s CEO, Sridhar Vembu, has reignited the long-standing debate on the 70-hour work week, a notion first proposed by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. Vembu recently shared his thoughts in a detailed post on X. He wrote, ""The rationale behind the 70-hour work week is 'it is necessary for economic development' "".
 


 IS HARD WORK THE KEY TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS? Vembu referred to the work culture in East Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China, noting that their rapid economic development was driven by intense labour. However, he pointed out that these nations now face significant demographic challenges, with plummeting birth rates leading governments to incentivise families to have children. Vembu raised two critical questions: ""Is hard work necessary for economic development? Is the price of such development, in terms of a lonely old age for many, worth it"". He responded to the first question by acknowledging that only a small percentage of the population needs to push themselves hard for economic growth, suggesting that 2-5% of people can drive development while the rest enjoy a balanced work-life scenario. Regarding the second question, Vembu firmly stated that it’s not worth sacrificing personal well-being and demographic stability for the sake of economic success. THE DANGERS OF OVERWORK: A CAUTIONARY TALE Vembu expressed concern over India potentially mirroring China's economic success if it leads to a similar demographic decline. He warned against pushing India’s workforce to the same extreme work culture, stating the importance of balancing productivity with quality of life. ""I do believe we can develop without needing to work ourselves to demographic suicide,"" Vembu concluded. Narayana Murthy’s controversial advocacy for a 70-hour work week has sparked debates about the need for productivity boosts to compete globally. While some agreed with his call for more hours, others warned of burnout and its long-term effects on society. On the other hand, Vembu's stance offers a reminder that development doesn’t have to come at the cost of personal and societal well-being. Balancing economic growth with a healthy demographic future could be the way forward.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

Read this IndiaToday Exclusive. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/octafx-ferox-firm-run-by-russian-national-dupes-crores-from-indian-investors-pavel-prozorov-exclusive-2656797-2024-12-29,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet in the alleged Rs 800 crore Ponzi scheme scam orchestrated by a forex firm run by a Russian national named Pavel Prozorov.  In the last four to five years, OctaFX, a Forex trading platform, was visible everywhere on social media, from advertisements to sponsoring IPL teams. Very few, or say, no one knew that OctaFx was an elaborate long-term Ponzi scheme launched in India to dupe people of their hard-earned money.  The ED recently filed a second chargesheet against Octafx India, its operating company overseas, OctaMarkets, its founder Pavel Prozorov, OctaFX CEO, who handled India operations, Anna Rudaia, and nine other individuals accused apart from a total of 41 companies and entities. WHY IS IT AN ELABORATE PONZI SCHEME?  According to the exclusive details accessed by IndiaToday, the predicate offence, on the basis of which the ED started investigating, was an FIR filed at Shivajinagar police station in Pune in 2021, against two to three brokers and agents who had duped deaf and dumb persons with a promise of doubling their savings through forex trade at OctaFx in five months and triple it in eight months.  The investors lost huge sums in crores, following which an FIR was filed against the brokers, who are also called 'introducers' by OctaFX. With aggressive online and social media advertising promotions by hiring area-wise influencers and TV personalities, and even top Bollywood actors to promote the platform, they managed to lure numerous investors.  OctaFx employed a number of brokers who helped people invest in the platform. They were called introducers and were paid handsomely for luring people, with gifts like luxury cars, bikes, gold coins and gold bars.  The firm also organised events at 5-star hotels in Goa and invited agents and brokers and felicitated them with hefty bonus amounts and gifts at these events.  According to sources, the platform also offered to invest huge amounts of crores in cash from select customers and investors, mostly bigger introducers, whose online history showed that they had been regular. These cash amounts were collected by their agents and handed over to cash couriers and then deposited into multiple accounts of shell entities.  Once the amount invested swelled to huge proportions, the investors started losing money. Unsuspecting investors in tier-2 or tier-3 cities were mostly targeted with the help of so-called introducers where cash movement in business markets was huge.  However, the forex firm denies any wrongdoing and stresses on the companies' good track record. ""Since 2011, OctaFX has established a solid reputation in the financial industry, with hundreds of thousands of satisfied clients worldwide testifying to the quality and reliability of our services. We strongly refute any claims of money laundering, false promises of exorbitant returns, or engaging in practices that disadvantage traders,"" a spokesperson said.  ""Contrary to the allegations, we have never promised quick riches or guaranteed profits. Instead, we consistently emphasise that forex trading requires a knowledgeable and conscious approach. To support this approach, we provide comprehensive educational resources, which are publicly available on our website, YouTube channel, and the Octa app, to help clients make informed decisions,"" he added. Contrary to the company's claims, the recent investigations by the ED have revealed that forex trading platform OctaFx collected Rs 800 crores as proceeds of crime in just nine months of operations in India. However, the investigation is still ongoing to determine the precise amount of profit that OctaFx has earned from its operation in India. Further, the OctaFX platform frequently changed its login URLs and web addresses in a deliberate strategy to obscure fraudulent activities by investors.  ""Our team actively monitors the public activity of our partners and promptly addresses any misleading statements whenever and wherever they appear. Our partners are required, under the Introducing Broker Agreement, to provide fair and transparent information about the risks involved in forex trading. Whenever any infractions occur, we immediately take action, as with the case in Pune when unscrupulous IBs misrepresented our brand,"" the company further stressed.  During the investigation, OctaFx fully cooperated with authorities and provided all necessary information to assist in resolving the matter, it added. The platform is also accused of manipulating trade activities, resulting in substantial net losses for investors while diverting the defrauded funds into e-wallets and accounts of fictitious entities. Moreover, OctaFx utilised fintech workers to create mule accounts linked to shell companies and fake e-commerce websites. These entities were created to obtain payment gateway access, disguising investor funds as legitimate purchases, as per details exclusively accessed by IndiaToday.  The funds were then routed abroad under the pretext of fake imports and freight services. The platform has gained traction through aggressive promotions, including sponsoring an IPL team, and engaging various production agencies for influencer marketing. Payments to these production agencies were made as foreign inward remittances, through two Estonia-based companies. Both are related entities of OctaFx and controlled by Pavel Prozorov.MODUS OPERANDI  This Forex trading platform was widely promoted on social networking sites and followed referral-based incentive models for acquiring users to their platforms. The funds were collected from users, majorly through UPI/local bank transfers and channelised through dummy entities. These funds were credited to the bank accounts of various dummy entities and domestically transferred to other banks for the purpose of layering.  The multiple accounts of different Indian banks were being shown to investors/users on the OctaFx trading app for collecting funds in the guise of facilitating forex trading. The said accumulated funds, after defrauding these investors or users, were transferred to multiple e-wallet accounts or to bank accounts of dummy entities. The entire process of reflecting account numbers of dummy entities, managing the funds collected in these accounts and diversion of the same was managed and operated by the owners of OctaFx group entities.MONEY LAUNDERING WITH HELP OF DUMMY DIRECTORS, WHO WERE INDIAN NATIONALS, AND SHELL ENTITIES   The OctaFX India operations were run through multiple mule accounts where money was deposited from investors. These accounts belonged to some entities which had Indian directors who had been tutored by OctaFX officials to verify the Know Your Customer (KYC) details whenever needed. Further to legitimate the transactions, the funds from these accounts were transferred to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) registered funds.  To send this money or launder it overseas, they claimed an import order for the import of services and payments were done for the same when actually no such services were offered or taken and eventually the money would be laundered in crores outside the country to various tax havens or smaller European countries. ROLE OF OCTAFX GROUP FOUNDER PAVEL PROZOROV  Pavel Prozorov, Director of OctaFx India Pvt. Ltd. (now Tauga Pvt. Ltd.), is the mastermind behind OctaFx's global Forex and CFD trading operations. He orchestrated a network designed to conceal the origin of illicit funds and facilitate money laundering through shell companies.  Prozorov’s exploitation of regulatory loopholes and the establishment of dummy entities in India exemplify his calculated approach to financial deception. He utilised these entities to manipulate records, allowing funds to be transferred overseas without raising suspicion. Additionally, Prozorov directed substantial promotional campaigns targeting Indian investors, including celebrity endorsements and sponsorships, further embedding OctaFx in the market.  Prozorov's actions constituted careful layering, placement, and integration of laundered funds as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), misrepresenting their origins.  Despite multiple summons from the ED, Prozorov evaded compliance, indicating deliberate obstruction of legal processes. His direct involvement in establishing a complex web of entities and orchestrating financial flows under Section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), as he engaged in the concealment, possession, acquisition, and use of proceeds of crime. He is also liable for punishment under Section 4 of the PMLA for his role in facilitating large-scale financial fraud and evading regulatory oversight. ED has attached some palatial properties of Pavel in Spain worth Rs 41 crores through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).  However, OctaFx denied any role of Prozorov and refuted accusations of him being the 'masterming' of any fraud, saying it lacked credible evidence. ""We strongly reject these unfounded accusations and will take decisive action against any attempts to tarnish our reputation,"" it maintained.ROLE OF FORMER OCTAFX INDIA CEO ANNA RUDAIA  Anna Rudaia, also a Russian national and former CEO of OctaFx India Pvt. Ltd., was summoned last year and her statement was recorded once by the ED, but a day later, she didn't appear despite being summoned by the agency. A Look-Out Circular has already been issued in her name, but she managed to flee the country through illegal channels and has conveyed that she is presently outside India.  Rudaia played a crucial role in managing the Indian operations linked to illicit Forex trading and money laundering activities. Under her leadership, OctaFx organised events promoting unauthorised trading, violating regulatory frameworks mandated by the Reserive Bank of India (RBI) and SEBI.  Rudaia’s involvement included overseeing marketing strategies that attracted Indian investors and channelling illicit proceeds through complex layers to disguise their origins. Despite multiple summonses from the ED, she evaded compliance and fled India, indicative of her intent to escape accountability. After her departure, Rudaia continued to manage operations remotely and facilitated the formation of M/s APAC Stock Brokerage Operations Pvt. Ltd. to continue OctaFx’s activities under a different guise.  Rudaia's actions directly contributed to the laundering of proceeds of crime, fulfilling the requirements of Section 3 of the PMLA through the concealment, possession, acquisition, and use of illicit funds. Based on the evidence, Rudaia is implicated under Sections 3 and 4 of the PMLA for her active participation in promoting illegal Forex trading and laundering activities.ED CHARGESHEET AND ATTACHMENTS IN THE CASE  ED Mumbai had earlier filed a Prosecution Complaint (PC) against OctaFx and its associated entities under the provisions of the PMLA before the Special Court (PMLA), Mumbai on October 1 and a supplementary Prosecution Complaint on December 20. They took note of the prosecution complaint and supplementary prosecution complaint on December 24. The ED has conducted extensive search proceedings and has so far attached and seized assets worth approximately Rs 165 crore, including attachment of 19 immovable properties located in Spain. These properties are owned by the prime accused, Pavel Prozorov. ED officials said that further investigation in the alleged scam is underway.Published By: Vivek Published On: Dec 29, 2024Must Watch

The telecom operator has received a letter from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) regarding a waiver on bank guarantees. Additionally, Vodafone Group, a promoter entity, has settled Rs 11,650 crore of its outstanding dues, releasing pledged shares in Vodafone Idea. Vodafone Idea shares closed at Rs 7.49 on Friday, down 0.93%. The stock has fallen 56% so far in 2024.advertisementBANK GUARANTEE WAIVER Vodafone Idea informed the stock exchanges that the DoT, in a communication dated 27 December 2024, has waived the requirement for Financial Bank Guarantees (FBGs) for spectrum acquired in auctions held in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2021. However, this waiver is subject to certain terms and conditions. Before this decision, Vodafone Idea was required to provide bank guarantees worth Rs 24,800 crore for spectrum instalments. These guarantees had to be submitted 13 months before the instalments became due. According to Vodafone Idea, it will no longer need to provide bank guarantees for the auctions held in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2021. However, a one-time partial shortfall will remain for the 2015 auction, where the net present value (NPV) of all payments made so far is less than the pro-rated value of spectrum used. Vodafone Idea is currently discussing the final amount of this shortfall with the DoT.VODAFONE GROUP SETTLEMENT In a separate development, Vodafone Group has settled Rs 11,650 crore of outstanding dues secured against its shares in Vodafone Idea. These dues were owed by the group's Mauritius and India-based entities, with the pledge held by HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK). According to a regulatory filing, the settlement has resulted in the release of a pledge on 15.72 billion shares held by Vodafone Promoter Shareholders. This accounts for 22.56% of Vodafone Idea’s equity capital on a fully diluted basis.TARIFF HIKE AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Vodafone Idea recently implemented a tariff hike, which has slightly increased its average revenue per user (ARPU). However, revenue growth remains marginal. The company expects the impact of the tariff hike to reflect in its ARPU and revenue figures over the next two quarters. Geojit Financial Services noted that Vodafone Idea anticipates subscriber growth driven by the expansion of its 4G coverage and the rollout of 5G services in key regions starting from Q4FY25. Additionally, the telecom operator’s fundraising efforts through equity issuance or convertible securities are expected to support its expansion plans and help reduce debt.

JSW Energy stock: Brokerages are bullish on the shares of JSW Energy after the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, JSW Neo Energy signed a major deal.

O2 Power is a renewable energy platform set up by Swedish asset manager EQT Partners and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings. The acquisition, valued at Rs 12,468 crore ($1.47 billion) after adjusting for net current assets, has been positively received by market experts, who see it as a strong step towards enhancing JSW Energy’s renewable energy portfolio and boosting its future growth prospects. O2 Power is a big player in the renewable energy sector with a total capacity of 4,696 MW. Of this, 2,259 MW is expected to be operational by June 2025, while 1,463 MW is under construction. Additionally, 974 MW is in the pipeline, targeted for completion by June 2027. The assets are spread across seven resource-rich states in India and have a tariff of Rs 3.37 per kilowatt hour (KWh). The facilities have an average remaining life of 23 years, which adds long-term value to JSW Energy’s portfolio. This acquisition increases JSW Energy’s locked-in generation capacity by 23% to 24,708 MW, bringing the company closer to its target of reaching 25 GW capacity by FY27/28. Following the announcement, JSW Energy shares were trading at Rs 663.3, up 6% compared to the previous session’s closing price of Rs 629.85 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The company’s market capitalisation now stands at Rs 1.09 lakh crore. Over the last year, JSW Energy's stock has climbed by 53%, reflecting the company’s efforts to expand its renewable energy portfolio and strengthen its market position. Several brokerage firms have praised the acquisition and shared optimistic outlooks for JSW Energy. Global brokerage Investec highlighted the deal as a major step for JSW Energy, as it significantly enhances the company's renewable energy capabilities. Investec noted that the transaction includes approximately 2.4 GW of operational assets with an estimated run-rate EBITDA of Rs 1,500 crore. However, the brokerage retained a ""hold"" rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 675 per share. Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal reiterated its ""buy"" recommendation for JSW Energy, raising the target price to Rs 810 per share. It emphasised that acquiring 4.7 GW of high-quality renewable assets at a valuation of 7x EV/EBITDA is favourable, especially when compared to listed renewable energy companies that trade at nearly 15x EV/EBITDA. Motilal Oswal highlighted key positives from the deal:
O2 Power’s competitive interest cost of 8.8% aligns well with JSW Energy’s financial strategy.
O2 Power’s receivable days stand at 43, significantly lower than JSW Energy’s 68 days.
A majority (87%) of O2 Power’s portfolio is secured by utilities such as SECI, NTPC, and SJVN, while the remainder is backed by highly rated commercial and industrial issuers.
The portfolio is diversified across solar, wind, and niche renewable segments.

The company’s shares have gained significant ground since their IPO debut at Rs 31 last month, marking an impressive rise of over 80%. The ongoing rally has been driven by a combination of strong financial performance and growing investor interest in Sagility’s prospects within the healthcare outsourcing sector.WILL POSITIVE MOMENTUM CONTINUE?  Recent financial results have played a crucial role in driving the stock’s performance. The company reported a notable increase in consolidated net profit and revenue from operations, underlining its operational efficiency and ability to capitalise on emerging opportunities in the market. Sagility has strategically positioned itself to benefit from the rising demand for outsourcing services in the U.S. healthcare sector, a trend that analysts believe could sustain its growth trajectory.

With enhanced transparency, simplified processes, and increased flexibility, taxpayers now have more tools at their disposal to file returns accurately and efficiently. Whether it’s the revamped Form 26AS or the introduction of pre-filled ITRs, these updates are designed to make compliance less stressful. Let’s explore five key changes that are making tax filing easier than ever.ENHANCED TRANSPARENCY WITH FORM 26AS The revamped Form 26AS now offers taxpayers a detailed view of their tax transactions. It includes tax deductions, collections, payment details, demands, refunds, and specified financial transactions (SFTs). This transparency helps taxpayers monitor their financial activities, ensuring accurate income disclosure.PRE-FILLED ITRS FOR HASSLE-FREE FILING Pre-filled ITRs now ease the process by automatically populating data like salary income, bank interest, and dividends. This reduces manual effort, minimises errors, and makes tax filing more efficient for individuals.FILING FLEXIBILITY WITH UPDATED RETURNS Under Section 139(8A) of the Income-tax Act, taxpayers can file updated returns within two years of the relevant assessment year. This allows individuals to voluntarily correct mistakes or omissions by paying additional taxes. The e-verification scheme also streamlines reporting of unreported income.SIMPLIFIED PERSONAL TAX REGIME The alternative tax regime, introduced in 2020 and further refined in 2024, offers lower tax slabs for those who opt to forgo specific exemptions and incentives. This aims to make the tax structure more straightforward for individual taxpayers.EXPANDED SCOPE OF TDS AND TCS The tax base has widened with the inclusion of transactions like large cash withdrawals, luxury car purchases, foreign remittances, e-commerce sales, and virtual asset transfers under TDS (tax deducted at source) and TCS (tax collected at source). This ensures greater compliance and accountability. These reforms make tax compliance more seamless and transparent, empowering taxpayers with tools and options to stay on track with their filings while reducing complexities in the process.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

The decline comes after the company’s spectacular stock market debut last week, with analysts attributing the fall to profit booking by retail investors capitalising on the massive listing gains. On Friday, Mamata Machinery delivered a stellar debut on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), listing at a 147% premium to its IPO price of Rs 243. The stock opened at Rs 600 per share, giving the packaging machinery manufacturer a market valuation of Rs 1,476.47 crore. The listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) matched the same rate, reflecting robust investor demand. The company’s IPO, which aimed to raise Rs 179.39 crore, saw overwhelming interest during its three-day subscription period, closing with an impressive 194.95 times oversubscription. The price band for the issue was set between Rs 230 and Rs 243, with the minimum investment requirement at Rs 14,823 for 61 shares. Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, highlighted the strong debut, noting that such a performance was anticipated given the reasonable valuations and high subscription levels across all investor categories. “For conservative investors, booking profits at this level is advisable. However, long-term investors may consider holding onto their shares, given Mamata Machinery’s strong positioning in the automation and flexible packaging sector,” he added. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart Ltd, also recommended partial profit booking while setting a stop-loss at Rs 550. Nyati pointed to the company’s global presence, consistent revenue growth, and sound fundamentals as indicators of its long-term potential. Mamata Machinery, a leader in packaging solutions, specialises in manufacturing and exporting advanced machinery like plastic bag-making and pouch-making equipment. Its focus on innovation and strong customer relationships has established it as a trusted name in the industry. Despite today’s decline, Mamata Machinery’s strong fundamentals and global footprint suggest it remains an attractive option for long-term investors, provided they navigate short-term fluctuations carefully.

The last Union Budget did not make changes to the old tax regime but introduced modifications to the new tax regime to make it more appealing.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/budget-2025-last-major-income-tax-relief-economists-experts-standard-deduction-tax-rate-cut-2657244-2024-12-30,"The Union Budget 2025 is scheduled to be presented on February 1, 2025 as expectations are high among salaried individuals for income tax relief. Rising inflation and the increased cost of living have led to hopes that the government will announce measures to ease the financial burden on taxpayers. Economists have also called on the government to cut income tax rates and implement reforms to boost savings and economic growth in the Union Budget 2025, as per media reports. During a pre-budget meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, experts discussed ways to address economic challenges. A key suggestion was reducing income tax rates, as it could raise disposable income, encourage savings, and stimulate spending on essentials, potentially reviving demand in sectors hit by sluggish consumption. The last Union Budget did not make changes to the old tax regime but introduced modifications to the new tax regime to make it more appealing. Two income tax slabs were widened, and the standard deduction under the new regime was raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. The standard deduction is a fixed amount subtracted from taxable salary income, helping employees manage common work-related expenses. India first abolished the standard deduction in 2005, which previously allowed employees to deduct Rs 30,000 or 40% of their salary, depending on income levels. It was reinstated in Budget 2018 at Rs 40,000, then increased to Rs 50,000 in the interim Budget 2019. In the 2023 Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman expanded the scope of the standard deduction. Individual taxpayers in the new tax regime could claim Rs 50,000, while family pensioners could deduct up to Rs 15,000. Salaried individuals earning Rs 15.5 lakh or more received a tax benefit of Rs 52,500.PREVIOUS MAJOR INCOME TAX RELIEF Ajinkya Gunjan Mishra, Tax Partner at S&R Associates said, “The last significant income tax relief for individual taxpayers was announced in the Union Budget for the financial year 2020-21, which introduced a new and optional personal income tax regime.” This optional regime introduced lower tax rates but required taxpayers to forgo common exemptions and deductions, such as those under Sections 80C and 80D. Mishra explained that the primary goal was to simplify the tax system and provide relief to middle-income earners. Mishra added, “The introduction of reduced tax rates under the optional regime has particularly benefited middle-income taxpayers who do not claim deductions or exemptions.” He also noted that India’s income tax structure is moderate compared to global standards. For instance, India’s basic exemption limit of Rs 3.5 lakh is lower than Singapore’s Rs 6-7 lakh equivalent but higher than many European nations. Dipesh Jain, Partner at Economic Laws Practice, highlighted that the Finance Act 2024 brought additional relief for taxpayers. Jain said, “The new tax regime expanded the basic tax-free income slab limits, reduced tax rates at certain income levels, and increased the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000.” Another major change was the reduction in the long-term capital gains tax rate from 20% to 12.5%. However, Jain said, “This change may not always be beneficial due to the removal of the indexation clause, which in some cases increases the tax burden.” Both Mishra and Jain agreed that these tax changes have positively impacted disposable income and consumer spending. The simplified options under the new tax regime have increased liquidity for middle-class taxpayers, enhancing their purchasing power. India’s top marginal tax rate under the new tax regime is 39%, which is in line with global averages. For comparison, the UK has a top tax rate of 45%, while the US imposes up to 37%. Countries like Australia, Germany, and Japan also have top rates of around 45%. “To increase purchasing power and boost the economy, the government could consider rationalising effective tax rates along with other measures,"" said Jain.

Here is all you need to know. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/sensex-nifty-in-2025-whats-next-for-stock-markets-in-the-new-year-2657239-2024-12-30,"As the curtains close on 2024, Dalal Street reflects on a year of steady gains and record-breaking moments. The Sensex climbed 8.24% while the Nifty rose 8.84%, with both indices reaching historic peaks—Sensex touching 85,978 and Nifty scaling 26,277 on September 27. Despite the milestones, the journey wasn’t without hurdles. Now, as 2025 approaches, all eyes are on what’s next. Can Indian equities continue their upward climb, or will a mix of global and domestic hurdles create a rocky road ahead? Experts believe the year could bring fresh opportunities for investors, thanks to policy shifts, government spending, and innovation-driven growth across key sectors. ""Indian equities were buoyant amidst a challenging and eventful year with higher volatility. The markets were volatile with multiple global events, a slowdown in the Indian economy, tighter liquidity conditions and delayed government spending,"" notes Deepak Ramaraju, Senior Fund Manager at Shriram AMC. However, recent policy changes could set a positive tone for the coming year. Ramaraju points out that ""a recent cut in CRR is expected to ease the liquidity conditions followed by a pickup in government spending. These two factors are expected to improve overall consumption and pickup in industrial output."" The focus in 2025 will likely shift to several key sectors. According to Ramaraju, ""The stock market in 2025 is set to ride on strong economic growth and government efforts to boost infrastructure and digital innovation. Sectors like capital goods, technology, financial services, consumption, and healthcare are expected to shine, with emerging areas such as semiconductors, electronic and manufacturing, renewable energy and electric mobility grabbing more attention."" Government spending will play a crucial role in market movement. Capital expenditure until October 2024 stood at Rs 4,66,545 crores, representing only 42% of the budgeted Rs 11,11,111 crore for FY25. This slower pace of spending compared to the previous year suggests potential for increased activity in the latter half. Looking at global factors, Neeraj Chadawar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, identifies key areas to watch: ""The market will closely monitor the global developments around the following events: 1) Policies in the US government during the Trump presidency, 2) Trade policy, 3) Further rate cut by the US FED in 2025, and 4) The direction of Currency and Oil prices in 2025."" On the domestic front, Chadawar expects market volatility to continue, particularly in the first half of 2025. ""These events are expected to keep the Indian equity market volatile, and it could respond in either direction based on the developments. However, we expect the first half of 2025 to be more volatile. More concrete developments are expected in the second half."" The investment approach for 2025 might need to be more calculated. As Chadawar suggests, ""With current valuations offering limited scope for further expansion, an increase in corporate earnings will be the primary driver of the market returns moving forward. Hence, bottom-up stock picking with a focus on 'Growth at a Reasonable Price' and 'Quality' would be keys to generating satisfactory returns in the next one year."" While opportunities exist across sectors, investors might need to maintain a balanced approach, considering both the growth potential and associated risks in what promises to be an eventful year for stock markets.

Despite the rising popularity of mutual funds and equities, nearly 15% of household savings still find their way into FDs. However, the perceived safety of FDs comes with its share of risks and limitations that investors must consider before making decisions.advertisementTHE REALITY OF SAFETY AND RISKSThe Indian banking system is well-regulated, fostering confidence in the safety of bank FDs. However, regulatory protection is limited to Rs 5 lakh per person per bank under RBI guidelines. Deposits exceeding this limit are theoretically at risk. The Indian banking system is well-regulated, fostering confidence in the safety of bank FDs. However, regulatory protection is limited to Rs 5 lakh per person per bank under RBI guidelines. Deposits exceeding this limit are theoretically at risk. FDs with PSU banks are considered the safest, followed by private scheduled banks and small finance banks, which offer higher interest rates but carry greater risks. Instances like the moratoriums on Yes Bank and Global Trust Bank serve as cautionary tales. Similarly, corporate FDs demand careful scrutiny of credit ratings, reputation, and lock-in periods to avoid defaults.RETURNS THAT BARELY KEEP UP While FDs provide fixed interest rates, their real returns often fail to keep pace with inflation and taxes. For example, an 8% return on an FD for a high-income individual can shrink to a post-tax yield of 4.88%, which, when adjusted for 6% inflation, results in negative real returns. This scenario is even worse for ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Additionally, FDs lack the compounding advantage of equity mutual funds or stocks, where returns are taxed only upon realisation, allowing for wealth accumulation over time.CHOOSE WISELY FOR WEALTH CREATION  While FDs offer a safe harbour, their limited growth potential makes them unsuitable for long-term wealth creation. Investments in equity-oriented products, when held for 7–10 years, tend to mitigate risks and provide significantly higher returns. Safety, though important, should not come at the cost of wealth erosion. By understanding the hidden risks of FDs, investors can make informed choices, balancing security and growth for a financially prosperous future.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

Historically, January has often been a challenging month for equity markets, with the NSE Nifty 50 index recording losses in 13 out of the past 20 years. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/stock-market-in-january-2025-what-to-expect-investors-face-a-tough-start-sectors-to-watch-dalal-street-2657261-2024-12-30,"Stock markets have seen a downward trend in the latter part of December 2024 and Dalal Street's performance in January 2025 is under close watch as a series of major global and domestic events are expected to influence investor sentiment. Historically, January has often been a challenging month for equity markets, with the NSE Nifty 50 index recording losses in 13 out of the past 20 years. Since 2019, the index has experienced a losing streak in January for six consecutive years. Adding to the uncertainty, the swearing-in of Donald Trump as the US president on January 20 is anticipated to impact global markets. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve’s potential delay in rate cuts and India’s Union Budget, set to be announced on February 1, are key factors that could shape market dynamics.INVESTOR CAUTION AHEAD OF MAJOR EVENTS Market experts are advising caution for January 2025, given the confluence of global and domestic events. Jathin Kaithavalappil, Assistant Vice President at Choice Broking, said, “Domestic equity markets are expected to be cautious in Q1FY2025. The domestic Union Budget: fiscal measures to be released for the year on February 1, 2025, and the unemployment reports out of the US, as they almost always signal winds of changing trends in inflation in the USA. Finally, creeping inflation in our country in different areas will certainly be one of the issues.” G Chokkalingam, Founder of Equinomics Research, expects a weak start to 2025 for Indian markets. “A weak rupee, possible delay in aggressive rate cuts by the US Fed, and the forthcoming Budget would delay the return of FIIs’ investments in Indian equity,” he said. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) poured Rs 3,459 crore into equities in 2024 until December 26, but they offloaded over Rs 1.15 lakh crore worth of shares in October and November. This follows significant buying activity in 2023, during which FIIs invested Rs 1.71 lakh crore.2024: A MIXED YEAR FOR EQUITY MARKETS Despite heavy outflows by FIIs in the last quarter of 2024, the overall year was positive for the stock market. The NSE Nifty 50 gained nearly 10% year-to-date until December 27, 2024. Meanwhile, the Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 indices surged by 23% and 26%, respectively, during the same period. Ajay Garg, Director and CEO of SMC Global Securities, believes there is room for optimism in 2025. “Nifty 50 is expected to cross the 28,000 mark in 2025, but the growth may remain non-linear. The current market downturn, in turn, poses a good opportunity to pick some high-quality stocks at a lower price. Taking the ‘buy low sell high’ approach can provide fruitful returns in 2025,” he said.SECTORS TO WATCH IN 2025 Certain sectors are expected to drive market growth in 2025, particularly BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance), FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods), and infrastructure. BFSI: The sector saw its total income rise by 16% year-on-year in the July-September 2024 quarter. Garg noted, “BFSI will experience sharp growth in 2025 with improved asset quality, growth in loans, higher investment participation, and higher financial literacy.” FMCG: The sector faced challenges in 2024 due to lower consumer demand. However, Garg believes it could recover strongly in 2025. “The FMCG sector is one of the stable sectors that can revive with rising consumption, quick commerce push, and higher premiumisation,” he added. Infrastructure: This sector posted a 12.9% year-on-year growth in total income in the July-September 2024 quarter. Garg highlighted the role of government spending and public-private partnerships in driving the sector’s growth, along with improvements in logistics and housing development.

The share, which had closed at Rs 281.83 on Friday, opened at Rs 288.70 on Monday, reflecting strong investor interest. The significant rise in Greaves Cotton’s stock price is attributed to multiple factors, including developments in its subsidiary, Greaves Electric Mobility (GEML), and increased investor confidence. Greaves Electric Mobility, a subsidiary of Greaves Cotton, recently filed a draft prospectus for a Rs 1,000 crore Initial Public Offering (IPO). The public issue will include a fresh issue worth Rs 1,000 crore and an Offer for Sale (OFS) of up to 18.94 crore shares by existing promoters and shareholders.

This marks the first time Kedia has invested in the company, a move that has further enhanced market sentiment. His investment came shortly after the GEML IPO received approval, highlighting confidence in the company’s direction. Greaves Cotton has a current market capitalisation exceeding Rs 7,200 crore, with its shares doubling in value during 2024. The company is undergoing a significant transformation, moving from its traditional role as an engine manufacturer to becoming a provider of fuel-agnostic mobility solutions. This transition is supported by diversified revenue streams and a focus on electric and multi-fuel vehicles. In the second quarter of FY25, Greaves Cotton reported consolidated revenue of Rs 705 crore. Its retail arm, Greaves Retail, continues to lead in the three-wheeler motor and parts segment while also expanding into the electric three-wheeler category.  The company’s management has set a target to achieve Rs 15,000 crore in revenue by 2030. This goal is underpinned by its strategy to diversify revenue streams and focus on multi-fuel and electric mobility solutions, aligning with global trends in sustainable transportation.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 30, 2024

The government has taken steps to simplify taxation through the New Tax Regime, but concerns remain over the potential elimination of the old system, which offers extensive deductions and exemptions. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, addressing these concerns after Budget 2024, stated that no decision has been finalised, and any changes would follow a thorough evaluation.advertisementCOMPARING OLD AND NEW TAX REGIMESThe Old Tax Regime, a longstanding system, encourages savings through exemptions like those under Section 80TTB, especially benefiting senior citizens. Tax rates range from 5% to 30%, with various deductions available. The Old Tax Regime, a longstanding system, encourages savings through exemptions like those under Section 80TTB, especially benefiting senior citizens. Tax rates range from 5% to 30%, with various deductions available. In contrast, the New Tax Regime introduces lower tax rates (0% to 30%) but reduces exemptions, simplifying the filing process and catering to those in lower income brackets. Key changes in the New Tax Regime include raising the tax-free limit to Rs 3 lakh, introducing a 5% tax for incomes between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 7 lakh, and increasing the standard deduction for salaried employees to Rs 75,000. Additionally, employer contributions to the National Pension System (NPS) now enjoy enhanced tax benefits. These changes aim to save taxpayers up to Rs 17,500 annually under the New Tax Regime.WHAT'S NEXT? The progressive tax slabs under the revised New Tax Regime offer simplicity but come at the cost of fewer savings incentives. For instance, while the New Tax Regime benefits individuals in lower tax brackets, it lacks the robust exemptions that the Old Tax Regime provides. As the government continues its push for a streamlined tax system, the question remains: will the Old Tax Regime be scrapped entirely? While no final decision has been announced, taxpayers must evaluate which system aligns with their financial goals. The future of taxation lies in striking a balance between simplicity and incentivising savings, ensuring a fair and efficient framework for all.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

Conviction to accumulate stocks will emerge only when macro indicators suggest recovery in growth and earnings.

Unimech Aerospace IPO has been commanding a good grey market premium and reached Rs 715 on December 29, 2024, but has since seen a gradual decline in the unofficial market.  The Grey Market Premium (GMP) for the Unimech Aerospace IPO was last reported at Rs 625 as of December 31, 2024, at 5:04 AM. Considering the IPO's price band of Rs 785, the anticipated listing price for Unimech Aerospace shares is estimated at Rs 1,410.

The recently-listed investment banking firm saw its stock rise to an intraday high of Rs 406.65 after opening at Rs 368.05. By 11 am, the shares were trading 3.60% higher at Rs 385.70, recovering some ground lost during Monday’s profit booking. Monday’s 8% drop followed a strong debut for Dam Capital on the stock market last week, where it gained significantly, drawing both retail and institutional interest. Analysts believe Tuesday’s uptick reflects renewed investor demand after the sharp pullback. Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President (Research) at Mehta Equities, highlighted that Dam Capital’s robust listing was driven by reasonable valuations and positive market sentiment. “Conservative investors should consider booking profits on higher-than-expected returns, but those with a long-term perspective and an appetite for volatility may hold onto their shares,” Tapse advised. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, praised Dam Capital for its strong growth in investment banking services, including equity capital markets, mergers and acquisitions, and private equity advisory. However, Nyati cautioned that the company’s valuation appears fully priced, recommending a stop-loss strategy at Rs 390 and partial profit booking. Despite the recent volatility, analysts remain optimistic about the company’s fundamentals. Dam Capital’s positioning in the growing investment banking sector and its ability to capitalise on market opportunities continue to make it an attractive choice for investors. However, experts suggest closely monitoring its long-term performance and broader market trends before making additional investments. The stock’s movement on Tuesday signals resilience as it continues to garner attention from investors. While short-term fluctuations may persist, Dam Capital’s strong market positioning and promising growth trajectory could sustain interest, particularly among those seeking exposure to the financial services sector.

As per a report by Moneycontrol Pitti intends to sell 50,37,21,910 shares at Rs 15.60 per unit, which is an 8.45% discount to the stock's previous closing price. This move follows his earlier stake sales in the company over the past few months.

Before this, in June 2023, he sold 6.25 crore shares at Rs 42.60 per share. The continuous stake reduction by the promoter has raised concerns among investors, contributing to the sharp decline in the stock price. The stock has fallen 16.56% in 2024 so far and has seen a 23.78% drop from its 2024 highs. Additionally, the stock turned ex-bonus in a 1:1 ratio on November 29, which has also impacted its trading pattern. Institutional investors are expected to participate in the fresh block deal.

For the September quarter, Easy Trip Planners reported a 45.16% drop in profit, posting Rs 25.87 crore compared to Rs 47.18 crore in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter showed a modest growth of 2.1%, reaching Rs 144.67 crore compared to Rs 141.69 crore in the previous year.

Many have revised target prices upward, with projections averaging around Rs 320.55, indicating confidence in the company’s growth trajectory.

Taxpayers must complete payments within 15 days of receiving Form-2 to avoid penalties. This streamlined approach reflects the government’s commitment to reducing litigation, fostering compliance, and promoting a dispute-free tax system. Chartered Accountant Himank Singla, partner, SBHS and Associates, while speaking to The Economic Times, stated that the extension encourages higher participation and aligns with the government’s objective to resolve disputes effectively.

Check all detailsUnion Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary recently revealed in Parliament that only 6.68% of India's population filed ITRs in the fiscal year 2023-24.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/itr-filing-deadline-extended-for-belated-revised-return-cbdt-new-date-income-tax-check-all-details-stmp-2657711-2024-12-31,"The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for resident individuals to file their belated or revised Income Tax Returns (ITR) for the Assessment Year (AY) 2024-25. The original deadline of December 31, 2024, has now been pushed to January 15, 2025. This extension gives taxpayers an additional two weeks to complete or revise their filings. The CBDT shared this update via an announcement on X, and said, “CBDT extends the last date for furnishing Belated/ Revised return of income for AY 2024-25 in the case of Resident Individuals from December 31, 2024 to January 15, 2025.” The change has been made using the board’s powers under section 119 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

 



ITR deadline extended
 This extension applies to two specific cases. Firstly, it benefits individuals who missed the initial deadline of July 31, 2024, to file their ITR and had until December 31 to file a belated return. Secondly, it allows taxpayers who need to make corrections to previously filed returns an extended window to submit their revised filings. Under current rules, taxpayers filing belated returns must pay a late fee. If the taxable income is below Rs 5 lakh, the fee is Rs 1,000. For those with taxable income above Rs 5 lakh, the late fee increases to Rs 5,000. Taxpayers often make errors or omissions when filing their ITR, such as missing income details or claiming incorrect deductions. A revised return allows individuals to rectify these mistakes. Filing a corrected ITR ensures compliance with tax regulations and can help avoid penalties or additional scrutiny. Despite repeated efforts to encourage tax compliance, a small portion of India’s population files income tax returns. Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary recently revealed in Parliament that only 6.68% of India’s population filed ITRs in the fiscal year 2023-24. “In FY 2023-24, the percentage of population that filed Income Tax Return is 6.68%. The total number of persons filing income tax returns is 8,09,03,315,” he informed the Rajya Sabha on December 17. The new deadline aims to provide relief to taxpayers who may have faced difficulties meeting the December 31 deadline. It also ensures that those needing to correct or update their returns have sufficient time to do so without unnecessary haste.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Trending Reel

Axis Securities is quite hopeful about India's growth in 2025. They say India's economy is doing better than other growing countries and should keep doing well. ""Nifty 50 EPS is projected to grow by 7.6% in FY25, with growth expected to accelerate to 13.7% in FY26 and 11% in FY27, reflecting a robust 14% CAGR over the FY23–27 period. This growth will be supported by the real estate cycle, private capex recovery, and strong
construction activity during this period. Risks include global macro uncertainties, inflation pressures, and potential earnings downgrades post-Q3,"" Axis Securities said.  However, they say investors should keep an eye on a few things in 2025: what happens in US government policies after Doanld Trump takes oath as President, any changes in trade rules between countries, whether the US central bank cuts interest rates, and how oil prices and currency rates move. In India, they suggest watching for the upcoming budget and possible interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India.

Following a volatile 2024 that saw significant gains in the first half before moderating, market experts anticipate single-digit returns in the coming year. The previous year’s journey was particularly noteworthy.

This performance is especially remarkable considering the substantial foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. As Tapse notes, Nifty achieved its ""ninth consecutive year of positive returns, despite FIIs selling shares worth Rs 3,03,000 crore.""CAUTION AND UNCERTAINTY REMAIN  The market sentiment entering 2025 remains cautious, with several global factors weighing on investor confidence. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, points to ongoing challenges: ""Markets are preparing to move into the New Year with caution since uncertainty is high and valuations are stretched. The high US bond yield and strong dollar will ensure that FIIs will continue to sell on every rise."" Several other analysts expect 2025 to be a year of modest returns, with geopolitical issues and US Federal Reserve decisions playing crucial roles in market direction. The change in US government, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and anticipated Fed rate cuts are contributing to market volatility.WHAT'S IN FOCUS?  The first half of 2025 could see muted earnings due to tepid demand, according to market experts. Analysts believe stock markets are likely to remain range-bound in the first half of the year, with recovery expected later in the year driven by underlying earnings growth. Vijayakumar highlighted the importance of corporate performance: ""Conviction to accumulate stocks will emerge only when macro indicators suggest recovery in growth and earnings. Watch out for the Q3 results starting from January 10 to identify companies reporting good numbers despite the growth slowdown."" Despite the cautious outlook, some analysts maintain optimistic targets. According to a Business Today report, Choice Broking's Jathin Kaithavalappil projects the Sensex to reach 90,000 and Nifty to hit 28,000 by year-end, citing India's strong domestic consumption and investment cycle. Meanwhile, Religare Broking's Ajit Mishra provides a more conservative estimate, with Nifty potentially reaching 26,000 by the end of 2025. As markets navigate through these challenging times, Tapse's closing remarks capture the sentiment perfectly: ""Sentiments are volatile, and caution is advised as we enter the new year.""Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

This surprising move caught the attention of millions of his followers and also caused a stir in the cryptocurrency market. 
 


 The memecoin KEKIUS, sharing its name with Musk’s new persona, surged over 500% in just a few hours, reigniting enthusiasm in the volatile world of memecoins.WHAT IS KEKIUS MAXIMUS? Kekius Maximus, which goes by the ticker, KEKIUS, is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency token that blends humour with decentralised finance (DeFi). KEKIUS is influenced by internet culture, particularly the Pepe the Frog meme and the Maximus character from Gladiator. According to CoinGecko, the token operates across multiple blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana, with a current market capitalisation of over $85 million. KEKIUS tokens are actively traded on both centralised and decentralised exchanges, with Gate.io being the most popular platform for transactions. The token’s highest recorded price was $0.09274 on December 31, 2024, while its lowest price of $0.0006923 was seen just 13 days earlier. The sudden surge in KEKIUS’s value is a testament to the power of social media and Musk’s unparalleled influence in the tech and crypto realms.THE MUSK EFFECT ON MEMECOINS Musk, a well-known fan of memes and cryptocurrency, further amplified the hype by resharing posts about his new identity. One such post joked about journalists addressing him as “Kekius Maximus,” to which Musk replied, “This will be priceless.” While he hasn’t clarified his reasons for adopting the new name, his tweets have once again demonstrated their market-moving potential.
 


 The surge in KEKIUS has also revived interest in other Kekius-themed memecoins, some of which have soared by over 200% within hours of launch. Experts believe this could signal the return of the 'memecoin season,' where humour and speculation drive unprecedented gains in the crypto market. Musk’s playful antics continue to blur the lines between internet culture and high-stakes financial markets, leaving everyone guessing what he’ll do next.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 109.12 points to settle at 78,139.01, while the Nifty50 edged down by 0.10 points, closing at 23,644.80. Among the sectoral indices, Nifty IT emerged as the top loser, declining by 1.44% by the end of the session. This downturn in IT stocks, which derive a substantial portion of their revenue from the US market, is attributed to the US Federal Reserve's recent indication of fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously anticipated. The stance has led to a rise in Treasury yields, diminishing the appeal of emerging markets like India for foreign institutional investors (FIIs). Consequently, FIIs have been net sellers for ten consecutive sessions, offloading shares worth approximately $2.8 billion. In terms of individual stock performance on the Nifty50, the top gainers included Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Kotak Mahindra Bank, Trent, and Coal India. Conversely, the leading losers were Adani Enterprises, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, and SBI Life Insurance. The mixed performance across broader market indices, coupled with rising volatility during the session, suggests a cautious investor sentiment as the year concludes. Market participants are now looking ahead to 2025, closely monitoring global economic indicators and policy decisions that could influence market dynamics in the coming year. Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares, said, ""Today's market action exhibited a V-shaped recovery, with a subdued opening followed by a sharp decline led by weakness in the Mid and Smallcap stocks. However, a strong recovery across sectors helped the Index close the session at 23,644.80."" ""A Spinning Top candlestick pattern appeared on the chart, suggesting indecisiveness but also raising the possibility of a positive divergence in the RSI, which could signal a change in momentum. In terms of technical levels, the immediate resistance is seen at 23,700, and a confirmation of trend reversal would see the next resistance level at 23,880. On the downside, 23,470 remains a key support level,"" he added.

""The near-term trend appears weak with the macro construct dominated by weak GDP and earnings growth. The headwinds from a strong dollar ( $ index is at 108.5%) and high U.S. bond yields will impact the market through more FII selling, at least in the early days of 2025. Even though FII selling is matched by DII buying, in this tug of war, in the near-term, sentiments are on the side of FIIs since valuations continue to be elevated and growth and earnings are yet to show signs of recovery,"" he added.  A trend reversal may happen if the Q3 corporate results indicate recovery in earnings. But an across the board sharp recovery appears unlikely. Positive cues can come from a growth-stimulating Budget followed by a rate cut by the MPC in February.

In addition to boosting energy production, the project is expected to generate employment for approximately 5,000 people, both directly and indirectly. It is also set to attract an investment of around Rs 10,000 crore to Bihar, marking a significant milestone in the state’s energy development plans. In August 2022, the Ministry of Power designated SJVN as the nodal agency for developing Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) in Bihar.

India's GDP growth slowed to 5.4% in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, marking an 18-month low. This was primarily due to weak consumption.",https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/budget-2025-expectations-nirmala-sitharaman-focus-on-boosting-consumption-slow-growth-high-inflation-2658158-2025-01-01,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman faces a challenging economic backdrop as she prepares to present Budget 2025-26 on February 1. With inflation driven by high food prices and a slowdown in economic growth, the government is under pressure to revive private consumption, which is critical for sustaining economic momentum. India’s GDP growth slowed to 5.4% in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, marking an 18-month low. This was primarily due to weak consumption. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also lowered its real GDP growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.6%, citing global uncertainties, volatile commodity prices, and fragmented economic conditions. Experts, including Deloitte, have highlighted the need for measures in the upcoming Budget to address these challenges. Boosting private consumption, particularly among the middle class, is seen as essential to prevent further delays in the recovery of the private investment cycle.MIDDLE-CLASS RELIEF & CONSUMPTION REVIVAL Anand Ramanathan, Partner and Leader for the Consumer Products and Retail sector at Deloitte India, said that India’s GDP growth is likely to moderate to 6.3% in FY25 due to fiscal consolidation and tighter global credit conditions. While core inflation stands at a manageable 4.8%, food inflation remains a concern at 5.1%. “The country’s current account deficit is projected at 1.9 per cent of GDP, supported by a 13 per cent rise in services exports, mainly IT services, which contribute $325 billion annually. This economic backdrop underscores the need for prudent fiscal policies that prioritise consumption revival, infrastructure development and innovation-driven growth,"" said Ramanathan.DELOITTE'S KEY EXPECTATION FROM BUDGET 2025 Deloitte has outlined three main expectations for Budget 2025 that could help boost private consumption and address economic concerns: Higher income tax exemptions - Deloitte suggests raising the basic income tax exemption limit under the old tax regime from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh. Additionally, it recommends increasing the standard deduction under the new regime from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. The consultancy firm estimates that this could increase disposable income for middle-income households by 5-7%, leading to a 6% rise in consumer spending on essential goods and a 0.7% boost to GDP. Lower GST rates on mass-consumption FMCG products - Deloitte recommends reducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on mass-consumption FMCG products, such as personal care items and packaged foods, from 18% to 12%. This move could result in an 8% increase in volume sales of these products, leading to higher tax collections and a 0.5% GDP growth. It would also make essential goods more affordable and support small-scale FMCG manufacturers. Targeted tax incentives for rural markets and innovation - To enhance rural demand, Deloitte proposes a Rs 10,000 crore FMCG Rural Growth Fund to improve distribution networks and offer tax rebates for affordable rural product lines. The firm also suggests a 150% weighted tax deduction on research and development (R&D) expenses for FMCG companies focusing on sustainable packaging and health-related products. Deloitte estimates that a 10% growth in rural FMCG sales could add Rs 50,000 crore in annual revenue for the industry.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Must Watch

Check details NPCI's decision allows WhatsApp Pay to serve over 500 million WhatsApp users in the country, a huge leap from earlier restrictions.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/whatsapp-pays-upi-services-to-cover-all-indian-users-check-details-npci-lifts-cap-2658208-2025-01-01,"WhatsApp Pay, the payment feature of the popular messaging platform, has been given the green light to extend its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) services to all its users in India. This major development comes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has lifted the cap on user onboarding for WhatsApp Pay. In a press release, NPCI announced, ""National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has removed the UPI user onboarding limit for WhatsApp Pay (Third Party App Provider), with immediate effect. With this development, WhatsApp Pay can now extend UPI services to its entire user base in India."" This decision allows WhatsApp Pay to serve over 500 million WhatsApp users in the country, a huge leap from earlier restrictions.  When WhatsApp Pay was introduced, NPCI imposed strict limits on the number of users it could onboard. This cautious approach was designed to ensure the payment service could handle the large-scale demands of India's digital payments ecosystem while maintaining security and performance standards. Initially, WhatsApp Pay was allowed to onboard only a small percentage of UPI users. The cap was gradually raised as NPCI monitored its performance and ensured compliance with the UPI framework. In November 2022, NPCI increased the cap for WhatsApp Pay to 100 million users. This phased rollout allowed WhatsApp Pay to fine-tune its operations and address any scalability or security concerns before reaching a wider audience. The decision to lift the cap comes after NPCI assessed that WhatsApp Pay has met all necessary operational, security, and compliance standards required for UPI payment services. By removing the limit, NPCI aims to enable broader access to digital payment platforms, which aligns with India’s push for a cashless economy. With this update, WhatsApp Pay will still need to comply with all existing UPI guidelines applicable to third-party app providers (TPAPs). This move is expected to reshape India’s UPI ecosystem. WhatsApp, with over 500 million users in the country, can now actively promote its payment feature to a much larger audience. This could challenge existing UPI leaders like PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm, which currently dominate the market. The decision to remove the onboarding limit coincides with NPCI's extension of the market cap deadline for UPI service providers. According to the earlier NPCI rule issued in 2021, no single UPI app was allowed to handle more than 30% of the total UPI transactions. However, NPCI has now extended the compliance deadline for this rule by two years, until 31 December 2026. This gives existing players like PhonePe and Google Pay, which currently exceed the 30% cap, more time to align with the guidelines.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 1, 2025

The latest numbers indicate a steady growth in GST revenues but reflect a slowdown in consumption and a rise in refunds issued during the month.

Central GST (CGST): Rs 32,836 crore

 GST revenues from domestic transactions, including the collection from services and goods sold within the country, grew 8.4% YoY to Rs 1.32 lakh crore. Meanwhile, tax revenues from imports increased by 4% YoY to Rs 44,268 crore. Refunds issued during December surged 31% compared to the same month last year, amounting to Rs 22,490 crore. After adjusting for these refunds, the net GST collection stood at Rs 1.54 lakh crore, up 3.3% YoY.COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS MONTHS November 2024: GST collections stood at Rs 1.82 lakh crore, reflecting an 8.5% YoY growth. October 2024: The mop-up reached Rs 1.87 lakh crore, marking a 9% YoY increase and the second-highest collection on record. April 2024: The highest-ever monthly GST collection was recorded at Rs 2.10 lakh crore. The steady increase in GST revenues over the year highlights improvements in compliance and economic activity. However, the drop in December’s month-on-month collection compared to November may reflect seasonal factors such as lower post-festive consumption.

Announced late on December 31, 2024, via the ITR e-filing portal, the department confirmed that eligible taxpayers would soon be able to file revised or belated ITRs through the ITR filing utility or online on the e-filing portal. This development follows an interim directive by the Bombay High Court, which extended the deadline for filing revised and belated ITRs for resident individuals to January 15, 2025. Backend updates to the online ITR forms are underway to facilitate these changes. Under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, eligible taxpayers can claim rebates of up to Rs 12,500 under the old tax regime and Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime.KEY UPDATE FOR ELIGIBLE TAXPAYERS On December 31, 2024, the department confirmed that it will soon enable the filing of revised or belated ITRs for eligible taxpayers on the e-filing ITR portal for Forms ITR-2 and ITR-3. These forms allow individuals to declare incomes such as Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG), which were earlier excluded from claiming the 87A rebate. This update addresses a significant issue where taxpayers filing ITRs after July 5, 2024, were barred from claiming the rebate due to changes in the e-filing utility. Many of these taxpayers subsequently received notices, sparking widespread concern amongst professionals and individuals alike.BOMBAY HIGH COURT'S INTERVENTION The Bombay High Court, in an interim order dated December 20, 2024, emphasised that taxpayers eligible for the rebate should not face procedural hurdles. The court directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to extend the deadline for filing revised or belated ITRs, ensuring compliance with statutory rights. While the final judgment is awaited on January 9, 2025, tax professionals have lauded this move as a significant step toward aligning procedural efficiency with legislative intent. This decision not only safeguards taxpayers' rights but also highlights the importance of timely updates to tax systems. As the revised utilities roll out, taxpayers are advised to file accurately within the extended deadline to avoid complications.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Trending Reel

The sharp drop comes after the company disclosed a significant capital reduction proposal involving Urban Infrastructure Holdings Private Limited (UIHPL), in which it holds a 32% equity stake. Jai Corp informed stock exchanges that UIHPL plans to convene an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to seek shareholder approval for the proposed capital reduction. The move is also subject to clearance from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and other regulatory bodies. Upon approval, Jai Corp is set to receive approximately Rs 364 crore from the reduction process. The announcement follows recent developments involving Dronagiri Infrastructure Private Limited (DIPL), a subsidiary of UIHPL. DIPL sold a 74% equity stake in Navi Mumbai IIA Private Limited for Rs 1,628.03 crore, with CIDCO retaining the remaining 26%. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) acquired this stake, finalizing the deal after CIDCO waived its rights of first refusal earlier in December. As part of the capital reduction process, UIHPL will receive a minimum of Rs 1,492.50 crore from DIPL, which may increase depending on interest earnings from surplus funds. Additionally, UIHPL expects Rs 682 crore from redeeming optionally fully convertible debentures in Vinamra Universal Traders Private Limited, bringing the total funds to a minimum of Rs 3,772 crore. UIHPL plans to reduce 99.76% of its share capital, including equity shares and fully compulsorily convertible preference shares, paying an aggregate of Rs 3,746.87 crore to its shareholders on a proportionate basis.

ef504571-029d-4a39-a711-9bb7d5d12c1d,Vodafone Idea likely to launch 5G broadband services in March: ReportVodafone Idea plans to introduce 5G with competitively priced plans that could be up to 15% cheaper at entry levels. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/vodafone-idea-5g-launch-in-march-report-pricing-war-ahead-reliance-jio-airtel-vi-share-price-stmp-2658560-2025-01-02,"Vodafone Idea is planning to launch its 5G mobile broadband services in March, reported The Economic Times. The company aims to make a mark in a market already dominated by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. The company plans to introduce 5G with competitively priced plans that could be up to 15% cheaper at entry levels, added the report. The move is expected to spark a pricing war among telecom operators. Vodafone Idea is likely to focus on India’s top 75 cities and 17 priority circles for the initial rollout. Industrial hubs, known for heavy data usage, are also on the radar. The telco’s strategy is aimed at winning back customers who have migrated to its competitors, which already have extensive 5G networks. “We are gearing up to launch 5G services and are committed to providing the best experience and price,” a Vodafone Idea spokesperson told the publication. The company added that it has sufficient and competitive 5G spectrum in its 17 key markets, which will help improve its 4G coverage and enable a swift 5G rollout. The anticipation of 5G launch helped Vodafone Idea’s shares gain marginally, which were trading at Rs 8.03, up 0.12%, at the time of writing.  Global brokerage Citi recently upgraded Vodafone Idea’s stock to a ‘buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 13, suggesting a potential upside of 64% from the current levels. The upgrade follows a critical bank guarantee waiver by the Department of Telecommunications, providing some relief to the debt-laden telecom operator. Vodafone Idea’s CEO Akshaya Moondra has hinted at keeping 5G base pricing lower than its competitors. During the company’s earnings call for the first quarter of FY25, he mentioned that a final decision on pricing would be made closer to the launch. This approach contrasts with the strategies of Jio and Airtel, which have increased the minimum threshold for 5G services by requiring users to upgrade to higher-value plans. To attract high-value 5G prepaid users, Vodafone Idea may also increase dealer commissions and promotional spending. As per Jefferies, the company spent Rs 3,583 crore (8.4% of sales) on dealer commissions in FY24, higher than Jio’s Rs 3,000 crore (3% of sales). Airtel was the largest spender, with Rs 6,000 crore (4% of sales) allocated for the same purpose.FUNDING AND ROLLOUT PLANS Backed by Rs 24,000 crore in equity funding, Vodafone Idea is expected to raise an additional Rs 25,000 crore in debt. The financial support comes after recent government relief measures, including waivers on bank guarantee requirements. The company has also finalised Rs 30,000 crore worth of contracts with global network vendors such as Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung to support its 4G expansion and 5G rollout. It plans to deploy around 75,000 5G base stations over three years, with several thousand new sites to be added by March 2025. “We’re excited to supercharge our network and add several thousand new sites by March 2025 for enhanced connectivity and roll out 5G to revolutionise the digital experience for Vi users,” said a Vodafone Idea spokesperson.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

For taxpayers looking to maximise their savings, now is the crucial time to make investments that will help claim tax exemptions for the fiscal year. However, the key to claiming these exemptions lies in making the investments before the financial year ends.advertisementKEY INVESTMENT OPTIONS FOR TAX EXEMPTION IN FY 2024-25To claim tax exemptions for FY 2024-25, the investments must be made in this current financial year, which concludes on March 31, 2025. When filing your income tax return (ITR) before July 31, 2025, you can benefit from various tax-saving options. To claim tax exemptions for FY 2024-25, the investments must be made in this current financial year, which concludes on March 31, 2025. When filing your income tax return (ITR) before July 31, 2025, you can benefit from various tax-saving options. Below are some of the most popular tax-saving instruments to consider: Section 80C (Max Rs 1.5 lakh): You can invest in instruments like the National Savings Certificate (NSC), Public Provident Fund (PPF), and Unit-linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) to claim a deduction under Section 80C. Section 80CCC (Max Rs 1.5 lakh): Contributions to life insurance-based pension plans also qualify for tax deductions under this section. Section 80CCD(1) (Max Rs 1.5 lakh): Taxpayers can invest in the National Pension Scheme (NPS) to claim deductions under Section 80CCD(1). Section 80D (Max Rs 25,000 for regular citizens, Rs 50,000 for senior citizens): Premiums paid for medical insurance for yourself, your spouse, parents, or children are eligible for tax deductions under Section 80D. Section 80CCD(1B) (Max Rs 50,000): For NPS contributors, this section allows an additional deduction on top of the one available under Section 80CCD(1).DON’T MISS OUT ON POTENTIAL SAVINGS While the new tax regime offers fewer exemptions, certain contributions, like those to the Agniveer Corpus Fund (Section 80CCH), are still eligible for deduction. However, most exemptions apply to the old tax regime, so if you're aiming to claim them, you must opt for the old system. As the end of the financial year approaches, now is the time to act. Make the right investments, maximise your tax deductions, and prepare for a smooth filing of your ITR before the July 31 deadline.

Thanks to the introduction of the Centralized Pension Payment System (CPPS), pensioners will now be able to collect their pension from any bank branch across India, even if they move to a different city or town. This change aims to provide greater flexibility and ease for retirees, making the process much more convenient.advertisementA REVOLUTIONARY SHIFTThe CPPS is part of the Employee Provident Fund Organization’s (EPFO) modernisation program and will be available under the Centralized IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01). The CPPS is part of the Employee Provident Fund Organization’s (EPFO) modernisation program and will be available under the Centralized IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01). It represents a national-level solution that leverages advanced IT and financial technology to make pension payments faster and more accessible to pensioners across India. The system allows pensioners to access their benefits without the need to transfer their Pension Payment Order (PPO) when relocating or changing banks. This is a significant step forward in modernising the pension disbursement process and will benefit over 78 lakh EPS pensioners. Union Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya praised the initiative, describing it as an important step in updating the EPFO. He stated that the new system would solve long-standing issues faced by pensioners and improve the overall efficiency of the EPFO.A FUTURE OF SEAMLESS PAYMENTS For pensioners, especially those who return to their hometowns post-retirement, this new system offers immense relief. They will no longer have to go through the hassle of transferring their PPOs or wait for pension delivery from a particular bank. In the future, the transition will move towards an Aadhaar-based Payment System (ABPS), further streamlining the process. As the CPPS rolls out, EPS pensioners can look forward to a more seamless and hassle-free experience, marking the beginning of a new chapter in pension disbursement across India.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 2, 2025

This decision means investors can continue to benefit from the current rates through the end of March 2025.advertisementCURRENT INTEREST RATES FOR POST OFFICE SCHEMESThe interest rates for the final quarter of FY 2024-25 have been confirmed as unchanged from the previous quarter, providing consistency for investors. The current rates for some popular small savings schemes are as follows: The interest rates for the final quarter of FY 2024-25 have been confirmed as unchanged from the previous quarter, providing consistency for investors.

The Sensex climbed 1.8% to end at 79,943.71, while the Nifty gained 1.9% to close at 24,188.65. Auto stocks led the rally following upbeat December sales data, with leading players like Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra reporting strong demand for SUVs and year-end discounts. IT stocks also advanced on optimistic brokerage views ahead of Q3 earnings. Satish Chandra Aluri of Lemonn Markets said, “Markets extended gains on improving risk appetite fuelled by Auto, IT, and Financials. Auto shares rallied after sales data allayed concerns over weakening demand, while IT benefited from positive revenue recovery expectations. Likely bargain hunting in quality stocks and anticipation of growth-oriented measures in the upcoming budget also boosted sentiment.” Financials contributed significantly, supported by strong deposit growth updates from banks. Santosh Meena of Swastika Investmart noted, “The market had been oversold for days, but auto sales beating expectations provided a much-needed trigger. Nifty not only crossed the 200-DMA but also surpassed the 50-DMA and 20-DMA, indicating a potential bullish reversal.” The broader market saw mixed action, with mid- and small-cap stocks underperforming the frontline indices. “Despite the strong movement in the Index, mid-caps and small-caps rose by only 1%. However, this could be an ideal time to accumulate value stocks with strong order books,” said VLA Ambala of Stock Market Today. On the technical front, analysts remain optimistic but cautious about a pullback. Aditya Gaggar of Progressive Shares commented, “The bulls dominated, helping Nifty break multiple resistance levels. While a pullback to test support at 24,000 is possible, the next leg of the rally could target 24,700-24,800.” As the markets gear up for Q3 earnings and the Union Budget, experts believe strong earnings delivery will be crucial for sustaining the rally.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

SHORT-TERM CHALLENGES FOR INDIASpeaking on the potential immediate challenges, Neelkanth Mishra outlined three critical fronts where Trump’s policies could impact India:Immigration policies: Mishra highlighted that Trump’s strong stance on immigration, particularly on H-1B visas, could disrupt the Indian IT sector, which heavily relies on these work permits to send professionals to the US.“We're already seeing that there is a lot of debate within the Republican establishment on what they mean by controlling immigration. Is it legal? Is it illegal? With H-1Bs, is it something bigger,” Mishra said. Trade tariffs: On the trade front, Trump’s threat of imposing reciprocal tariffs could significantly hit India’s exports. “The second front is, of course, trade, where he has threatened tariffs on everyone, including India, on the reciprocal tariffs. If that was to happen, it'd have a direct seven to eight billion dollar impact on our exports,” Mishra added.However, he suggested that these threats might serve as a starting point for negotiations rather than immediate actions.FII outflow: Mishra expressed concerns about the ripple effects of Trump’s likely extension of the 2017 tax cuts, which could worsen the US fiscal deficit and raise bond yields.""We've already seen the 10-year bond yields in the US starting to spike. And what that means is that the cost of capital for the rest of the world goes up,"" said the Chief Economist at Axis Bank. advertisementHe further added that emerging market equity investors are deserting India, which is a major concern. ""They're deserting all of emerging markets. In fact, the knee jerk reaction, the Pavlovian instinct for any emerging market investor and for right and understandable reasons is that when you're getting 5% yield on US government bonds, then why would you want to hold China, Brazil and India or other emerging market currencies,"" he said. Rupee at risk: Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist at Axis Bank also explained how the imposition of tariff could lead to unstable rupee and a currency war. “This would push up the global cost of capital, making borrowing more expensive for emerging markets like India,” he explained.

He said that as foreign equity investors retreat, India’s current account deficit will come under pressure, forcing the RBI to intervene more aggressively to stabilise the rupee.”These developments could also trigger a currency war, especially if China devalues the Chinese yuan (CNY) or renminbi (RMB) in response to US tariffs.advertisementA significant depreciation of the Chinese RMB could force the RBI to make tough decisions about the rupee, Mishra warned.MACROECONOMIC VOLATILITY LOOMSRathin Roy echoed Mishra’s concerns, adding that India’s limited role in global exports means that domestic fiscal policies will have a larger impact on the economy than Trump’s tariffs.“India accounts for just 2% of global exports,” Roy explained. “The government’s undershooting of its fiscal plans could pose a far greater risk to the economy than US tariffs.”Roy also highlighted the importance of a calibrated monetary and exchange rate policy. “There’s a fear that the RBI is following a nationalist policy of keeping the rupee artificially strong,” he said. “In these volatile conditions, a well-communicated approach to rupee depreciation could help mitigate investor concerns.”He criticised the lack of clarity in India’s monetary policies and called for better coordination between the RBI and the finance ministry to navigate the expected turbulence.“With the RBI, there is a clear and pleasant lack of clarity on the logic underlying its monetary policy and exchange rate actions.  And the more clarity we get in and the more forward guidance we give on how we are going to implement a policy that we publicly state, I think the more secure we will be in the next year,” Roy advised.advertisementThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the status quo on key interest rates and kept repo rates unchanged for the 11th consecutive time as the central bank’s focus remained on containing inflation.

In a post on X, Pai urged the government to prioritise middle-class taxpayers who are grappling with rising costs, inflation, and stagnant incomes. His wishlist for the upcoming Budget aims to ease financial burdens and stimulate economic activity.
 



 


advertisementPROPOSED TAX REFORMS Pai highlighted the sharp increase in individual tax collections, which rose from Rs 4.87 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs 10.45 lakh crore in FY24—a 114% jump in three years. He proposed new tax slabs with no tax for income up to Rs 5 lakh, 10% for Rs 5-10 lakh, 20% for Rs 10-20 lakh, and 30% for income above Rs 20 lakh. Pai highlighted the sharp increase in individual tax collections, which rose from Rs 4.87 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs 10.45 lakh crore in FY24—a 114% jump in three years. He proposed new tax slabs with no tax for income up to Rs 5 lakh, 10% for Rs 5-10 lakh, 20% for Rs 10-20 lakh, and 30% for income above Rs 20 lakh. He suggested removing most deductions, except under Sections 80D (health insurance) and 80G (charitable donations), and introducing these slabs as an optional scheme to replace the current complex structure. For senior citizens, Pai recommended taxing income above Rs 7.5 lakh for those over 60 and Rs 10 lakh for those over 70. He also advocated exempting individuals earning up to Rs 5 lakh from filing income tax returns unless they are claiming refunds.ADDRESSING TAX DISPUTES AND HOUSING LOAN CONCERNS Pai raised concerns over rising tax disputes, with pending amounts exceeding Rs 12.5 lakh crore. He urged the government to declare 2025-26 as the ‘Year of Tax Dispute Resolution’ and streamline processes within the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Additionally, he emphasised the need for housing loan reforms, as only 1.2 crore taxpayers benefit from deductions due to limited home loan uptake.RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS Calling for an end to ‘tax terrorism', Pai criticised the lack of relief for middle-class taxpayers, who shoulder the bulk of the tax burden. He highlighted that while over Rs 9 lakh crore in subsidies support the bottom 60% of the population, the middle class is often overlooked. Pai’s recommendations reflect the growing frustrations of India’s middle class, urging the government to deliver meaningful reforms. With economic pressures mounting, these measures could offer much-needed relief and restore confidence amongst taxpayers.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

Industry bodies, including the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), have shared their recommendations with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, advocating tax reforms to boost the ease of doing business and reduce complexity. Amongst the key proposals is streamlining the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) regimes to provide relief to businesses and taxpayers alike.advertisementSIMPLIFYING TDS-TCS RATESFICCI has proposed reducing the numerous TDS/TCS rates to a simplified two- or three-tier system, a move expected to minimise confusion and disputes over tax classifications. FICCI has proposed reducing the numerous TDS/TCS rates to a simplified two- or three-tier system, a move expected to minimise confusion and disputes over tax classifications. This would also improve compliance and reduce administrative burdens. A Deloitte survey found strong support amongst taxpayers for simpler Individual Tax Returns (ITRs), straightforward incentive calculations, and a unified TDS framework based on a ""one rate, one section"" principle. Additionally, the Income-Tax Policy Survey suggested eliminating Form 16A, as TDS details are already available in recipients' Form 26AS and Annual Information Statements (AIS). Such measures could significantly ease compliance and streamline processes for businesses and individuals.TDS-TCS REFORMS SO FAR In Budget 2024, some steps were taken toward simplifying the tax structure. The TDS rate on rents exceeding Rs 50,000 was reduced from 5% to 2%, and buyers of properties above Rs 50 lakh were required to deduct TDS only on the amount exceeding the threshold, regardless of the number of sellers involved. Recent changes also allow parents to claim TCS collected from a minor child’s income, making the process more family-friendly. From October 2024, employers will be required to factor in TDS/TCS deducted on non-salary income when calculating tax deductions on salaries, reducing double taxation. Updates to the TDS software, implemented in December 2024, now ensure accurate TDS calculations for Q4 of FY 2024-25.A STEP TOWARD TAXPAYER CONFIDENCE With the 2025 Budget on the horizon, stakeholders hope for bolder reforms to simplify the tax regime further. Streamlining TDS-TCS processes could enhance compliance, ease financial stress, and boost confidence amongst taxpayers, paving the way for a fairer and more efficient system.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

A recent report highlighted that the Gujarat State GST department has intensified its focus on business-to-consumer (B2C) sectors, aiming to close tax compliance gaps. Industries such as ice-cream parlours, salons, coaching classes, and mobile phone dealers are under the scanner for potential tax evasion and non-compliance. Recent raids across Gujarat exposed tax evasion worth Rs 20 crore, reported The Times of India. Officials revealed that while many registered traders underreport income, a large number of unregistered businesses exceed the GST registration threshold without complying. This raises an important question: can unregistered small businesses receive GST notices? Under the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017, GST authorities are empowered to scrutinise, audit, and assess businesses regardless of their registration status. Supreme Kothari, Partner at Economic Laws Practice, states: “GST laws allow authorities to issue notices to unregistered businesses whose turnover exceeds the prescribed threshold. Sections 65 and 67 enable audits, inspections, and searches.” The annual turnover threshold for GST registration is Rs 40 lakh for businesses supplying goods and Rs 20 lakh for service providers. Businesses below these limits are exempt, but exceeding them triggers registration and compliance requirements. The department employs several methods to monitor unregistered dealers, including analyzing e-way bills, tracking transactions in personal accounts, and identifying income discrepancies. SR Patnaik, Partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, explains: “While issuing notices to small businesses is legally valid, enforcement may depend on socio-economic and political factors.” GST compliance can be challenging for small businesses that lack organized operations. Record-keeping, filing returns, and hiring professionals can be resource-intensive. However, registered businesses gain access to input tax credits, reducing overall costs over time. Umesh Goel, Partner at Ved Jain & Associates, suggests: “Small businesses can leverage schemes like the composition scheme, which simplifies compliance processes.” Experts recommend that small businesses monitor their turnover, maintain accurate records, and register promptly once thresholds are crossed. Proactive compliance is essential, as the GST department can cross-reference bank transactions and other data sources to detect non-compliance. As the tax net expands, awareness and adherence to GST regulations are critical for small businesses. With proper guidance and compliance, businesses can benefit from a structured tax framework while avoiding penalties and scrutiny.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

As markets open today, several companies such as Zee, DMart, IRFC, ITC, Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp are expected to grab attention due to key updates. Zee Entertainment Enterprises is under focus after Sebi dismissed settlement applications filed by the company and its Managing Director, Punit Goenka.

Domestic sales were down 22% year-on-year, which could weigh on the stock.

This medication is used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients, and this development is expected to enhance Biocon’s global footprint.

Discussions regarding his exit have reportedly taken place with investors amid the company’s ongoing financial struggles. The Bengaluru-based quick commerce platform has faced a challenging period over the last 12–18 months, marked by cash flow issues and difficulties in raising fresh funds. These challenges come as rivals like Zomato’s Blinkit, Swiggy’s Instamart, and Zepto continue to grow rapidly, and the entry of e-commerce giants such as Flipkart, Amazon, further intensifying competition in the quick commerce sector.  According to sources cited in the report, Biswas has expressed interest in moving on from Dunzo, though a consensus among stakeholders is yet to be reached. Some investors are reportedly open to the idea, considering the company’s current state. “There have been talks from him (Kabeer) about moving on from Dunzo, and a consensus needs to be reached. Some investors have not opposed the idea given the state of affairs at the firm,” said a person familiar with the matter. “There have been talks from him (Kabeer) about moving on from Dunzo, and a consensus needs to be reached. Some investors have not opposed the idea given the state of affairs at the firm” one person familiar with the matter said as quoted in the report. Another source mentioned in the report said that discussions around what happens to Biswas’s remaining stake in the company are ongoing. However, Reliance Retail, which holds a 25.8% stake in Dunzo, has not yet approved the proposal but continues to engage in discussions. Dunzo, once a pioneer in hyperlocal deliveries, has raised over $450 million in funding, including debt. Its most significant investment came from Reliance Retail in January 2022, when the conglomerate invested Rs 200 crore as part of a Rs 240 crore funding round. At the time, Reliance’s backing was seen as a strong endorsement of both Dunzo and the quick commerce sector. Google, another key investor, owns just under 20% of the company. Despite these investments, Dunzo has faced a severe cash crunch since 2023. The company has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs and salary delays as it scaled back operations significantly. While Dunzo managed to secure debt financing to keep its daily operations afloat, creditors have since taken the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) over unpaid dues. “They are facilitating some courier delivery services, but nothing much is left there anymore,” said one of the sources cited in the report. The situation has also prompted former Dunzo executives to explore new ventures in the quick commerce space, as the company’s dominance in the sector diminishes. The future of Biswas’s role at Dunzo, along with the direction the company will take, is now largely dependent on Reliance Retail’s decision. While neither Reliance Retail nor Biswas has confirmed the developments, the report suggests that some shareholders, who have already written off their investments in Dunzo, are willing to allow Biswas to move on.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 3, 2025

Morgan Stanley retained its bearish view, pointing out that the growth rate is below DMart’s historical 20% top-line growth. However, the brokerage acknowledged that standalone Q3 revenue was 1% higher than its expectations. The growth was attributed to a 12% increase in store count, while the implied same-store sales growth (SSSG) was around 5.5%, exceeding its estimate of 4%. Morgan Stanley reiterated a target price of Rs 3,702 per share, indicating a modest upside of 4%. Macquarie echoed concerns about competitive pressures from the quick commerce sector, which it believes are weighing on DMart’s growth. The brokerage also noted that Q3 typically sees an improvement in gross margins due to a better product mix. While DMart’s addition of 10 stores during the quarter was in line with estimates, Macquarie continues to adopt a cautious stance. On the other hand, Hong Kong-based CLSA remains optimistic about Avenue Supermarts’ performance. The brokerage has maintained its “outperform” rating, with a target price of Rs 5,360 per share, suggesting a 50% upside. CLSA highlighted that DMart’s standalone revenue exceeded its expectations and reiterated confidence in the company’s strategy of focusing on private labels. These in-house brands are seen as a key factor in countering competition and boosting profitability. In Q2FY25, Avenue Supermarts reported a net profit of Rs 659.6 crore, a 5.8% increase compared to Rs 623.6 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter rose 14.4% year-on-year to Rs 14,444.5 crore, up from Rs 12,624.4 crore.

While much attention is often directed towards the salaried class, senior citizens face unique financial challenges that demand attention. With rising medical expenses and inflation eating into their savings, targeted tax benefits and simplified processes could significantly ease their burden. Here are five potential measures that could make a meaningful difference for senior citizens.advertisementEASIER TAX FILING PROCESSES Senior citizens aged 75 and above currently enjoy exemptions from filing income-tax returns if their income comes solely from pensions and interest from specific banks. Lowering the age threshold for this exemption and introducing simplified tax return forms for those with diverse income sources would reduce compliance complexities.INCREASED TAX EXEMPTION LIMITS The basic exemption limit for senior citizens has remained unchanged for some time. Increasing these limits under the newer tax regime could provide significant relief and encourage more seniors to adopt the simplified tax framework, ensuring better financial security.ADJUSTED TDS THRESHOLDS Banks and financial institutions deduct tax at source on interest income above a certain limit. Aligning this threshold with basic exemption limits would help reduce unnecessary deductions and the need for filing refunds, easing the financial strain on seniors.ENHANCED SAVINGS SCHEME BENEFITS Interest earned from senior citizens’ savings schemes and post-office savings accounts forms a critical part of their income. Increasing tax exemptions on these sources would directly alleviate financial stress, providing much-needed relief to this demographic.BETTER DEDUCTIONS FOR MEDICAL COSTS Healthcare expenses form a significant portion of senior citizens’ spending. By enhancing deductions for health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses, the Budget could address this concern, ensuring seniors have access to necessary medical care without undue financial strain. The Union Budget 2025 offers a crucial opportunity to address senior citizens’ financial needs. By introducing higher exemptions, streamlined compliance processes, and targeted tax benefits, the government can provide much-needed relief to ensure a secure and dignified life for India’s elderly population.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Trending Reel

The stock, which plunged 20% in the previous session, fell another 16% to touch an intraday low of Rs 207.60 before recovering slightly to trade 8% lower at Rs 228.10 around 12 pm. The steep decline in Jai Corp’s share price over two sessions stems from a significant capital reduction proposal involving Urban Infrastructure Holdings Private Limited (UIHPL), where Jai Corp holds a 32% equity stake. On Thursday, the company informed stock exchanges that UIHPL plans to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to seek shareholder approval for the proposed capital reduction. The move is subject to clearance from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and other regulatory bodies. Once approved, Jai Corp is expected to receive approximately Rs 364 crore from the process. The announcement follows a recent transaction involving Dronagiri Infrastructure Private Limited (DIPL), a subsidiary of UIHPL. DIPL sold a 74% equity stake in Navi Mumbai IIA Private Limited to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) for Rs 1,628.03 crore, with the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) retaining a 26% stake. This deal materialised after CIDCO waived its rights of first refusal earlier in December. As part of the capital reduction process, UIHPL is set to receive at least Rs 1,492.50 crore from DIPL, a figure that may increase with interest earnings on surplus funds. Additionally, UIHPL anticipates Rs 682 crore from redeeming optionally fully convertible debentures in Vinamra Universal Traders Private Limited, bringing the total funds to a minimum of Rs 3,772 crore. UIHPL plans to reduce 99.76% of its share capital, comprising equity and fully compulsorily convertible preference shares, distributing Rs 3,746.87 crore proportionately among its shareholders. This restructuring has raised investor concerns, leading to heightened selling pressure on Jai Corp shares, which have plunged nearly 27% in just three trading sessions.

Filing income tax returns, regardless of liability, helps create a documented financial history. This record becomes invaluable when applying for loans or credit products in the future.SET CLEAR INVESTMENT GOALS Every investment should have a defined objective. Whether it’s buying a car, saving for a home, or building a retirement corpus, align your investments with your targets. Opt for instruments that offer both tax benefits and potential returns to maximise value.STAY PROACTIVE IN TAX PLANNING Avoid the last-minute scramble by starting your tax planning early in the financial year. This approach gives you ample time to explore suitable options and make informed decisions. Timely filing of income tax returns is equally important to avoid penalties and ensure compliance. Tax-saving is more than a compliance exercise; it’s an opportunity to secure your financial future.

Here are three key factors contributing to today’s decline:IT AND FINANCIAL STOCKS DIP After rallying strongly in the previous session, IT and financial stocks faced significant profit booking in early trade on Friday. Market experts attributed the dip to investor caution ahead of the corporate earnings season, which typically brings heightened market fluctuations. The Nifty IT index plunged nearly 2%, making it the biggest loser among sectoral indices. Similarly, the Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services indices fell by almost 1% each, dragging down the broader market. This retreat followed a robust performance in the previous session, where the Nifty IT and Nifty Financial indices rose by 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Aditya Gaggar, Director at Progressive Shares, had forecasted a pullback in IT stocks and the benchmarks following the sharp rally, cautioning investors against over-optimism.DECLINE IN HDFC BANK, ICICI BANK AND TCS  Declines in heavyweight stocks exacerbated the fall in major indices. Shares of HDFC Bank, Infosys, TCS, and ICICI Bank all fell by over 1% during the session. Other notable losers included Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp, and Cipla. These large-cap stocks, which hold significant weight in the indices, were critical in dragging down the market, indicating a broader sell-off among blue-chip companies.Q3 EARNINGS ANXIETY Growing concerns over the upcoming Q3 corporate earnings season further dampened investor sentiment. Following a weak performance in the second quarter, analysts had highlighted that the Q3 results could set the tone for the market in the coming months. Although there is optimism that the Q3 earnings may show improvement, concerns persist that an earnings slowdown could extend for another couple of quarters. Analysts also pointed out that the trajectory of the stock market will likely hinge on announcements in the Union Budget 2025. A potential increase in government capital expenditure could drive new orders for companies, bolstering their earnings and improving stock performance over time. Today’s market decline underscores the heightened uncertainty and cautious sentiment among investors. As the corporate earnings season approaches and the Union Budget draws nearer, market participants will be closely watching for signs of stability and growth. For now, volatility continues to dominate the Indian stock market.

Tata Motors market capitalisation stood at Rs 2,93,201.60 crore. Despite today’s rise, the stock is below its 52-week high of Rs 1,179.05, recorded on July 30, 2024. Over the past five trading sessions, Tata Motors has gained more than 6%. However, the stock has seen a decline of 18.36% in the last six months. In the long term, Tata Motors has delivered an impressive return of 316.91% over the last five years.  The rise in Tata Motors’ share price on Friday marked its fourth consecutive session of gains. This momentum was partly influenced by global brokerage firm CLSA, which added Tata Motors to its India focus portfolio. CLSA noted that the stock’s 35% drop from its peak has already factored in potential risks, including a slowdown in the commercial vehicle segment and challenges in its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) portfolio.BROKERAGE VIEWS Several brokerages have shared their views on Tata Motors, reflecting a mix of optimism and cautiousness. Nomura India: The brokerage has set a target price of Rs 990, suggesting a positive outlook for the stock. DAM Capital: It maintains a ‘buy’ call with a target price of Rs 870. The firm expects JLR’s volumes to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% between FY2025 and FY2027. However, DAM Capital’s bear case scenario targets a lower price of Rs 675, indicating a potential correction of 9% from Thursday’s closing price. Sharekhan: The firm has a bullish price target of Rs 1,099, citing expectations of continued improvement in JLR, passenger vehicle (PV), and commercial vehicle (CV) businesses, along with reduced automotive debt. Sharekhan noted that the stock trades at a P/E multiple of 12.2x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.3x for its FY2027 estimates. LKP Securities: The brokerage considers Tata Motors a ‘value buy’ at current levels. It has a price target of Rs 970, citing recovery in domestic CV demand and the impact of recent product launches. LKP also highlighted the stock’s correction of approximately 40% from its 52-week high, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

With a slowing GDP and rising inflation, all eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to deliver bold strategies that will address these challenges and steer the country towards sustainable growth. The upcoming Budget is crucial, not just for long-term economic development, but for immediate relief to struggling sectors. Here's a look at the five key expectations from Budget 2025.advertisementTAX RELIEF FOR INDIVIDUALS A significant expectation is income tax relief to boost disposable income. Proposals include raising the exemption limit for individuals, which would encourage higher consumption and stimulate economic activity. Such a measure could provide immediate relief to the middle class, particularly as inflation and living costs continue to rise.REDUCTION IN EXCISE DUTY ON FUEL Despite global crude prices dropping, fuel prices have not decreased due to high excise duties. Industry experts believe that lowering these duties could alleviate inflationary pressures, increase disposable income, and improve consumption, particularly in lower-income households. This could significantly reduce the financial burden on the public.SUPPORT FOR EMPLOYMENT-INTENSIVE SECTORS To address unemployment, there’s a push to focus on employment-heavy industries such as garments, footwear, tourism, and MSMEs. By stimulating growth in these sectors, the government could generate jobs, boost domestic production, and position India as a stronger player in global markets.BOOSTING RURAL CONSUMPTION AND FOOD SECURITY With rural areas showing signs of recovery, boosting rural consumption remains a priority. Proposals include increasing daily wages under employment schemes, enhancing direct benefit transfers, and offering consumption vouchers for low-income families to increase purchasing power and demand in rural markets.ADDRESSING DUMPING BY CHINA China’s practice of dumping excess goods in the global market has hurt Indian industries. Industry bodies are calling for protective measures to safeguard domestic businesses from unfair competition, ensuring that local industries can thrive without external distortions. With India eagerly awaiting Budget 2025, these proposed measures have the potential to boost economic growth, ease inflation, and create jobs. Bold interventions in key areas could help India overcome its current economic challenges and pave the way for a more prosperous future.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

The rally can be attributed to global policy measures aimed at economic revival, which investors believe could boost fuel demand and enhance earnings for upstream oil companies. Oil India’s stock climbed 4.88% to Rs 486.15 on the BSE at 12:33 pm, while ONGC’s shares advanced 4.67% to Rs 257.50. The surge in ONGC’s share price was further supported by a report from Jefferies, which set a target price of Rs 375, arguing that the recent 30% correction in ONGC’s stock price over the past three months appears excessive. The report highlighted that recent regulatory developments could drive profitability improvements. Despite the recent rally, upstream companies are expected to post subdued operating profits in Q3 due to a decline in net crude realisations. According to YES Securities, ONGC’s oil production may fall 4.7% year-on-year (YoY) in Q3, though gas production is likely to remain flat. Similarly, Oil India’s oil production is expected to be flat YoY, while gas production could see a marginal increase of 0.5% YoY. For the December quarter, YES Securities projects a net crude oil realisation of $73.2 per barrel for ONGC and $73.7 per barrel for Oil India. It also anticipates APM gas realisation at $6.5 per mmBtu for both companies. ONGC’s gas volumes are expected to remain flat YoY but rise 1.2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), while Oil India’s gas volumes may grow 0.5% YoY and 3.4% QoQ. However, the outlook for the current quarter appears brighter. Brent crude futures edged up 22 cents to $76.15 per barrel, marking their highest close since late October. Similarly, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 25 cents to $73.38 per barrel, hitting a two-month high. YES Securities noted that the oil and gas sector’s core performance in Q3FY25 could be mixed, with oil marketing companies and refiners potentially benefitting from stronger gross refining margins and improved marketing profits.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 3, 2025

The stock declined 4.44% to trade at Rs 547 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at Rs 1:40 pm after hitting an intraday low of Rs 548. In an exchange filing, the company noted, “Pursuant to Regulation 42 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rules made thereunder, the Company has fixed Friday, January 03, 2025, as the ‘Record Date’ for determining the eligibility of Shareholders entitled for issuance of Bonus Equity Shares in the proportion of 1 (One) Equity Share for every 2 (Two) existing Equity Shares."" The sharp 36% drop shown on some trading apps likely stems from a recalibration of the stock price post-bonus issue. This adjustment accounts for the increased number of outstanding shares while keeping the company’s overall market capitalisation unchanged. Such price corrections are standard following bonus issues and do not signal any fundamental shift in the company’s financial position. The record date is crucial as it determines which shareholders qualify for the bonus shares. To be eligible, investors must own the stock at least one day before the ex-date since trades settle on a T+1 basis. Shares bought on the ex-date do not qualify for dividends, splits, or bonus issues. This marks the company’s third bonus share issuance in recent years. KPI Green Energy issued bonus shares in a 1:2 ratio in 2024 and a 1:1 ratio in 2023, according to Trendlyne.

Taxpayers are eagerly awaiting potential changes to ease their financial burden, especially as inflation has raised the cost of living. The government is expected to focus on boosting consumption, given the low GDP for the second quarter, which could lead to tax relief measures aimed at increasing disposable income for salaried taxpayers. The new tax regime is expected to take centre stage in the budget, with reforms designed to make it a more attractive alternative to the traditional tax structure.POSSIBLE REFORMS IN THE NEW TAX REGIME The upcoming budget could include several changes to the new tax regime to simplify compliance and reduce the tax burden for individual taxpayers. According to tax experts, one significant proposal is raising the income exemption threshold from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh or higher. There is also speculation about increasing the standard deduction for salaried individuals from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Tushar Kumar, an advocate at the Supreme Court of India, said, “The government might rationalise income tax slabs or reduce tax rates for middle-income earners. This would boost disposable income and encourage economic activity. Introducing deductions for contributions to the National Pension Scheme (NPS) or interest on housing loans could incentivise taxpayers further."" Additionally, family-centric tax reliefs, such as deductions for educational expenses or medical insurance premiums, might be introduced. The government is also considering recalibrating concessional tax rates for income brackets between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 15 lakh. This could provide significant relief to middle-income taxpayers and encourage more people to switch to the new regime. Although the focus is on modernising the new tax regime, the old tax structure is unlikely to be overlooked. Many taxpayers still prefer the traditional system due to its established deductions and exemptions. Experts suggest that the government could increase the Section 80C deduction limit from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh and raise the ceiling on housing loan interest deductions under Section 24(b) from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. Additional changes might include higher deductions under Section 80D for medical insurance premiums and more relief for individuals with dependents who have disabilities under Section 80DD. These measures would ensure that the old tax regime remains a viable option for those who benefit from its provisions. Some experts believe the new tax regime is unlikely to introduce many additional deductions, as it aims to keep taxation straightforward. Sudhir Kaushik, Co-Founder and CEO of Taxspanner, said, “The focus is on offering straightforward taxation with reduced rates. Taxpayers who prioritise deductions for savings or expenses may prefer the old tax regime.” Others are optimistic about provisions that could benefit specific sectors. Kunal Savani, Partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said, “While the new tax regime offers broader slabs, it comes with restrictive deductions by default. However, we can expect welcoming provisions, especially for the real estate segment, which is growing significantly. This could include an increase in home loan deductions and a rationalisation of House Rent Allowance (HRA).”Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) classifies these as prepaid instruments, and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has clarified their treatment under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework. Here’s a breakdown of how GST applies to vouchers, along with insights for businesses.advertisementPREPAID VOUCHERS: TREATED AS ‘MONEY’Prepaid vouchers, including gift cards and digital wallets, are considered ‘money’ under the GST framework. Prepaid vouchers, including gift cards and digital wallets, are considered ‘money’ under the GST framework. Transactions involving these instruments are not treated as the supply of goods or services. Instead, they are viewed as a method of payment, similar to cash, and therefore, exempt from GST.NON-PREPAID VOUCHERS: ACTIONABLE CLAIMS Non-prepaid vouchers, which allow holders to redeem specific goods or services, are classified as ‘actionable claims.’ These transactions are also excluded from GST since they do not involve the supply of goods or services.GST ON VOUCHER TRANSACTIONS While the vouchers themselves are not subject to GST, the goods or services redeemed using them may attract GST. For instance, if a customer uses a Rs 10,000 voucher to purchase goods, GST applies to the purchased items, not the voucher.VOUCHER DISTRIBUTION MODELS AND GST Principal-to-Principal Basis:
Distributors buying vouchers at discounted rates and reselling them are not subject to GST since these transactions do not qualify as the supply of goods or services. Commission/Fee Basis:
Distributors working on behalf of issuers and earning commissions for marketing or support services must pay GST on their service fees.UNUSED VOUCHERS AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES If vouchers expire unused, no supply of goods or services occurs, exempting them from GST. However, distributors offering additional services like advertising or customer support to voucher issuers must pay GST on their service fees. The CBIC's clarifications simplify voucher taxation but require businesses to understand their specific scenarios. While vouchers themselves don’t trigger GST, commissions and related services do. Upcoming amendments to the GST framework may provide further clarity, ensuring businesses remain compliant and avoid ambiguities.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Trending Reel

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently met with representatives from the financial sector to deliberate on tax incentives for fixed deposits (FDs), amongst other investment tools. Here's a closer look at the discussions and proposals shaping this narrative.advertisementTAX RELIEF FOR FIXED DEPOSITSRepresentatives from banks and capital markets proposed treating FD interest as distinct from regular income tax or linking it to long-term capital gains tax. Representatives from banks and capital markets proposed treating FD interest as distinct from regular income tax or linking it to long-term capital gains tax. Such measures could make FDs more attractive, addressing declining deposit growth and encouraging middle-class savings. Currently, FD interest is taxed as regular income, which may deter potential investors.BOLSTERING CAPITAL MARKETS Radhika Gupta, CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund, emphasised the need for greater efficiency and inclusivity in capital markets. She proposed incentives for long-term savings through bonds and equity investments, aligning with the government's broader goals of financial inclusion.TAXATION AND COMPLIANCE FOR FDs Interest earned on FDs is categorised as ""Income from Other Sources"" under the Income Tax Act and taxed according to individual tax slabs. To simplify tax compliance, individuals should gather essential documents like interest certificates and Form 26AS. Submitting Form 15G or 15H at the start of the financial year can help eligible individuals and senior citizens avoid Tax Deducted at Source (TDS).MUTUAL FUNDS: A GROWING CONTENDER While FDs remain a staple for household savings, their dominance is waning. Nearly 15% of household savings still flow into FDs, but mutual funds and equities are gaining ground. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has highlighted the shift towards these avenues, urging banks to innovate and bridge the gap between credit and deposit growth. Budget 2025 presents an opportunity to balance traditional and modern savings instruments. By introducing tax incentives for FDs and enhancing capital market inclusivity, the government can bolster middle-class savings while addressing broader economic goals. A reimagined framework for savings could provide the much-needed impetus for both individuals and the financial sector.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

The new rule, the company said, will initially be applicable only in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut. ""We are committed to upholding safe and responsible hospitality practices. While respecting personal freedoms, we must also collaborate with local communities and law enforcement to ensure a harmonious operating environment,"" Pawas Sharma, Region Head, OYO North India said.  The updated guidelines, which will immediately affect OYO's partner hotels in Meerut, require all married couples to provide valid proof of relationship during check-in, including for online bookings.  The company also stated that unmarried couples may be denied accommodation, with discretion granted to hotel partners to decline bookings based on local social norms. The move, according to OYO, is part of a broader initiative to address community feedback and reshape its image as a safe and trusted accommodation provider for families, businessmen, students, religious pilgrims, and solo travellers. OYO's decision followed repeated appeals from civil society groups, particularly in Meerut, urging stricter regulations against stays by unmarried couples. Similar petitions have emerged from residents in other cities, prompting the firm to pilot the policy in Meerut and considering expanding it to other locations based on feedback. Alongside the revised policy, OYO has introduced several nationwide initiatives, including hosting joint seminars with the police and hotel partners on safe hospitality practices, blacklisting hotels found engaging in activities deemed immoral and taking action against unauthorised establishments misusing OYO branding.

Check unclaimed deposits via UDGAM portalRBI (Reerve Bank of India) launched the Unclaimed Deposits – Gateway to Access Information (UDGAM) portal in August 2023. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/what-are-unclaimed-deposits-bank-owe-you-money-check-via-udgam-portal-rbi-2660211-2025-01-06,"We’ve all had that delightful moment when we find a Rs 500 note tucked away in an old jacket or a forgotten pair of jeans. It feels like an unexpected bonus, doesn’t it? Now, imagine if that forgotten money wasn’t just a few hundred rupees, but potentially thousands or even lakhs lying idle in a bank account. That’s exactly what unclaimed deposits are – your money, sitting unnoticed. Unclaimed deposits amounting to a staggering Rs 78,213 crore are lying idle in various banks across the country as of March 2024, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). These funds, transferred to the Depositors' Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF), earn a simple interest of only 3% per annum, reducing the potential returns for depositors. To address this issue and make it easier for individuals to access their unclaimed funds, the RBI launched the Unclaimed Deposits – Gateway to Access Information (UDGAM) portal in August 2023. The platform helps users track and consolidate unclaimed deposits across different banks in one place.WHAT ARE UNCLAIMED DEPOSITS? Unclaimed deposits are funds lying in bank accounts that have been inactive for a long period. Here’s how this happens: Dormant accounts: Savings or current accounts become inactive if there is no activity for two years. Similarly, fixed and recurring deposits are considered dormant if not claimed within two years after maturity. Unclaimed deposits: If these accounts remain untouched for another eight years, the money is transferred to the DEAF, making them unclaimed deposits. These deposits often occur due to forgotten accounts, unclaimed fixed deposits, or the account holder's demise without proper succession planning.HOW UDGAM PORTAL HELPS The UDGAM portal is a one-stop platform developed by the RBI in collaboration with Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt Ltd (ReBIT), Indian Financial Technology & Allied Services (IFTAS), and participating banks. It simplifies the process of finding unclaimed deposits across multiple banks. Currently, 30 banks are part of the portal, representing 90% of the total unclaimed deposits in terms of value. Banks already on the platform include State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, South Indian Bank, Central Bank of India, Dhanlaxmi Bank, DBS Bank India, and CitiBank N.A. The remaining banks were added in phases, with full integration completed by October 15, 2023.HOW TO REGISTER ON THE UDGAM PORTAL To search for unclaimed deposits, users need to register on the UDGAM portal by following these steps: Visit the UDGAM Portal: Access the official website. Register an account: Enter your mobile number, name, password, and CAPTCHA code. Submit the details. An OTP will be sent to your mobile number for verification. Log In: Use your mobile number and password to log in. Enter another OTP sent to your mobile number. Search for deposits: Provide details such as the account holder’s name and the bank name(s). Include at least one of these search criteria: PAN, Voter ID, Driving Licence Number, Passport Number, or Date of Birth. Click ""Search"" to view your unclaimed deposits. The RBI launched UDGAM to tackle the growing trend of unclaimed deposits and ensure that rightful owners or their legal heirs can reclaim their money. Public awareness campaigns are being conducted to encourage people to check and claim their funds through this portal. Once you find unclaimed deposits through UDGAM, you can approach the respective bank to either reactivate the dormant account or claim the funds. The process may require submitting documents such as ID proof, proof of account ownership, and, in some cases, succession certificates.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

45cce80d-836f-424c-a398-7acb938704bc,Explained: Why ITC share price fell by 6% todayA special pre-open session was conducted on the stock exchanges between 9:00 AM and 9:45 AM to determine ITC Hotels' share price.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/itc-share-price-hotel-business-demerger-special-pre-opening-session-key-details-review-stmp-2660219-2025-01-06,"ITC share price saw a sharp drop of nearly 6% in Monday's early trading, hitting a low of Rs 455. The fall occurred during the price discovery process for ITC Hotels, the soon-to-be-listed demerged hotels business of ITC. A special pre-open session was conducted on the stock exchanges between 9:00 AM and 9:45 AM to determine ITC Hotels' share price. Following this, normal trading in ITC shares resumed at 10:00 AM. Eligible ITC shareholders will receive one ITC Hotels share for every 10 ITC shares they hold. During the pre-open session, ITC shares settled at Rs 455 on the BSE and Rs 455.60 on the NSE, compared to the previous closing prices of Rs 482 and Rs 481.60, respectively. The difference between ITC's closing price on Friday (January 3) and its price during the special session determines the value of ITC Hotels' shares. Based on this, ITC Hotels' share price was discovered at Rs 27 per share on the BSE and Rs 26 per share on the NSE. ITC Hotels will officially list on the stock exchanges in February 2024. Until then, it will appear as a dummy ticker on market indices, with no trading activity allowed. Once listed, the stock will trade independently, and ITC Hotels will be removed from NSE and BSE indices based on its last traded price. However, if the stock hits circuit limits on listing, its exclusion will be delayed.PRICE ESTIMATES FOR ITC HOTELS Market analysts predict that ITC Hotels' share price will likely be in the range of Rs 150 to Rs 175 per share after full trading begins. Systematix, a financial research firm, estimates the stock's value at Rs 150 per share, applying a 25-times EV/EBITDA multiple for FY26 earnings. It notes that ITC Hotels is India’s second-largest hotel chain, operating 140 properties across the country. Systematix also highlights the financials of ITC Hotels. The business accounts for 4% of ITC’s total revenues, 3% of its EBIT, and 10% of its capital employed. Post-demerger, ITC’s return on capital employed (ROCE) is expected to improve from 40% to 43%. ITC Hotels will begin operations as a standalone company with Rs 1,500 crore in cash and no debt. It plans to invest 8-10% of its annual sales in renovations, ongoing projects, and new developments. ITC will continue to hold a 40% stake in ITC Hotels, while the remaining 60% will be distributed among ITC’s shareholders. Analysts have a neutral to positive outlook on ITC shares post-demerger, as the separation allows the conglomerate to focus on its core businesses, including FMCG and tobacco. According to Nuvama’s FMCG research team, the adjustment in ITC’s stock price due to the demerger is expected to be Rs 18 per share. This aligns with market participants’ views that ITC Hotels’ initial trading price will be in the Rs 150-175 range.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

The proposals aim to capitalise on India’s demographic dividend and strengthen its employment ecosystem.NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT POLICY CII recommends a comprehensive National Employment Policy to integrate existing employment schemes from various ministries and states. This policy would streamline efforts and centralise data through a single employment portal, the National Career Service (NCS).advertisementDATA-DRIVEN EMPLOYMENT INSIGHTS To improve job creation strategies, CII suggests developing a Universal Labour Information Management System (ULIMS) under NCS. This system would provide insights into job opportunities, skills demand, and training programs, aligning them with market needs.INCENTIVES FOR HIRING CII proposes replacing section 80JJAA with a new tax provision to encourage businesses to hire. Employers could avail deductions for new employees, capped at Rs 1 lakh per month for the first three years, fostering job creation.BOOSTING LABOUR-INTENSIVE SECTORS Focused support for employment-heavy sectors like construction, textiles, and tourism is crucial. Synchronising tariff structures, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), and employment-linked schemes can enhance exports and job opportunities.EMPOWERING RURAL YOUTH A rural internship program for college graduates could strengthen government initiatives in rural areas, utilising young talent to address workforce gaps.INCREASING FEMALE WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION CII emphasises the need for dormitories funded by CSR, crèches in industrial clusters, and formalisation of the care economy. These initiatives, coupled with gender-sensitive employment policies, aim to economically empower women.TAPPING GLOBAL JOB MARKETS CII advocates for an International Mobility Authority under the Ministry of External Affairs to facilitate overseas job opportunities for Indian youth. Programs focusing on global skillsets, cultural training, and foreign languages would enhance employability abroad. CII’s recommendations aim to create a dynamic employment landscape, fostering inclusivity and productivity. If implemented, these measures could unlock India’s potential as a global economic powerhouse.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Tune InMust Watch

With rising living costs and limited disposable income, expectations from the government are higher than ever. Will this budget bring much-needed relief to ease their financial burdens?TAX RELIEF: THE BIGGEST EXPECTATION One of the foremost demands of the middle class is a reduction in tax liabilities. Simplified tax structures and higher exemptions could go a long way in improving disposable incomes. The salaried class also hopes for increased standard deductions to address rising costs, including healthcare and education expenses.AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INTEREST RELIEF The dream of owning a home remains a challenge for many middle-class families due to high property prices and loan interest rates. Measures like subsidies on housing loans or incentives for first-time homebuyers could make this dream more achievable.CUSHIONING THE IMPACT OF INFLATION Inflation has consistently chipped away at middle-class incomes. Budget 2025 could offer relief through subsidies on essential commodities or measures to stabilise fuel and utility prices. A more robust mechanism to control inflation could significantly ease monthly financial pressures.EMPOWERING THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES While tax relief is vital, long-term financial stability stems from consistent income growth. Policies aimed at boosting job creation, skill development, and upskilling initiatives would empower the middle class to adapt to a rapidly changing economy.RETIREMENT, HEALTHCARE, AND WELFARE PRIORITIES Past budgets have seen incremental changes, but a significant overhaul remains elusive. This year, taxpayers are keen to see whether longstanding demands for more comprehensive reforms will be addressed. Provisions supporting retirement planning, healthcare expenses, and family welfare are high on the wish list.FOCUS ON WORK-LIFE DYNAMICS There’s also hope for policies that cater to the evolving work environment, such as deductions for remote work expenses or incentives for skill development. The salaried class looks forward to tax provisions that align with contemporary needs, fostering both personal and professional growth. Will Budget 2025 meet these expectations or fall short?

Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted, “The market is likely to be influenced by the negative factors impacting FII flows and some positive domestic factors which can support the market.”WEAK GLOBAL CUES Global economic conditions remain unfavourable, with a high dollar index at 109 and the 10-year US bond yield at 4.62%. Dr. Vijayakumar explained, “The FIIs are likely to continue selling till the yields decline and the dollar stabilises.” These global challenges are weighing heavily on Indian markets.SECTORAL SELL-OFFSectoral indices on the Nifty were deep in the red, with Nifty PSU Bank falling 3.63%. Nifty Metal and Realty also saw sharp declines, dropping 2.98% and 2.77%, respectively. Broader indices, including Nifty Smallcap100, took a heavy hit as selling pressure mounted across the board.WEAK Q3 BUSINESS UPDATES Concerns over weak business updates from key sectors, particularly banking and FMCG, have further dampened sentiment. Chowdhury noted, “Markets have been under pressure primarily due to weak business updates by companies, especially banks and some FMCG stocks.”FPI SELLING AND RISING DOLLAR 
Persistent FPI selling and a strengthening dollar have exacerbated the market downturn. Manish Jain, Director at Mirae Asset Capital Markets, highlighted the challenges: “The government’s capex spending remains elusive, while depreciation of the Rupee has intensified, and a revival in consumption is still not evident. The market is waiting for strong positive triggers which are still missing.”VIRUS SCARE Last but not least, the discovery of two HMPV cases in Bengaluru sparked panic among investors. Although the virus is not expected to have the same impact as Covid-19, it led to a knee-jerk reaction in the markets. Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at StoxBox, remarked, “Market sentiment may have turned a little sour due to initial HMPV cases found in India, but its impact may be limited as the fatality seems to be lower compared to the Covid virus.” With corporate earnings, the upcoming budget, and global trade policies on the horizon, market volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term.

His untimely death was confirmed by the company in an official statement. ""It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Mr. Amit Banerji, our Founder, Chairman, and CEO. His impact on the company, its people and the industry will be lasting, and he will be profoundly missed by his family, friends and partners,"" the statement read. Banerji, aged 44, was a seasoned professional with vast experience in the technology and real estate sectors. Before founding Table Space in 2017, he worked at Accenture for over 13 years, leaving as its managing director of corporate real estate in India. He co-founded Table Space alongside Karan Chopra, with a vision to provide innovative and flexible workspace solutions. Under Banerji's leadership, Table Space grew rapidly, with Banerji playing a pivotal role in business planning, negotiations, and asset management. The company, aiming for a valuation of $2.5 billion in its upcoming IPO, raised around $330 million in several funding rounds, including a significant commitment from Hillhouse Capital. As of FY24, Table Space reported a 35% increase in revenue, with a notable rise in both occupancy rates and leasable areas. Despite this significant growth, the company will undoubtedly feel the impact of Banerji's loss as it moves forward with plans for its IPO. Banerji’s untimely death joins a tragic trend of premature losses in the entrepreneurial world, with Rohan Malhotra, co-founder of Good Capital, passing away at 44 last year, Ambareesh Murty, co-founder of Pepperfry, at 51 in 2023, and Rohan Mirchandani, co-founder of Epigamia, who also died of a heart attack last month.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

According to the new policy, OYO has empowered its partner hotels to decide whether to accept or decline bookings from couples based on their judgement, aligning with local social sensibilities. Known for being couple-friendly, even for unmarried couples, OYO has been working over the past few months to rebrand itself as a more family-oriented platform. In an exclusive chat with India Today Digital, OYO founder Ritesh Agarwal discussed the brand’s image transformation and the need to shift its focus. During the promotions of Shark Tank India 4, where Agarwal returns as one of the sharks (investors), the entrepreneur addressed OYO's branding, which has been largely associated with couple stays — something he described as a 'social media-created perspective.' He also highlighted their recent advertisement, which aimed to challenge this perception and promoted its partner hotels to be better suited for families. Agarwal shared that, according to their data, most of OYO’s bookings have always come from families or business travellers. ""It’s been quite interesting because, based on our data, a significant portion of our business — almost 70-80% — comes from families or business travellers. However, there is a social media perception, mainly fuelled by certain memes, which has created a new context. We appreciate this because that (couple stays) has been a challenge for our society too,"" Agarwal told India Today Digital.  The founder also discussed OYO’s branding evolution to a more premium image, particularly after recognising the potential of religious tourism. ""We launched 80 hotels in Ayodhya and have partners in Varanasi, Rameshwaram, Ajmer, and other religious destinations across the country, all of which are growing rapidly. As our brands grew, we realised the value of confronting the branding challenge head-on. Rather than whispering about the assumptions created by memes, we wanted to address them directly. The reality is different, and I believe brands should be bold. If there are misconceptions, they should not hesitate to communicate openly with customers. You need to convey the message and help them understand. Only then can both parties benefit,"" the OYO founder said.  Agarwal further shared that the new branding strategy had proven successful, with the company seeing the highest app downloads, repeat rates, and hotel openings in the last three years. ""We really got a lot of love,"" he said. When asked if the memes on social media ever caused him embarrassment or made him feel bad about how his company was perceived, Agarwal responded, ""Not at all. OYO is a highly respected brand in the corporate world, and we've won several 'Best Corporate' awards. The platform is used by families in central India, from Orissa to Uttar Pradesh, and they don’t have that perception at all. The whole thing has been a social media phenomenon, mainly in urban cities. Even when we released the new ad, it was targeted specifically at urban cities. We didn’t even air it on TV; it was just a digital message. This issue is primarily a big-city problem, but it’s rapidly changing thanks to our company-managed hotels."" Shark Tank India 4 starts streaming today on SonyLIV. In addition to Ritesh Agarwal, the other sharks on the show include Anupam Mittal (Shaadi.com), Aman Gupta (boAt), Namita Thapar (Emcure), Peyush Bansal (Lenskart), Vineeta Singh (Sugar), Azhar Iqubal (Inshorts), Varun Dua (ACKO), Kunal Bahl (Snapdeal), and Viraj Bahl (Veeba).Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

Aimed at enhancing efficiency, accessibility, and user experience, this new software is set to transform the way employees manage their retirement savings.ENHANCED FEATURES AND ACCESSIBILITY Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya revealed that EPFO 3.0 will bring a host of features aimed at streamlining the EPF processes. One of the standout features of the new system will be a more user-friendly website interface, making it easier for members to navigate and manage their accounts. The system will offer a level of efficiency similar to that of banking systems in India, allowing employees to access their retirement funds seamlessly.ATM CARD FOR EPF MEMBERS One of the most anticipated features of EPFO 3.0 is the introduction of ATM cards for EPF members. Once the system is launched, employees will be able to withdraw their EPF savings directly from ATMs, enhancing accessibility and allowing them to address financial emergencies more conveniently. The first phase of website and system upgrades is expected to be completed by the end of January 2025.PENSION SCHEME FLEXIBILITY AND WITHDRAWAL GUIDELINES In addition to ATM withdrawals, the EPFO is exploring changes to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS), offering employees the flexibility to adjust their contribution levels. The current system mandates a 12% contribution from both the employee and employer, but with the proposed change, employees may have the option to contribute more or less, based on their preferences.A NEW ERA FOR EPF MEMBERS With these exciting changes on the horizon, EPFO 3.0 is poised to make managing retirement savings more convenient and efficient than ever before. The expected improvements will not only benefit employees but will also help address unforeseen financial needs, marking a new era in India’s retirement savings ecosystem. As 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on the implementation of these revolutionary changes.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

The company last implemented pay hikes in November 2023. Typically, scheduled earlier in the year, this delay in wage hikes signals broader challenges in the global demand environment, particularly for discretionary IT services. The ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty has left IT companies grappling with subdued discretionary spending, delayed client budgets, and rising cost pressures.advertisementINDUSTRY-WIDE COST MANAGEMENT Infosys is not the only IT giant adopting such measures. Rivals such as HCLTech, LTIMindtree, and L&T Tech Services also chose to skip salary increments during the second quarter to curb expenses and maintain profitability, added the report.  As part of its phased approach, Infosys had earlier announced plans to implement wage hikes partially in January and fully by April, as confirmed by Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka during the company’s Q2 earnings call.EARNINGS UNCERTAINTY In Q2FY25, Infosys reported a 2.2% quarter-on-quarter rise in net profit, reaching Rs 6,506 crore. While this represented modest growth, it fell short of market expectations. Margins saw a slight improvement of 10 basis points, aided by reduced onsite costs, better utilisation rates, and enhanced operational efficiencies. Despite these gains, analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services anticipated margin pressures in the December quarter due to seasonal furloughs and fewer working days. However, cost-saving initiatives like subcontractor optimisation, pricing improvements, and Infosys’ margin improvement plan, Project Maximus, may help offset these challenges.STAGNANT JOB MARKET The delayed salary hikes are unlikely to trigger significant attrition, analysts noted, given the stagnant job market in the IT sector, said analysts quoted in the moneycontrol.com report. Selective salary increments for top performers, especially those in high-demand areas like artificial intelligence, continue within certain delivery teams. For many employees, retaining their positions is seen as a bonus in the current economic climate. As Infosys and its peers navigate these turbulent times, cost management remains a key priority to sustain profitability while adapting to evolving global market conditions.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Trending Reel

Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart said that the Indian equity markets are witnessing a sharp decline today, with both Nifty and Bank Nifty slipping below their 200-day moving averages (DMA). ""The sell-off can be attributed to a rise in foreign institutional investor (FII) selling and concerns surrounding the upcoming Q3 earnings season. Additionally, fears related to the new HMPV virus have added to the bearish sentiment, triggering fresh rounds of selling after the recent counter-trend pullback rally,"" he added.  The overall market structure appears weak; however, there remains a glimmer of hope for the bulls. One key factor is the lack of consistent follow-through in either direction, suggesting a degree of indecision. Furthermore, both Nifty and Bank Nifty are currently trading near their crucial support levels of 23,500 and 49,700, respectively, which could provide some respite to the bulls. Stock markets bled today, but some stocks still managed to gain.  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise emerged as the top gainer, rising 1.94%, followed by Tata Consumer Products which advanced 1.12%. Titan Company gained 0.72%, while HCL Technologies added a modest 0.10%, and ICICI Bank edged up by 0.08%. Tata Steel faced the steepest decline of 4.60% on Nifty50, followed by Trent Limited which fell 4.35%. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited dropped 3.68%, while NTPC Limited declined 3.63%, and Adani Enterprises Limited decreased by 3.61%. ""We can expect Nifty to gain support between 23,470 and 23,200 and notice resistance between 23,650 and 23,720 in the next intraday session. Notably, the overall sentiment will remain bearish, and we could expect the price to test the 22,900 level. In this situation, I suggest adopting a sell-on-rise approach while short-term and mid-term investors should continue to hedge their positions,"" said VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today.  Market volatility spiked significantly, as reflected in the India VIX, which surged 15.58%. The broader markets faced severe selling pressure, with Nifty Smallcap100 taking a bigger hit, plunging 3.20%, while Nifty Midcap100 declined sharply by 2.70%. In a brutal sell-off today, all sectoral indices on the Nifty plunged into the red, with no sectors managing to escape the bloodbath. Nifty PSU Bank took the hardest hit plummeting 4.00%. Nifty Metal crashed 3.14%, closely followed by Nifty Realty which tumbled 3.16%. The banking sector faced severe pressure with Nifty while Nifty Bank fell 2.09% and Nifty Private Bank dropped 2.11%. Energy stocks weren't spared either, as Nifty Oil & Gas sank 2.89%. Nifty Media declined sharply by 2.71%, while Nifty Financial Services Ex-Bank fell 2.75%.

By January 15, 2025, taxpayers must disclose any overseas financial accounts, income, and assets as part of their tax filing process for the Assessment Year 2024-25.SOURCES OF FOREIGN ACCOUNT INFORMATION To ensure compliance, the Indian government and its law enforcement agencies gather detailed information on financial accounts held by Indian residents abroad through two key international frameworks: FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and CRS (Common Reporting Standard). These sources allow the Indian Income Tax Department to monitor the global income of taxpayers and track those who may not be fully transparent in their disclosures.UNDERSTANDING FATCA AND CRS FATCA is a US law that compels foreign financial institutions to report accounts held by U.S. taxpayers to the IRS. On the other hand, CRS is an initiative by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), requiring global financial institutions to disclose foreign-held financial account information to the relevant tax authorities. Both frameworks play a crucial role in promoting global tax transparency and preventing tax evasion.DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIAN TAXPAYERS Under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, residents must report their foreign assets and income in their ITRs. To ensure proper reporting, foreign assets must be declared using Schedule FA, while income from abroad is reported via Schedule FSI. Additionally, taxpayers can claim tax relief for taxes paid abroad through Schedule TR.EXTENDED ITR FILING DEADLINE The Income Tax Department has extended the deadline for filing belated and revised ITRs for fiscal year 2023-24 from December 31, 2024, to January 15, 2025. This extension allows taxpayers with foreign assets or income to update their filings, ensuring full compliance with Indian tax laws before the final date. As the deadline draws near, it’s crucial for taxpayers with foreign assets and income to ensure they meet the reporting requirements. Failing to disclose foreign assets or income can result in penalties and legal consequences. The government’s push for transparency through FATCA and CRS will continue to shape the tax landscape, making it imperative for taxpayers to be vigilant about their obligations.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Must Watch

The week began with heavy selling pressure, dragging all sectoral indices into the red. Concerns over the HMPV virus and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pulling out funds triggered a massive sell-off, leaving the Sensex and Nifty both over 1.5% lower. The S&P BSE Sensex plunged 1,258.12 points to close at 77,964.99, while the NSE Nifty50 dropped 388.70 points to end at 23,616.05. Nifty PSU Bank bore the brunt, plummeting by 4%, marking its worst performance since June 2024. Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty followed with losses of 3.14% and 3.16%, respectively. Broader market indices also suffered sharp declines. Nifty Smallcap100 plunged 3.20%, while Nifty Midcap100 fell by 2.70%. Meanwhile, the India VIX, a measure of market volatility, spiked 15.58%, reflecting investor anxiety. The market fall marked one of the steepest single-day declines in recent months. REASON FOR MARKET CRASH  ""The sell-off was largely attributed to continued foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows and confirmation of HMPV cases in India coincided with reports of a virus outbreak in China, leading to heightened investor caution,"" said Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza. Analysts also pointed to other factors that contributed to the market crash. Among these were weak business updates from key sectors, particularly banks and FMCG companies, and concerns over tightening liquidity in the banking sector. ""The main concern of the market pressure has been the firms' poor business updates, particularly those from banks and FMCG stocks. The banking sector is currently navigating a landscape of tightening liquidity and slowing deposit growth. A stronger dollar and ongoing FPI selling have made the market decline worse. The strength of the US dollar and rising bond yields created a challenging environment for emerging markets,"" said CA Jashan Arora, Director, Master Trust Group.WHAT TO EXPECT TODAY Market volatility is expected to persist on Tuesday, fuelled by ongoing concerns over the HMPV virus, upcoming corporate earnings reports, and macroeconomic factors such as the Union Budget and global trade policy shifts. Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research at Religare Broking Ltd, highlighted the challenges ahead and said, ""The pullback in the Nifty index, coupled with a spike in volatility (India VIX), has disrupted the recovery trend, signalling potential challenges ahead. The banking sector's recent underperformance, combined with weakness in the midcap and smallcap segments, has intensified the bearish sentiment."" He further added that the pharma and healthcare sectors are expected to maintain their resilience, while other sectors may continue to face downward pressure.  ""We can expect Nifty to gain support between 23,470 and 23,200 and notice resistance between 23,650 and 23,720 in the next intraday session. Notably, the overall sentiment will remain bearish, and we could expect the price to test the 22,900 level.

Most other broader market indices, including small and midcaps, also registered gains. Despite today’s recovery in early trade, there are visible signs of volatility on Dalal Street due to a slew of factors such as FII selling, strengthening dollar, Q3 results and a few other factors. Additionally, the first GDP advance estimates for FY25 will be released today and economists have indicated that growth could slow down to a four-year low. Given the uncertainty on Dalal Street, experts have offered some insights on what factors are triggering volatility and how retail traders can navigate this turbulent phase. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said, “Nifty's Monday decline was driven by persistent selling from FIIs, who offloaded Rs 2,575 crore worth of shares, pushing the index below its 200-DMA at 23,907.” “Key catalysts for heightened volatility include FIIs selling Rs 7,078.30 crore of Indian equities in January, a record-low Rupee at 85.85, a spike in oil prices to $74.75 per barrel, and elevated US Treasury yields,” he added. “As the market awaits US NFP data and TCS's Q3 results, Nifty's direction remains uncertain amidst global and domestic pressures,” he noted, indicating that investors should remain cautious for the time being. Meanwhile, Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said the 1.6% cut in Nifty yesterday appears to be an “overreaction to the HMPV virus concerns”. “FII selling of Rs 2,575 crore was overwhelmed by the DII buying of Rs 5,750 crore.

The firm raised its rating on Biocon to 'underperform' and increased its target price by 43% to Rs 400, citing positive developments around the regulatory approval of the company’s manufacturing facility in Bengaluru. The new target price suggests an upside potential of approximately 12% from Monday’s closing price. At 10:45 am, Biocon shares were trading 7.22% higher at Rs 384.50 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).advertisementBIG FDA BOOST  The key trigger for the rally was the US Food and Drug Administration’s (US FDA) approval of Biocon’s biologics unit in Bengaluru, which received a “Voluntary Action Indicated” (VAI) status. The VAI classification signals that while minor issues were noted during the inspection, they do not require further regulatory actions. The development clears the path for Biocon to continue its operations without any disruptions. Investors now turn their focus to the regulatory approval process for Biocon’s Malaysia manufacturing unit, which remains a critical factor for the company’s growth outlook.BIOSIMILAR STELARA BOOST In addition to the Bengaluru unit approval, Jefferies highlighted Biocon’s recent milestone in securing US FDA approval for its biosimilar version of Janssen’s Stelara, a top-selling drug used to treat autoimmune disorders. Biocon plans to launch the biosimilar, branded as Yesintek, in February 2025. Stelara generated $7 billion in US sales in 2023, and Biocon aims to tap into this lucrative market. While competition in the biosimilar space is intense, with five other FDA-approved versions expected to launch in FY25, Jefferies sees strong growth potential for Biocon’s biologics business. Analysts believe the Stelara biosimilar approval significantly enhances Biocon’s revenue and profitability visibility. With these developments, Biocon can capitalise on regulatory clearances and expand its biologics portfolio, driving investor confidence and fuelling the stock’s upward momentum.

Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking Ltd, shared insights on the situation.  The sudden drop in key indices on Monday has disrupted the recovery trend in Indian markets. Analysts warn that rising volatility (India VIX) and sectoral weaknesses may lead to more selling pressure in the coming days. Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking Ltd, shared insights on the situation.  ""The Nifty index's pullback on Monday, coupled with a rise in volatility, has disrupted the recovery trend, signalling potential challenges ahead. Weakness in the banking sector, along with declines in midcap and smallcap stocks, has amplified bearish sentiment. On the other hand, the pharma and healthcare sectors are expected to demonstrate resilience, while other sectors may remain under pressure. Traders are advised to realign their positions accordingly. Key levels to watch include support at 23,250 in Nifty and resistance in the 23,950-24,250 zone,"" said Mishra. FACTORS BEHIND MARKET VOLATILITY Several factors have contributed to the current market volatility: Disappointing quarterly updates: A few large-cap companies, particularly in the banking sector, have shared weaker-than-expected Q3 updates ahead of the results season. HMPV spooks investors: Increasing cases of the HMPV virus in India have added to investor worries. Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) outflows: FIIs have been consistent net sellers in Indian equities, offloading shares worth Rs 7,078 crore in December 2024. ""Market sentiment has been dampened by a few disappointing quarterly updates, particularly from the banking sector, ahead of the earnings season, coupled with concerns over rising HMPV virus cases in India. Additionally, persistent foreign fund outflows are adding to the pressure. We believe that only strong earnings results can shift the market tone toward a sustained recovery; otherwise, the corrective trend is likely to persist, interspersed with occasional intermediate bounces,"" added Mishra. Amid the volatile backdrop, some stocks are showing clear trends, providing opportunities for both traders and investors. Below are specific stock recommendations from Dr Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research at Religare Broking, detailing potential moves based on current market conditions:Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) Analysis: The stock recently failed to sustain gains after breaking out in December and has now formed a bearish flag pattern. Recommendation: Sell January Futures at the current market price of Rs 1,054, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,087. Target: Rs 1,000 to Rs 980.Godrej Consumer Products (GODREJCP) Analysis: Godrej Consumer has shown resilience, rebounding strongly from the Rs 1,080-1,100 range. This indicates potential gains in the short to medium term. Recommendation: Buy in the price range of Rs 1,130-1,140, with a stop-loss below Rs 1,112. Target: Rs 1,190 to Rs 1,210.Cummins India (CUMMINSIND) Analysis: The stock recently broke below its critical support level of Rs 3,260, indicating a bearish trend. Recommendation: Sell January Futures at the current market price of Rs 3,180, with a stop-loss at Rs 3,240. Target: Rs 3,100. According to Singh, the market is likely to remain volatile until clear signals emerge from Q3 earnings reports. He said, ""Given the current market weakness, we anticipate heightened volatility in the coming days. However, amid this uncertainty, select stocks could present opportunities for gains.""

The sharp rally came despite the company reporting a consolidated net loss of Rs 3.59 crore in Q2 FY25, compared to a profit of Rs 5.23 crore in Q2 FY24.  At around 1:45 pm, shares of the company were trading 11.47% higher at Rs 622.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Investors appeared optimistic as Mobikwik’s Q2 FY25 loss narrowed from Rs 6.62 crore in the previous quarter, signalling improving financial health. The company attributed the loss to ongoing investments in its business aimed at driving future growth.WHY MOBIKWIK SHARES ARE ON THE RISE?  Mobikwik’s revenue from operations saw a significant jump, rising 42.86% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 290.65 crore from Rs 203.45 crore in Q2 FY24. The fintech company also reported a 267.3% YoY growth in Payments GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), driven by the rapid expansion of its payments business. The company’s EBITDA for the quarter stood at Rs 6.8 crore, which it attributed to improvements in contribution margin and optimized costs. This marked a positive development, as the business appears to be balancing growth initiatives with financial discipline. Mobikwik, a 15-year-old Gurugram-based fintech, has been a pioneer in digital payment innovations. Its latest product, Pocket UPI, allows users to make UPI transactions through their Mobikwik wallet instead of directly linking to a bank account, offering a seamless payment experience. The upbeat revenue growth and strong GMV expansion likely reassured investors about the company’s long-term potential, overshadowing the reported loss.

Rising inflation and increasing living costs have amplified the demand for measures that could ease financial strain. Taxpayers are hopeful for adjustments that would enhance their disposable income and support economic growth. The government is likely to focus on spurring consumption, particularly in light of the sluggish GDP growth reported for the second quarter. Industry experts expect measures aimed at reducing the tax burden on salaried and middle-class individuals, which could, in turn, drive household savings and consumption. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has recommended lowering marginal tax rates for individuals earning up to Rs 20 lakh annually, noting that such a move could stimulate a positive consumption cycle, foster growth, and boost tax revenue.WILL NEW INCOME TAX REGIME GET SWEETER?  The upcoming budget may focus on the new income tax regime yet again to increase its appeal compared to the old tax regime. Proposals under consideration include raising the income exemption threshold from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh or higher and increasing the standard deduction for salaried individuals from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Additional family-oriented tax benefits, such as deductions for educational expenses and medical insurance premiums, are also being speculated. There’s discussion around revising concessional tax rates for income brackets between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 15 lakh, potentially offering significant relief to middle-income taxpayers and encouraging a shift toward the New Tax Regime.END OF THE ROAD FOR OLD TAX REGIME?  While the new tax regime may get more benefits, there has been chatter around the possibility of the old tax regime facing the axe. However, the old tax regime still remains popular for its established deductions and exemptions.  Experts have suggested raising the Section 80C deduction limit from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh and increasing the housing loan interest deduction under Section 24(b) from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. Higher deductions under Sections 80D and 80DD for medical insurance and disabled dependents are also on the table. CII President Sanjiv Puri has called for reducing personal income tax rates for individuals earning up to Rs 20 lakh annually to stimulate consumption and economic growth. Similarly, Supreme Court advocate Tushar Kumar suggested rationalising tax slabs and introducing new deductions to boost disposable income. Former Infosys CFO TV Mohandas Pai highlighted the need for tax reforms to address inflation and rising living costs, while FICCI Vice President Vijay Sankar and PHDCCI President Hemant Jain highlighted the importance of supporting the middle class to boost consumer demand and alleviate inflationary pressures.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 7, 2025

The delay in updating the ITR processing software has left many eligible taxpayers struggling to claim their rightful rebates, with the January 15, 2025, deadline for filing revised or belated returns fast approaching.advertisementITR UPDATES AND SECTION 87A REBATE ISSUES The updated ITR forms were expected to resolve earlier glitches preventing taxpayers from claiming the Section 87A rebate on short-term capital gains (STCG) income. However, while the e-filing utility now accepts the claims, the processing software still rejects them due to outdated logic last revised on July 5, 2024. The updated ITR forms were expected to resolve earlier glitches preventing taxpayers from claiming the Section 87A rebate on short-term capital gains (STCG) income. However, while the e-filing utility now accepts the claims, the processing software still rejects them due to outdated logic last revised on July 5, 2024. Under Section 87A, eligible taxpayers can claim rebates of up to Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime or Rs 12,500 under the old regime. Chartered accountants have reported that the JSON schema, which governs ITR processing, has not been updated. This oversight means taxpayers filing revised ITRs will still face rejection if they claim the rebate on STCG income. Chartered Accountant Himank Singla, while speaking to The Economic Times, explained, “The ITR forms were updated for belated and revised filings, but the underlying processing logic remains unchanged. Filing a revised return now serves no purpose as the rebate claim will still be denied.” Many tax professionals recommend waiting for the Bombay High Court’s hearing on January 9, 2025, for clarity. The court had earlier directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to extend the deadline and update utilities to accommodate the rebate claims. With just days left before the revised ITR filing deadline, taxpayers face uncertainty and higher liabilities due to outdated processing systems. Clear communication and swift updates from the Income Tax Department are urgently needed to address these challenges and provide relief to eligible taxpayers.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Trending Reel

Zomato shares have declined over 9% in the past 5 trading sessions and over 14% in a month. At around 12:05 pm, shares of the company were trading 4.38% lower at Rs 253.05. The shares of the company fell after foreign brokerage Jefferies downgraded the stock from ""buy"" to ""hold."" The brokerage also reduced its target price for the food delivery giant by 18% to Rs 275, down from Rs 335, reflecting concerns over intensified competition in the quick commerce segment. The revised target price aligns closely with Zomato’s Monday closing of Rs 264.6, marking a 13% decline from its recent high of Rs 304.IS ZOMATO’S DREAM MARKET RALLY OVER? Jefferies cited heightened competition from Swiggy’s Instamart, Zepto, and Amazon as potential headwinds for Blinkit, Zomato’s quick commerce arm, which could impact profitability. Despite Zomato’s impressive 2024 rally—with shares doubling in value—Jefferies expects 2025 to be a year of consolidation. It revised its EBITDA estimates for FY26-27 downward by 12-15%, halving Blinkit’s valuation multiple to six times. Jefferies also trimmed its FY26-27 EPS forecasts by 20-21%, pointing to possible risks from aggressive discounting and competition. Meanwhile, Bernstein retained an ""outperform"" rating on Zomato, setting a target price of Rs 335. The firm lauded Zomato’s leadership in food delivery and quick commerce, highlighting its strong user acquisition strategy and expanding addressable market through initiatives like Dine Out. Bernstein anticipates quick commerce growth of 75-100% year-over-year, positioning Zomato as a major beneficiary. Elara Securities also highlighted Blinkit’s industry-leading position due to higher average order values, larger assortments, and competitive take rates. It noted that Blinkit has scaled operations to 45-50 cities, targeting 1,000 stores by the end of FY25. Anand Rathi offered a more balanced view, suggesting that multiple players can coexist in the quick commerce segment. The firm initiated coverage on Zomato and Swiggy with ""buy"" ratings and set 12-month target prices of Rs 385 and Rs 705, respectively. It highlighted Zomato’s market leadership but acknowledged Swiggy’s aggressive expansion plans, including its 10-minute food delivery service, Bolt. With competition intensifying in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, Zomato and its rivals are exploring new markets to drive growth. While analysts have varying views, all agree that Zomato faces the challenge of maintaining its position amid rising competition.

The surge came after the company announced it had received a key licence from the Indian government to manufacture advanced light machine guns. In a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Paras Defence said, ""We are pleased to inform you that M/s. Paras Defence and Space Technologies Ltd has been granted a licence under the Arms Act, 1959. This licence authorises the company to manufacture MK-46 and MK-48 Belt-fed Light Machine Gun (LMG) – Modernised Enhanced and Redefined LMG – with a proposed annual capacity of 6,000 numbers each."" This development is seen as a major step forward for the company in expanding its presence in India’s defence manufacturing sector and resulted in heavy trading on Paras Defence's stock today.

With the government's continued focus on simplifying the tax system, the upcoming budget could bring further modifications to make this framework even more appealing.EVOLUTION OF THE NEW TAX REGIME: A TIMELINE The new tax regime, introduced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Budget 2020, was designed to simplify the taxation process by reducing tax rates and eliminating most exemptions and deductions. This alternative tax structure offered six taxable slabs, with the promise of lower tax rates for those willing to forgo traditional tax benefits. Initial Structure: Budget 2020 In the 2020 Budget, Sitharaman unveiled a tax system with six slabs. For example, an individual earning Rs 15 lakh annually would now pay Rs 1.95 lakh in taxes, compared to Rs 2.73 lakh under the old regime. The key takeaway was that taxpayers could still choose between the old and new tax structures. Modifications in Budget 2021-2023 While the new tax regime remained mostly unchanged in the 2021 and 2022 budgets, Budget 2023 brought significant updates. The new tax regime became the default option on the ITR e-filing portal. Taxpayers can still opt for the old tax regime, but they must specify their choice before submitting their returns. Key changes included: A tax exemption for individuals earning up to Rs 7 lakh annually. A reduction in the number of tax slabs from six to five. An increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. The introduction of a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried individuals. Budget 2024: A boost for salaried employees In Budget 2024, Sitharaman introduced further modifications, particularly benefiting salaried employees and pensioners. The standard deduction was raised to Rs 75,000, and private-sector employees became eligible for a deduction of up to 14% of their basic salary for investments in the National Pension System (NPS). The Budget 2025 outlook As the Budget 2025 is set to address the financial concerns of the middle class, taxpayers expect more favourable changes to the new tax regime. With increased participation and evolving benefits, it seems that this system will continue to be a focal point for future tax reforms. With each passing year, the new tax regime evolves to provide more relief to taxpayers. As the budget draws closer, one can expect these changes to not only make compliance easier but also offer significant savings to the taxpayer.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Tune InMust Watch

According to two sources mentioned in the report, the hikes range from 1% to 4%, depending on performance. ""Salary increases have been rolled out for employees at the junior levels—E0, E1, and E2. The average hike is between 1% and 2%, while top performers have received raises of around 3% to 4%,"" a source was quoted as per the report. However, another source noted that these hikes are below earlier expectations. ""We were expecting an average increase of about 7%, with the best performers getting increments between 12% and 15%,"" they explained. The salary adjustments have been implemented for the third quarter, covering the period from October to December 2024. Letters detailing the new salary structures were sent to eligible employees in the last week of December. Junior employees at HCLTech, categorised under the E0, E1, and E2 levels, typically have experience of up to 10 years. Employees in mid- and senior-level roles, categorised as E3 and above, have not received any salary increases so far. HCLTech has not yet announced anything on salary hikes for junior employees and India Today Digital was not able to verify this. The company is scheduled to announce its financial results for the third quarter on 13 January 2025. The technology services industry, valued at $254 billion, is facing a challenging environment. Companies are dealing with slower client spending, which has made cost management a priority. These factors have led to delays in salary increases and bonuses across the sector. Recently, Infosys, a major competitor, announced 90% performance bonuses for the second quarter ending September. However, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are reported to have delayed their annual salary hikes for the fiscal year 2025. These increases are now expected to be announced in the last quarter, between January and March 2025. The decision to implement salary hikes is expected to affect profit margins for HCLTech and other companies in the October–December quarter. According to industry reports, firms like Wipro, LTIMindtree, and L&T Technology Services (LTTS) are likely to experience margin pressure due to similar wage increases. On the other hand, companies that have delayed salary hikes, such as Infosys and TCS, may see stable or improved margins for the same period. The third-quarter earnings season will begin with TCS releasing its results on 9 January, followed by Infosys on 16 January. Wipro and Tech Mahindra are scheduled to announce their results on 17 January.

This annual ritual helps reduce TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on salaries. If you're unsure about the process or whether it applies to you, here's a clear breakdown.WHO NEEDS TO SUBMIT PROOFS? Employees opting for the old tax regime must submit proof of eligible investments and expenses to claim deductions and exemptions. These include House Rent Allowance (HRA), Section 80C investments, health insurance premiums, home loan interest, and more. On the other hand, employees under the new tax regime are exempt from this requirement as most deductions are unavailable in this regime.KEY DEDUCTIONS UNDER THE OLD TAX REGIME HRA exemption: Submit rent receipts and agreements. For annual rent exceeding Rs 1 lakh, your landlord’s PAN is mandatory. Section 80C deductions: Investments like PPF, ELSS, and NPS, or expenses such as school fees and housing loan repayments, can reduce taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh. Health insurance (Section 80D): Claim up to Rs 1 lakh for premiums paid for self and parents. Home loan interest (Section 24B): Deduction up to Rs 2 lakh is allowed for interest paid on a home loan.TDS ON SALARY: HOW IT WORKS Employers calculate total tax liability based on your income and declared investments. If proofs aren’t submitted on time, they deduct full tax without accounting for deductions. However, you can still claim these while filing your ITR, though this might invite scrutiny and delay refunds.SWITCHING TAX REGIMES Employees can switch between tax regimes during ITR filing. Ensure timely filing (by July 31, 2025, for FY 2024-25) to claim the old regime and maintain all documents for verification. Submitting tax-saving proofs on time not only reduces TDS but also streamlines your tax compliance. While the new tax regime simplifies filing, the old regime remains advantageous for those with significant investments and expenses. Act early, submit proofs, and make the most of your hard-earned money!Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Must Watch

""Real GDP has been estimated to grow by 6.4% in FY 2024-25 as compared to the growth rate of 8.2% in Provisional Estimate (PE) of GDP for FY 2023-24. Nominal GDP has witnessed a growth rate of 9.7% in FY 2024-25 over the growth rate of 9.6% in FY 2023-24,"" said the NSO data.  It may be noted that the projection is even lower than the recent Reserve Bank estimate of 6.6% for the current fiscal year ending March 2025. The advance estimate, which plays a crucial role in Budget calculations, follows the July-September quarter shocker of 5.4% GDP growth. This surprising figure prompted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to revise its growth forecast for the current fiscal year to 6.6%, down from the earlier 7.2%. Real GDP at constant prices is estimated to rise to Rs 184.88 lakh crore in FY25, from Rs 173.82 lakh crore in FY24. Nominal GDP at current prices is projected to grow by 9.7%, reaching Rs 324.11 lakh crore, compared to Rs 295.36 lakh crore last year.
 


Real Gross Value Added (GVA) is expected to grow at 6.4%, a deceleration from 7.2% in FY24.Despite the slowdown, key sectors show promise. Agriculture and allied activities are forecast to grow by 3.8%, up from 1.4% in FY24. The construction sector is projected to expand by 8.6%, while financial, real estate, and professional services are expected to grow by 7.3%.Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), a key indicator of household spending, is anticipated to grow by 7.3% in FY25, compared to 4.0% in FY24. Meanwhile, Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) is estimated to rebound with a growth rate of 4.1%, up from 2.5% last fiscal.These estimates highlight that while growth will decelerate, some sectors are likely to remain resilient, offering hope for continued economic activity even amid slower overall growth.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Jan 7, 2025

MCLR, introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2016, replaced the base rate system to make lending rates more dynamic. It represents the minimum rate below which banks cannot lend. Changes in MCLR directly affect loan EMIs, making them higher or lower depending on rate revisions. Borrowers under older regimes like the base rate or Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR), implemented before 2016, remain unaffected by MCLR changes unless they switch to the new system. Currently, HDFC Bank's Benchmark PLR stands at 17.95%, while the base rate is 9.45%, effective since September 2024.OTHER LENDING AND DEPOSIT RATES HDFC Bank has also revised its interest rates on bulk fixed deposits of Rs 3 crore to less than Rs 5 crore. Post-revision, FDs offer 4.75% to 7.40% for the general public and up to 7.90% for senior citizens, depending on the tenor. With this rate cut, HDFC Bank provides some financial relief to borrowers navigating fluctuating interest rates. Whether you're planning to take a loan or invest in fixed deposits, staying informed about these changes ensures smarter financial decisions.

These measures are expected to increase disposable incomes, spurring consumption in urban areas where most taxpayers reside. Sources indicate that the government is eyeing tweaks to the new income tax regime, introduced in FY 2020-21, which has attracted over 70% of taxpayers due to its simplified structure and regular enhancements.advertisementPROPOSED CHANGES IN TAX STRUCTURECurrently, under the new regime, income up to Rs 3 lakh is tax-free, while earnings between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 6 lakh are taxed at 5%, Rs 6-9 lakh at 10%, Rs 9–12 lakh at 15%, Rs 12–15 lakh at 20%, and above Rs 15 lakh at 30%. A standard deduction of Rs 75,000 ensures that incomes up to Rs 7.75 lakh are tax-free. Currently, under the new regime, income up to Rs 3 lakh is tax-free, while earnings between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 6 lakh are taxed at 5%, Rs 6-9 lakh at 10%, Rs 9–12 lakh at 15%, Rs 12–15 lakh at 20%, and above Rs 15 lakh at 30%. A standard deduction of Rs 75,000 ensures that incomes up to Rs 7.75 lakh are tax-free. Reports suggest that the basic exemption limit might increase from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh, with corresponding adjustments to other slabs. For example, the 5% slab may cover incomes from Rs 4 lakh to Rs 7 lakh, making the tax regime more beneficial for earners up to Rs 14 lakh.BOOSTING SPENDING POWER AMID INFLATION The government’s focus appears to be on easing the burden on individuals earning Rs 13–14 lakh annually, especially in urban areas, where inflation has eroded purchasing power, according to sources. The changes aim to provide relief to urban taxpayers, who face rising inflation and form the bulk of the consumption-driven economy. Experts believe that revising tax slabs by raising thresholds by Rs 1 lakh each could significantly lower tax burdens, encouraging higher spending. Sudhir Kapadia, EY India Tax & Regulatory Services partner, while speaking to Financial Express, stated, “Majority of income taxpayers live in urban areas where most of the consumption also takes place. Given that inflation is hurting people in the lower income strata, each IT slabs can be raised by 1 lakh each.” He added, “To boost consumption, especially in urban areas (where the majority of income taxpayers reside), expanding slabs at lower and middle-income levels, that is, up to 20% tax bracket should be considered.”RISING TAX REVENUES SUPPORT REFORMS With personal income tax collections rising 25% to Rs 7.41 lakh crore during April-November FY25, the government is in a strong position to implement these reforms. Unlike corporate taxes, personal tax receipts have consistently surpassed targets, providing fiscal space for relief measures. The anticipated changes could be a game-changer, delivering much-needed relief to taxpayers while stimulating economic activity.

Kamath wrote on X, “Ahmedabad and Mumbai account for 80% of equity delivery trades. Let that sink in. Essentially, the real money is with Gujjus.” He added,“Gujarat accounts for just 8% of the total registered investors, and the share has been falling.”
 


 According to Kamath's analysis, Mumbai contributed 64.28% of equity trade deliveries in November 2024, while Ahmedabad added another 17.53%. These figures underscore the dominance of these two cities in the financial landscape, largely driven by the Gujarati community’s financial prowess.GUJARATIS: THE FINANCIAL POWERHOUSES Kamath’s tweet acknowledged the Gujarati community’s deep-rooted business acumen, calling them the custodians of ""real money"" in the stock market. Interestingly, Gujarat, despite its outsized influence in equity trades, represents only 8% of India's total registered investors—a share that has been declining. Kamath also highlighted Gujarat’s significant participation in IPOs, which accounted for nearly 40% of all IPO activity last year.CITY-WISE TURNOVER INSIGHTS Expanding on city-wise turnover in the cash segments of BSE and NSE, Kamath noted that Ahmedabad leads, followed by Bengaluru, Vadodara, Bhubaneswar, and Chennai. Maharashtra, however, retains the top spot for the highest number of registered investors, with 1.48 crore as of December 2023. Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the second-largest state in this metric, overtaking Gujarat, with 89.47 lakh registered investors compared to Gujarat’s 76.68 lakh.REACTIONS SPARK INTEREST Kamath’s observations sparked engaging reactions. Kunal Shah, founder of CRED, responded with the iconic phrase 'Risk hai to Ishq hai' from Scam 1992, referencing Gujaratis’ bold and calculated risk-taking nature.
 


 CoinDCX playfully noted the entrepreneurial spirit of Gujarati kids, saying while children elsewhere learn A for Apple, B for Ball, and C for Cat, Gujarati kids grow up with A for Absolute Return, B for Blue Chip Tokens, C for Call Option, and D for Dalal Street.

As the stock experienced heavy trading activity, the exchanges sought clarification from the company regarding the price movement. At around 10 am, Spandana Sphoorty shares were trading at Rs 461.40 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), marking a remarkable 35% gain in just two days. By 12:56 pm, the stock had risen 14.62% to Rs 459, signalling strong investor interest. Today's surge came after the stock's 20% upper circuit hit in the previous session, which also saw high trading volumes, the highest in the last 10 weeks. The upswing in the stock price began after well-known chartist Sushil Kedia from Kedianomics predicted that the stock, then priced just over Rs 300, could deliver six-fold returns in the future, potentially reaching levels of Rs 1,800. Kedia told CNBC Awaaz that while he doesn’t recommend immediate action, he is watching for an ideal “buy” signal. Meanwhile, Osho Krishan, Senior Research Analyst at Angel One told Business Today about the positive development in the stock, noting the large volume-backed 35% surge this week. He suggested that aggressive traders could consider accumulating the stock, with immediate resistance levels around Rs 550-600 and support near Rs 400. The stock's sharp rise follows a challenging period for Spandana Sphoorty, which had faced pressure due to a deterioration in its microfinance asset quality and profitability. The company reported a significant increase in its gross stage 3 (GS3) loans, from 1.7% in Q4 FY24 to 5.3% in Q2 FY25, reflecting the ongoing challenges in its business operations.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the budget on February 1, 2025, with the middle class hoping for an increase in the tax-free income threshold, amongst other proposals.RSS-BACKED BMS PUSHES FOR BOLD REFORMS The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has called for substantial changes during pre-budget discussions. The organisation proposed raising the tax-free income limit to Rs 10 lakh while retaining current exemptions. Additionally, the BMS urged the government to constitute the 8th Pay Commission and exempt pensioners from income tax on pensions. Other key demands include extending the MGNREGA program to provide 200 workdays per family annually, implementing a stimulus package for agriculture and allied industries, and expediting GST refunds. The BMS also stressed the need for a comprehensive manufacturing strategy to reduce dependence on Chinese imports.FOCUS ON PENSION AND WORKER WELFARE The BMS has advocated increasing the minimum pension for EPS-95 beneficiaries from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000, with a future target of 50% of the government’s minimum wages, linked to the Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA). They also suggested expanding the Ayushman Bharat scheme to EPS-95 pensioners and introducing universal old-age pensions. Recommendations to improve worker welfare include extending gratuity calculations to 30 days per year, funding industrial boards like the beedi and contract labour boards, and prioritising the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) over the New Pension Scheme (NPS). With the Union Budget just weeks away, the middle class and worker groups are eagerly anticipating the government’s response to these bold proposals. If adopted, these measures could offer substantial financial relief and bolster India’s economic framework. Whether Budget 2025 will meet these expectations is yet to be seen.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The S&P BSE Sensex fell 553.10 points to 77,646.01 at 1:11 pm, while the NSE Nifty50 fell 163.05 points to trade at 23,544.85. Multiple factors were behind today’s nervousness on Dalal Street, including weaker growth estimates for FY25, worries over Q3 corporate earnings and the likelihood of fewer US rate cuts.advertisementQ3 CORPORATE EARNINGSOne of the key triggers behind today’s decline is nervousness among investors over the outcome of Q3 corporate earnings. Early trends suggest that the earnings season will be subdued and it has already started hurting investor sentiments. One of the key triggers behind today’s decline is nervousness among investors over the outcome of Q3 corporate earnings. Early trends suggest that the earnings season will be subdued and it has already started hurting investor sentiments. It is worth noting that recent quarterly updates from companies including Dabur India  and Hero MotoCorp  did not give the market hope that corporate profit growth in the December quarter would be any better than the previous quarter, which was the worst in four years. Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at Wealthmills Securities, told news agency Reuters that the business updates from companies have heightened worries of earnings moderation, which is “weighing on sentiment and triggering a drop in domestic equities ahead of the results season”.FEWER US RATE CUTS LIKELY Another reason behind today’s decline was a sharp tumble in technology and financial stocks, which fell after US data signalled at a stable economy and labour market, diminishing prospects of future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The Nifty IT index was down 0.5% during the session; Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services indices also fell sharply during the session and pulled down the benchmark indices. It was only due to heavyweight stock Reliance, which rose 2%, that the losses were limited on Dalal Street.GDP GROWTH ESTIMATE SLIPS A day ago, the first advance estimates released by the government indicated that GDP growth in FY25 may slow down sharply to 6.4%, marking a 4-year low. The growth estimate for FY25 is also sharply lower than FY24’s 8.2%. This may have led to some nervousness on Dalal Street. However, analysts said that it may not be a major trigger behind today’s weakness. Trivesh D, COO at Tradejini, said, “Markets often anticipate economic data, reacting to expected changes before the official figures are out. The forecasted GDP slowdown is not new information for investors; thus, the impact on equity markets might have already been absorbed.” “If not entirely, only minor movements may follow, unless there’s a further downward revision in growth expectations,” he added.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

The report noted that power output increased by 5.8% year-on-year to 1,824.13 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh). The deceleration was especially pronounced in the second half of the year, where power generation rose by only 2.3%, compared to a 9.6% rise in the first half. The slower growth aligns with the country’s economic performance, which saw its slowest expansion in nearly two years during the July-September quarter. December brought little relief, with India’s manufacturing sector posting its weakest monthly growth for the year due to subdued demand. However, analysts anticipate a rebound in 2025, driven by rising industrial production and higher residential electricity use during adverse weather conditions. “Electricity demand picked up in December with colder weather boosting heating system usage,” Sooraj Narayan, head of Asia-Pacific power modeling at Wood Mackenzie, told the news agency. “We expect a demand growth rate of 6% to 7% in 2025, supported by increased industrial activity.” Renewable energy contributed 12.1% of India’s total power generation in 2024, helping to reduce the share of coal to 74.4% from 75% in 2023. This marked the first drop in coal’s share in three years. Despite this progress, renewable growth slowed, with solar output rising just 18.4%, the lowest rate since India’s 2015 climate commitments. Wind power output also declined for the first time since 2020. Hydropower output recovered, rising 4% after a sharp 13.7% drop in 2023, but its overall share fell to 8.6%. Meanwhile, natural gas-fired power, which rose 17.3% last year, is expected to decline in 2025 due to higher projected gas prices, according to Energy Aspects senior LNG analyst Kesher Sumeet.With inputs from ReutersPublished By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

It may be noted that both the benchmark indices fell about 0.8% during the session, but pared losses in the last few hours. One of the biggest reasons for the volatility was recent business updates from companies, which have suggested that profit growth is unlikely to be any better. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Slowing economic growth projections and caution ahead of Q3 numbers added volatility in the market.” “However, the market witnessed a recovery from the day’s low owing to an accumulation of beaten-down blue-chip stocks and in expectation of government reforms in the upcoming budget to lift the tepid economy,” Nair added. “The near-term sentiment is likely to be subdued due to the rise in US bond yield and fear of fewer rate cuts by the Fed."" Meanwhile, Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, ""The Nifty index is trading within a range of 23,500 to 24,200. In Wednesday's session, it formed a hammer candlestick on the daily chart, closing near its 200-day EMA, thereby strengthening the 23,500 support level."" ""A decisive move will require the index to close below 23,500, which could lead to heightened selling pressure, or sustain above 24,000 to pave the way for a potential rally toward 24,500. Monitoring these crucial levels is essential to identify the next trend in the index,"" he added.

Victims are receiving fraudulent messages claiming that their PAN card details must be updated to avoid account blockage. These deceptive messages often contain suspicious links, which direct users to scammers looking to steal sensitive information. The Press Information Bureau (PIB) has stepped in to clarify the situation, labelling the message as fake. In an official post on X, PIB warned, ""Claim: The customer's India Post Payments bank account will be blocked within 24 hours if their PAN card is not updated. This claim is #Fake.""
 


 The government’s fact-check team highlighted that India Post will never send such messages, urging the public to be cautious and avoid clicking on any links.HOW THE SCAM WORKS Phishing is an online scam where cybercriminals impersonate trusted organisations to steal sensitive data like passwords, account numbers, or PINs. In this case, scammers prey on fear, sending messages that threaten account blockage unless PAN details are updated immediately. These messages might seem authentic, but they are part of a larger scam designed to deceive and exploit victims.PROTECT YOURSELF FROM PHISHING SCAMS IPPB has also shared important safety tips to help customers protect themselves. The bank encourages individuals to regularly update their passwords, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and be wary of fake customer care numbers. They also advise customers to closely monitor their bank accounts for any unauthorised activity. Additionally, users should exercise caution when using public Wi-Fi and always verify the authenticity of communications from financial institutions. As digital banking evolves, scammers are finding new ways to trick users. To stay safe, it’s crucial to stay informed and practice smart online security. When in doubt, always double-check the source and never share your personal or bank details through unsecured platforms. As scams become more sophisticated, it is crucial for users to stay informed and exercise vigilance. By following these simple steps, you can protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly common online frauds.

Shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) climbed over 2% on Wednesday, following a bullish note from foreign brokerage firm Jefferies. The firm reiterated its 'BUY' rating on the heavyweight stock, setting a target price of Rs 1,690, indicating a potential upside of over 30% from current levels. At 3:26 pm on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), RIL shares were trading 1.81% higher at Rs 1,263.30. If Jefferies’ target is achieved, it would translate to an impressive 33% upside. The rally marks a positive shift for Reliance, which underperformed the Nifty50 index by 15% in 2024, which is the first calendar year in nine years to see negative returns. According to Jefferies, concerns over medium-term growth in Reliance’s retail business and weaker earnings in FY25 weighed on the stock. However, the brokerage now expects mid-teens growth in the retail segment, a potential listing of Reliance Jio, and improved profitability in its Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) business by FY26. It forecasts a 14% growth in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) for FY26, with all segments contributing to this recovery. Jefferies also highlighted that RIL’s current valuations are the cheapest since March 2020, presenting a strong buying opportunity. Another global brokerage, Bernstein, maintained its 'Outperform' rating with a target price of â‚¹1,520, implying a 25% upside. Bernstein projects that 2025 will be a recovery year, driven by a 12% increase in Reliance Jio’s Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), even without tariff hikes. The retail segment is expected to revert to double-digit EBITDA growth, while refining margins are likely to improve. Out of 39 analysts covering RIL, 33 have a 'Buy' rating, three recommend 'Hold,' and three suggest 'Sell.' Mirae Asset Securities has the highest price target of â‚¹1,950, which signals a potential upside of 57%. RIL’s stock has corrected 22% from its 52-week high, making its valuations attractive for investors seeking long-term growth. Jefferies expects FY26 to see robust growth across segments, aided by Jio’s potential listing and improved O2C profitability. Meanwhile, Bernstein foresees a boost from higher telecom revenues and a rebound in refining margins. With two major brokerages expressing confidence in RIL’s recovery prospects, the stock could offer significant returns.

The app, which is currently available in select Bengaluru neighbourhoods, is aimed at urban consumers who prioritise speed and convenience when it comes to food delivery. The SNACC app offers a menu that includes breakfast options, light meals, and a variety of beverages, perfect for those seeking a fast, hassle-free dining experience. The app can be downloaded on both Android and iOS platforms, signaling Swiggy’s foray into the ultra-fast food delivery space, a market segment that's growing rapidly. This launch marks a shift from Swiggy's traditional model, where innovations were integrated into its main app, which has grown increasingly cluttered and difficult to navigate. By creating SNACC as a standalone platform, the company aims to streamline the delivery process for those looking for quick bites without the distractions of larger food orders. SNACC expands on Swiggy’s existing success with its rapid delivery arm, Bolt, which promises 15-minute deliveries by partnering with restaurants that can meet strict delivery time requirements. Unlike Bolt, however, SNACC operates from a centralised hub stocked with ready-to-serve products, enabling even faster and more reliable service. With this move, Swiggy is entering a competitive arena, where rivals like Zepto Cafe and Blinkit Bistro are already making waves in the rapid food delivery market. These platforms have capitalised on the increasing demand for quick, convenient food options, especially among India’s millennials and Gen Z consumers. India’s rapid food delivery market has seen significant growth, driven by changing consumer preferences and the widespread adoption of digital services.

Is Indian economy losing steam?While a slowdown in the ongoing financial year was anticipated, the steep downward revision in GDP growth for FY25 has taken many by surprise. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/indias-fy25-gdp-may-hit-a-4-year-low-whats-dragging-economic-growth-2661602-2025-01-08,"India’s economic growth is expected to slow sharply to 6.4% in FY25, according to the first advance estimates released by the government. The  projection marks a considerable drop from the 8.2% growth achieved in FY24 and represents the slowest pace of expansion in four years. The estimate is also lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) revised annual growth forecast of 6.6%, raising concerns across sectors. While a slowdown in the ongoing financial year was anticipated, the steep downward revision has taken many by surprise. So, what factors are driving this deceleration in GDP growth?advertisementSECTORAL GROWTH MODERATIONDr. Manoranjan Sharma, Chief Economist at Infomerics Ratings, explained, “India’s GDP is expected to grow by 6.4% in FY25 over 7.2% in FY24. This slowest growth rate since the pandemic manifests moderation across key sectors and constitutes a significant drop from the 8.2% growth in FY24.”While agriculture is poised for a noticeable improvement with a growth projection of 3.8% compared to 1.4% last year, other key sectors are forecast to slow. Manufacturing growth is projected to fall to 5.3% from 9.9%, while mining is expected to grow at 2.9% compared to 7.1%.Similarly, the construction sector is set to grow at 8.6%, down from 9.9%, and electricity growth is estimated at 6.8%, lower than the previous year’s 7.5%.The top contributors to GDP, such as manufacturing, trade and hotels, and financial services and real estate, are all expected to witness slower growth in FY25.

The industry will have to quickly adapt to changing tastes,” he noted. Singh pointed out that subdued sales in the FMCG and auto sectors are not merely a result of low incomes. “The entry of brands like MG Hector and KIA in 2018 and the surge in Parle-G sales during COVID indicate that poor sales stem more from shifting preferences than income constraints,” he said. These shifts in consumer behaviour underline a broader transition in India’s consumption landscape, which may weigh on GDP growth in the short term but could offer opportunities for industries willing to adapt quickly. “The country is undergoing a change in preferences, and the industry will soon incorporate these changes, leading to more robust GDP growth,” Singh added.IMPACT ON STOCK MARKETS AND BROADER ECONOMY Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd, highlighted the potential market impact of the revised GDP forecast. “India’s GDP growth projection of 6.4% for FY25 could temper investor sentiment, as lower growth expectations might lead to reduced corporate earnings forecasts, prompting portfolio adjustments,” he said. Sectors closely tied to economic growth, particularly manufacturing, may see notable declines. However, Mishra suggested that “effective government fiscal measures or potential interest rate cuts by the RBI could offer some relief.” A sustained slowdown in GDP growth could also affect foreign institutional investor (FII) sentiment. Mishra noted, “Slower economic growth often raises concerns about corporate profitability and market stability. If FIIs identify more favourable opportunities elsewhere, they may reduce their exposure to Indian equities.” That said, India’s long-term appeal remains intact due to its demographic advantage, strong consumption trends, and resilient financial markets. External factors such as global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions will also play a role in shaping FII behaviour. Nominal GDP is expected to grow by 9.7% in FY25, slightly higher than the 9.6% seen in FY24. However, the broader economic outlook will rely heavily on the government’s fiscal policies and the RBI’s approach to managing inflation and growth.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

This new regulation aims to provide a more accurate reflection of borrowers' financial activities, enhancing credit score precision and streamlining financial assessments.TIMELY UPDATES FOR BETTER CREDIT SCORES Under the older system, credit bureaus relied on monthly updates from lenders, leading to delays in capturing borrowers' repayment behaviour. For instance, timely payments or loan closures often went unrecognised until the next update, potentially impacting borrowers' credit scores and limiting their access to favourable loan terms. The new 15-day cycle ensures faster updates, allowing borrowers’ financial activities to be reflected in real-time, thereby improving their chances of securing better credit opportunities.IMPROVED CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT The bi-monthly update system benefits lenders by offering more current credit data. This enables them to assess credit risk accurately, identify potential defaulters sooner, and reward responsible borrowers promptly. With up-to-date information, lenders can make well-informed decisions when evaluating loan applications, fostering responsible borrowing habits and reducing default rates.KEY BENEFITS OF THE NEW REGULATION Timely updates: Borrowers' credit histories will now reflect their financial activities more quickly, benefiting those with consistent repayment habits. Enhanced credit access: Accurate credit scores allow responsible borrowers to access loans faster and on better terms. Consumer empowerment: Real-time updates offer borrowers greater insight into their financial health, promoting informed decision-making. Lender confidence: Frequent updates improve risk management, providing a clearer picture of borrowers' financial behaviour. With the new bi-monthly updates, borrowers gain from quicker acknowledgement of their financial behaviours, while lenders benefit from improved risk assessment tools. This regulatory change not only strengthens trust in India's lending system but also empowers consumers and promotes a more equitable financial environment.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

According to a Bloomberg report, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to unveil a comprehensive overhaul of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a move that has been in the works for several months.advertisementKEY FOCUS: SIMPLIFYING TAX FILINGThe proposed reforms, which may be open for public consultation by mid-January, are designed to streamline the income tax return (ITR) filing process. The proposed reforms, which may be open for public consultation by mid-January, are designed to streamline the income tax return (ITR) filing process. The initiative includes simplifying tax computation structures with formulas, unifying the definitions of the assessment year and financial year, and introducing tabular formats for taxpayer clarity. While the changes aim to make tax compliance easier, the government has indicated that tax rates and policies will remain unchanged. The demand for a simpler tax regime has grown, especially with tax disputes ballooning to Rs 10.5 lakh crore by the fiscal year ending March 2023. The proposed changes aim to address these disputes and provide clarity to taxpayers, reducing litigation and improving compliance.STEPS TOWARD REFORM In her July 2024 Budget speech, Sitharaman highlighted the government’s commitment to simplifying taxation. Measures like the introduction of exemption-free tax regimes for corporations and individuals have already garnered positive feedback, with 58% of corporate tax revenue in 2022-23 coming from the simplified regime. Similarly, over two-thirds of taxpayers have adopted the new system. The Income Tax Department has also received over 6,500 suggestions from stakeholders, reflecting widespread public engagement in shaping the reforms.A MORE TRANSPARENT TAX REGIME As India prepares for Budget 2025, these reforms signal a step toward a more transparent and taxpayer-friendly system. By reducing complexity and fostering clarity, the government aims to create a tax framework that promotes trust and compliance. With these anticipated changes, taxpayers can look forward to a smoother filing experience and fewer disputes.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Scheduled for presentation on January 31, a day before the budget, the Economic Survey provides essential insights into India’s economic health and sets the stage for the government’s fiscal plans.WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC SURVEY? The Economic Survey is a comprehensive review of India’s economic performance over the past fiscal year. It covers critical sectors such as agriculture, industry, and services, along with key economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, employment rates, fiscal deficit, and more. The document, prepared by the Department of Economic Affairs under the supervision of the Chief Economic Advisor, V Anantha Nageswaran, includes policy recommendations to address economic challenges and promote growth. The survey is divided into two main sections: Part A reviews the country’s economic status, focusing on current fiscal trends, while Part B addresses socio-economic issues like education, poverty, climate change, and social security. Projections for GDP, inflation, forex reserves, and trade deficits are also included. The theme of this year’s Economic Survey is expected to focus on deregulation, which will likely influence the upcoming budget discussions.WHY IS THE ECONOMIC SURVEY IMPORTANT? The Economic Survey plays a pivotal role in shaping the Union Budget by offering a clear and unbiased assessment of the economy. It aids policymakers in making informed decisions and helps stakeholders such as investors and businesses with key economic data for strategic planning. The survey is not only a pre-budget tool but also an important benchmark for evaluating economic progress and setting future growth targets.HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND CONTINUED RELEVANCE Historically, the Economic Survey was presented alongside the Union Budget, but since 1964, it has been released a day before the budget. This document continues to be essential in guiding India’s economic policy and providing transparency to the nation’s financial landscape. As we await the Union Budget 2025, the Economic Survey offers valuable foresight, shaping not just the budget but the economic roadmap for the year ahead.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

According to a report by Business Insider, this decision aligns with the company’s efforts to strengthen its performance management approach, similar to strategies adopted by other tech giants. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the move but did not reveal how many employees would be affected. “At Microsoft, we focus on high-performance talent. We’re always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take appropriate action,” the spokesperson said as mentioned in the report. While the layoffs are aimed at addressing underperformance, the company often refills roles left vacant by such cuts. This means Microsoft’s total workforce may not see a major decline. As of June 2024, the company had approximately 228,000 full-time employees. Managers have reportedly spent several months reviewing the performance of staff at all levels, including senior positions. The layoffs, described as wide-reaching, will also include employees in the company’s security division. Microsoft has conducted several rounds of layoffs in recent years. In 2023, the company cut an estimated 10,000 jobs, amounting to roughly 5% of its global workforce. During the same year, its Xbox gaming division also experienced a smaller number of layoffs. In 2024, Microsoft dismissed nearly 2,000 employees in its gaming division following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Later that year, the company targeted 1,500 roles in its Azure cloud computing business, though the final count of job losses reached about 1,000. These steps reflect the tech industry’s broader trend of prioritising efficiency and high performance as companies navigate economic uncertainties and evolving market demands. Meanwhile, Microsoft is continuing to expand its footprint in India. Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella recently announced an initiative to train 500,000 people in rural areas of India in artificial intelligence (AI) skills. This programme is being carried out in partnership with India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The announcement was made during Nadella’s visit to New Delhi as part of the Microsoft AI Tour. He highlighted the importance of AI in empowering communities and enhancing human skills. “There’s tremendous progress in AI skilling in India,” Nadella said, pointing to the country’s growing influence in the AI landscape.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Last year, TCS declared a final dividend of Rs 28 per share for FY24 along with its Q4 results in April. For FY24, TCS had also announced an interim dividend of Rs 9 per share and a special dividend of Rs 18 per share following its Q3 results. In the first and second quarters of FY24, the company announced interim dividends of Rs 9 each. In addition to the dividends, TCS undertook a share buyback programme worth Rs 17,000 crore in FY24. The total amount distributed to shareholders, including dividends and buybacks, was Rs 46,223 crore for FY24.HISTORICAL DIVIDEND PAYOUTS For FY23, TCS declared a final dividend of Rs 24 per share, with cumulative payouts for the year amounting to Rs 115 per share. This translated to Rs 33,306 crore in total dividends and a dividend yield of 3.59%. In earlier years, the company paid dividends of Rs 43 per share (Rs 7,686 crore) in FY22, Rs 38 per share (Rs 8,510 crore) in FY21, and Rs 72 per share (Rs 25,125 crore) in FY20. These consistent payouts underscore TCS’s commitment to returning value to its shareholders.Q3 FY25 PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS For the third quarter of FY25, market analysts expect TCS to show flat constant currency (CC) revenue growth, with a slight decline in dollar revenue. This is mainly due to seasonal factors like furloughs and a lower contribution from the BSNL contract. However, analysts predict that operational efficiencies and a reversal of one-off costs from earlier quarters will partially offset these impacts. Margins are expected to improve by 20-40 basis points during the quarter. Analysts at Nuvama forecast TCS's profit after tax at Rs 12,390 crore, with revenue reaching Rs 64,129 crore. The firm predicts a 0.1% sequential CC revenue growth, a 0.8% decline in dollar revenue, and stable deal wins. Nuvama also highlighted key areas to watch, including the company’s outlook on the BSNL contract and its future margin guidance.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Must Watch

According to Equirus Capital, the tightening global supply of refrigerant gases has pushed prices higher, creating significant financial opportunities for manufacturers like SRF and Navin Fluorine. Analysts pointed out that SRF is particularly well-positioned, with an annual production capacity of 29,000 to 30,000 tons of R32 and about 7,000 tons of R125. The report estimated that for every $1/kg increase in R32 prices, SRF’s EBITDA could grow by Rs 260 crore, while a similar rise in R125 prices could add Rs 60 crore to its EBITDA. Navin Fluorine, which currently produces 4,500 tons of R32 annually, also stands to benefit. The company’s plans to double its R32 production capacity to 9,000 tons by February 2025 could further enhance its profitability. Equirus projected that starting February 2025, every $1/kg increase in R32 prices could add Rs 77 crore to Navin Fluorine’s EBITDA. The price increase highlights a growing demand-supply imbalance in the refrigerant gas market, which remains crucial for the HVAC industry. With strong production capacities and planned expansions, analysts believe that both SRF and Navin Fluorine are well-positioned to capitalise on this trend.

Around 11:05 am, Sensex was trading 448.21 points lower at 77,700.28 and Nifty was down 142.85 points to 23,546.10. Most of the broader market indices also fell during early trade as volatility rose due to concerns over the possibility of weak profit growth in the third quarter.Q3 RESULTS KEEP D-STREET ON EDGE It may be noted that Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is set to kick off the Q3 earnings season today and several analysts have noted that the IT giant could witness a sequential slowdown. Alongside TCS, Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, Tata Elxsi, GTPL Hathway, Mishka Exim, Padam Cotton Yarns, Teamo Productions HQ, Vivo Bio Tech and Yash Highvoltage will also report September to December 2024 period results today. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, “With the Q3 results season starting from today there will be market reaction to results. The results of TCS will give an indication of what is in store for the IT sector. The strength of the US economy and the depreciation of rupee will be tailwinds for the IT sector.” Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, also said the key factors to watch include TCS's Q3 results and Friday's US Non-Farm Payroll data. Another reason behind the weakness on Dalal Street is sustained FII selling pressure, with Rs 3,362 crore worth of net sales yesterday, bringing the January total to Rs 11,932 crore.

The report highlights the key trends shaping the workforce and the strategies businesses plan to adapt to respond to these changes. The WEF’s report is based on inputs from over 1,000 leading global employers representing more than 14 million workers across 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. It examines the macro trends that will affect jobs, skills, and workforce transformation between 2025 and 2030. “Technological change, the green transition, economic uncertainty, geoeconomic fragmentation, and demographic shifts are reshaping the labour market,” the report said. The report predicts that 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030, while 92 million jobs will be displaced. This translates to a net gain of 78 million jobs in the next decade.FASTEST-GROWING JOB ROLES

 



Fastest growing jobs (Source: WEF Report)
 The rise of technology and digital access is driving demand for certain roles. According to the WEF report, the top five fastest-growing jobs by 2030 include Big Data Specialists, FinTech Engineers, AI & Machine Learning Specialists, Software & Applications Developers, and Security Management Specialists.  ""According to the surveyed executives, the fastestgrowing job roles by 2030, in percentage terms, tend to be driven by technological developments, such as advancements in AI and robotics and increasing digital access,"" the report mentioned.  These roles are experiencing rapid growth due to advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and digital technologies. Businesses are increasingly adopting these tools to enhance efficiency and innovation.FASTEST-DECLINING JOB ROLES

 



Fastest declining jobs (Source: WEF Report)
 On the other hand, traditional roles are expected to see significant declines, primarily due to automation and digitalisation. The top five fastest-declining jobs by 2030 are Postal Service Clerks, Bank Tellers & Related Clerks, Data Entry Clerks, Cashiers & Ticket Clerks and Administrative Assistants and Executive Secretaries.  ""By contrast, respondents expect the fastest declining roles to include various clerical roles, such as Cashiers and Ticket Clerks, alongside Administrative Assistants and Executive Secretaries, Printing Workers, and Accountants and Auditors,"" said the WEF report on jobs.  These roles are being phased out as automation, AI, and autonomous systems streamline routine tasks. Other contributing factors include slower economic growth and aging populations. Interestingly, farm workers are set to experience the largest job growth, with an additional 35 million jobs anticipated by 2030. This increase is driven by the green transition, which focuses on reducing carbon emissions and adapting to climate change. Other factors include broader digital access and the rising cost of living. Farm workers currently account for over 200 million jobs globally. As the workforce transforms, the demand for new skills will grow. Employers are focusing on reskilling and upskilling employees to adapt to technological advancements and shifting job markets. The report highlights that businesses must adopt proactive strategies to prepare for these changes, while employees should consider continuous learning to remain relevant in the evolving job landscape.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 9, 2025

While the idea may sound audacious, it has sparked discussions about the island’s value, strategic significance, and feasibility of such a purchase.GREENLAND’S PRICE TAG: FROM HISTORY TO MODERN ESTIMATES Trump’s fascination with Greenland isn’t without precedent. In 1946, President Harry Truman offered $100 million in gold—equivalent to $1.3 billion today—to purchase the icy expanse. Modern estimates, however, paint a vastly different picture. Greenland’s mineral wealth, including rare earth metals, copper, and cobalt, coupled with its strategic Arctic location, has pushed valuations between $230 million (based on Alaska’s 1867 price) to over $1.1 trillion. When accounting for infrastructure and economic integration, the total cost could soar to $1.5 trillion. Furthermore, compensating Greenland’s 57,000 residents for such a transition could add another $5.7 billion to $57 billion, depending on payout schemes.STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE  Trump has underscored Greenland’s strategic value, highlighting its role in Arctic trade routes and its proximity to geopolitical rivals Russia and China. However, Greenlandic and Danish leaders have firmly rejected the idea. Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Egede stated, “Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland. Our future is ours to shape.” while Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen highlighted respect for the island’s autonomy. Acquiring Greenland would require navigating complex international laws that prioritise self-determination, Greenlandic and Danish approval, and a robust treaty negotiation process. While Trump’s vision may remain an ambitious dream, Greenland’s significance as a resource-rich, strategically located island highlights its growing importance on the global stage. Whether for its minerals or its position in Arctic trade, Greenland’s future remains firmly in the hands of its people.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The absence of a GMP premium suggests a cautious investor sentiment, with many waiting to see how the units perform post-listing. While a positive GMP often indicates strong demand in the grey market, the flat trend in this case may reflect broader concerns over sector-specific risks and market conditions.SUBSCRIPTION STATUS ON DAY 3  At around 12:10 pm on day 3 of the bidding process, the Capital Infra Trust InvIT IPO had been subscribed by 86%. In total, bids have been placed for 2,36,96,850 units out of the total 8,83,83,750 units available, according to data from the NSE.

After Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy’s suggestion of a 70-hour work week sparked online debates, Subrahmanyan has taken it a step further, saying employees should clock 90 hours a week and maybe even give up Sundays. In a comment that’s now gone viral, Subrahmanyan asked employees, “How long can you stare at your wife?” urging them to spend less time at home and more at the office. Subrahmanyan’s comments came during an employee interaction where he was questioned about L&T's six-day workweek policy.

byu/5seb4C inIndiaCareers
 Responding to the query about why employees are required to work on Saturdays, Subrahmanyan expressed regret that he couldn’t mandate Sunday as a working day as well. In a video circulating on Reddit, he said, ""I regret I am not able to make you work on Sundays. If I can make you work on Sundays, I will be more happy, because I work on Sundays."" Subrahmanyan further questioned what employees do while staying at home. ""What do you do sitting at home? How long can you stare at your wife?"" he asked. ""Come on, get to the office and start working."" To support his views, Subrahmanyan shared an anecdote about a conversation he had with a Chinese individual. According to him, the person claimed that China could surpass the United States because Chinese workers put in 90 hours a week compared to the 50 hours worked by Americans. ""So that’s the answer for you. If you have got to be on top of the world, you have to work 90 hours a week. Get going, guys. Come on,"" Subrahmanyan said in the undated video. The video, which was first shared on Reddit, has gone viral, drawing criticism from netizens. Many users found Subrahmanyan’s comments inappropriate and compared them to the remarks made by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy last year. Murthy had suggested that young Indians should work 70 hours a week to help build the nation, which also faced widespread backlash. In the Reddit comments section, some users questioned Subrahmanyan’s understanding of work-life balance, while others criticised the broader culture of promoting overwork. Many felt his remarks trivialised employees' personal lives, with the comment about staring at one’s wife particularly drawing sharp responses.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Must Watch

Details hereThe Income Tax Department warns against excessive cash transactions, as violations can lead to heavy penalties.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/these-cash-transactions-may-trigger-100-percent-penalties-details-here-2662158-2025-01-09,"The Income Tax Department has issued a fresh reminder urging taxpayers to limit their use of cash in daily transactions. Cash remains popular in India due to its convenience, but certain cash dealings can lead to hefty penalties under the Income Tax Act, 1961. If cash transactions exceed specific thresholds, taxpayers may face disallowed deductions and penalties equal to the cash amount involved. Here’s a closer look at the rules you need to know to avoid penalties.CASH TRANSACTION LIMITS AND PENALTIES Loans, deposits, and advances (Section 269SS): You cannot accept loans, deposits, or specified sums in cash if the total amount is Rs 20,000 or more. Violating this limit attracts a penalty under Section 271D, equal to the cash accepted. However, exceptions include transactions involving the government, banks, and notified institutions. Receiving cash above Rs 2 lakh (Section 269ST): No individual can accept cash exceeding Rs 2 lakh from one person in a day, for a single transaction, or multiple transactions linked to one event. This rule applies even to fees, donations, or related-party transactions. Breaching this limit leads to a penalty under Section 271DA, equal to the amount received. Repayment of loans and deposits (Section 269T): Repaying loans, deposits, or specified advances in cash above Rs 20,000 is prohibited. Violations result in penalties under Section 271E, equal to the amount repaid in cash. Exceptions include repayments to government bodies, banks, or notified institutions.PROMOTING DIGITAL PAYMENTS To reduce reliance on cash, businesses with turnover exceeding Rs 50 crore must facilitate digital payment methods like UPI, NEFT, and RTGS. Failing to comply results in a Rs 5,000 daily penalty under Section 271DB. The government aims to reduce the risks of unaccounted money by discouraging cash transactions. By understanding these rules, taxpayers can avoid penalties and adopt digital financial systems for seamless and compliant transactions. Remember, staying informed about cash regulations can save you from unnecessary financial setbacks.

Assigning the company an ""Outperform"" rating with a target price of Rs 1,100, the report titled, ‘India Payments: From Disruption to Monetisation – Can Payments Be Profitable?’, highlights Paytm’s ability to monetise its core payments business despite the challenges posed by the zero-MDR (Merchant Discount Rate) environment. Bernstein’s analysis underscores Paytm’s potential for sustainable growth and profitability, citing key drivers of its success. The report points to Paytm’s strategic leverage of the growing adoption of credit payments on UPI rails, which typically offer higher margins compared to debit payments. RuPay credit card transactions through UPI now represent 30% of all credit card transactions, up sharply from just 10% in FY24. This shift toward credit-based payments has significantly bolstered Paytm’s profitability in the payments space. Bernstein also highlights the exponential growth in payment volumes through UPI, which continues to expand at an impressive rate of 40-50% year-on-year. Cashless payments now account for 50% of private consumption expenditure in India. Bernstein predicts that this could rise to 2-3 times private consumption expenditure, mirroring trends observed in markets like China. Paytm’s scale and reach in India position it well to capitalize on this massive growth opportunity. Paytm’s innovative revenue streams, such as devices like soundboxes, have emerged as a significant contributor to its margins. According to the report, nearly 50% of Paytm’s payment margins come from device-related revenues, showcasing the company’s ability to effectively monetise its growing payment volumes. Bernstein notes that such innovations have positioned Paytm ahead of its competitors in terms of sustainable profitability. The report also emphasises Paytm’s increased operating leverage resulting from higher transaction volumes. As cashless transactions continue to grow, the company is expected to benefit from economies of scale, allowing it to cover costs more efficiently. This increased operational efficiency further strengthens Paytm’s profitability. In addition to leveraging RuPay credit cards, Paytm has expanded its credit-based solutions to include UPI-linked credit lines and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) offerings. These innovative solutions enable Paytm to tap into new revenue streams and enhance its profit margins, highlighting its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market trends. Bernstein’s analysis portrays Paytm as a leader in India’s transition from payment disruption to monetisation. With diversified revenue streams, innovative products, and an ever-growing market share, Paytm is well-positioned to remain at the forefront of India’s digital payments revolution, the report indicated. The report also underscored the company’s potential to drive long-term profitability while maintaining its leadership in one of the world’s most dynamic fintech ecosystems.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Must Watch

""The top-line growth of the listed firms could remain subdued for the seventh quarter in a row while y-o-y margins could face pressure with a subdued 10% growth for the third consecutive quarter,"" she added.  Market trends indicate that certain sectors, including automobiles, banking, consumer staples, oil, and construction materials, may deliver subdued profits with limited growth, possibly remaining in the single digits. In contrast, industries like pharmaceuticals, real estate, capital goods, and telecommunications are expected to show robust growth in profit after tax (PAT). Despite these sectoral variations, the overall market sentiment is likely to remain weak, mainly due to continued selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs). So far this month, FIIs have sold shares worth Rs 11,931.91 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have managed to counterbalance the selling pressure by investing Rs 12,614.32 crore.

Over the years, the government has taken several steps to ease the tax burden and provide better financial opportunities for women. With more women entering the workforce and managing personal finances, this budget is expected to bring forth measures that foster greater financial independence and security.advertisementA BOOST TO WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSWith the rise of women entrepreneurs and their growing contribution to the economy, the Union Budget 2025 is expected to introduce tax reliefs that encourage female-led businesses. With the rise of women entrepreneurs and their growing contribution to the economy, the Union Budget 2025 is expected to introduce tax reliefs that encourage female-led businesses. Simplified tax compliance procedures, along with incentives for women to invest in startups, could be a key feature. Women-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs) may benefit from lower tax rates, easier access to financial resources, and a more conducive environment for business growth. These changes could significantly lower barriers for women entrepreneurs to thrive. Ridhima Kansal, Director of Rosemoore, believes that with the Union Budget 2025 approaching, women taxpayers are hopeful for measures that reduce their tax burden and enhance financial empowerment. She anticipates higher exemptions for retirement plans, education loans, and housing ETFs, as well as tax relief on restructuring costs to encourage greater female workforce participation.EASIER ACCESS TO CREDIT AND TAX INCENTIVES A significant focus of the upcoming budget is likely to be improving access to credit for women. Financial inclusion is a key priority, and the government may introduce schemes aimed at making credit more accessible to women entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals. Simplified loan processes and lower interest rates could be on the cards, enabling women to expand their businesses or pursue their professional goals. Additionally, targeted tax incentives for women could help reduce their financial burden. Expect possible tax breaks or rebates for women in higher income brackets, along with deductions for those investing in specific long-term savings plans. These measures will help women better plan for their future, particularly in terms of financial independence. Dimple Motwani, Co-Founder, Posh Pitara, stated, “Initiatives such as easier access to credit, targeted tax incentives, and streamlined compliance processes would go a long way in helping women-owned ventures flourish.” She further highlighted that government-backed skill-development mentorship programs could significantly empower women to innovate and compete on a global scale.RETIREMENT PLANS  As women increasingly take on roles as primary earners and caregivers, retirement security becomes more crucial. The budget might include provisions for better retirement plans tailored to women’s needs, including higher contributions or tax-free growth options. Such steps would ensure that women are better prepared for their golden years.HOUSING LOANS Another area of focus could be affordable housing. Women buyers may benefit from enhanced tax exemptions on home loans, making homeownership a more achievable goal. These initiatives would also encourage women to invest in long-term assets, contributing to their overall wealth-building strategy.EDUCATION LOANS AND EMPOWERMENT Education remains one of the most empowering tools for women. In line with the government’s ongoing push for women’s education, the budget could feature favourable tax incentives for education loans. This would not only make higher education more accessible but also equip women with the skills to thrive in a competitive job market. Mamta Shekhawat, the founder of Gradding.com, mentioned, “This budget is crucial as it presents an opportunity to empower women by creating a more equitable tax framework. Besides, it not only fosters economic independence but also removes barriers that limit women's potential.” The Union Budget 2025 has the potential to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem for women. With an emphasis on credit access, tax relief, and long-term financial planning, women taxpayers can look forward to more opportunities that foster growth, security, and independence.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Tune InMust Watch

With a blend of long-term stability, flexibility, and attractive tax benefits, PPF is a popular choice for risk-averse investors looking to plan their financial future.KEY FEATURES AND BENEFITS OF PPF PPF offers unmatched benefits for those seeking a reliable savings scheme. You can start investing with as little as Rs 500 annually, up to a maximum of Rs 1.5 lakh per year. The 15-year lock-in period ensures disciplined savings, and upon maturity, investors have the option to extend the tenure in 5-year blocks, making it a versatile tool for long-term wealth accumulation. One of its standout features is the tax treatment under the Exempt-Exempt-Exempt (EEE) regime, where the principal amount, interest earned, and maturity withdrawals are all tax-free. This makes PPF one of the most tax-efficient and attractive investment options for individuals.CURRENT INTEREST RATES AND WITHDRAWAL RULES As of January 2025, the PPF interest rate stands at 7.1% per annum, compounded annually. The rate is subject to quarterly revisions by the government, ensuring fair returns in line with market trends. Withdrawals are allowed after five years, subject to certain conditions. Upon maturity, investors can either withdraw the entire amount, retain the balance to earn interest, or extend the account in 5-year increments with or without additional deposits.INVESTING IN PPF: A SMART MOVE FOR THE FUTURE Opening a PPF account is simple and can be done through post offices, authorised bank branches, or online platforms. Regular contributions throughout the year can maximise interest earnings, encouraging disciplined financial planning. For instance, if you invest Rs 1.5 lakh annually at 7.1% interest over 15 years, you can accumulate approximately Rs 40.68 lakh, with Rs 18.18 lakh as interest earned. In other words, PPF stands as a reliable and tax-efficient investment option, providing individuals with a secure path to long-term financial growth and stability.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Must Watch

Wall Street banks, including industry giants like Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, are expected to cut up to 200,000 jobs over the next three to five years. The reason? AI is rapidly taking over tasks traditionally performed by human workers, particularly in back-office, middle-office, and operations roles. This shift is not just about cutting costs—it’s also about boosting productivity and profits.advertisementAI's IMPACT ON BANKING JOBSThe job cuts are largely expected to impact positions involving routine and repetitive tasks, such as customer service and know-your-customer (KYC) roles. The job cuts are largely expected to impact positions involving routine and repetitive tasks, such as customer service and know-your-customer (KYC) roles. According to Bloomberg Intelligence (BI), AI tools will streamline operations, leading to fewer human workers required for these functions. However, it’s important to note that while jobs will be transformed, they won’t be entirely eliminated. Tomasz Noetzel, BI’s senior analyst, pointed out that AI’s impact would primarily result in workforce transformation, not total job loss. The role of AI in customer service is particularly noteworthy, as bots are expected to handle more of the client-facing tasks, reducing the need for human intervention. Jobs that demand higher-level cognitive skills may be less vulnerable, but the overall trend is clear: the banking workforce will need to adapt to new technological realities.FINANCIAL GAINS DESPITE JOB LOSSES Despite the potential loss of jobs, the rise of AI is expected to have a positive effect on banks’ earnings. According to BI’s report, AI could increase bank profits by 12% to 17% by 2027, contributing as much as $180 billion to the industry’s bottom line. Eight out of ten surveyed respondents believe that generative AI will boost productivity and revenue generation by at least 5% in the next three to five years. While this transformation brings efficiency, it also prompts significant concerns about the future of work in banking.THE FUTURE OF WORK: A NEW ERA The rise of AI may lead to fewer jobs in traditional roles, but as industry leaders like JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon suggest, this shift will also improve the quality of life for workers, making their roles more efficient and less mundane. AI may eliminate certain positions, but it could also bring a future where work-life balance is vastly improved. As the banking sector adapts to this new technological wave, one thing is certain: the future of finance will be shaped by AI, with far-reaching consequences for both jobs and productivity.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 9, 2025Must Watch

Backed by the government, NSC offers stable returns and numerous benefits, making it a preferred choice for risk-averse investors.WHAT ARE NATIONAL SAVINGS CERTIFICATES? NSCs are fixed-income investment instruments introduced by the Government of India to encourage small savings among individuals. These certificates not only provide assured returns but also help investors save on taxes under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. With a maturity period of five years, NSCs are a reliable option for those looking to build a secure financial future.INTEREST RATE FOR JANUARY-MARCH 2025 For the January-March 2025 quarter, the interest rate on NSCs remains at 7.7% per annum, compounded annually. The rate is unchanged from the previous quarter, as per the announcement by the Department of Economic Affairs on December 31, 2024. This steady rate ensures consistent and attractive returns for investors. Upon maturity, the investment grows significantly, providing both principal and interest.KEY FEATURES OF NSC INVESTMENTS Eligibility: NSCs can be purchased by individuals, joint account holders (up to three adults), and guardians on behalf of minors or persons of unsound mind. Minors above 10 years can open an account in their own name. Investment limits: The minimum deposit is Rs 1,000, with further investments in multiples of Rs 100. There is no upper limit, and investors can open multiple accounts under the scheme. Pledging and transfer: NSC accounts can be pledged as security to authorities such as banks, cooperative societies, and housing finance companies. Transfers are allowed under specific conditions, such as the death of the account holder or by court order.TAX BENEFITS NSC deposits qualify for a deduction under Section 80C, up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year. In comparison to tax-saving fixed deposits, which offer rates ranging from 6.5% to 7.75% depending on the bank, NSC’s 7.7% rate remains highly competitive, especially for those seeking stable returns.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 9, 2025

However, mere tax deductions have had little impact on income and wealth inequality in India, which has only broadened in the last six decades.  Income is the money one earns over a period of time, while wealth is the total value of assets minus debts. About 11.4 per cent of India’s total wealth was in the hands of people in the bottom 50 per cent bracket in the year 1961; this nearly halved to 6.5 per cent in the year 2023, according to the World Inequality Database.

Most of the wealth lost was from the people in the middle 40 per cent group — falling from 43.7 to 29 per cent.
 


INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY Gradual income inequality has translated into a more stark wealth inequality in the country. While 57.7 per cent of income is in the hands of the top 10 per cent of people, 65 per cent of wealth lies with them. In contrast, only 15 per cent of income and 6.4 per cent of the country's wealth are within the bottom 50 per cent of people.

The bottom 50 per cent earned only Rs 71,163, the middle 40 per cent Rs 1.65 lakh, the top 10 per cent Rs 13.53 lakh, the top one per cent Rs 53 lakh, and the top 0.1 per cent Rs 2.25 crore. The top 0.01 per cent or nearly 92,234 people earned Rs 10.18 crore and the top 0.001 per cent earned Rs 48.52 crore. This means that the top 1 per cent of people have 75 times more income and 313 times more wealth than the bottom 50 per cent of people in India.
 


THE WAY AHEAD The World Inequality Lab suggests the skewed wealth distribution is a good reason to consider restructuring the tax code to account for both income and wealth. Moreover, it suggests that broad-based public investments in health, education and nutrition are needed to enable the average Indian, and not just the elites, to meaningfully benefit from the ongoing wave of globalisation. It adds that besides serving as a tool to fight inequality, a “super tax” of two per cent on the net wealth of the 167 wealthiest families in 2022-23 would yield 0.5 per cent of national income in revenues and create valuable fiscal space to facilitate such investments.

The company said that achieving extraordinary results requires extraordinary effort, particularly in a time when India is striving for progress. “Nation-building is at the core of our mandate. For over eight decades, we have been shaping India’s infrastructure, industries, and technological capabilities. We believe this is India’s decade, a time demanding collective dedication and effort to drive progress and realise our shared vision of becoming a developed nation,” said an L&T spokesperson. “The chairman’s remarks reflect this larger ambition.” During a recent interaction with employees, Subrahmanyan addressed the company’s six-day work week and expressed his belief in a more demanding schedule. “I regret I am not able to make you work on Sundays. If I can make you work on Sundays, I will be more happy, because I work on Sundays,” he said. He went on to make a contentious remark, asking, “What do you do sitting at home? How long can you stare at your wife? Come on, get to the office and start working.” Subrahmanyan also recounted a conversation with a Chinese individual who suggested that China could outpace the United States because Chinese workers clocked 90 hours a week, compared to the 50 hours worked by Americans. Using this as an example, he told employees, “If you have got to be on top of the world, you have to work 90 hours a week. Get going, guys.” The remarks, shared in an undated video that surfaced on Reddit, sparked widespread criticism online. Many users found the comments inappropriate and questioned the work-life balance implications. Critics drew parallels between Subrahmanyan’s statements and earlier remarks made by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, who had suggested that young Indians should work 70 hours a week to contribute to the nation’s growth. Murthy’s comments also faced backlash, with many arguing that such work expectations were unrealistic and harmful. The statements have reignited the ongoing debate on work-life balance in corporate India.  Shares of L&T closed 1.71% lower on Thursday at Rs 3,535.00.

The S&P BSE Sensex gained 206.33 points to 77,826.54, while the NSE Nifty50 added 45.90 points to 23,572.40 as of 9:19 AM.

Banking giants are expected to report strong results; however, the sector might not react positively due to ongoing selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs).

The S&P BSE Sensex hit a low of 77,099.55 in early trade, falling over 580 points from the previous day’s close. Nifty, too, fell sharply in early trade. At around 10:12 am, Sensex was trading 392.63 points lower at 77,227.58, while the Nifty50 tumbled 150 points to trade at 23,376.25. Most of the other broader market indices were also trading in negative territory as volatility continued to rise during the session. Today’s weakness on Dalal Street comes despite strong gains high-weightage IT stocks, which rose after Tata Consultancy Services’ Q3 results beat market expectations. With that said, here are three reasons why the stock market is falling today:Q3 EARNINGS WORRIES Even as TCS opened the Q3 earnings season on a positive note, the broader sentiment surrounding the third quarter results remains negative. For instance, Tata Elxsi shares fell over 7% today after reporting Q3 results as it missed street estimates. Several analysts have indicated that the Q3 results are unlikely to see any major improvement in comparison to the previous quarter and this is likely to dampen the mood on Dalal Street. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Since the results season has started the market will witness lots of stock-specific action in response to the results.”ANXIETY OVER DONALD TRUMP’S ACTIONS Another major factor behind the nervousness among investors is growing anxiety over Donald Trump’s likely actions when he takes charge as US President. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said, “Uncertainty around US Federal Reserve rate plans and President-elect Trump's policies continues to fuel market pessimism.” Vijayakumar also agreed and said, “In the context of the looming uncertainty regarding President Trump’s likely actions, the market is unlikely to rally in the near-term.”CONTINUED FII SELLING Last but not least, sustained selling by foreign institutional investors has kept the mood tense on Dalal Street. “There appears to be no respite to the sustained FII selling which touched Rs 7170 crores yesterday. This will continue to put pressure on the market,” Vijayakumar said, “Results of banking majors will be good but in the context of FII selling the sector may not perform in response to the results,” he added.

At the time of writing, the stock was trading at Rs 292.90, reflecting a 9.45% decline. The fall in shares came as the company’s two-day offer for sale (OFS) by promoter Adani Commodities LLP began. The stock has been under pressure recently, falling nearly 10% over the past five trading sessions and losing 12.28% over the last six months. The OFS floor price was set at Rs 275, a 15.11% discount to Thursday’s closing price of Rs 323.95 on the BSE. This steep discount weighed heavily on the stock, causing it to fall 9% during early trading. Over the past year, the stock has declined by 18.69%, and it has lost 47% of its value in the last two years. Adani Commodities LLP is offering up to 17,54,56,612 shares, which accounts for 13.50% of the total issued and paid-up equity share capital of Adani Wilmar. The OFS is open to non-retail investors today, while retail investors will have the opportunity to participate on Monday, January 13. Non-retail investors can also choose to carry forward their unallotted bids to Monday for allocation from the unsubscribed portion of the retail category. Additionally, Adani Commodities LLP has announced the option to sell up to 8,44,79,110 more shares, which represents 6.50% of the company’s equity share capital. If the oversubscription option is fully exercised, the total number of shares offered, including the base size and additional shares, will represent 20% of Adani Wilmar’s equity share capital. This amounts to 25,99,35,722 shares in total. Adani Enterprises, the parent company, plans to eventually sell its entire 44% stake in Adani Wilmar for an estimated $2.2 billion. Analysts believe this strategic move is aimed at improving liquidity within Adani Enterprises. Ventura Securities recently highlighted the potential benefits of this transaction. It suggested that the proceeds could be leveraged to secure additional debt, creating a corpus of Rs 50,000–52,000 crore. This would enable the group to strengthen its overall financial position and capital management. Adani Wilmar informed stock exchanges that the OFS is partly being undertaken to comply with regulatory requirements. As per Rule 19(2)(b) and Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, and Regulation 38 of Sebi's Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements, the company needs to meet the minimum public shareholding norms.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 10, 2025

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has proposed allowing couples to file income tax returns (ITRs) jointly under the New Tax Regime, providing relief to families with sole breadwinners and incentivising better tax compliance. This system, already popular in developed nations like the United States and the United Kingdom, could alleviate financial stress and simplify tax planning for Indian families.advertisementKEY FEATURES AND PROPOSED TAX SLABS  The ICAI's recommendations include a new set of tax slabs for joint filing, with no tax on income up to Rs 6 lakh, 5% for Rs 6–14 lakh, 10% for Rs 14–20 lakh, 15% for Rs 20–24 lakh, 20% for Rs 24–30 lakh, and 30% for income above Rs 30 lakh. Under this scheme, the basic exemption limit doubles to Rs 6 lakh for couples, compared to Rs 3 lakh for individual taxpayers under the current New Tax Regime. Salaried couples will benefit from individual standard deductions, while the surcharge threshold is proposed to increase from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore, with progressive surcharge rates applied to higher income brackets.HOW JOINT TAXATION BENEFITS FAMILIES  For households with a single earning member, the proposed joint taxation system addresses financial challenges by offering higher exemption limits and lower effective tax rates. This initiative aligns with global trends, recognising shared household responsibilities and reducing tax liability for middle-income families. Additionally, it could curb tax evasion practices such as income splitting by shifting tax liabilities to a unified framework. Dr. Suresh Surana, while speaking to Business Today, mentioned that ICAI's proposal seeks to ease financial pressures on families, particularly single-earner households. Taxpayers can opt for the default regime under Section 115BAC with a Rs 2.5 lakh exemption limit or Rs 3 lakh under the new regime, while dual-income couples can benefit individually.A STEP TOWARD MODERNISED TAXATION  The joint taxation proposal, if implemented, could transform India's tax landscape, aligning it with progressive global practices. By supporting families through flexible tax structures, this system could ease financial burdens, enhance compliance, and foster fairness in personal tax filings. As Budget 2025 nears, all eyes are on the government to see if this visionary reform becomes a reality, potentially changing the way Indian families plan their finances forever.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 10, 2025

At 10:40 am, Tata Elxsi share price was down 7% at Rs 5992.95. The stock had hit a 52-week low of Rs 5,924 in early trade.WEAK Q3 RESULTS Analysts attributed the decline to weaker-than-expected results across key business verticals and margin pressures stemming from currency fluctuations and salary hikes. The company’s transportation vertical witnessed modest growth, driven by large deal wins in Asia and Japan. However, the automotive segment in Europe and the US faced significant challenges, impacting the overall performance. Additionally, adverse currency movements and salary hikes weighed on the margins. Kotak Institutional Equities commented on the company’s weak quarterly performance, stating, “Tata Elxsi’s Q3 performance was weak, missing moderate expectations. Weakness was across verticals with a modest uptick in the healthcare vertical, while the transportation and media verticals were muted. EBIT margin declined 160 bps QoQ to 23.5%, impacted by a wage hike and currency headwinds.” The brokerage firm also noted that the near-term outlook remains subdued, primarily due to challenges in the automotive vertical, despite some positive signs in other segments.ANALYSTS CAUTIOUS Kotak revised its FY2025-27 EPS estimates downward by 7-11% and maintained a ‘Sell’ rating, lowering the fair value target to Rs 5,400 from Rs 5,600. Arihant Capital Markets highlighted the company’s growth strategies and said, ""Tata Elxsi aims to drive growth in India, Japan, and emerging markets while addressing challenges in Europe and anticipating recovery in the US. The company remains focused on operational efficiency, deal momentum in Media and Healthcare, and expanding in high-growth areas like connected vehicles and digital engineering.” While Tata Elxsi’s focus on emerging markets and operational efficiency offers hope, analysts remain cautious about the near-term demand outlook, especially in the automotive sector. Investors should closely monitor the company’s progress in overcoming these challenges and driving growth in key markets.

Strong Q3 results from TCS buoyed the IT sector stocks, helping it remain in green when all the sectoral indices struggled in early trade.  India’s largest IT services firm, TCS, reported a 12% year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, reaching Rs 12,380 crore, in line with market expectations. TCS’s revenue for the quarter stood at Rs 63,973 crore, marking a 5.6% YoY increase (4.5% in constant currency).   Nifty IT was up 2.16% as of 10:30 AM while other indices fell. Nifty Media took the biggest brunt falling close to 3%.  ""Since the results season has started the market will witness lots of stock-specific action in response to the results. Results of TCS indicate that the IT sector will continue to remain resilient,"" said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.  In a strong showing by the IT sector, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) led the pack with a substantial gain of 4.40%, followed by Larsen & Toubro Infotech (LTI Mindtree) which rose 3.50%. Tech Mahindra posted a healthy increase of 2.34%, while Wipro advanced by 1.97%. Persistent Systems gained 1.58%, and Mphasis climbed 1.31%. Infosys showed positive momentum with a 1.13% increase, while HCL Technologies rounded out the gains with a 0.77% rise. The overall Nifty IT index reflected this robust performance, moving up by 2.08%. Most of the other broader market indices were also trading in negative territory as volatility continued to rise during the session.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 10, 2025

Amid this uproar, his salary details for the fiscal year 2023-24 have drawn huge attention. Subrahmanyan earned Rs 51.05 crore during the period, a figure that is 534.57 times the median salary of L&T employees, which stands at Rs 9.55 lakh.advertisementBreakdown of Subrahmanyan's SalaryAccording to L&T’s Integrated Annual Report for 2023-24, the breakdown of Subrahmanyan’s Rs 51 crore salary is as follows:

Salary: Rs 3.60 crore
Perquisites: Rs 1.67 crore
Retirement Benefits: Rs 10.50 crore
Commission: Rs 35.28 crore
 His total remuneration of Rs 51.05 crore marks an increase of 43.11% from the previous year. The debate began when Subrahmanyan addressed employees during a recent town hall, defending the company’s six-day work week and advocating for an even more demanding schedule. “I regret I am not able to make you work on Sundays. If I can make you work on Sundays, I will be more happy, because I work on Sundays,” Subrahmanyan remarked in an undated video that surfaced on social media. He also made a contentious comment, saying, “What do you do sitting at home? How long can you stare at your wife? Come on, get to the office and start working.” Subrahmanyan further recounted a conversation with a Chinese individual, who told him that Chinese workers put in 90 hours a week compared to the 50 hours clocked by Americans. Using this as an example, he said to employees, “If you have got to be on top of the world, you have to work 90 hours a week. Get going, guys.” The remarks were met with widespread criticism, with social media users and notable personalities calling out the chairman for his comments. Actress Deepika Padukone and billionaire Harsh Goenka were among those who voiced disapproval. Some users highlighted the disparity between Subrahmanyan’s earnings and the average employee's salary, while others drew parallels to Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, who had earlier suggested a 70-hour work week for young Indians. One social media user commented, “And here I'm thinking L&T is a good company; seems like everyone's following Narayana Murthy's footsteps.” Another user remarked, “So unfortunate, we have such business leaders. I think we must call them ‘leaders in baby diapers.’” Some users noted that such remarks would never be directed at employees working in countries outside India. In response to the backlash, an L&T spokesperson issued a statement defending Subrahmanyan’s comments. “At L&T, nation-building is at the core of our mandate. The Chairman’s remarks reflect this larger ambition, emphasising that extraordinary outcomes require extraordinary effort,” the spokesperson said.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Must Watch

The S&P BSE Sensex rose 227.35 points to 77,847.56 by 11:39 am, while the NSE Nifty50 climbed 51.20 points to 23,577.70. Despite the rebound, sharp swings between gains and losses continued to dominate trading, leaving investors on edge. Broader market indices remained firmly in negative territory, highlighting persistent uncertainty on Dalal Street. Heavyweight IT stocks, including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra, surged up to 5%, lending support to the indices. However, market experts warned that deeper concerns, such as global uncertainty and sustained FII outflows, are still weighing heavily on investor sentiment. In this article, we will discuss the key factors driving market volatility and explore strategies investors can use to navigate these turbulent times.REASONS BEHIND MARKET VOLATILITY One of the primary reasons for today’s market swings is investor anxiety over the potential policy actions of US President-elect Donald Trump. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, explained, “Uncertainty around US Federal Reserve rate plans and President-elect Trump’s policies continues to fuel market pessimism.” Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, echoed this sentiment, adding, “In the context of the looming uncertainty regarding President Trump’s likely actions, the market is unlikely to rally in the near-term.” Additionally, sustained selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) has kept the market under pressure. FIIs pulled out Rs 7,170 crore yesterday, continuing a recent trend of large outflows. Anticipation of weaker Q3 corporate earnings has also contributed to heightened volatility. Vijayakumar pointed out that while IT companies like TCS delivered strong results, broader earnings expectations remain subdued, particularly in sectors like automotive and consumer goods.WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO?  Analysts advise investors to remain cautious and focus on stock-specific opportunities rather than broad market movements. “TCS’s results indicate that the IT sector will remain resilient,” said Vijayakumar. “Banking majors are likely to report good results, but the sector’s performance may be muted due to continued FII selling.” For those looking to invest during this volatile phase, Vijayakumar recommended focusing on sectors with strong growth potential. “Pharma and select auto stocks like Eicher Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), and Bajaj Auto are potential outperformers in a weak market,” he added. Simply put, while the market’s rebound offers some relief, investors should remain vigilant and consider sector-specific opportunities as uncertainty continues to dominate global and domestic markets.(Disclaimer: The views, opinions, recommendations, and suggestions expressed by experts/brokerages in this article are their own and do not reflect the views of the India Today Group.

With the January 11, 2025, deadline for December 2024 returns fast approaching, taxpayers and professionals are calling for urgent action. On 10 January, GSTN wrote on X, “GST portal is currently experiencing technical issues and is under maintenance. We expect the portal to be operational by 12:00 noon. CBIC is being sent an incident report to consider an extension of the filing date. Thank you for your understanding and patience!”

advertisementTECHNICAL ISSUES DISRUPT FILING PROCESSThe GSTN portal, essential for filing GST returns, has been under maintenance due to technical glitches. While the system is expected to be operational by noon on January 10, 2025, the disruption has hindered critical processes such as filing GSTR-1 returns, accessing older data, and replying to notices. The GSTN portal, essential for filing GST returns, has been under maintenance due to technical glitches. While the system is expected to be operational by noon on January 10, 2025, the disruption has hindered critical processes such as filing GSTR-1 returns, accessing older data, and replying to notices. Many tax experts have stressed the importance of having backup plans to avoid such disruptions from impacting the tax filing process.CALL FOR DEADLINE EXTENSION The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has yet to release a formal notification regarding an extension of the GSTR-1 filing deadline. However, GSTN has submitted an incident report to CBIC, requesting a possible extension. Industry experts suggest extending the deadline to January 13, 2025, to accommodate affected taxpayers, especially as January 11 falls on a Saturday, a non-working day for many multinational companies.IMPACT ON INPUT TAX CREDIT  Delays in filing GSTR-1 can have a cascading effect on businesses. GSTR-1 data is crucial for generating GSTR-2B, which enables buyers to claim Input Tax Credit (ITC). A delay in GSTR-1 filing postpones GSTR-2B generation, potentially depriving buyers of timely ITC claims. This could lead to cash flow disruptions for companies with significant input purchases, as they may need to pay GST liabilities in cash until ITC is credited in subsequent periods. As businesses await a formal announcement from CBIC, the hope is for swift resolution and a more resilient system to ensure seamless tax compliance. For now, taxpayers and professionals alike remain on edge, navigating these unforeseen challenges.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Trending Reel

This growth demonstrates the increasing confidence of both domestic and global investors in the company’s financial trajectory and innovative business model in India’s thriving fintech landscape. Domestic mutual funds emerged as key contributors to this rise, boosting their stake by 3.3% to 11.2%. Among the notable changes, Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund increased its holding to 2.1%, showcasing strong faith in Paytm’s growth prospects. Nippon Mutual Fund maintained its consistent position with a 2% stake, while Mirae Asset, despite a slight reduction, retained a substantial 4.2%, reflecting continued trust in the company’s fundamentals. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) also contributed to this upward trend, with their shareholding increasing by 0.7%. FPI holdings rose from 115 million to 119 million shares, while the number of FPI entities investing in Paytm grew by 20 to reach 237. This uptick underscores the growing global interest in Paytm’s scalable and innovative approach to financial services. Bernstein’s report India Payments: From Disruption to Monetization – Can Payments Be Profitable? positions Paytm as a leader in India’s transition from a disruptive payments ecosystem to one focused on monetisation. The report credits Paytm’s ability to monetise its ecosystem through strategies like device-driven revenues, credit-based payment innovations, and increasing operating leverage as factors that set it apart in the industry. With UPI adoption continuing to grow, alongside innovations such as UPI Lite and credit-linked UPI transactions, Paytm is expected to sustain its profitability and competitive edge in the rapidly evolving fintech market. Paytm’s progress toward achieving EBITDA before ESOP breakeven by Q4 FY2025 further reinforces its strong fundamentals and appeal to institutional investors.

With inflation and the rising cost of living eroding their fixed incomes, this group anticipates measures to ease financial pressures and enhance their quality of life.CHALLENGES FACED BY SENIOR CITIZENS Senior citizens often rely on fixed-income investments or rental income to sustain themselves. However, these sources fall short of keeping pace with inflation, leading to financial struggles. Restricted incomes necessitate targeted tax relief and financial support to help this vulnerable group manage their expenses effectively.NOTABLE REFORMS IN BUDGET 2024 Last year’s budget introduced several changes tailored to senior citizens. The standard deduction for family pensioners increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000, providing much-needed relief. Salaried employees and pensioners also benefited from an increased deduction limit of Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime. Senior citizens continue to enjoy higher exemption limits in both the old and new tax regimes. For instance, the new regime exempts income up to Rs 3 lakh, compared to Rs 2.5 lakh for regular taxpayers under the old regime.ITR FILING MADE SIMPLER Section 194P, introduced in Budget 2024, simplified the tax filing process for senior citizens aged 75 and above. Those meeting specific conditions—such as receiving income solely from pensions and interest—are exempt from filing income tax returns. Specified banks handle tax deductions, ensuring compliance without the need for additional filings.TAXATION OF PENSION INCOME Pension taxation varies based on its nature. While uncommuted pensions are fully taxable as salary, commuted pensions enjoy exemptions. For government employees, the commuted pension is entirely tax-free. Private-sector retirees benefit from partial exemptions depending on gratuity receipts.WHAT TO EXPECT FROM BUDGET 2025? With inflationary pressures mounting, senior citizens hope the upcoming budget will introduce broader exemptions and enhanced benefits. Measures to reduce tax liabilities and increase deductions could significantly alleviate financial strain. As Budget 2025 approaches, the hope is clear: a financial framework that not only addresses immediate challenges but also ensures long-term security for India’s senior citizens. The promise of ageing with dignity and stability is one that cannot be overlooked.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 10, 2025

While hopes run high for transformative announcements, many believe this budget may tread a cautious and familiar path.NO MAJOR CHANGES IN THE OLD TAX REGIME Taxpayers hoping for substantial alterations in the old tax regime may need to temper their expectations. While the government has consistently pushed for tax rationalisation, significant modifications have already been introduced in previous budgets, particularly in capital gains tax. This year, only minor adjustments are anticipated, leaving the old tax slabs largely untouched. The focus, instead, might lean towards encouraging taxpayers to migrate to the new tax regime.STANDARD DEDUCTION LIKELY TO REMAIN SAME  One of the most discussed aspects of the new tax regime is the standard deduction of Rs 75,000. Despite its popularity amongst taxpayers, there’s little indication that this amount will see an increase in Budget 2025. The government’s approach appears to balance providing relief to taxpayers while maintaining its fiscal prudence. As a result, any significant hike in this deduction seems unlikely.NO MAJOR CHANGES IN TAX STRUCTURE Tax rationalisation has been a recurring theme in recent budgets, with notable updates to capital gains tax in the previous year. This time, however, significant tax reforms or overhauls seem unlikely. Instead, taxpayers can anticipate minor adjustments aimed at fine-tuning existing policies rather than introducing sweeping changes. This aligns with the government's focus on maintaining stability while gradually optimising revenue streams.FOCUS ON FISCAL DISCIPLINE OVER BIG BANG ANNOUNCEMENTS The government is likely to prioritise fiscal consolidation, continuing its commitment to maintaining a disciplined approach to public finances. Alekh Yadav, Head of Investment Products at Sanctum Wealth, anticipates a largely conservative approach. He said, “We anticipate this budget will largely mirror previous ones, with few significant changes expected. The government is likely to maintain its focus on fiscal consolidation, as seen in prior budgets. While capital expenditure will remain a priority, we foresee limited potential for substantial growth in this area.” He added, “The government has also emphasised tax rationalisation, with notable changes to capital gains tax last year. We expect only minor adjustments this time around, rather than any major shifts. Additionally, there may be measures aimed at boosting consumption.”CONSUMPTION BOOSTS WITH CAUTION Although measures to spur consumption could make their way into the budget, these are expected to be incremental rather than transformative. The focus will likely be on targeted incentives and sector-specific support rather than widespread stimulus packages. Sheetal Malpani, CIO & Head of Equity, Tamohara Investment Managers, mentioned, “Given the cyclical slowdown in the economy and possible uncertainty on US policies under the Trump presidency, the budget takes more importance. On one hand, we anticipate fiscal measures to push growth, but on the other hand, given the slowdown in GDP growth and rupee depreciation, the fiscal deficit may overshoot, so a fine balance needs to be made."" As the countdown to February begins, it’s clear that Budget 2025 is shaping up to be steady rather than sensational. By prioritising fiscal discipline and measured reforms, the government aims to strike a balance between stability and progress. While bold announcements may be off the table, the budget’s focus on gradual, strategic initiatives could still pave the way for long-term economic resilience. In other words, as Budget 2025 unfolds, it may prove to be a steady yet uneventful affair, prioritising fiscal stability over bold reforms.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Closing at 85.9650, the rupee marked its tenth consecutive weekly loss, slipping 0.2% this week amid a strong dollar and persistent capital outflows. The rupee has been under pressure for weeks due to a surging dollar index, which remained above the 109 mark on Friday, and investor concerns over U.S. labour market data. Traders are bracing for the psychologically significant breach of the 86 level, with one foreign bank trader suggesting it could happen “sooner rather than later.”WILL RUPEE'S WEAK RUN CONTINUE? The dollar's strength is largely attributed to expectations of slower rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, reported news agency Reuters. ING Bank noted that strong jobs data could push markets to delay pricing in rate cuts, further strengthening the greenback. The US non-farm payrolls data, released later on Friday, is expected to provide crucial cues for the Fed’s next moves, keeping global markets on edge. The Reuters report also added that The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stepped in to curb excessive volatility, with state-run banks reportedly selling dollars on behalf of the central bank. These routine interventions have helped moderate the rupee’s decline but have not been enough to prevent its steady slide. In addition to the stronger dollar, foreign investors have withdrawn over $3 billion from Indian stocks and bonds this month, contributing to the rupee's depreciation. The sell-off has been driven by concerns over the new US President’s policies, which have boosted U.S. bond yields and increased the appeal of dollar-denominated assets. The rupee's volatility has also climbed in recent weeks, coinciding with the change of leadership at the RBI.

The decision provides temporary relief to the gaming sector while safeguarding the interests of the revenue department. The next hearing on the matter is scheduled for March 18, 2025.advertisementRELIEF FOR GAMING SECTOR AND REVENUE DEPARTMENTThe stay has been welcomed by both online gaming companies and the revenue department, albeit for different reasons. For gaming platforms, the ruling shields them from immediate coercive actions, allowing a fair hearing to contest the hefty tax demands. The stay has been welcomed by both online gaming companies and the revenue department, albeit for different reasons. For gaming platforms, the ruling shields them from immediate coercive actions, allowing a fair hearing to contest the hefty tax demands. Meanwhile, the revenue department gains assurance that the notices will not become time-barred during the legal process. This case hinges on the interpretation of GST applicability to the online gaming industry. The government asserts that a 28% GST should be levied on the total contest entry amount, including the prize pool. However, gaming companies argue that the tax should only apply to platform fees or commissions, highlighting that many games are skill-based rather than chance-based.INDUSTRY AWAITS LEGAL CLARITY Abhishek A. Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers and legal representative for gaming companies in the Supreme Court, highlighted the case's potential to reshape taxation in India's online gaming industry. He noted that the Supreme Court has ordered the consolidation of cases involving multiple gaming companies, with the next hearing scheduled for March 18, 2025. This timeline, he stated, allows stakeholders to present their arguments and enables the judiciary to address the key issues in this significant taxation dispute. The GST Council’s amendment effective October 1, 2023, has been a point of contention, with gaming companies asserting that retrospective application of the law is unjustified. Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner at EY, highlighted the importance of due process and transparency, noting that the March hearing will play a pivotal role in shaping a fair taxation framework for the burgeoning online gaming sector. As the online gaming sector awaits the Supreme Court’s final decision, this legal battle underscores the complexities of regulating a rapidly evolving industry. The March 2025 hearing promises to set a precedent that could redefine taxation norms for years to come, ensuring clarity for both businesses and policymakers.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Trending Reel

L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan made waves by suggesting employees should work on Sundays. Last year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy proposed that millennials work 70-hour weeks to improve India's productivity.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/industry-leaders-lt-chairman-sn-subrahmanyan-infosys-narayana-murthy-90-hour-workweek-more-pay-labour-laws-2662833-2025-01-10,"Ninety-hour workweeks, no Sundays and bosses continuing to push for more hours - sounds like a nightmare? Well, some top industry leaders believe it's the key to boosting productivity, and they’re not holding back in saying so. The latest entrant to that list is L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan. He fired a fresh controversy, saying that employees should work on Sundays too. ""What do you do sitting at home? How long can you stare at your wife?” he asked, jokingly urging people to “get to the office.” The offhand comment turned into a full-blown debate on whether the 9-to-5 routine should be stretched and what it would mean for work-life balance. Subrahmanyan, though, is not the first one to have made such remarks. Infosys co-founder N Narayana Murthy said last year that millennials need to put in 70 hours of work a week to boost India's work productivity. His remarks sparked widespread criticism and a national discourse on work-life balance. PAY GAP AMONG CXOs AND EMPLOYEES While India Inc. leaders have advocated for an increase in working hours, none of them have talked about the pay gap and proposed linking wages to work hours.  SN Subrahmanyan earned Rs 51.05 crore for FY24, a figure that is 534.57 times the median salary of L&T employees, which stands at Rs 9.55 lakh. While his salary saw an increase of 43.11% from the previous year, there was an increase of 1.32% only in the median remuneration of L&T employees as per L&T’s Integrated Annual Report for 2023-24.  This reflects a huge pay disparity and the trend appears to be the same across the white-collar job industry in India.  The salaries of chief executives at India’s leading IT firms have skyrocketed by over 160% in the past five years, whereas entry-level employees have experienced only marginal pay growth of under 4% during the same time, as per data collected by Moneycontrol. In the financial year 2024 (FY24), the median annual salary of the CEOs at top IT companies such as TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra rose to nearly Rs 84 crore. In contrast, the median salary offered to freshers increased from Rs 3.6 lakh to Rs 4 lakh over the same period, reflecting a modest 4% rise. This contrast in pay begs the question - is the demand from top industry leaders justifiable? India Today Digital spoke with experts about laws in India on work hours and if there was a need for more pay on the table when work included more than the specified working hours. WHAT ARE THE LAWS ABOUT WORKING HOURS IN INDIA? There are no specific laws that protect or regulate white-collar/corporate job employees in India.  ""Considering the statement made, India should establish specific laws and regulate working hours and pay linked to overtime for white collar/corporate employees, to prevent exploitation. Indians have been known to be exploited under the guise of work hours. This will align with the global standards work-life balance,"" said Alay Razvi, Managing Partner, Accord Juris.  However, there are certain labour laws crafted to protect the interests of both workers and employers, ensuring fairness and balance in the workplace. Rishi Agrawal, CEO and co-founder of Teamlease Regtech said that the current labour laws in India mandate a working individual not to work more than 9 hours a day and 48 hours a week, including one hour of rest or a meal break. Employees who work overtime should be paid twice the regular hourly wage. ""The Factories Act, 1948 applies to all factories, Shops and Establishment Act regulates the payment of wages, hours of work, leave, holidays, terms of service and other work conditions of people employed in the shop and commercial establishments. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948 applies to the entire country and aims to protect the interests of workers by ensuring minimum wages are paid for scheduled employment. There are sectors to which only central rules are applicable and others are subjected to state-specific rules. For example sectors like railways, banking and insurance, telecommunications, airports and aviation, defense establishments come under the central jurisdiction,"" he added.  However, white-collar workers, including CXOs, follow the terms of their employment contracts, while others are covered by labour laws. Central government employees are excluded from these laws, and railway employees need central government approval for them to apply. A 70- or 90-hour work week would break India’s labour laws, which cap weekly work hours at 48 under the Factories Act, 1948, and the Shops and Establishments Act. Overtime is allowed but must be paid at double the regular wage, and total daily work hours, including overtime, can’t exceed 12. ""The OSH Code of 2020, not yet implemented, also sticks to these limits but raises quarterly overtime to 125 hours from 50. Continuous work beyond five hours is prohibited without a break. Such long weeks would breach both national laws and international labour standards,"" said Agrawal. SHOULD EMPLOYEES BE PAID FOR EXTRA HOURS?  When work hours are over and above the norm, there must be a provision for such overtime and fair compensation or benefits for that. ""Fairness and satisfaction are of the utmost importance, and overall well-being is improved, so the need is to compensate fairly for the extra hours, balance between pay and well-being, and keep it transparent and proper communication,"" said Tanya Parwani, Senior HR, Gradding.com.  She further added that in addition to this, ensuring fairness in job distribution requires longer working hours to be balanced by increases in pay or other forms of benefit. It's not just monetary rewards; it will also give them a sense of being valued. The debate over extended working hours in India's corporate sector has laid bare a stark reality: while industry leaders push for longer workweeks, the fundamental issues of fair compensation and work-life balance remain unaddressed.  As India aims to position itself as a global economic powerhouse, the path forward may not lie in stretching workdays to its limits, but in creating a workplace culture that values both productivity and employee wellbeing.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 10, 2025Must Watch

The Bengaluru-based firm accused its US-based rival of contractually restricting clients from awarding IT services to competitors and withholding software training, which Infosys claims hindered its ability to compete. The lawsuit comes after Cognizant's subsidiary TriZetto sued Infosys in August last year, accusing the Indian IT giant of misappropriating trade secrets related to its healthcare insurance software. TriZetto’s Facets and QNXT platforms, widely used by healthcare insurers to automate administrative tasks, were central to the initial legal dispute.WHY HAS INFOSYS FILED COUNTER LAWSUIT?  In its counterclaim, Infosys accused Cognizant of deliberately recruiting its senior executives, including S Ravi Kumar, who was appointed CEO of Cognizant in 2023. Infosys claims this slowed the development of its competing software, Infosys Helix. The counterclaim seeks three times the damages incurred, along with attorney fees, though the total amount has not been disclosed. Responding to the allegations, Cognizant stated it would take firm action, maintaining that Infosys had improperly used its intellectual property. “Cognizant encourages competition, but competitors cannot use Cognizant’s IP to unfairly compete, as Infosys has done,” the company said in a statement. Infosys declined to comment when approached by news agency Reuters. The dispute escalated with TriZetto’s claim that Infosys had repackaged its proprietary data into an Infosys product under the guise of “Test Cases for Facets.” Infosys countered by arguing that Cognizant’s anti-competitive actions, including restrictive contract clauses, were impeding fair competition in the IT services sector. The case, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, has drawn attention due to its potential implications for the competitive landscape of the global IT industry. With both companies accusing each other of misconduct, the legal battle is expected to intensify as it unfolds.With inputs from ReutersPublished By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 11, 2025Must Watch

While a slowdown in the ongoing financial year was anticipated, the steep downward revision in GDP growth for FY25 has surprised many. Concerns over economic growth have intensified, with India’s GDP projected to slow sharply to 6.4% in FY25, according to the government’s first advance estimates. This marks a significant drop from the 8.2% growth recorded in FY24 and represents the slowest expansion in four years.advertisementINDIA INC SEEKS MAJOR REFORMSThe corporate sector is pinning its hopes on the upcoming budget. Amit Modi, director of County Group, highlighted the real estate industry's pressing needs. The corporate sector is pinning its hopes on the upcoming budget. Amit Modi, director of County Group, highlighted the real estate industry's pressing needs. “One of the most long-standing demands is granting industry status to enable easier access to low-cost financing, which directly benefits consumers. Additionally, implementing single-window clearance is crucial for timely project completion and cost efficiency,” Modi said. He further added, “Reintroducing GST input credits for residential real estate will stabilise costs. We also expect the home loan interest exemption to be increased to Rs 8 lakh annually to support first-time buyers, while Section 80C should either exclusively cover housing loan principal deductions or have its limit raised to Rs 5 lakh.”REAL ESTATE AWAITS RELIEF The real estate sector, grappling with challenges, anticipates significant measures to aid the middle class and the industry. Sachin Gawri, founder and CEO of RISE Infraventures, addressed the sector’s expectations. “Real estate reflects India’s economic progress, yet significant untapped potential remains. Budget 2025 should address high input costs by extending input tax credits and reducing GST on materials,” Gawri said. He suggested revising the affordable housing definition to Rs 80 lakh, reintroducing a 100% tax holiday for such projects, and creating new land banks to boost supply. “Combining home loan principal and interest deductions with a Rs 5 lakh cap would ease homeownership. Additionally, reducing the long-term capital gains holding period to two years, raising Section 54EC exemptions to Rs 1 crore, and expanding REIT benefits will spur investments,” he added.STARTUPS SEEK SUPPORT The startup ecosystem, a critical driver of job creation, faces hurdles that need immediate attention. Sumit Singh, CEO and co-founder of DashLoc, outlined the sector’s expectations from the budget. “As the Union Budget 2025 approaches, it is crucial for the government to focus on bolstering the startup ecosystem by reducing regulatory complexities, which often hinder growth,” Singh said. He proposed establishing dedicated IT software parks to provide essential infrastructure and foster innovation. “Simplifying access to loans through banks and government-backed schemes will ensure startups can secure funding more efficiently, enabling them to scale and contribute significantly to the economy,” Singh added.HEALTHCARE DEMANDS INCREASED FOCUS Although the world has largely overcome the Covid-19 pandemic, HMPV infections have raised fresh alarms. The healthcare sector is calling for increased investments and policies to address systemic gaps. Dr Pravin Gupta, principal director and chief of neurology at Fortis Hospital, stressed the need for a roadmap. “We expect a clear plan to increase public healthcare spending. Strategic investments coupled with supportive policies can bridge the rural-urban divide and ensure access to critical care, especially in underserved regions,” he said. Dr Ashish Chaudhari, managing director at Aakash Healthcare, echoed similar sentiments. “Reinstating the 150% deduction under Section 35AD of the Income Tax Act for new healthcare projects and providing tax holidays for a minimum of 15 years for new projects, alongside a 10-year tax relief for existing facilities, are key demands,” Chaudhari said. “These measures will ease the financial burden on healthcare providers and ensure cost savings are passed on to patients, making healthcare more affordable,” he added. With stakeholders across sectors voicing their concerns and expectations, the Union Budget 2025 holds the promise of addressing critical issues and driving India’s economic recovery.Published By: Devika BhattacharyaPublished On: Jan 11, 2025Tune InMust Watch

While the broader market struggled, the IT sector provided a silver lining on Friday, supported by optimism from sector-leader Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Despite the IT sector’s performance, Sensex and Nifty ended in the red after encountering high volatility throughout Friday’s session. Will the turbulence continue to plague Dalal Street investors next week? Here are 4 things you need to know:NIFTY AND NIFTY BANK LIKELY TO BE UNDER PRESSURE The Nifty50 closed 573 points lower at 23,431.50 last week, slipping below its 21-week and daily EMAs. According to Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, ""The index now rests at a crucial support zone of 23,200–23,300, which has historically provided a strong floor. A breach below this could accelerate selling, potentially pulling the Nifty toward 22,900."" On the upside, Singhania sees 23,850 as a critical resistance. “This level offers an ideal shorting opportunity, but a sustained move above it could trigger an upside rally toward 24,200,” he added. Bank Nifty, which plunged 4.42%, is also in a vulnerable position, having broken below the 50,000 mark. ""The index is in a sell-on-rise trend, with Fibonacci support at 48,300,"" Singhania noted. ""A breach below this could result in an additional 1,000-point drop. Traders can use 49,500 as a stop-loss for any short positions.""GLOBAL FACTORS, FII SELLING Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled $2.2 billion from Indian markets in January, driven by a strengthening dollar and rising US bond yields. These factors and subdued Q3 earnings expectations have dampened investor sentiment.IT SECTOR LIKELY TO GAIN Amid the sell-off, IT stocks emerged as an outlier, with the Nifty IT index gaining 2% last week. TCS surged 5.6% on Friday after expressing optimism about a demand revival in North America. According to analysts, the IT sector may continue to see a positive run due to the boost provided by the Q3 results of the country’s largest IT services firm.WHAT SHOULD BE YOUR TRADING STRATEGY?  Singhania advised that with the Nifty at a critical juncture, traders should closely monitor the 23,200–23,300 support zone. He noted that a breach below this could signal further downside, while any bounce near 23,850 may present a shorting opportunity. He added that Bank Nifty’s support at 48,300 will also be key. Simply put, investors should remain cautious and try for a risk-managed approach in the coming sessions.

His remarks, including, “how long can you stare at your wife,” drew massive criticism online and led to fresh discussions on the importance of work-life balance.  Following his comments, Subrahmanyan’s hefty remuneration package of Rs 51.05 crore in 2023-24 also came under the spotlight. This was because it was 534.57 times the median pay of L&T employees. It may be noted that even L&T issued a statement defending its chairman. However, prominent industry leaders have since voiced their opinions, opposing the idea of an excessively long workweek. RPG Enterprises Chairman Harsh Goenka expressed his disapproval on X, stating, “90 hours a week? Why not rename Sunday to ‘Sun-duty’ and make ‘day off’ a mythical concept!” He also stressed the fact that success stems from working smart, not excessive hours, adding, “Work-life balance isn’t optional, it’s essential. Well, that’s my view! #WorkSmartNotSlave.” Marico Ltd Chairman Harsh Mariwala shared similar views. He said, ""Undeniably, hard work is the backbone of success, but it is not about the hours clocked in. It’s about the quality and passion one brings to those hours.” Mariwala said young professionals thrive when placed in roles that foster growth and learning. “When an individual sees a path where hard work translates to a promising future, they are naturally inclined to give their best,” he said. He also spoke about the need for organisational cultures built on transparency and trust. “The ultimate objective should be to make work so invigorating and rewarding that the paradigm of work-life balance seamlessly integrates,” he added. Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, joined the debate, suggesting, “Let it start from the top, and if [it works] as a Proof of Concept, then implement it further down.” He called the practice of measuring work hours “archaic and regressive.” The controversy follows similar comments from Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, who last year suggested youngsters should work 70-hour weeks, an idea backed by Ola founder Bhavish Aggarwal. In contrast, the second-richest man in India, billionaire industrialist Gautam Adani, also shared his views on work-life balance recently. In an interview, Adani said, “Your idea of work-life balance should not be imposed on me, and my work-life balance shouldn’t be imposed on you.” Adani suggested that individuals find their own balance but recommended spending at least four hours with family. ""The thing is, you should see how much time can you take out for family and if you are happy, and your family is happy with it, it should be fine,"" Adani said.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/new-us-sanctions-threaten-russias-oil-trade-with-india-china-oil-prices-may-go-up-report-2663810-2025-01-13,"New US sanctions on Russian oil producers and ships are expected to disrupt Russia’s oil trade with India and China, two of its largest customers, according to a report by news agency Reuters. This development may lead to higher oil prices and increased freight costs for both countries as they look to source oil from alternative markets. The US Treasury announced tougher sanctions on Friday, targeting major Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 ships involved in transporting Russian oil. These measures aim to cut into the revenues Russia uses to fund its war in Ukraine. The targeted ships played a huge role in shifting Russian oil exports from Europe to Asia after the Group of Seven countries imposed a price cap on Russian oil in 2022. Some of these ships were also used to transport oil from Iran, which is already under US sanctions. The new sanctions are likely to severely affect Russia’s oil exports, as many tankers previously used for shipments to India and China will now face restrictions. According to industry sources, Chinese independent refiners may be forced to cut their refining output due to supply disruptions. This development has already pushed global oil prices higher, with Brent crude trading above $81 a barrel on Monday, reaching its highest level in months. The sanctions cover 143 oil tankers that handled over 530 million barrels of Russian crude last year, amounting to 42% of Russia’s total seaborne oil exports. Of this, approximately 300 million barrels were shipped to China, with the majority of the remainder going to India, according to Kpler’s lead freight analyst, Matt Wright. A Singapore-based trader told Reuters that these tankers shipped about 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Russian crude to China over the past year, warning that this trade could see a significant drop. India and China have been major buyers of Russian oil, with India’s imports of Russian crude rising by 4.5% year-on-year to 1.764 million bpd for the first 11 months of last year. This accounted for 36% of India’s total oil imports. China’s imports, including pipeline supplies, increased by 2% to 99.09 million metric tonnes (approximately 2.159 million bpd), representing 20% of its total imports during the same period. While India mainly buys Russia’s Urals crude, China prefers ESPO Blend crude, which is often sold above the G7-imposed price cap. Analysts suggest that if the sanctions are strictly enforced, Russian ESPO Blend crude exports could halt entirely. The sanctions are expected to push India and China to source oil from other regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas. This shift has already led to a rise in spot prices for oil grades from these regions. An Indian oil refining official said that the country may need to increase its reliance on oil from the Middle East and potentially the US. “There is no option but to go for Middle Eastern oil. Perhaps we may have to go for US oil as well,” the official told Reuters. Analysts also believe that Russian oil prices may drop below $60 a barrel to allow Moscow to continue using Western insurance and shipping services. Experts predict that the demand for Middle Eastern oil will intensify as Indian and Chinese refiners seek alternatives. This could lead to a tighter Brent-Dubai price spread, with prices for February-loading cargoes like Oman or Murban oil expected to rise due to aggressive bidding.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Must Watch

However, investors may need to lower their expectations due to a decline in the grey market premium (GMP) ahead of the listing. The correction in broader market trends has impacted sentiments, even though the IPO had seen strong subscription during its bidding phase. As of Monday morning, the shares of Standard Glass Lining Technology were commanding a grey market premium of Rs 50 in the unofficial market. This suggests potential listing gains of around 35.71% for investors, based on the upper price band of the IPO at Rs 140. This is a huge drop from the GMP of Rs 90-95 recorded on the final day of bidding, signalling reduced enthusiasm among investors. Standard Glass Lining share price IPO was open for subscription from January 6 to 8, offering shares in a price band of Rs 133-140 with a lot size of 107 shares.  The Hyderabad-based company raised Rs 410.05 crore through the IPO, which included a fresh issue of Rs 210 crore and an offer-for-sale (OFS) of Rs 200.05 crore by existing shareholders. The issue received an overwhelming response, being subscribed 183.18 times overall. The allocation for qualified institutional bidders (QIBs) was subscribed 331.60 times. The non-institutional investors (NIIs) portion was subscribed 268.50 times. The retail investors’ portion was subscribed 64.99 times. This strong subscription indicates high demand for the shares, particularly from institutional investors. Incorporated in September 2012, Standard Glass Lining Technology is an engineering equipment manufacturer catering to the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors in India. The company provides turnkey solutions, which include design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly, installation, and preparation of standard operating procedures for its clients. Its expertise in engineering equipment makes it a key player in these sectors, which are critical to the country’s economy. Brokerage firms have been largely positive about the IPO. They advised investors to subscribe, citing the company’s strong fundamentals, robust demand in its target sectors, and growth potential. IIFL Securities and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors were the book-running lead managers for the IPO, while Kfin Technologies acted as the registrar. The shares are set to list on both the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

SBI Life Insurance Company declined by 1.90%, followed by Mahindra & Mahindra which slipped 1.77%. Wipro rounded out the major losers with a decline of 1.61%. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that market will continue to be under pressure from the many strong headwinds.KEY REASONS FOR STOCK MARKET FALL  Rupee hits a record low - The Indian rupee crashed 23 paise to a historic low of 86.27 against the US dollar in early trade. This drop came after stronger-than-expected US jobs data dampened hopes for significant interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2025. The rupee opened at 86.2050 against Friday’s close of 85.9650. A weak rupee increases import costs, particularly for crude oil, and adds to inflationary pressures in the economy. US jobs data and rate concerns - The US added 2.56 lakh jobs in December, far exceeding expectations of 1.65 lakh. This pushed the US unemployment rate down to 4.1%. While this highlights a strong US economy, it has led to reduced expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “The robust US jobs data means the Fed is unlikely to cut rates significantly this year. This good economic news for the US is turning out to be bad news for global markets, including India, which were hoping for rate cuts to boost liquidity.” Rising crude oil prices - Brent crude prices rose to $81 per barrel, creating concerns for India, a major importer of crude oil. Higher crude prices increase input costs for businesses and could lead to higher inflation, adding to the challenges for the Indian economy. Analysts suggest that while the near-term outlook remains challenging, there could be opportunities for long-term investors. Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “The market is approaching critical levels, with Nifty near its recent low of 23,263. A break below this level could see the index falling to 23,000 or even 22,260. However, any recovery above 23,540 could signal strength and give bulls a chance to regroup.” Dr Vijayakumar added that the strength of the US economy could support IT stocks, which have been relatively resilient. He also said that healthcare and pharma sectors may remain stable due to steady demand.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Must Watch

As Budget 2025 approaches, taxpayers are hoping for a wishlist to come true that eases their tax burden. Individual taxpayers are looking at Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to deliver a financial masterstroke on February 1. Amid rising costs and squeezed disposable incomes, the spotlight is on the new tax regime, with experts pushing the demands for HRA inclusion and a Rs 1 lakh standard deduction in Budget 2025. Experts believe that the government is unlikely to make significant changes to the old tax regime, as it aims to encourage a shift towards the new, simplified structure. However, to draw more taxpayers to the new system, changes that offer better tax relief and align with rising living costs are being suggested. Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, said, “Last year, the Finance Minister raised the standard deduction and revised tax slabs under the new tax regime. This year, taxpayers are expecting further relief given high interest rates, rising living expenses, and the need to boost consumption. Any relief will increase disposable income for individuals, supporting economic growth.”HRA EXEMPTION One of the most common requests from taxpayers is the inclusion of HRA exemptions in the new tax regime. At present, this benefit is only available under the old system. Mayank Mohanka, Founder-Director of TaxAaram.com, explained, “Housing is a basic necessity, not a discretionary expense. Many taxpayers stick to the old regime to retain the HRA benefit. Including it in the new regime could encourage more people to make the switch.” HRA exemptions currently provide tax savings. The exemption amount is calculated as the lowest of: Actual HRA received. 50% of basic salary (40% for non-metro residents). Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary. Experts argue that incorporating this exemption would make the new regime more practical for taxpayers who incur significant housing costs.INCREASE IN STANDARD DEDUCTION The rise in inflation and household expenses has led to calls for an increase in the standard deduction. In Budget 2023, the deduction under the new regime was raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. However, experts believe this amount is insufficient. Abhishek Soni, Co-Founder of Tax2Win, said, “The standard deduction should be raised to Rs 1 lakh to match the surge in living expenses. For instance, a salaried individual earning Rs 15 lakh may spend Rs 7-9 lakh annually on various expenses, which are already taxed through GST or VAT. A higher deduction would help offset this burden.” Tax experts are also calling for an easier income tax return (ITR) filing process, particularly for non-resident Indians (NRIs). Challenges faced by NRIs include difficulty in receiving refunds directly into overseas bank accounts and limited options for digitally verifying returns. Kumar highlighted the need for changes, stating, “NRIs are struggling with the 30-day time limit to submit the ITR-V in physical form to the tax department. Extending this period to 120 days or offering more e-verification options would address their concerns.”Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The recent US nonfarm payrolls report showed the addition of 256,000 jobs in December, surpassing expectations of 160,000. The fresh data has reduced the likelihood of multiple rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in 2025, further strengthening the dollar and weighing on emerging market currencies. Moreover, the dollar index neared 110, while the rupee plunged to a record low of 86.39, raising fears of continued foreign outflows.FII OUTFLOWS CONTINUE Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled over $4 billion from Indian equities this month, following an $11 billion outflow in the last quarter. Concerns over US monetary policy and uncertainty about President-elect Donald Trump's economic strategies have intensified bearish sentiment. Additionally, Brent Crude's rise to over $81 per barrel has increased inflationary concerns, adding to market jitters.MORE PAIN AHEAD FOR INVESTORS? Market experts predict that volatility will persist in the near term and indicate that the stock market could fall further. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Market will continue to be under pressure from the many strong headwinds.” “The blow out jobs data from the US with 2.56 lakh job creation in December against expectations of 1.65 lakhs means the rate cut expectations in 2025 is now down to one. With the unemployment in the US down to 4.1% the economy doesn’t need any stimulus. This good economic news is turning out to be bad news for markets which were discounting many rate cuts this year,” he added. Vijayakumar added that Brent Crude price rising to $81 is also a concern for India, and it seems to have weighed on market sentiments.

Meanwhile, Emkay Global has stated in a note that domestic markets might remain weak until March, with stability expected from April as earnings outlooks improve and FII selling subsides. The brokerage set a conservative Nifty target of 25,000 for 2025, projecting small and mid-cap stocks to outperform. ""We see another year of moderate returns for the Nifty, but SMIDs could deliver stronger gains,"" the note added. ICICI Securities expressed similar concerns, suggesting that anxiety around Donald Trump’s policies and Budget 2025 could keep markets on edge.

While pensioners’ representatives, led by the EPS-95 National Agitation Committee, have strongly advocated for a Rs 7,500 pension, trade unions suggested a lower hike to Rs 5,000 per month. This divergence has sparked criticism from pensioners, who argue that the proposed Rs 5,000 is insufficient to meet rising living costs. The committee also highlighted discrepancies in the current system, stating that despite the government’s 2014 announcement to set the minimum pension at Rs 1,000, over 36.60 lakh pensioners still receive less than this amount.UNDERSTANDING EPF CONTRIBUTIONS Under the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), both employees and employers contribute 12% of the employee’s basic salary to a retirement benefits corpus. Of the employer’s contribution, 8.33% is directed to the EPS, while the remaining 3.67% is allocated to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF). Pensioners argue that the current allocation system needs a comprehensive review to provide adequate post-retirement benefits. Finance Minister Sitharaman’s assurance to review the pensioners’ demands has rekindled hope amongst millions of retirees. If the proposed hike to Rs 7,500 is implemented, it could mark a new chapter in ensuring financial dignity for India’s elderly workforce.

Check the key factors behind this decline and whether the Indian currency faces further challenges.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/rupee-all-time-low-86-against-us-dollar-key-factors-behind-fall-and-will-it-decline-further-2663863-2025-01-13,"The Indian rupee plunged to an all-time low, breaching the 86 mark against the US dollar on Monday.  The rupee fell 0.4% to hit 86.39 per dollar, in line with the broader weakness in Asian currencies. The sharp decline came after a stronger-than-expected US jobs report, which further strengthened the dollar and pressured emerging market currencies, including the rupee.advertisementSTRONG US DATA, LOWER FED RATE CUT HOPESThe US nonfarm payrolls data revealed that 256,000 jobs were added last month, far exceeding expectations of 160,000. The US nonfarm payrolls data revealed that 256,000 jobs were added last month, far exceeding expectations of 160,000. Additionally, a strong performance in the US services and manufacturing sectors highlighted the resilience of the world’s largest economy. The fresh data diminished hopes of immediate rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, bolstering the dollar and weakening the rupee.FII EXODUS CONTINUES Another factor behind the rupee’s fall is continuous selling by foreign institutional investors. It has further exacerbated the rupee's decline.
It is worth mentioning that overseas investors have withdrawn over $4 billion from Indian stocks this month alone, following a $11 billion outflow last quarter. Concerns over US monetary policy and uncertainty surrounding US President-elect Donald Trump's planned policies have led to increased bearish bets on the rupee. All these factors, combined with higher hedging activity, seem to have intensified the pressure on the Indian currency.WILL THE RUPEE’S FALL CONTINUE? The rupee's downward trajectory has been ongoing for over three months, accompanied by heightened volatility. Brad Bechtel, global head of foreign exchange at Jefferies, told news agency Reuters that the rupee's continued depreciation aligned with its real effective exchange rate (REER). The rupee's 40-currency trade-weighted REER indicates it is at its most overvalued level in at least two decades, he added. Market analysts predict further depreciation in the rupee. Bechtel expects the rupee to weaken to 88 in the near-to-medium term, while ANZ Bank forecasts the rupee to reach that level by March.

Investors will be closely watching the IT giant’s performance, especially after Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) posted its Q3 FY25 results last week. TCS reported decent earnings and better-than-expected deal wins, which led to a rally in IT sector stocks, with TCS shares gaining over 5% the following day. Market analysts predict that HCL Tech will show robust growth in the December quarter, driven by its software business and recent acquisition of the Communications Technology Group (CTG). HCL Tech is projected to lead the Tier I IT companies in growth, with a sequential constant currency (CC) growth of 4.6-5.5%. This growth is attributed to the seasonality of its software segment and the one-month consolidation of CTG. However, wage hikes and furloughs are expected to slightly impact margins. Deal wins for the quarter are likely to range between $2-2.5 billion, and some analysts believe HCL Tech may upgrade its FY25 revenue guidance.WHAT TO EXPECT?  Net profit: Prabhudas Lilladher estimates a 3.9% year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit to Rs 4,520 crore, compared to Rs 4,350 crore in the same quarter last year. JM Financial expects profit to rise 8.5% YoY to Rs 4,593.50 crore, while Nuvama forecasts a 13.1% YoY increase to Rs 4,790 crore. Revenue: Analysts project a 4.3-6% YoY increase in revenue, with estimates ranging from Rs 30,110 crore to Rs 30,393 crore. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin: EBIT margin is expected to contract slightly on a YoY basis but improve sequentially. Prabhudas Lilladher estimates a margin of 19.2%, while JM Financial forecasts 19.1%. HCL Tech’s growth in Q3 FY25 is supported by strong contributions from its IT services and software businesses. Analysts at JM Financial have factored in a $20 million contribution from the CTG consolidation and expect quarter-on-quarter growth of 1.5% in IT services, engineering and R&D (ERS), and product and platform businesses. While engineering and manufacturing segments may face softness due to challenges in the German automotive sector, discretionary spending in the high-tech segment is expected to show signs of revival. This should provide long-term growth opportunities for the company. Brokerages are optimistic about HCL Tech slightly upgrading its FY25 revenue growth guidance. Nuvama predicts the company will raise its guidance to 4-5% CC YoY from its earlier 3.5-5%. Margins are likely to expand by 50 basis points (bps) sequentially, driven by a strong performance in the software business and operating leverage, despite headwinds from wage hikes and furloughs. HCL Tech’s management is also expected to announce a dividend along with its quarterly results. Post-results, the company’s senior leadership will hold an audio conference call at 7:30 PM.

Backed by major investors such as Peak XV, Tiger Global, and Alkeon, Groww has firmly established itself as a leader in India’s competitive retail investing market.

Subrahmanyan’s comments, which recommended employees work longer hours—including Sundays—have ignited strong reactions across the business world and beyond.VIJAY KEDIA’S SARCASTIC TAKE Veteran investor Vijay Kedia shared a sarcastic remark on X, humorously highlighting the disconnect between employee effort and employer reward.  He wrote, “A heartfelt moment at the office today: Our boss just bought a Lamborghini! We gathered to congratulate him, and his words truly inspired us: ""Thank you all for this achievement. Without you, it wouldn't have been possible. Your relentless 90-hour weeks made this Lamborghini a reality. Today, I promise you all...... if you continue to work this hard, I'll buy another one next year!""
 


INDUSTRY TITANS AND CELEBRITIES SPEAK UP While Subrahmanyan’s remarks drew support from some, industry giants like Anand Mahindra and Harsh Goenka offered a contrasting perspective. During the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2025, Mahindra stated that impactful change can happen in just 10 hours, highlighting that productivity stems from effective time management rather than extended work hours. Goenka, chairperson of RPG Enterprises, responded humorously, “Why not rename Sunday to ‘Sun-duty’ and make ‘day off’ a mythical concept?” He stressed the importance of work-life balance, warning against turning life into a “perpetual office shift.” Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, echoed Mahindra’s views, highlighting the value of “work-life balance.” Poonawalla jokingly added, “Even my wife loves staring at me on Sundays.” Bollywood star Deepika Padukone, known for her advocacy of mental health, also voiced her concern. Sharing a screenshot of Subrahmanyan’s statement on Instagram, she remarked, “And they just made it worse,” pointing to the detrimental effects of overworking employees.THE CALL FOR A SMARTER APPROACH TO WORK The 90-hour workweek debate has illuminated a broader conversation about the need for smarter work strategies, not longer hours. As industry leaders and celebrities continue to speak out, the message is clear: work-life balance is vital, not just for personal well-being, but also for long-term success.

At 12:34 pm, HCLTech shares were trading marginally lower by 0.17% at Rs 1,992.20. The IT giant is set to report its quarterly results with expectations of a modest rise in profit and revenue despite challenges in key business segments. As investors wait for the results, here’s a look at what brokerages are forecasting for the company.advertisementWHAT TO EXPECT FROM HCLTECH Q3? Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher predicts a 3.9% year-on-year (YoY) increase in HCL Tech’s net profit, which is expected to reach Rs 4,520 crore, up from Rs 4,350 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue is anticipated to rise 6% YoY to Rs 30,200 crore, compared to Rs 28,450 crore in Q3 FY24. However, the brokerage expects a slight contraction in the EBIT margin, projecting a decrease of 54 basis points to 19.2%, down from 19.7% in the previous year. Despite this, the brokerage firm forecasts a sequential improvement in the margin, which should grow by 62 basis points from the 18.6% recorded in the September quarter. JM Financial is more optimistic, projecting an 8.5% YoY increase in profit to Rs 4,593.5 crore, along with a 5.3% rise in revenue to Rs 30,393 crore. The brokerage expects the EBIT margin to reach 19.1%. It notes that the quarter’s results will benefit from a $20 million contribution from the one-month consolidation of CTG, along with anticipated 1.5% growth in IT Services and ERS/Product & Platform businesses in USD terms. However, wage hikes are expected to be a headwind, potentially impacting margins. Brokerage firm Nuvama anticipates a 13.1% YoY increase in profit to Rs 4,790 crore and a 4.3% YoY rise in revenue to Rs 30,110 crore for Q3.

The stock market witnessed widespread selling, pushing investor wealth down by over Rs 5 lakh crore.  The Sensex was down 879.56 points to 76,499.35 at 1:56 pm, while the NSE Nifty50 was trading 300 points lower at 23,131.50. All the other broader market indices were trading in negative territory as volatility skyrocketed during the afternoon trading session.  All Nifty sectoral indices also traded deep in negative territory, with Nifty Realty falling nearly 6%. Nifty Auto and Nifty Metal were also top losers in percentage terms.  However, the trigger was a sharp decline in banking, financial and IT stocks, which failed to hold gains as the session progressed.  The stock market’s fall was driven by losses across major banking stocks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. Only three of the 50 Nifty50 constituents were trading in negative territory, reflecting the weakness on Dalal Street. WHAT'S BEHIND THE MARKET BLOODBATH?  The stock market’s dismal performance today has been primarily attributed to a mix of factors that severely hit investor sentiments.  VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, highlighted that the market is facing significant headwinds. The strong US jobs report for December, showing 2.56 lakh job additions, has reduced expectations for multiple rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in 2025.  According to him, this shift in the US economic outlook, coupled with a strengthened dollar, has weighed heavily on emerging market currencies, including the rupee, which plummeted to a record low of 86.39 against the dollar. Additionally, the rise in global crude oil prices, with Brent crude breaching $81 per barrel, has reignited inflationary concerns, further dampening market sentiment. The global macroeconomic environment, coupled with continued foreign outflows, has made it more challenging for Indian equities to attract investments. Additionally, foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have been key drivers of market volatility, pulling over $4 billion from Indian equities this month alone. This follows an outflow of $11 billion in the previous quarter. The continued uncertainty surrounding US monetary policy and the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's economic strategies have exacerbated bearish sentiment in global markets, contributing to further outflows from emerging markets like India. Despite the foreign sell-off, domestic investors have shown resilience. As per provisional data from the NSE, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) purchased Rs 3,961.92 crore worth of shares on Friday, offsetting some of the FII selling pressure. However, analysts are cautious about the outlook for the short term.WHAT'S NEXT?  As volatility continues to haunt the market, experts predict that the bearish trend could persist in the near term. Vijayakumar noted that the US job data, while positive for the US economy, could lead to fewer rate cuts, further impacting emerging market sentiments. The ongoing global uncertainties, including concerns about inflation and crude prices, add to the challenges.  Looking forward, analysts suggest that markets could remain weak until March, with stability expected to return around April. Emkay Global, in a recent note, projected that the Nifty could remain subdued, with a conservative target of 25,000 for 2025. However, it noted that small and mid-cap stocks could outperform, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities beyond the large-cap index. While the short-term outlook remains challenging for the stock market, with continued foreign outflows and global macroeconomic pressures, a potential recovery could take shape as earnings outlooks improve and FII selling subsides in the coming months.

What if you could enjoy all the benefits without paying this fee? Surprisingly, many banks offer ways to get your credit card’s annual fee waived—if you meet specific spending criteria.SPEND MORE, SAVE MORE Some banks allow you to waive your annual fee by crossing a pre-defined spending threshold. For instance, several cards, like the Axis Bank Rewards Credit Card, waive a Rs 1,000 fee if you spend Rs 2 lakh annually. Similarly, the Axis Bank Freecharge Plus Credit Card removes fees for spending Rs 50,000 in a year, while the Axis Bank Cashback Credit Card waives its Rs 1,000 fee if you spend Rs 4 lakh. For those who want to avoid annual fees altogether, there are options like ICICI Bank’s Platinum Credit Card, which has no joining or annual fees.HOW TO ENSURE FEE WAIVERS To maximise your chances: Leverage regular spending: Use your card for groceries, dining, travel, or other everyday expenses to reach the threshold. Check eligibility: Before applying, confirm if the card offers a fee waiver on specific spending levels. Contact the bank: If you’ve hit the spending mark but still see a fee, call customer service to request a waiver. Be a loyal customer: Banks often reward long-standing customers with fee waivers, even if you don’t meet the exact criteria.SMART SPENDING PAYS OFF While fee waivers are attractive, it’s essential to evaluate whether the card’s benefits justify its costs. Cards offering rewards, cashback, or travel perks may be worth the fee if the returns outweigh the expense. Owning a credit card is about more than convenience—it’s about making smart financial choices. By understanding your card’s features and utilising them wisely, you can save money and enjoy the full suite of benefits without paying extra.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Trending Reel

The latest concern, dubbed the 'Jumped Deposit Scam,' has sparked fears amongst Unified Payments Interface (UPI) users. However, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has assured users of UPI's robust security and clarified misconceptions surrounding the alleged scam.HOW THE SCAM OPERATES In the Jumped Deposit Scam, fraudsters transfer small amounts of money to a victim's account to build trust. They then send payment collection requests, urging the victim to refund the amount. The scam escalates when users, in their haste, authorise these requests by entering their UPI PIN, mistakenly believing it’s required for verifying account balances. NPCI stated that a UPI PIN is never needed to receive funds and is only used to authorise outgoing payments. Cyber experts reveal that scammers manipulate victims by creating urgency and using emotional appeals, such as claims of mistaken transfers or fabricated emergencies. These tactics exploit human psychology, making even financially savvy individuals vulnerable to fraud.NPCI’S CLARIFICATIONS AND SAFETY TIPS NPCI has reiterated that no cases of this scam have been observed on the UPI platform. The organisation emphasises that UPI transactions are device-based and require explicit user authorisation with a PIN. Merely opening a UPI app or entering a PIN does not initiate or approve any transaction. To protect yourself, NPCI advises scepticism towards unexpected deposits. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or responding to unverified requests. If you receive an unsolicited deposit, consult your bank or UPI service provider. Educating yourself about digital payments and staying alert are key to preventing fraud.STAY VIGILANT While scams like the Jumped Deposit Scam highlight the need for vigilance, NPCI’s clarifications reaffirm UPI’s security and reliability. By understanding how UPI works and being cautious, users can confidently embrace the convenience of digital payments without falling prey to cybercriminals.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 13, 2025

Amidst a cyclical growth slowdown and ongoing fiscal consolidation, these questions reflect the focus on managing public debt, fiscal deficit targets, and key government spending priorities. Let’s dive into Goldman Sachs' expectations and the critical issues they foresee. Will the government meet its FY25 fiscal deficit target? The first question revolves around the government's ability to meet its fiscal deficit target of 4.9% of GDP in FY25. Goldman Sachs predicts that despite slower nominal GDP growth, the government will likely achieve this target. They expect higher income tax collections and increased non-tax revenues to offset shortfalls in corporate taxes and excise duties. Additionally, a reduction in capital expenditure is anticipated, which should help balance out the rising food subsidy costs. What will be the fiscal deficit target for FY26? Looking forward, Goldman Sachs anticipates a more ambitious fiscal deficit target of 4.4-4.6% of GDP for FY26. The firm highlighted that fiscal consolidation remains critical to maintaining long-term debt sustainability. The government’s fiscal actions in FY25 will set the tone for FY26 and beyond, with the goal of bringing down the fiscal deficit further to around 4.5%. How will the government prioritise spending? A key concern is the government’s spending priorities. Goldman Sachs forecasts a slowdown in capital expenditure (capex) growth to around 13% YoY in FY26, compared to over 30% in the previous years. They also predict a shift towards welfare schemes and rural transfers, especially post the 2024 elections, with an expected focus on rural development and welfare spending. Will the government fully utilise supplementary expenditures? Goldman Sachs questions whether the government will fully utilize the additional funds allocated through supplementary grants. Historically, the government has spent only 80% of the approved budget, and while the shortfall has reduced post-pandemic, FY25 might still see underutilization of the allocated budget. Will the RBI be a net buyer of government bonds in FY26? Lastly, Goldman Sachs wonders if the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will need to step in as a net buyer of government bonds in FY26. This action could inject necessary liquidity into the banking system and counter the impact of foreign exchange sales. As India prepares for the 2025 Union Budget, these questions highlight the government's delicate balancing act between fiscal discipline, spending priorities, and long-term economic stability. The answers will shape India’s path toward sustained growth in the coming years, as policymakers navigate an increasingly complex economic landscape.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Stock Market Crash: Dalal Street faced another sharp decline on Monday, with key indices tumbling and investors suffering heavy losses. Is this a temporary dip, or the start of a prolonged bear run? ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/stock-market-crash-wipes-out-rs-13-lakh-crore-bloodbath-on-dalal-street-rebound-key-factors-2664086-2025-01-13,"The mood on Dalal Street remained tense after another stock market crash in which investors lost nearly Rs 13 lakh crore. At the closing bell on Monday, the Sensex fell sharply by over 1,000 points and the Nifty50 barely managed to stay above the 23,000 mark.  The Sensex ended 1048.90 points lower at 76,330.01, while the NSE Nifty50 tumbled 344.20 points to settle at 23,087.30. Most of the heavyweight stocks also ended in negative territory, with heavyweight sectoral indices registering significant declines.  But is this just a temporary setback, or are investors staring at a prolonged bear run? It is worth mentioning that the Sensex and Nifty have already fallen over 2% in the calendar year and over 7% in a month. Analysts anticipate the domestic stock markets to remain volatile and even decline further in the near term. WHAT TRIGGERED TODAY'S MARKET CRASH?  The answer lies in a complex web of negative global events. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, highlighted that the US imposing sanctions on Russian oil exports pushed the rupee to a fresh low against the dollar, which in turn triggered a ""massive correction in domestic equity markets as overseas investors continued to desert the local share market"". ""Wide-spread selling across the sectors fuelled along with massive exits in mid and small-cap stocks further worsened the sentiment. Rising crude oil prices would raise concerns of a spike in domestic inflation, which could further delay any rate cut hopes from the RBI in the near to medium term,"" Tapse added. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, highlighted similar points. He said, ""The global markets witnessed a significant sell-off, prompting a similar response in domestic markets due to strong US payroll data suggesting fewer rate cuts in 2025. This has strengthened the dollar, driven up bond yields, and made emerging markets less attractive.""He also added that recent GDP downgrades and slowing earnings amid higher valuations are weighing heavily on market sentiment.""Expect volatility in the near term, with the 2025 budget, Q3 results, RBI policy, and Trump's policies as key factors to define the trend in the short-term,"" Nair said. Ajit Mishra, SVP (Research) at Religare Broking Ltd, shared details outlining the market's technical weakness. ""The sell-off was broad-based, with realty, metal, and energy sectors taking the biggest hits. The broader indices also experienced significant losses, plunging nearly 4% each,"" he said. ""The Nifty has decisively broken below the November 2024 low of 23,263.15, accompanied by a noticeable rise in the volatility index, signaling further downside risks. The next significant support is at the 22,700 level, although oversold conditions in select heavyweight stocks may lead to brief pauses in the downtrend,"" he explained. WHAT'S NEXT?Prashanth Tapse pointed out that the rise in global crude oil prices, with Brent Crude breaching $81 per barrel, has reignited inflationary concerns, further dampening market sentiment. He warned that the global macroeconomic environment, coupled with continued foreign outflows, has made it more challenging for Indian equities to attract investments.It is worth noting that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been key drivers of market volatility, pulling over $4 billion from Indian equities this month alone. This follows an outflow of $11 billion in the previous quarter. Looking forward, analysts suggest that markets could remain weak until March, with stability expected to return around April. Emkay Global, in a recent note, projected that the Nifty could remain subdued, with a conservative target of 25,000 for 2025.However, it noted that small and mid-cap stocks could outperform, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities beyond the large-cap index.Ajit Mishra advised traders to maintain a ""sell on rise"" approach for the index while prioritising risk management. ""Among sectors, IT, FMCG, and select pharma stocks are relatively stable, while others remain under considerable pressure.

This marks a steady retreat within the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target range of 2–6%.EASING FOOD INFLATION LEADS THE WAY The moderation in retail inflation was primarily attributed to a decline in food inflation, which fell to 8.39% in December from 9.04% in November. Seasonal factors and improved supply chains contributed to the slowdown. However, certain categories such as meat, fish, eggs, and fruits saw prices rising faster than in the previous month. Food prices had remained elevated for over a year, crossing 7% between November 2023 and June 2024, largely due to uneven monsoon rains. Despite the easing, food price volatility remains a concern for economists and policymakers.STATE-WISE INFLATION TRENDS Inflation rates varied across states, with 13 out of 22 states reporting inflation above the national average of 5.22% in December. States like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra reported lower inflation than the national average, reflecting regional variations in price pressures.RBI HOLDS STEADY ON INTEREST RATES The RBI maintained its benchmark repo rate at 6.5% during its December 2024 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, signalling a cautious approach to monetary policy. The central bank reiterated its commitment to aligning inflation with its medium-term target of 4% while fostering economic growth. Looking ahead, the RBI expects CPI inflation to average 4.8% for FY25, up from its earlier estimate of 4.5%, largely due to persistent food price pressures and weaker consumption demand. As India steps into 2025, the easing inflation brings some relief to households, but challenges remain with volatile food prices and economic headwinds. The RBI’s calibrated approach to interest rates and the government’s policy interventions will play a critical role in maintaining this delicate balance.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 13, 2025Must Watch

The Sensex tumbled over 1,000 points, while the Nifty50 struggled to hold above the key 23,000 mark. This extended the ongoing downtrend, with both indices losing over 7% in the past month and more than 2% since the start of the year. Vaibhav Vidwani, a research analyst at Bonanza, explained the reasons for the market crash and said, ""Profit booking by foreign investors, weak government spending on capital expenditure, and rising food inflation were major drivers of the sell-off. Concerns about U.S. economic data, particularly a strong jobs report, have reduced the chances of Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025, increasing global market volatility. Additionally, the rupee hitting an all-time low against the dollar has further impacted investor sentiment."" Another key factor weighing on the markets is the rise in global crude oil prices. Brent Crude recently crossed $81 per barrel, which has reignited fears of higher inflation. Prashanth Tapse noted that this, combined with foreign investor outflows, has made it difficult for Indian equities to attract new investments. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net sellers this month, pulling out over $4 billion from Indian equities. This follows an outflow of $11 billion in the previous quarter, highlighting the pressure on domestic markets.SHOULD INVESTORS PANIC?  Nilesh D Naik, Head of Investment Products at Share.Market, explained, ""A 10-12% drop from the peak should not be a cause for panic. Over the last 20 years, the market has traded more than 10% below its peak on 34.73% of trading days, more than 20% lower on 16.45% of days, and over 30% lower on 6.73% of days."" He added, ""Stopping systematic investment plans (SIPs) during such corrections is counterproductive. It’s like a batsman leaving the crease when an easy bowler comes to bowl. Continuing SIPs through downturns often pays off in the long term."" Radhika Gupta, the Managing Director and CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund, shared valuable insights, stressing the need for investors to remain composed and focus on long-term goals. Gupta acknowledged the day’s market challenges, calling it one of the most significant declines, with midcap indices dropping by 4%. She pointed out that the markets have seen a cumulative fall of about 14-15% since their peak last September. In response to the volatility, Gupta advised investors to resist the urge to make hasty decisions. She said, ""With times like this, all the news you see, there is a natural temptation to panic and take action that may not be good for your portfolio. My advice to you would be to embrace the volatility and try to hold on for the long term.""WHAT NEXT FOR THE MARKET? Analysts expect the markets to remain weak in the short term. Emkay Global has projected a conservative Nifty target of 25,000 for 2025, with expectations of subdued performance until March. However, there is some optimism for smaller stocks. ""Small and mid-cap stocks could outperform in the current environment, providing opportunities for investors willing to take a slightly higher risk,"" Emkay Global noted in its recent report. Ajit Mishra advised a ""sell on rise"" strategy for traders, suggesting they focus on relatively stable sectors like IT, FMCG, and select pharma stocks. He also highlighted the importance of managing risks and adjusting stock-specific positions as per market conditions.

The report suggests that Chinese authorities would rather keep TikTok under the control of its parent company, ByteDance. However, mounting pressure from US lawmakers over national security concerns may leave no option but to sell TikTok’s US division. One potential scenario involves Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, acquiring TikTok US and running it jointly with ByteDance. The report notes that no final decision has been made, and discussions remain inconclusive. ByteDance has consistently maintained that China’s stake in the company, often referred to as a ""golden share,"" has no influence over TikTok's global operations outside of China. However, members of the US Congress have argued otherwise, claiming the ""golden share"" gives Beijing undue control, as per the report. A TikTok spokesperson dismissed the Bloomberg report, saying, “We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.” It is unclear whether ByteDance or Elon Musk has been involved in any formal talks about a potential deal. TikTok has been under scrutiny for years over concerns that user data could be accessed by the Chinese government. The company has repeatedly denied these allegations, stating that data from US users is stored securely within the United States. The backdrop to these discussions is a US Supreme Court review of a law that could lead to a ban or forced sale of TikTok’s US operations by 19 January. US authorities argue that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its ties to China. China’s Cyberspace Administration and Ministry of Commerce, along with representatives from Elon Musk’s companies, have yet to comment on the Bloomberg report.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Must Watch

India prepares to celebrate festivals like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, and Lohri on January 14. Many traders and investors are wondering whether the stock markets will remain closed for the festivities. However, according to the official holiday calendar released by the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the stock markets will remain open on this day. Despite the holiday mood across the country, January 14 is not listed as a trading holiday, meaning that both exchanges will operate as usual. Trading in equities, derivatives, bonds, commodities, and currencies will take place during regular market hours from 9.15 AM to 3.30 PM. The holiday schedules for the BSE and NSE are determined based on national holidays and key religious and cultural festivals that are widely observed across the country. While Makar Sankranti and Pongal are celebrated in many states, they are considered regional holidays and do not feature on the official list of trading holidays. For 2025, the BSE and NSE have announced a total of 14 holidays when the markets will remain closed. These include major festivals such as Diwali, Holi, and Eid, as well as national observances like Independence Day and Republic Day. However, regional festivals like Pongal, Ugadi, and Onam typically do not qualify for market holidays unless they coincide with other national events. While the stock markets will remain open, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has declared January 14 as a bank holiday in select states for Makar Sankranti and Pongal. This means that banking operations such as cheque clearing and branch services may be unavailable in some regions. Customers are advised to check with their local banks for specific details.Official stock market holidays for 2025 Here is the complete list of trading holidays for the Indian stock markets in 2025: February 26: Mahashivratri March 14: Holi March 31: Eid-Ul-Fitr (Ramzan Id) April 10: Shri Mahavir Jayanti April 14: Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti April 18: Good Friday May 1: Maharashtra Day August 15: Independence Day August 27: Ganesh Chaturthi October 2: Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti October 21: Diwali (Laxmi Pujan) October 22: Diwali (Balipratipada) November 5: Prakash Gurpurb (Guru Nanak Jayanti) December 25: ChristmasPublished By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 14, 2025

The stock was trading at Rs 549.60, up 6.09%, as of the time this article was written. This surge boosted the company’s market capitalisation to Rs 96,057.35 crore. JSW Energy shares closed at Rs 518.05 in the previous session. The stock opened at Rs 528.15 on the BSE, signalling a positive sentiment among investors. This gain follows a month of declining performance, with the stock losing 20.14% in the last month and 23.69% over the past six months. Despite the recent decline, JSW Energy has gained 16.15% over the past year. The rise in JSW Energy's share price came a day after the company announced that its resolution plan for acquiring KSK Mahanadi Power Company Limited (KMPCL) had been approved by the committee of creditors. The acquisition is part of the corporate insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. In an exchange filing post-market hours on Monday, JSW Energy confirmed that it had received a letter of intent from the resolution professional handling the insolvency process. KMPCL owns a 3,600 MW thermal power plant located in Chhattisgarh. Of this, 1,800 MW is currently operational, with 95% of the capacity tied up under long- and medium-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). The remaining 1,800 MW is under construction. One unit of 600 MW is 40% complete, while the remaining 1,200 MW has the necessary infrastructure in place. The plant has firm arrangements for water and coal transportation for its full capacity of 3,600 MW, which adds to its operational reliability. The acquisition of KMPCL strengthens JSW Energy’s position in the energy sector, particularly in the thermal power generation segment. It also increases the company’s total thermal generation capacity. Commenting on the development, Sharad Mahendra, Joint Managing Director and CEO of JSW Energy, said, “This strategic move positions the company to address India's increasing energy needs through a diversified energy mix, integrating both conventional and renewable sources. Strategically located near a coal block, the plant boasts PPA tie-ups and efficient operations, ensuring a reliable power supply."" Mahendra added that JSW Energy is committed to exploring new opportunities and maintaining its leadership in the energy sector. The stock has shown volatility in recent months.

Today's gains come as a respite for JSW Energy’s stock, which has been on a downtrend since January 2, losing over 15% so far this month. A positive close today could break the stock’s eight-session losing streak. The rally in JSW Energy’s stock comes after the company announced that the committee of creditors had approved its resolution plan for KSK Mahanadi Power Company Limited (KMPCL). The acquisition, under the corporate insolvency resolution process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, marks a significant boost to JSW Energy’s thermal power generation capacity. “We wish to inform you that the resolution plan submitted by the company for KSK Mahanadi Power Company Limited has been approved by the committee of creditors.

The facility, which uses domestic coal, has firm water and coal transportation arrangements for its entire capacity, making it a strategically important asset. With the acquisition, JSW Energy’s total locked-in thermal capacity now stands at 7.5 GW, contributing to its total locked-in generation capacity of 28.2 GW. This positions the company well to achieve its target of 20 GW capacity well before 2030 and underscores its commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.

At 10:46 am, HCLTech's shares were trading 9.02% lower at Rs 1,806.20 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Earlier, its shares hit an intraday low of Rs 1,798.40.HCL Technologies Q3 results HCLTech reported a net profit of Rs 4,591 crore, a 5.5% year-on-year (YoY) increase from Rs 4,350 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue from operations rose 5.07% YoY to Rs 29,890 crore. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) stood at Rs 5,821 crore, up 8.6% YoY, with EBIT margins improving by 90 basis points to 19.5%. The company raised its full-year constant currency revenue growth guidance to 4.5-5% but retained its EBIT margin guidance at 18-19%.WHY HCLTECH SHARES FELL TODAY? Despite healthy deal bookings worth $2.1 billion, muted management commentary on the near-term outlook weighed heavily on investor sentiment. Kotak Institutional Equities maintained a ‘reduce’ rating on the stock with a fair value of Rs 1,760, citing tepid large deal wins in recent quarters. The brokerage highlighted that HCLTech’s growth acceleration may lag peers due to its portfolio mix. “We expect HCL Tech to gain from opportunities during the recovery in discretionary spending but with slower growth compared to select peers,” the brokerage said. Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities issued a ‘buy’ rating, with a target price of Rs 2,282, citing the company’s strong deal pipeline in areas like GenAI and ERP automation. “While near-term growth appears muted, HCL Tech’s stable leadership and favorable business mix make it a solid long-term bet,” it noted. Global brokerage Nomura retained its ‘buy’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 2,000, while Morgan Stanley maintained an ‘equal-weight’ stance with a target of Rs 1,970. Simply put, HCLTech’s near-term performance faces hurdles, but analysts remain divided on its long-term prospects. While some highlight strong fundamentals, others flag valuation concerns and a sluggish large-deal pipeline. For now, investors seem wary of its subdued guidance despite stable financial metrics.

The S&P BSE Sensex was up over 400 points in early trade, while the NSE Niffty50 witnessed a similar rebound. Despite today’s rally, the stock market remains under pressure due to several factors, especially the impact of Q3 earnings and sustained selling by foreign institutional investors. While volatility has declined today, it also remains on the higher side, reflected by the wild swings that the broader market is encountering. Here are three reasons you need to know about today’s stock market rally and whether it will last:RETAIL INFLATION EASES TO 4-MONTH LOW Retail inflation eased to a four-month low in December, which is among the factors contributing to today’s market rally. A fall in retail inflation is likely to provide a boost to most sectors, especially FMCG. Though FMCG shares are down today due to the broader Q3 impact, the lower inflation is likely to provide a boost in the near-term.HEAVYWEIGHT SECTORS GAIN All Nifty sectoral indices rose except for IT, which fell nearly 2%. Heavyweight Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services indices also gained and added more steam to today’s recovery on Dalal Street. Nifty Metal also gained sharply after falling in the previous session. The index was up 2.48%, with Adani Enterprises jumping over 5% and Hindustan Zinc gaining nearly 4%.MAJOR STOCKS GAIN Some major stocks such also gained in early trade due to high trade volume. They are Adani Enterprises, Bajaj Finance, SBI and HDFC Bank. This also provided a boost to the stock market today, even as information technology stocks capped gains after a sharp fall in HCLTech’s share price following its Q3 results.WILL STOCK MARKET RECOVER IN NEAR TERM? Despite today's recovery in the Sensex and Nifty, analysts expect the stock market to remain under pressure in the near term due to continued FII selling, a stronger US dollar, and diminished hopes of rate cuts. So far, the Q3 earnings season has offered little cheer to the market, aside from a few bright spots like TCS, which posted stronger-than-expected results. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said, “Investors are on edge ahead of the US inflation reports and the Federal Reserve meeting later this month. Persistent FII selling and rising crude oil prices continue to pressure the market.” Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, offered a broader view on the ongoing correction in domestic stocks. ""The constant refrain from many saner voices that the broader market is overpriced and may correct sharply is now playing out. Reversion to mean valuations are happening in large caps, too,” he said,. “Strengthening dollar, 10-year US bond yields rising to above 4.7%, uncertainty regarding Trump’s actions after January 20, slowdown in India’s economy and poor corporate earnings, sharp surge in crude – all have combined to cause this market correction,” he added. However, Vijayakumar also noted that the market appears a “bit oversold” and added that this “favours a bounce back in the near term”. “But that trend, if it plays out, is unlikely to sustain. There is more pain likely in mid and small caps. There is a message from the net institutional activity in the market yesterday. DII buying was Rs 3,174 crore higher than FII selling,” he explained. “This means that smart money like HNIs are also selling in the market. The FII strategy of continuously adding to short positions this month has been successful. The sensible option for retail investors is to buy beaten down quality largecaps and wait patiently,” Vijayakumar said.

The remarks, which quickly gained attention on social media, drew criticism from celebrities and industry leaders. However, L&T’s Head of HR, Sonica Muraleedharan, has stepped forward to defend the Chairman, urging a deeper understanding of his intent.advertisementHR HEAD CLARIFIES REMARKS WERE ‘CASUAL IN NATURE’In a LinkedIn post addressing the uproar, Muraleedharan expressed disappointment over what she termed as the misinterpretation of Subrahmanyan’s statements. “It’s truly disheartening to see how the words of our MD & Chairman, SN Subrahmanyan (SNS), have been taken out of context, leading to misunderstandings and unnecessary criticism,” she wrote.
 


 In a LinkedIn post addressing the uproar, Muraleedharan expressed disappointment over what she termed as the misinterpretation of Subrahmanyan’s statements. “It’s truly disheartening to see how the words of our MD & Chairman, SN Subrahmanyan (SNS), have been taken out of context, leading to misunderstandings and unnecessary criticism,” she wrote.
 


 She clarified that the Chairman’s remarks were casual and not intended as directives or policies. Muraleedharan said that the remarks were made during an internal address and reflected the Chairman’s light-hearted nature rather than a serious work mandate.LEADERSHIP STYLE PRAISED AMID BACKLASH Amid the criticism, Muraleedharan highlighted Subrahmanyan’s dedication to fostering a positive and empowering work culture. “He treats every employee as part of an extended family, fostering a sense of unity and belonging that’s rare in today’s corporate world,” she noted. While many on social media, including actor Deepika Padukone and business leaders Anand Mahindra and Harsh Goenka, criticised the remarks, Muraleedharan called for focus on the Chairman’s proven track record. She described his leadership as ‘visionary’ crediting him with inspiring positive change and growth within the organisation. The controversy has reignited discussions about work-life balance in corporate India. Muraleedharan concluded her post by urging critics to look beyond isolated comments. “Leaders like SNS inspire positive change and growth, and it’s vital to recognise their efforts rather than misinterpret them,” she said. As debates continue, L&T stands by its Chairman, reiterating its commitment to a supportive work environment. Whether this controversy will impact broader corporate discussions on work culture remains to be seen.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Must Watch

At 12:05 pm, Adani Power soared 18.05% to Rs 531.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), while Adani Green Energy climbed 14.15% to Rs 1,015.80. Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship company, was trading 8% higher at Rs 2,401.75. Other Adani Group stocks also saw significant gains. Adani Energy Solutions rose 13.21% to Rs 779.40, while Adani Total Gas gained 12.30% to Rs 705.50. Adani Ports and SEZ was up 5.79% at Rs 1,128.50. Meanwhile, Adani-owned companies like ACC, Ambuja Cements, and NDTV registered gains of 4-8%.WHY ARE ADANI GROUP STOCKS RISING TODAY? The rally in Adani Group stocks followed a sharp increase in trading volumes, with Adani Power witnessing intraday gains of over 18%. The surge was also fuelled by a broad market rebound, as banking, auto, realty, and energy sectors led gains in early trade. Market sentiment was also boosted by renewed optimism about potential fundraising by the group. A report by Livemint, quoting Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment and Securities, suggested that the market is buzzing with speculation regarding the group’s plans to raise capital. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Jain highlighted that former US President Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House could ease access to overseas funding for the Adani Group. This prospect has likely spurred fresh buying interest in the group’s stocks. The Adani Group’s performance comes as a relief after the recent downturn, where its shares struggled amid global and domestic market volatility. With today’s gains, the group’s stocks have regained some lost ground, offering a positive outlook for investors. For now, the market remains optimistic about the group’s ability to capitalise on emerging opportunities, supported by its diversified business portfolio and strong growth prospects.

70e622af-0ff6-4b36-aaff-bb8c080ab156,"Explained: Why Biocon shares surged 7% today Biocon share price: The stock has gained 9.66% in the last month, 7.99% over the past six months, and an impressive 37.98% in the last year. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/biocon-share-price-rise-reason-surged-7-percent-today-hsbc-rating-upgrade-2664516-2025-01-14,"Shares of Biocon surged over 6% in early trade on Tuesday, marking their second consecutive day of gains. The stock was trading at Rs 388.50, up 6.50%, at the time this artice was being written, with its market capitalisation standing at Rs 46,643.31 crore. It had closed at Rs 364.80 in the previous session. The stock opened at Rs 370 on the BSE, reflecting strong investor sentiment. The rise in Biocon's share price was primarily driven by an upgrade from global brokerage firm HSBC, which changed its rating on the stock to a ""buy"" and raised the price target to Rs 430, up nearly 50%. HSBC’s revised outlook is based on expectations of an operational turnaround for the company, supported by key developments and regulatory clearances. Biocon’s recent success in resolving regulatory issues at its manufacturing facilities played a major role in boosting investor confidence. Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reclassified Biocon’s Malaysia facility status to ""Voluntary Action Indicated"" (VAI), a significant improvement from the earlier ""Official Action Indicated"" (OAI) status issued in October 2023. The clearance of Biocon’s Malaysia facility is a key development, as it paves the way for the company to seek approvals and launch its insulin biosimilar, Aspart. This product, manufactured at the Malaysia unit, is considered a critical driver of Biocon’s growth in the coming years. Previously, the Malaysia plant had faced challenges, including five observations from the US FDA during a September 2023 inspection. The reclassification to VAI has now removed a major regulatory bottleneck for the company. The regulatory improvement has also had a positive impact on Biocon’s biosimilar pipeline, boosting market confidence in the company’s ability to launch new products and expand its market share.BROKERAGE VIEWS In addition to HSBC, Bank of America Securities also raised its price target for Biocon to Rs 435, an increase of nearly 9%. The brokerage reiterated its ""buy"" rating, citing the resolution of issues at Biocon’s manufacturing facilities in Bengaluru and Malaysia as a major confidence booster. Bank of America also highlighted the company’s growth potential, projecting an increase in annualised revenue from $1 billion in the first half of FY25 to $1.2 billion in FY26. The brokerage believes Biocon’s focus will now shift to reducing debt and delivering strong performances with its new launches. Biocon’s stock has shown resilience over the past year, despite facing challenges. The stock hit its 52-week high of Rs 395.65 on September 17, 2024 and a 52-week low of Rs 244.40 on March 20, 2024. The stock has gained 9.66% in the last month, 7.99% over the past six months, and an impressive 37.98% in the last year. Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 14, 2025

As the Union Budget for 2025-26 nears, NRIs are keenly observing the potential reforms and incentives that could bolster their contributions while simplifying compliance. Experts from EY India have outlined key expectations that could significantly impact the NRI community.TREATY RELIEF AT SOURCE Claiming tax relief under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements currently involves tedious refund processes. Introducing provisions for treaty relief at the tax withholding stage, including necessary amendments to Form 16, could simplify this process, reduce administrative burdens, and ensure timely compliance.EXPANDING ESOP TAX BENEFITS India’s tax laws currently allow employees of eligible startups to defer taxes on ESOPs. Extending this benefit to all employees, including NRIs, regardless of the employer’s status, could enhance compensation structures and ease cash flow management for NRIs.SIMPLIFYING PROPERTY AND RENT TDS Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) procedures for property sales and rent payments can be complex for NRIs. Streamlined processes and enhanced digital infrastructure would make compliance more accessible and user-friendly.OVERCOMING E-VERIFICATION CHALLENGES NRIs often face hurdles in e-verifying tax returns due to the lack of Aadhaar or Indian bank accounts. Streamlining e-verification and ensuring seamless access to tax forms from overseas IP addresses could alleviate these challenges, making tax filing more efficient.EXTENDING SIMPLIFIED ITR-1 TO NRIs Given that many NRIs have limited income sources, expanding the eligibility of the simplified ITR-1 form to include them would significantly ease compliance.TAX REFUNDS AND PAYMENTS VIA OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS Delays in crediting refunds to overseas bank accounts and restrictions on tax payments through Indian accounts pose challenges for NRIs. Enabling smooth financial transactions through overseas accounts could resolve cash flow issues.REVISING DEADLINES FOR BELATED RETURNS Extending the deadline for filing belated or revised returns to 31 March of the assessment year would give NRIs more time to claim foreign tax credits, ensuring accurate and fair compliance. These proposed reforms promise to simplify tax compliance, enhance financial flexibility, and foster deeper engagement from the NRI community. As the government unveils the Union Budget, addressing these concerns could strengthen NRIs’ role in India’s growth story while ensuring a seamless tax ecosystem. The Budget is not just an announcement; it’s an opportunity to cement India’s position as a global economic powerhouse through inclusive policies.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Several brokerages have shared their views on the IT giant’s Q3 results. Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley maintained an 'Equal-Weight' rating with a target price of Rs 1,970. It said while services performance met expectations, software revenue fell short. The brokerage noted that the unchanged EBIT margin guidance offsets lower revenue growth projections. Nomura retained a 'Buy' rating on the HCLTech stock, setting a target price of Rs 2,000. The brokerage cited mixed results, but highlighted that FY25’s revenue growth guidance was raised to 4.5-5% YoY. It expects generative AI to drive future demand. Meanwhile, Nuvama downgraded the stock to 'Hold' with a target price of Rs 2,150. Despite decent growth in retail and telecom, analysts at Nuvama suggested that the valuation at 28.5x FY26 PE is stretched, though it praised HCL’s capital efficiency.

With a focus on addressing key economic challenges while leveraging opportunities, the Budget is expected to prioritise long-term solutions aimed at economic growth, employment generation, and poverty alleviation.advertisementFOCUS ON SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATIONIndia’s demographic advantage, particularly its youthful population, holds immense potential. To harness this, the government is expected to continue its emphasis on skill development and job creation. India’s demographic advantage, particularly its youthful population, holds immense potential. To harness this, the government is expected to continue its emphasis on skill development and job creation. The Budget may announce measures to further bolster vocational training, encourage entrepreneurship, and incentivise businesses to employ the youth. This is likely to create a ripple effect, driving economic growth and enhancing consumption through higher incomes. Bharat Dhawan, Managing Partner, Forvis Mazars in India, has stated, “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritise skill development and job creation to tap into India's demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes.”TACKLING INFLATION AND STRENGTHENING INFRASTRUCTURE Inflation, especially food inflation, remains a concern for many households. The government is likely to introduce supply-side measures to alleviate the pressure, possibly through more efficient agricultural practices, improved storage facilities, and incentives for production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) could help support rural consumption, mitigating the impact of rising prices. Infrastructure development is also set to remain a key focus, with continued investments in roads, logistics parks, and multi-modal transport, strengthening the overall logistics sector.  “We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivise production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics,” mentioned Dhawan.PRIORITISING HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, AND INNOVATION The Budget may also focus on strengthening key sectors such as healthcare, education, and skills development. Investments in these areas are essential for building a more inclusive and equitable society. Additionally, the government is likely to prioritise the integration of innovative technologies to foster inclusivity, formalisation, and transparent governance. Advancing digital infrastructure is also expected to be a key focus in policymaking. As India aims to build a sustainable and prosperous future, the 2025 Budget will be a key instrument in realising this vision. By focusing on inclusive growth and long-term solutions, it has the potential to unlock new avenues for development and economic transformation.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 14, 2025

Check these 7 simple steps To avoid delays in your online personal loan application, ensure you meet the eligibility criteria and have all necessary documents ready.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/looking-for-an-online-personal-loan-check-these-7-simple-steps-2664570-2025-01-14,"In today’s fast-paced world, applying for a personal loan has become a quick and hassle-free process. With a few clicks, you can raise a loan online through banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), or fintech platforms. However, knowing the essential documents and steps is crucial to avoid delays and ensure smooth processing.REQUIRED DOCUMENTS To successfully apply for a personal loan online, you must provide the following key documents: Salary slips: Lenders require salary slips from the past three months to assess your repayment ability and financial stability. These slips help determine your net income after deductions. PAN card: This is a mandatory document for all income-tax-related transactions, ensuring compliance with legal requirements. Aadhaar card: Serving as both identity and address proof, your Aadhaar must be linked to your mobile number for eKYC verification. Employment proof: Documents such as an ID card or appointment letter validate your employment status. Some lenders might also request salary slips for the past six months. Bank statements: Statements from the last three to six months may be required to verify your financial transactions and liquidity. Address proof: Utility bills or other valid documents are necessary to confirm your current address.APPLICATION PROCESS Applying for a personal loan online is a streamlined and efficient process that saves time and effort. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the steps involved: Research: Start by researching various lenders, including banks, NBFCs, and digital fintech platforms. Compare their interest rates, loan terms, processing fees, and customer reviews to identify the lender that best suits your financial needs and repayment capacity. Check eligibility: Before proceeding, verify your eligibility using the tools provided on the lender's website or mobile app. This step helps you understand whether you meet the income, employment, and credit score criteria required for approval. Apply online: Once you have chosen the lender, navigate to their online portal or mobile app. Fill out the application form carefully, entering all required personal, professional, and financial details. Double-check for accuracy to avoid delays in processing. Submit documents: Upload the necessary documents as part of the application process. These typically include identity proof (Aadhaar), address proof (utility bills or similar), income proof (salary slips or bank statements), and employment proof (appointment letter or ID card). Ensure all documents are legible and up-to-date. Await approval: After submitting your application and documents, the lender will review them. Personal loan apps and digital platforms are known for their speedy processing, often providing approval decisions within hours. Accept terms: If your loan is approved, the lender will share the offer details, including the loan amount, tenure, interest rate, and repayment schedule. Take the time to thoroughly review these terms and conditions. If satisfied, accept the offer to proceed. Receive funds: Once you accept the terms, the approved loan amount will be directly credited to your registered bank account. The entire process, from application to disbursement, can often be completed within 24-48 hours. By following these steps, you can seamlessly apply for a personal loan online, ensuring a hassle-free experience and timely access to funds when you need them most.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Must Watch

Regularly monitoring your credit score can help you maintain financial health and avoid surprises when applying for credit. But how often should you check your score, and what impact does it have?WHAT IS A CREDIT SCORE? A credit score is a numerical representation of your creditworthiness, calculated based on factors like your payment history, outstanding debt, and length of credit history. It helps lenders assess the risk of lending you money. Generally, the higher your score, the better your chances of securing favourable terms on loans or credit cards.HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU CHECK YOUR CREDIT SCORE? It’s advisable to check your credit score at least once a year to ensure its accuracy. By doing so, you can spot any payment discrepancies, ensuring that all your recent payments, including credit card bills, are accurately reflected in your report. Additionally, if you identify any errors, correcting them promptly can prevent them from negatively impacting your score. Regularly checking your credit score also helps you plan your finances more effectively, as it allows you to assess your ability to qualify for loans at favourable interest rates. Contrary to the common misconception, checking your score frequently doesn’t harm it. There are two types of credit enquiries: soft and hard. A soft enquiry occurs when you or a company checks your score for informational purposes, and it doesn’t affect your score. A hard enquiry, on the other hand, happens when a lender checks your score to evaluate your loan application. While a hard enquiry may cause a temporary dip in your score, it doesn’t have long-term consequences unless there are too many hard enquiries.WHEN IS IT IMPORTANT TO REVIEW YOUR CREDIT SCORE Besides the annual check, it’s also wise to review your credit score before applying for a loan or credit card to ensure you qualify for the best terms. Additionally, if you pay off a large debt, clear errors, or go through a significant life event like a job loss, check your score to track any changes. In the fast-paced world of personal finance, understanding and monitoring your credit score is key to making informed financial decisions and maintaining a healthy credit profile. Checking it regularly empowers you to stay ahead of any issues and act before they affect your financial well-being.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Must Watch

The final date for submission is January 15, 2025, giving individuals a narrow window to comply and avoid penalties. This extension, granted by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), has already pushed the original deadline from December 31, 2024, by 15 days to provide taxpayers more time to complete their filings.advertisementWHO NEEDS TO FILE? Taxpayers who missed the original income tax filing deadline need to submit a belated Income Tax Return (ITR) to fulfil their tax obligations. On the other hand, those who have already filed but need to rectify errors or omissions in their returns can file a revised ITR to ensure accuracy. Under Section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, taxpayers can revise their returns multiple times before the assessment is completed or up to three months prior to the end of the assessment year. However, revisions cannot increase refunds, reduce tax liabilities, or declare new losses.

Taxpayers with income below the Rs 3 lakh exemption limit incur no penalty. Missing the January 15, 2025, deadline will result in a Rs 10,000 penalty, underscoring the importance of timely filing.TIPS FOR LAST-MINUTE FILING For last-minute tax filing, use the Income Tax Department’s e-filing portal for a quick and hassle-free process. Ensure all details, such as income, deductions, and taxes paid, are accurate to avoid errors. Additionally, settle any pending tax dues, including interest and penalties, before filing to ensure compliance and avoid complications.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Must Watch

From March 1, 2025, Sebi’s revised guidelines allow mutual fund investors to nominate up to 10 individuals, aiming to address issues of unclaimed assets and improve asset management in cases of investor incapacity or death. This update enhances investor convenience while ensuring that the nomination process remains secure and transparent. Investors can now designate their assets amongst family members or associates with ease, fostering efficient wealth transmission.advertisementA QUICK LOOK INTO THE NEW GUIDELINES Under the new rules, investors must personally declare nominees, as Power of Attorney (PoA) holders are not authorised to complete this task. Each nominee’s details, including their Permanent Account Number (PAN), Aadhaar, or driving licence number, must be provided, along with their contact information and relationship with the investor. Nominees can hold joint accounts or maintain individual accounts for their respective shares. Sebi has also simplified the asset transmission process, requiring only essential documents such as a self-attested copy of the deceased investor's death certificate and updated Know Your Customer (KYC) details of the nominee. To promote transparency, regulated entities like mutual fund houses and depositories must offer online and offline nomination submission options. Online nominations will be verified using digital signatures or Aadhaar-based electronic signatures, with records retained for eight years after account transmission.ENHANCED INVESTOR PROTECTION The guidelines also aim to protect incapacitated investors by allowing nominees to manage portfolios and withdraw assets within set limits. Asset Management Companies (AMCs) must personally verify the investor’s approval using thumbprints or independently witnessed marks. Funds will only be transferred to verified bank accounts, and no changes to contact details or account information will be allowed, ensuring the legitimacy of transactions. Sebi's proactive measures pave the way for seamless wealth allocation and transmission.

Find out why experts urge patience and see volatility as a buying opportunity, not a cause for alarm.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/stock-market-turbulence-hits-mutual-funds-should-you-continue-sips-or-cash-in-2664671-2025-01-14,"The recent roller-coaster ride on Dalal Street has left many investors clutching their portfolios anxiously. With the Nifty 50 down nearly 12% from its September 2024 highs to touch lows near 23,250 in January 2025, the obvious question on investors’ minds is: Should I be worried about my mutual fund investments? The short answer, according to market experts, is a resounding no. In fact, experts from the industry indicate that despite the market turbulence, mutual funds have demonstrated resilience. December 2024 saw equity mutual funds attract inflows of Rs 41,155 crore, which marks a 14% increase from November. Even more telling is the record-breaking Rs 26,459 crore flowing into Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), suggesting that experienced investors see this volatility as an opportunity rather than a threat. Following Monday’s stock market crash, Radhika Gupta, Managing Director and CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund, said, “Today has not been a very pretty day — it's one of the roughest falls, with midcap indices down 4%.” However, she explained that such market movements shouldn't trigger panic reactions. “With times like this, all the news you see, there is a natural temptation to panic and take action that may not be good for your portfolio,” she noted. ""My advice to you would be to embrace the volatility and try to hold on for the long term.”STAY INVESTED OR CASH IN? For those tempted to halt their SIPs or switch to the perceived safety of fixed deposits, experts offer contrarian wisdom. Let SIPs continue because now you are buying units at cheaper levels, Gupta said. The strategy, known as cost averaging, often proves particularly effective during market downturns. “Generally, staggered investment is a good principle in these markets,” she added. Trivesh, COO of Tradejini, also pointed out some silver linings in the current market landscape. He noted that sectoral and thematic funds have attracted significant interest, pulling in Rs 15,331 crore in December alone. ""Sectors like pharma and auto stood out, reinforcing the importance of aligning fund choices with sectoral strength,"" he said.DON'T PANIC For investors still struggling with market anxiety, there's a middle path. Instead of making dramatic moves to cash, Gupta recommended considering hybrid funds or balanced advantage funds, which offer a mix of equity and debt exposure. According to her, the balanced approach can help investors maintain their long-term investment journey while managing short-term market stress. Therefore, the key message from market experts is clear: Market cycles are natural, and current volatility, while unsettling, is not unusual. Rather than panicking, investors should view this period as an opportunity to accumulate units at lower prices. As Gupta put it, ""Ups and downs are part of the market cycle. But what is very important is not to panic, to control our reactions and to go through our journey with emotional resilience.""

While some leaders support longer working hours, ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri mentioned the importance of aligning employees with the company’s bigger goals. Sanjiv Puri said on Tuesday that ITC focusses on having employees involved in the company's journey, rather than counting the hours they work, according to PTI.advertisementPURI ON EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENTSpeaking at an event in Delhi, Puri made it clear that ITC does not believe in tracking the number of hours employees work but in helping them contribute to the company's larger journey. Speaking at an event in Delhi, Puri made it clear that ITC does not believe in tracking the number of hours employees work but in helping them contribute to the company's larger journey. ""It’s about being part of the company's mission and feeling the drive to make a difference,"" Puri explained. Puri believes that personal empowerment and alignment with a company’s vision yield far better results than focusing on rigid work hours.INDUSTRY LEADERS AND CELEBRITIES REACT Subrahmanyan’s comments on the 90-hour workweek and his regret over not being able to make employees work on Sundays have caused a storm on social media. His statement, questioning employees' time at home, was met with criticism from celebrities and business leaders alike, including Anand Mahindra and Harsh Goenka, who voiced concerns about employee well-being and work-life balance. Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone also stressed the importance of mental health and personal time in maintaining long-term productivity.DEFENDING SUBRAHMANYAN’S REMARKS While Subrahmanyan's statements drew widespread criticism, L&T’s Head of HR, Sonica Muraleedharan, defended him, claiming that his words were misinterpreted. In a LinkedIn post, she urged the public to understand the context of his remarks, arguing that the intention behind his comments was to encourage a deeper commitment to work, not to undermine employees’ personal time. Moreover, Uma Srinivasan, Head of Talent Management at L&T, defended Chairman S.N. Subrahmanyan, and mentioned his empathy, commitment to employee well-being, and the company's dedication to its values, despite recent criticism.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 14, 2025

The decision, shared in an internal memo by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, focusses on improving overall performance by moving out those not meeting expectations more quickly than before. In the memo, Zuckerberg said, “I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.” The planned reduction, according to the memo, is part of Meta's effort to achieve 10% ""non-regrettable"" attrition by the end of the current performance cycle. This includes around 5% from 2024 alone. Employees who have been with Meta long enough to receive a performance review and are deemed underperforming will be impacted. The company assured affected employees that they would receive “generous severance.” This announcement comes as Meta continues to restructure its policies and operations under Zuckerberg’s ""Year of Efficiency"" initiative, which was launched to optimise costs and streamline the organisation. Over the past year, Meta has already laid off thousands of employees, focusing on team realignment and cutting costs to enhance profitability. The layoffs coincide with several strategic and policy shifts at Meta, some of which have sparked internal and external discussions.  Meta recently made changes to its content moderation policies, loosening rules on posts related to controversial topics such as immigration and transgender rights. The company framed these changes as a step towards encouraging ""free expression."" However, the move faced criticism from employees and external groups, who expressed concerns about potential harm to marginalised communities. The company also announced the end of its third-party fact-checking programme in the United States. This decision raised fears about the possible spread of misinformation on Meta’s platforms, especially given its influence on public discourse. Meta has reduced internal programmes aimed at improving workforce diversity. The scaling back of these initiatives has drawn criticism, with some viewing it as a departure from its previously stated commitment to inclusivity.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/haldiram-stake-pepsico-enters-bidding-against-temasek-alpha-wave-starts-talks-report-2664931-2025-01-15,"PepsiCo has joined the race to acquire a stake in Haldiram Snacks Food, India’s largest ethnic snacks company, reported The Economic Times. The company has initiated discussions with the Aggarwal family, who own Haldiram, for a minority stake. This makes PepsiCo a late entrant in a competition that already includes global investment firms Temasek and Alpha Wave Global. Executives quoted in the report said PepsiCo’s leadership from its New York headquarters has started direct talks with the Aggarwal family in recent weeks. These discussions are still at an early stage and may not necessarily result in a deal. Unlike its Indian unit, the funding for this stake purchase will reportedly be led by PepsiCo’s US-based parent company. The Aggarwal family is seeking a valuation of Rs 85,000-90,000 crore for Haldiram as they look to bring in an external investor for the first time. Temasek and Alpha Wave Global have already submitted binding offers for a 10-15% stake in Haldiram. These offers were made last month, putting the firms in an advanced stage of negotiations. Temasek is said to be leading the discussions, with reports suggesting a potential investment of over $1 billion as per the report. Haldiram is a market leader in ethnic snacks, offering over 500 types of products, including namkeen, sweets, ready-to-eat meals, and pre-mixed food items. The company reported revenue of Rs 12,800 crore in FY24, more than double that of PepsiCo’s snacks business in India, which earned Rs 4,763.29 crore during the nine-month period from April to December 2023. For PepsiCo, which dominates the western snacks market with brands like Lay’s, Kurkure, and Doritos, this move could provide a foothold in the fast-growing ethnic snacks segment. PepsiCo holds a 24% market share in western snacks but has limited presence in traditional Indian snacks like namkeen and bhujiya. The Indian snacks market, worth Rs 42,694.9 crore in 2023 according to IMARC Group, is expected to grow to Rs 95,521.8 crore by 2032. However, it is highly fragmented, with numerous regional players such as Balaji, Bikanerwala, and Bikaji Foods competing alongside Haldiram. These regional brands often offer lower prices, direct distribution, and better retailer margins, challenging larger players like PepsiCo. PepsiCo India has been under pressure to expand its snacks division, especially as its beverages business is managed almost entirely by Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL), a listed company under RJ Corp.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Must Watch

With the Union Budget 2025 around the corner, home-loan borrowers are optimistic about policy changes that could make this dream more affordable and accessible. With the housing sector playing an important role in India’s GDP and employment generation, stakeholders anticipate reforms to ease financial burdens and boost homeownership.advertisementENHANCED TAX BENEFITSCurrently, borrowers can claim up to Rs 2 lakh per year as a deduction for interest paid on home loans under Section 24(b). However, this limit, unchanged since 2014, falls short of addressing the affordability gap, especially with soaring property prices even in smaller cities. Currently, borrowers can claim up to Rs 2 lakh per year as a deduction for interest paid on home loans under Section 24(b). However, this limit, unchanged since 2014, falls short of addressing the affordability gap, especially with soaring property prices even in smaller cities. Home loan borrowers hope for an increase in the deduction limits, making home loans more affordable. Similarly, introducing separate limits for principal repayment deductions or expanding existing ones can offer much-needed relief to borrowers, especially for salaried individuals constrained by other statutory contributions.EXPANDING SUPPORT MEASURES High interest rates remain a significant challenge for homebuyers, making monthly payments a financial strain. Reinstating earlier provisions that offered additional tax relief for first-time buyers could help offset these costs. Borrowers are also looking for changes in the new tax regime, such as including home-loan interest deductions, which could boost affordability and encourage more people to invest in housing.ADDRESSING CONSTRUCTION COSTS Rising construction costs and land prices have made housing increasingly expensive, particularly in urban areas. Supply-side measures like tax relief for builders, streamlined approvals, and incentives for affordable housing projects could reduce costs and make homes accessible to more buyers. Moreover, temporary reductions in stamp duty or state-level rebates for first-time buyers would significantly lower the overall cost of purchasing a home. With the Budget 2025, policymakers have a unique opportunity to address these concerns and make homeownership a reality for millions. By introducing thoughtful reforms, the government can ensure that housing is not just an aspiration but an attainable milestone in every Indian's journey.

While this is a good sign for market investors, analysts have made it clear that a proper recovery will take time. Some of the factors behind today’s positive run on Dalal Street are the appreciation of the rupee against the US dollar, a decline in US bond yields ahead of key inflation data, and falling crude oil prices.

The government’s fiscal policies are eagerly awaited, particularly by middle-income households, who play a pivotal role in driving India’s economy.FOCUS ON MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS There is growing anticipation for adjustments in personal income tax to alleviate the financial burden on middle-income taxpayers. Cutting tax slabs or raising exemption limits could greatly ease the financial strain on these households, helping them spend more while saving. This boost in consumption can play a key role in driving economic growth. Moreover, targeted tax benefits in forward-looking sectors, such as green energy, artificial intelligence (AI), and upskilling initiatives, could incentivise investments in these areas. Such measures not only align with India’s sustainable growth ambitions but also foster innovation and entrepreneurship in emerging fields. Dr. Suresh Ramanathan, Dean & Principal, Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai, stated, “A reduction in personal income tax slabs or raising the exemption limit could provide much-needed relief to middle-income households, who form the backbone of India’s economy.”SIMPLIFIED COMPLIANCE Simplifying the tax framework has been a longstanding demand of taxpayers. The Budget could introduce reforms that ease compliance, improve transparency, and make the filing process more user-friendly. Such measures would encourage more individuals and businesses to enter the tax net, ultimately broadening the tax base. Furthermore, it is important to establish a fair tax system where everyone contributes based on their income level. Policymakers must balance generating revenue with fairness to build trust amongst taxpayers. Dr. Ramanathan mentioned, “Policymakers must also consider measures that enhance taxpayer compliance through transparency and ease of filing, thus broadening the tax base.”BALANCING SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM GOALS The Budget presents an opportunity to strike a delicate balance between short-term economic needs and long-term structural reforms. While measures to boost consumption are crucial, investments in strategic sectors like renewable energy, technology, and education will ensure sustained growth. As Budget Day approaches, taxpayers and industry stakeholders alike await a financial plan that promotes prosperity and inclusivity. With well-thought-out policies, the government can pave the way for a robust and resilient economy while addressing immediate public concerns.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Tune InMust Watch

What stock market investors are hoping forStock markets are buzzing with anticipation for the upcoming budget, especially after the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced key changes to capital gains taxation in her seventh Budget.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/budget-2025-stock-market-expectations-capital-gains-tax-ltcg-relief-dalal-street-investors-2665049-2025-01-15,"The stock market has emerged one of the most popular ways for people to grow their money, and has seen more and more Indians investing on the Dalal Street over the last few years. Yet, taxes on stock market gains are eating into investors' returns, making many think twice before investing. With rising inflation and taxes like the LTCG jumping from 10% to 12.5%, investors are finding their returns shrinking. As Budget 2025 approaches, market experts are strongly pushing for tax relief to keep stock market investments attractive. They say making taxes simpler and lighter could encourage more people to invest, helping both investors and the economy grow faster. The upcoming budget, which will mark Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's eighth presentation (including five annual and two interim budgets), is expected to have stock market investors on the hook.  Trivesh, COO of Tradejini, said, ""Looking ahead to Budget 2025, I feel the government might propose a balance between addressing public expectations and sustaining economic stability amid evolving market conditions.""  He further added that the impact of changes made in capital gains tax in budget 2024 has been notable. ""For small investors, the new hike in Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax rates from 10% to 12.5%, mixed with the raised exemption limit to Rs 1.25 lakh, has had a measured effect,"" Trivesh said. He suggested that ""streamlining the capital gains tax structure across asset classes by aligning rates and holding periods could reduce complexities and encourage broader participation in equity markets."" Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, outlined key expectations for capital markets, including ""stabilisation of capital gains taxation: Enhanced clarity and predictability, fostering greater confidence among investors."" He also mentioned the possibility of ""restoring indexation benefits, revising tax rates for long-term investments."" VLA Ambala, Sebi Registered Research Analyst and Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, provided detailed insights into recent market performance. ""According to the latest data, between April 1, 2024, and January 12, 2025, Securities Transaction Tax (STT) collections surged to Rs 44,538 crore, and other tax earnings amounted to an additional Rs 2,868 crores,"" she said.  Addressing current tax challenges, Ambala said, ""The amount held in demat accounts has already been taxed or is not exempt from tax, creating a dual taxation structure that is detrimental to investors."" He further notes that ""the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax burden was increased by 2.5%, inflating the rate to 12.50%, up from the previous 10%. Similarly, Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) rose from 15% to 20% and are subject to tax at applicable income tax slab rates."" Ambala advocated for tax relief and said, ""I believe to ensure a more conducive investment environment, the government must consider offering relief to investors in the upcoming Union budget."" She highlighted that ""this mounting tax burden should be addressed urgently with suitable tax reliefs, particularly in STT, where the gains have already been taxed.""Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

cba82b1b-0db3-4d9f-8052-1a98a25b7243,Budget 2025: Is merging old and new income tax regimes a good idea?Will merging the old and new tax regimes offer the best of both worlds for taxpayers? Experts weigh in on whether a unified system could simplify compliance or introduce new challenges.,https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/union-budget-2025-old-and-new-income-tax-regime-merger-benefits-challenges-explained-2665029-2025-01-15,"As the Union Budget 2025 approaches, the country’s vast middle class population is eagerly awaiting announcements related to income tax. As always, the air is thick with speculation about potential relief measures, including tax breaks for those earning up to Rs 15 lakh and an increased standard deduction under the new income tax regime. However, much like previous years, experts predict that the government is unlikely to introduce any major changes to the old income tax regime. This stagnancy has led to rising discussions about whether it’s time to scrap the old regime altogether. Yet, such a move would be risky, given the sizeable number of taxpayers who rely on benefits like home loan interest deductions. To avoid backlash, another option can be considered: merging the old and new tax regimes.WHY WAS NEW TAX REGIME INTRODUCED? The new tax regime was introduced in the Union Budget 2020 to simplify the taxation process. By offering lower tax rates with fewer deductions, the government aimed to encourage greater participation in tax compliance while streamlining operations for the tax department. “The government has prioritised the new tax regime to simplify the taxation process and enhance compliance. It was also aimed at letting individuals not having to make forced investments or donations for saving taxes, thereby making more cash available at their disposal,” said Kumarmanglam Vijay, Partner at JSA Advocates & Solicitors. The preference for the new tax regime is evident, as nearly two-thirds of individual taxpayers have opted for it. According to a recent report, over 67% of taxpayers now choose the new tax regime, underscoring its growing popularity. Merging the old and new tax regimes could potentially offer the best of both worlds. Taxpayers would retain the deductions available under the old regime while benefiting from the higher tax slabs of the new regime, leading to significant tax savings for eligible individuals. However, this comes with its own set of challenges. “The cost of compliance under the old tax regime is significantly higher. Merging the two would mean additional compliance burdens for taxpayers, companies, and the tax administration,” said Kumarmanglam Vijay. He further highlighted that simplification should not come at the expense of key taxpayer benefits. Subhash Chand Aggarwal, Chairman and Managing Director of SMC Global Securities Limited, added another perspective. “The old tax regime charges higher tax rates but provides more exemption and deduction benefits, while the new tax regime offers the opposite. Merging the two can simplify the tax structure but could disadvantage those who don’t invest enough to claim deductions under the old regime,” he said. Aggarwal added that the flexibility of two separate regimes allows taxpayers to choose based on their income levels and long-term financial goals. “There’s certainly a need to simplify the tax structure, but maintaining two regimes offers taxpayers the ability to make more informed decisions regarding their investments and spending,” he said. While merging the two regimes may seem like a step toward simplification, it could lead to unintended consequences. Taxpayers who rely heavily on deductions might face a loss of benefits, while the government risks a reduction in tax revenue. Additionally, the increased administrative burden on employers and tax authorities could outweigh the benefits of a unified regime. “The need of the hour is to raise the tax slabs with fewer unambiguous deductions to ensure ease of compliance for all,” said Vijay. He warned that merging the regimes could be counterproductive, as it might reintroduce the complexities the new tax regime sought to eliminate. As Budget 2025 approaches, the government’s focus is likely to remain on promoting compliance and simplifying tax administration. Whether it opts to merge the old and new regimes or continues to offer them separately, taxpayers can expect the ongoing debate to shape the future of India’s taxation system. For now, experts advise taxpayers to carefully evaluate their options under both regimes, considering their income levels, deduction claims, and long-term financial objectives. With clarity expected in the upcoming budget, all eyes will be on the Finance Minister’s announcements regarding income tax reforms.With inputs from Sonu Vivek Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

4e9482e5-edba-4847-8f5e-e1ca012d4855,Budget 2025: 10 key financial terms every taxpayer must knowThe Union Budget 2025 will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1.,https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/budget-2025-10-key-financial-terms-every-taxpayer-must-know-2665024-2025-01-15,"With the Union Budget 2025 just around the corner, all eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as she prepares to unveil the financial roadmap for the nation. To fully grasp the announcements and their implications, understanding key budgetary terms is important. Let’s have a quick look at some of the 10 most important terms that every taxpayer should know.advertisementCAPITAL EXPENDITURE (CAPEX) Capital expenditure refers to the money allocated by the government for developing long-term assets such as roads, railways, and other infrastructure. This type of spending is aimed at boosting economic growth and creating employment opportunities.REVENUE EXPENDITURE Unlike capex, revenue expenditure involves day-to-day operational costs such as salaries, subsidies, and maintenance. It also includes interest payments on the government’s debt.REVENUE RECEIPT These are the earnings of the government through taxation, fees, and services. For instance, the money collected through income tax, GST, or fines forms part of revenue receipts.DIRECT TAXES These are taxes collected directly from individuals or entities, including income tax and corporate tax. They directly affect taxpayers and form a major part of the government's revenue.INDIRECT TAXES Indirect taxes are applied to goods and services, such as GST and excise duty. These are not paid directly by individuals but are included in the prices of goods and services consumed.TAX DEDUCTION A tax deduction reduces the amount of income that is subject to tax. Investments in schemes like PPF, ELSS, or fixed deposits make taxpayers eligible for these deductions.REBATE A rebate reduces the overall tax liability, offering relief to taxpayers. It encourages spending or investing, contributing to economic growth.FISCAL DEFICIT The fiscal deficit indicates the gap between the government’s total expenditure and revenue. It is filled through borrowing and reflects the financial health of the economy.FISCAL POLICY This is the government’s strategy for managing the economy through taxation and spending to control inflation and promote growth.INFLATION Inflation, which is marked by an increase in the general price level of goods and services, decreases the purchasing power of money. Managing it is critical for maintaining economic stability. Understanding these key terms can empower taxpayers to better grasp the budget’s impact. As Budget 2025 unfolds, these concepts will play a critical role in shaping the economic narrative, ensuring everyone stays informed and prepared.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Tune InMust Watch

While bond yields and market dynamics might sound like distant concerns to many Indians, the truth is that this sell-off hits closer to home than most realise. Recent data paint a concerning picture of what's really happening and why it matters to all Indians. Remember that last home loan application? Well, the same basic principle applies to governments – they need to borrow money too. Right now, we're watching a dramatic exodus from government bonds worldwide. The US Treasury yields have shot up to 4.8% this January, and it's not just another number on the financial news ticker. Think of it this way: when neighbourhood property rates surge, it affects everything from rent to shop prices. Similarly, when government borrowing costs spike, it creates a domino effect across the entire economy.WILL GLOBAL BOND SELL-OFF IMPACT INDIA? Most likely. Domestic markets have taken some hard punches lately. And India's 10-year bond yield has climbed to 6.9%, and foreign institutional investors (FII) are heading for the exit. Many fund managers and experts have indicated that foreign investors are chasing safer returns in developed markets, and that is the reason behind the FII exodus from emerging markets like India. But here's where it gets interesting. Unlike previous market storms, India has not been caught completely off-guard this time. The country's forex reserves are healthy, and its recent inclusion in JPMorgan's GBI-EM index isn't just another feather in the cap – it's a potential game-changer that could bring billions in steady, long-term investments.SHOULD INVESTORS BE WORRIED? Let's cut through the jargon and get to what matters. Anyone planning to take a home loan or expand their business with borrowed money might want to crunch those numbers again. Banks aren't in a generous mood when their own borrowing costs are rising. For stock market investors, especially those heavily invested in infrastructure or real estate companies, it's time to put on the thinking cap. These sectors typically struggle when borrowing costs rise. But before hitting the panic button, remember that India's consumption story remains comparatively strong and recent inflation data suggests that it could get better. In fact, recent data also made it clear that the middle class isn't going to stop buying cars or homes just because bond yields are up.WHAT NEXT? The reality is this: While global markets are throwing a tantrum, India's position isn't as precarious as during previous crises. Sure, the nation will feel the heat – the currency might take some hits, and import bills could pinch more. But the economic fundamentals tell a different story. For the average investor, this isn't the time for radical portfolio surgery. Instead, consider it a wake-up call to review financial plans, as indicated by experts. A more balanced approach between stocks and fixed-income investments might be worth considering. And for those sitting on the fence about that big-ticket loan? That decision might be better made sooner rather than later. Market cycles come and go. What matters is having a clear head when others are losing theirs. Keeping an eye on interest rates, staying informed about market movements, but not letting daily market noise drive long-term financial decisions – that's the key to navigating these choppy waters. The bond market drama might seem like a complex puzzle, but its pieces directly connect to our daily financial lives. Understanding these connections is the first step toward making smarter money choices in these uncertain times.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 15, 2025

The old regime offers several tax-saving opportunities that can significantly reduce your taxable income, but the key lies in timely investments. Taxpayers must complete these investments by March 31 to claim benefits in their 2025 ITR, as the 2024–25 fiscal year comes to a close.advertisementSECTION 80C Section 80C of the Income Tax Act is one of the most widely utilised sections for tax deductions. It allows individuals to claim deductions up to Rs 1.5 lakh on investments made in various financial products. Some popular choices include life insurance premiums, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) contributions, Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC), and tax-saving fixed deposits with a 5-year lock-in period. In addition, home loan principal repayments and children’s tuition fees are also eligible for deductions under this section. For those aiming to boost their retirement savings, contributions to the National Pension Scheme (NPS) are another smart choice under Section 80C, while contributions to the Sukanya Samriddhi Account for a girl child also qualify.EXTRA DEDUCTIONS: SECTION 80D AND 80CCD Taxpayers can benefit from Section 80D, which allows deductions of up to Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums. For senior citizens, the limit is enhanced to Rs 50,000. An additional deduction is available for health insurance premiums paid for parents, providing a comprehensive way to reduce tax burdens. Section 80CCD (1B) offers a further opportunity to save Rs 50,000 on NPS investments, making it a highly attractive option for taxpayers looking to secure their retirement while enjoying additional tax benefits.OTHER DEDUCTIONS: SECTION 24(B) AND 80G Section 24(b) provides relief for homeowners by allowing a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh on interest paid on home loans for self-occupied property. Similarly, Section 80G encourages charitable donations by offering tax exemptions on contributions made to specified organisations. Act early and make use of these deductions before the financial year ends—you might save more on taxes than you might think.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Must Watch

With banks and regulators like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) working hard to mitigate the risks, it's crucial for customers to understand their liabilities and the steps to protect themselves. Here's everything you need to know about dealing with unauthorised credit card transactions.advertisementLIABILITY FOR FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONSCustomers may be fully liable for unauthorised transactions if they are negligent. The RBI guidelines state that if a customer shares payment details or fails to report a transaction promptly, they will bear the loss. Customers may be fully liable for unauthorised transactions if they are negligent. The RBI guidelines state that if a customer shares payment details or fails to report a transaction promptly, they will bear the loss. However, if fraud occurs without customer negligence and is reported within three days, the customer holds zero liability. If the report is delayed beyond three days, the customer’s liability will be capped at either Rs 10,000 (for credit cards with a limit of Rs 5 lakh) or Rs 25,000 (for credit cards with a limit over Rs 5 lakh). The bank has to prove the customer’s liability in such cases.WHAT HAPPENS AFTER REPORTING FRAUD? Once a fraudulent transaction is reported, banks are required to reverse the charge within 10 working days. Even if the fraud results from customer negligence, banks may choose to waive the liability. In case of unresolved complaints, the bank must resolve the issue within 90 days. If they fail to do so, the customer will be liable only for a minimal amount, and any interest incurred from the fraud will not be charged.HOW TO PREVENT AND REPORT FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS The first step if you suspect unauthorised transactions is to block your card immediately. Call the credit card helpline or customer care, and be ready to provide your card details for verification. After blocking the card, request a replacement. Submit any necessary documents to report the fraud. Prompt reporting and action are key to minimising the damage. By being vigilant and knowing your rights, you can ensure that you are protected from credit card fraud.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 15, 2025Trending Reel

f9b89a6d-62de-44c6-a712-b04983900c87,"Nate Anderson's Hindenburg Research to shut shop. Here's whyNate Anderson, the man behind Hindenburg Research, announced the decision in a detailed post, explaining that the firm's work is complete, and it is time to move on.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/hindenburg-research-nate-anderson-to-close-reason-here-why-adani-nikola-2665486-2025-01-16,"Known for sending shivers down corporate giants to their core and claiming to uncover billions in alleged frauds, Nate Anderson, the man behind Hindenburg Research, has decided to close the curtains on his short-selling saga. From triggering a $150 billion storm in Adani Group shares to taking down titans like Nikola and Eros International, Hindenburg was synonymous with financial accountability or controversy, depending on which side youre on. Anderson announced the decision in a detailed post, explaining that the firms work is complete, and it is time to move on. ""As Ive shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research,"" he said in a blog post titled 'Personal Note From Our Founder' on Hindenburg's website.WHY HINDENBURG RESEARCH IS CLOSING Anderson clarified that there was no single reason behind his decision. There is no external threat, personal health issue, or any other pressing matter forcing this move. Instead, he described it as a natural conclusion to a chapter of his life. The closure comes after Hindenburg completed its final cases of alleged financial fraud, which have been shared with regulators. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today, Anderson said. Reflecting on his career, Anderson shared that his intense focus on the firm came at the expense of other aspects of life. He explained that his motivation in the early years stemmed from a need to prove himself, but over time, he began to see Hindenburg Research as just one chapter in his life. In the next six months, Anderson plans to create and release materials and videos to openly share the firm's investigative methods. He hopes this will inspire others to continue similar work. Hindenburg Research operated with a small but dedicated team of 11 members. Anderson described the teams commitment to precision, evidence-based reporting, and taking bold steps to uncover financial fraud. He highlighted the significant impact of their work, with nearly 100 individuals facing civil or criminal charges as a result of their investigations. ""Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking,"" saidAnderson.MAJOR HINDENBURG CASES Hindenburg gained global attention in January 2023 when it released a report alleging fraud and stock manipulation by the Adani Group. The report triggered a massive selloff in Adani Group shares, wiping out over $100 billion of Gautam Adanis personal wealth. The market capitalisation of 10 Adani Group companies fell from Rs 19.19 lakh crore on 24 January 2023 to below Rs 7 lakh crore by February 27. While Adani stocks eventually recovered, the Supreme Court later said that allegations by organisations like Hindenburg or others, without proper verification, cannot serve as evidence. Hindenburgs earlier work included exposing Nikola Corporation in 2020, accusing it of fraud. The electric vehicle companys founder, Trevor Milton, resigned soon after. In 2019, the firm alleged financial mismanagement at Eros International, predicting its stocks would become worthless. Anderson is focused on helping his team transition into their next roles. Some team members plan to establish their own research firms, while others are exploring new opportunities. ""For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement,"" the Hindenburg founder said. He expressed confidence in his team, describing them as brilliant, focused, and easy to work with. He also invited interested organisations to reach out to him if they are looking for talented professionals.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Must Watch ",business,2025-01-16T09:12:00,14.9,6.8

The company posted a 14% rise in net profit in Q3 FY25 at Rs 415 crore, higher than Rs 365 crore in the same period last year, driving positive investor sentiment. HDFC Lifes net premium income rose by 10% year-on-year to Rs 16,771 crore, as per its stock exchange filings.

HSBC reiterated its buy rating with a target price of Rs 750, citing improved margins and the companys push to expand its distribution network and attract new customers. The brokerage said the shift away from low-margin products and stronger credit protection sales could further boost profitability. Jefferies, which also has a Rs 750 price target, praised HDFC Lifes diverse product mix and resilience, despite challenges in the regulatory landscape. However, it flagged uncertainties around potential changes to bancassurance norms that could impact growth. On the other hand, CLSA has trimmed its target to Rs 690, citing slower growth and regulatory challenges. Still, it retained an outperformance rating, crediting the insurers sound financial health.

RVNL informed the stock exchanges late on January 15 about receiving a Letter of Acceptance (LoA) from BSNL. The order involves the creation, upgradation, operation, and maintenance of the Middle Mile Network under the BharatNet project. The projects construction phase is expected to be completed in three years. Additionally, the agreement includes a maintenance contract spanning 10 years, with compensation set at 5.5% of the capital expenditure for the first five years and increasing to 6.5% for the following five years.

Analysts believe this latest project will boost the companys revenue visibility and earnings potential over the long term.

The S&P BSE Sensex was up 308.61 points to77,032.69, while the NSE Nifty50 added 105.75 points to23,318.95 as of 10:25 AM. Rise in the stock market could be attributed to several factors, of which the positive US inflation data was the biggest trigger for Sensex and Nifty.WHY DID STOCK MARKET GAIN TODAY US stocks rose on Wednesday night after new numbers showed US core inflation grew less than what experts had thought it would. This good news spread to Asian stock markets on Thursday, pushing them higher too. The US dollar and interest rates on US government bonds have come down a bit in the last few days. Some market watchers think the recent rise in stocks tied to Donald Trump might have reached its peak. Adding to the positive market sentiment in markets, Israel and Hamas agreed to stop fighting in Gaza, which helped calm worries about the conflict. This made investors feel better about putting money into stocks. Many think this could slow down the recent trend of foreign investors taking their money out of markets. Closer to home, investors were waiting eagerly for three big Indian companies - Reliance Industries, Infosys, and Axis Bank - to share their latest earnings reports later in the day. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that macro indicators from the US suggest that as the swearing-in of Mr Trump nears, the Trump trade has peaked. ""The decline in US bond yields and the dollar index are indications of this. This downshift in the dollar index and bond yields has been assisted by the lower-than-expected CPI inflation in the US, again igniting hopes of more rate cuts by the Fed this year. Hope of an end to the conflict in Gaza is another major relief. This global backdrop is positive for the market,"" he added.He also said that a relief rally in India is certainly on the cards, but the sustainability of the rally will depend on the Indian macros, particularly the revival of GDP and earnings growth. ""Budget expectations can aid a rally in the market but it will soon give way to the trends in GDP and earnings growth.Investors should focus on largecaps which have been more stable than the mid and small caps.

The news of the ceasefire, along with other positive economic signals from the US, helped lift investor sentiment across global markets. The positive mood in markets started with US stocks rising on Wednesday night, driven by lower-than-expected US core inflation numbers. This optimism also spread to Asian markets. Indian stock markets extended gains for the third straight session on Thursday. Sensex gained over 400 points in early trade while Nifty was up nearly 150 points. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explained the recent surge in markets and said that the lower US inflation has renewed hopes for more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year.IMPACT ON GLOBAL MARKET The ceasefire agreement's impact on markets could be huge, particularly for sectors tied to global trade and energy. Trivesh, COO of Tradejini, said, ""Market volatility is often powered by multiple concerns, easing one of those pressures can provide a much-needed relief, allowing the market to climb a bit higher with fewer problems in its path."" He particularly highlighted the potential benefits for energy markets, and said, ""For global markets, it reduces geopolitical risks that often create volatility, especially in energy sectors. Stability in the Middle East could help ease concerns about oil supply disruptions, which we feel is a positive development for inflation and broader economic conditions.""IMPACT ON DALAL STREET For Indian markets, the impact could be felt across several sectors. ""Oil and gas, logistics and manufacturing sectors likely to get some relief."" However, he cautions investors to remain vigilant: ""But investors shouldn't let down their guard because this geopolitical environment is still evolving, it's a fluid situation,"" said Trivesh. Dr. Vijayakumar suggests that while a relief rally is likely in India, its lasting power will depend on domestic factors: ""Budget expectations can aid a rally in the market but it will soon give way to the trends in GDP and earnings growth."" He advises investors to ""focus on largecaps which have been more stable than the mid and small caps,"" and notes that sectors ""like Pharma and health care, IT and discretionary consumption will remain resilient.""

Imagine a stranger approaches you, claiming their phone battery is dead and asking to borrow your phone for an urgent call. While it seems harmless, this act of kindness could lead to a financial disaster. Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has issued a warning about a new scam that exploits such situations. Sharing a video on X, he cautioned, Imagine this: A stranger approaches you and asks to use your phone to make an emergency call. Most well-meaning people would probably hand over their phone. But this is a new scam.    The video explains how scammers operate, their intended targets, and ways to safeguard yourself from falling victim.HOW THE SCAM WORKS The scam starts with a simple request to borrow your phone. While it may appear harmless, scammers use this opportunity to tamper with your device. They can install malicious apps or exploit existing ones, change settings to forward calls and messages to their own number, and intercept critical banking notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs). Even after returning the phone, these changes allow scammers to access your financial accounts and make unauthorised transactions without raising suspicion.TIPS TO STAY SAFE To safeguard yourself from such scams, always avoid handing over your phone to strangers.

Adani Power was the top gainer, rising nearly 9% in early trade; Adani Green also climbed nearly 9%. Adani Enterprises, which has pared most of the gains, was up nearly 7.7% as investors reacted to the news of Hindenburg. Adani Total Gas, Adani Energy Solutions, and Adani Ports also rose as much as 6.6% in early trade.WHY IS HINDENBURG RESEARCH SHUTTING DOWN? The rally in Adani Group stocks comes in the wake of an official statement by Hindenburg Researchs founder, Nate Anderson, who announced the firms closure. Anderson shared that the decision was part of a long-term plan to wind down operations after completing their investigative projects, including those targeting Ponzi schemes. In January 2023, Hindenburg Research published a scathing report alleging financial irregularities within the Adani Group, leading to a massive decline in the conglomerate's market valuation. While Adani Group has strongly denied the allegations, the fallout from Hindenburgs report is something that traders and investors will remember for a long time. In his statement, Anderson dismissed any specific trigger for the closure, saying, There is not one particular threat, health issue, or personal matter, and highlighted a desire to prioritise family, travel, and personal interests after years of intense focus on his career. The timing of Hindenburgs closure coincides with increasing scrutiny from US lawmakers regarding the firms activities, adding intrigue to the announcement. Anderson also expressed support for his former team, some of whom plan to start their own research ventures. For Adani Group, the end of Hindenburg Research marks the conclusion of a turbulent chapter, as investors turn their focus back to the companys operational performance and growth prospects.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 16, 2025",business,2025-01-16T12:39:00,9.0,0.8

As more people use UPI for its ease, several myths have popped up that could put the security of digital payments at risk. Its important to debunk these myths and ensure that UPI remains a safe and efficient mode of payment.advertisementMYTH 1: PAYMENT REQUESTS GET APPROVED AUTOMATICALLY One of the most common misconceptions is that simply opening a UPI or bank app will automatically approve a payment request. This is far from true. To initiate a transaction, users must navigate to the payment request and explicitly click on the Pay option. Additionally, the user must enter their UPI PIN to authorise the payment. Without these steps, the transaction would not proceed, ensuring that only authorised users can make payments.MYTH 2: EXTERNAL PARTIES CAN INITIATE WITHDRAWALS Another prevalent myth is that an external party can initiate a withdrawal from the users account directly. This is false. UPI and other banking apps are designed to ensure that only the account holder can initiate a transaction. No unauthorised person can access your funds without your direct involvement, making UPI transactions secure as long as the user is vigilant.MYTH 3: ENTERING THE PIN FOR BALANCE ENQUIRY AUTHORISES PAYMENTS Some users believe that simply entering their UPI PIN to check their balance can authorise a payment request. This is not the case. The PIN is required even for balance checks, but it does not authorise any payment or withdrawal transactions. For a payment to be processed, a separate action must be taken by the user. As more people use digital payments, it's important to understand these myths to keep transactions safe. By following the right steps and staying informed, users can make payments confidently, without worrying about fraud or errors.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Must Watch ",business,2025-01-16T14:01:00,13.8,2.2

Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the decision on Thursday, 16 January. While the Cabinet has given its approval, the date for setting up the commission has not been disclosed. This development comes just ahead of the Union Budget 2025 and is expected to bring a salary hike for government employees and retirees.advertisementWHAT THE 8TH PAY COMMISSION MEANS The 8th Pay Commission is expected to build upon the reforms introduced by the 7th Pay Commission, which was implemented in January 2016 and will conclude its recommendations by the end of 2025. A committee has been set up by the Central government to oversee its implementation. Reports suggest a possible increase in the fitment factor from 2.57 to 2.86, a key parameter in calculating revised salaries. If implemented, this change could result in a rise in the basic salaries of government employees. The fitment factor determines how much the basic pay is multiplied to calculate revised salaries and pensions.SALARY REVISION UNDER PREVIOUS PAY COMMISSIONS The transition from the 6th Pay Commission to the 7th Pay Commission marked a significant change in the pay structure for government employees.

 7th Pay Commission (2016)

Minimum monthly pay: Rs 18,000
Maximum monthly pay: Rs 2.5 lakh (for Cabinet Secretaries)
Introduced a simplified pay matrix, replacing the older pay bands and grade pay system.
Fitment factor: 2.57 times the basic pay.
Gratuity ceiling increased to Rs 20 lakh with a provision for periodic hikes based on dearness allowance (DA).
Allowances, including HRA, were rationalised.



 6th Pay Commission (2006)

Minimum monthly pay: Rs 7,000
Maximum monthly pay: Rs 80,000 (for Secretary-level officers)
Introduced the pay band and grade pay system.
Fitment factor: Approximately 1.86 times the basic pay.
Gratuity ceiling increased to Rs 10 lakh.
Rationalisation of allowances, with more focus on housing rent allowance (HRA) and other benefits.


IMPACT ON EMPLOYEES AND THE ECONOMY The approval of the 8th Pay Commission is likely to have a positive impact on millions of government employees and pensioners.

The January 2025 edition of the report highlights overall subdued global growth. ""The outlook remains subdued, with a majority of chief economists (56%) expecting the global economy to weaken over the next year, compared to 17% anticipating improvement,"" the report said.   Global economic outlook (Source: WEF Report)advertisementINDIA EMERGES AS BRIGHT SPOT However, the report highlighted two bright spots amid the gloomy global economic outlook in the US and South Asia. ""South Asia continues to stand out, with 61% of chief economists expecting strong or very strong growth in 2025,"" the report said. The region's exceptional performance is attributed largely to India, which ""remains the world's fastest-growing major economy."" However, the report does note some potential challenges for India, observing that ""there are now signs of some momentum being lost."" Recent national accounts data indicates a moderation in growth, though this appears to be a temporary adjustment rather than a fundamental weakness in the economy.EUROPE TO BEAR THE BRUNT In stark contrast to India's robust outlook, Europe faces a particularly challenging period ahead. T The report reveals that ""the outlook for Europe remains gloomy, with 74% of respondents predicting weak or very weak growth this year."" This dramatic divergence between regions highlights the shifting dynamics of global economic power and the increasing importance of emerging economies in driving global growth. Individual European economies show varying degrees of weakness, with Germany contracting by 0.3%, Italy growing at 0.4%, 1.2% in France and Spain managing 3.4% growth. The severity of Europe's situation was highlighted by Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister and governor of the European Central Bank, who warned that ""annual investment equivalent to 5% of GDP would be required to revive economic dynamism.""US TO PLAY KEY ROLE The United States presents another interesting dimension to this global economic narrative. According to the report, ""The chief economists expect US policy to have a significant impact on the global economy in the years ahead."" ""A majority (61%) characterise this impact as a long-term shift rather than a short-term disruption,"" said the WEF report. Under the incoming administration, economists anticipate ""significant changes across trade, migration, deregulation, fiscal policy, industrial policy and foreign policy."" These changes are expected to have far-reaching implications, including potential ""increases in inflation and public debt levels, as well as stock-market gains."" China's outlook also remains concerning, with growth ""projected to slow gradually in the years ahead."" This slowdown in the world's second-largest economy adds another layer of complexity to the global economic landscape. The global context remains complex and challenging, as the report highlights.

The new commission will focus on reviewing pay structures while considering inflation, economic conditions, and employee welfare. The 7th Pay Commission, which was constituted in 2014 and implemented in 2016, introduced significant changes such as replacing pay bands with a simplified pay matrix, increasing the minimum monthly salary to Rs 18,000, and capping the maximum monthly pay at Rs 2.5 lakh for top government officials. It also raised the fitment factor to 2.57, ensuring a notable boost to basic pay. The fitment factor is a multiplier used to calculate the revised basic pay of government employees under a Pay Commission. HIGHER SALARY Some reports suggest that the 8th Pay Commission may propose an increase in the fitment factor from 2.57 to 2.86, potentially raising the minimum basic salary to Rs 51,480. Such a move could have a big impact on employees’ financial well-being, fostering increased spending power. It could also lead to higher consumer spending .

",https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/budget-2025-5-key-expectations-from-india-insurance-sector-2665702-2025-01-16,"The Union Budget 2025 is expected to play an important role in shaping India’s insurance sector. With the government’s goal of achieving “Insurance for All” by 2047, this budget could bring changes to make insurance easier to access, more affordable, and innovative. Here are some key hopes from the insurance industry for this year’s budget.ENHANCED TAX BENEFITS Taxes play a big role in how people choose insurance products. Right now, life insurance premiums are included under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, which has a shared limit with other investments. Having a separate limit for life insurance premiums could encourage more people to save for the long term and secure their future. Aftab Chaz, Associate Director and Business Head, Elephant.in, mentioned that increasing the deduction limit under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act for health insurance premiums from Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 would provide major financial relief to individuals. By raising this limit, more people would be encouraged to invest in health insurance, ensuring better medical coverage and financial security.GST REFORMS Reducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on insurance premiums could lower costs and make insurance more affordable for more people. Mr. Nitin Mehta, Chief Distribution Officer - Partnership Distribution and Head of Marketing at Bharti AXA Life Insurance, says, “The current GST rate on life insurance premiums is 18%. Any reduction in this rate will significantly lower the cost of insurance, thereby making life insurance more affordable and accessible for buyers.” He added, “Streamlining GST compliance procedures will help to reduce administrative burdens on insurance companies. This can allow them to focus on product innovation and customer service.”FDI REFORMS The insurance sector hopes for simplified procedures for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), as increasing FDI limits could bring in more capital. ""The Union Budget 2025 presents a significant opportunity for growth in India’s insurance sector through targeted reforms. Easing procedural hurdles for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) beyond the current 74% cap could attract more capital, allowing insurers to underwrite larger risks, expand into underserved areas, and invest in technology,” says Aftab Chaz.INCLUSION OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS Encouraging technology adoption in the insurance sector can improve customer experiences, simplify operations, and drive product innovation. Aftab Chaz mentions that promoting tools like AI and blockchain can boost efficiency and meet changing customer needs.ADDRESSING CLIMATE RISKS Climate change poses significant challenges, and tax incentives for catastrophe insurance can play a key role in protecting businesses and communities from natural disasters. Aftab Chaz mentions, “The inclusion of the insurance sector in the national priority list would enable concessional funding and encourage innovation, particularly in micro-insurance and rural outreach. As climate change exacerbates natural disasters, tax incentives for catastrophe insurance are also vital to safeguard vulnerable communities and businesses.” The Union Budget 2025 could bring big changes to India’s insurance industry. Reforms in taxes, foreign investments, technology, and disaster preparedness can help the sector grow steadily while providing financial security to millions.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Popular items included tiramisu, fries, and roti, while packaged products like pesto sauce and noodles saw steady demand. Interestingly, Mumbai and Pune residents displayed a unique love for pav, dominating short-distance deliveries. Clothing ranked second amongst the top delivery categories, reflecting India’s growing preference for online fashion shopping. Meanwhile, documents have gained significant traction, especially in cities like Bengaluru and Delhi, indicating a rising need for quick and reliable document delivery within urban areas.PERISHABLES AND FESTIVE FAVOURITES Amongst perishables, tomatoes, cabbage, and milk tetra packs topped the list, with pudina, lemons, and green chilies being popular add-ons. Regional preferences stood out—Mumbai led in pudina orders, while Hyderabad favoured brinjal and lemons. The festive season brought a 25% surge in deliveries during Diwali, with mithai orders in Delhi marking a cultural highlight.EVOLVING CONSUMER HABITS The demand for quick deliveries extended to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which relied on courier services for spare parts, sample products, and gifting items. This trend underscores how small businesses are leveraging delivery platforms to drive growth. Gig workers played a crucial role, covering distances equivalent to circling the globe seven times to meet consumer needs. As technology continues to shape the q-commerce sector, businesses that adapt to these trends will thrive. The rise of delivery apps and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) models promises a future where speed, convenience, and reliability redefine India’s shopping experience.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 16, 2025

With India’s growing economy and rising aspirations, this year’s budget is expected to bring major reforms and incentives aimed at boosting growth, empowering citizens, and simplifying taxation. Here are eight key expectations:TAX REFORMS TO EASE COMPLIANCE Simpler tax filing processes and reduced complexities in tax rules are anticipated. The government may focus on easing compliance for both individuals and businesses, ensuring a seamless experience with reduced paperwork.advertisementSIMPLIFIED GST FRAMEWORK Businesses, particularly the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), are hoping for rationalised GST slabs and faster refunds. A more straightforward GST system would enhance the ease of doing business and boost economic activity. Mr. Shaji Varghese, CEO, Muthoot FinCorp Limited (MFL), mentions, “The Union Budget 2025 presents a pivotal opportunity to bolster the MSME sector. We are optimistic about the government’s commitment to banking the underbanked and unbanked, including nano and micro enterprises.”AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MIDDLE-CLASS RELIEF Housing loan interest exemptions are expected to increase, making homeownership more affordable. Additionally, tax benefits under Section 80C and higher exemptions may offer middle-class families much-needed financial relief. Mr. Dhruv Agarwala, Group CEO, Housing.com & PropTiger.com, says, “The Union Budget 2025 presents a crucial opportunity to address longstanding challenges and catalyse growth in the real estate sector. Raising the tax exemption limit on home loan interest, which has remained stagnant for years, is essential to easing the financial burden on homebuyers and enhancing housing affordability.”OVERHAUL OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX To encourage investments in equities and real estate, the capital gains tax framework may be simplified. Uniform tax rates across asset classes are likely to reduce confusion and attract more investors.CLARITY ON CRYPTOCURRENCY TAXATION The crypto sector awaits clearer rules and taxes. Budget 2025 may introduce well-defined regulations and a fair tax regime to bring transparency and legal stability to this growing digital asset market.INCREASED STANDARD DEDUCTION FOR SALARIED INDIVIDUALS To provide relief amid inflation, the government is expected to increase the standard deduction limit, offering more disposable income for the salaried class.FOCUS ON JOB CREATION The budget may allocate funds for infrastructure projects, skill development programs, and start-up support, aiming to generate employment across various sectors.INCENTIVES FOR WOMEN TAXPAYERS Special tax exemptions or deductions for women professionals may be introduced, empowering them financially and promoting gender inclusivity in the workforce. Budget 2025 holds the promise of driving India’s growth while addressing taxpayer concerns. With reforms catering to diverse needs, it could pave the way for a simplified and inclusive economic future. Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 16, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The Union Cabinet approved the 8th Pay Commission on Thursday to revise the salaries of central government employees and pensioners. Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the decision and said that the commission will likely be established soon. But the big question remains, will pensions witness a dramatic jump, or will it be a modest upgrade?  Currently, central government employees and pensioners receive their salaries and pensions based on the 7th Pay Commission's recommendations, which came into effect on 1 January 2016. POSSIBLE INCREASE IN PENSIONS Krishnendu Chatterjee, Vice President at TeamLease, told Economic Times (ET), “The average pension hike should be in line with the hike in salaries. It is expected to be in a fitment factor of 2.5-2.8, thus increasing the pension from the current Rs 9,000 to anywhere between Rs 22,500 and Rs 25,200.” Sumit Dhar, Partner at Fox Mandal & Associates LLP told ET that if the fitment factor of 2.86 is approved in the 8th Pay Commission by the government, the minimum salary and pension of government employees are expected to increase by 186%. “Though predicting the hike is practically not feasible, based on the average pension hike percentages from previous pay commissions, the 8th Pay Commission may provide an average pension hike in the range of 20% to 30%. However, the actual percentage increase depends on various factors considered by the commission, including economic conditions and budgetary constraints,"" said Ritika Nayyar, Partner at Singhania & Co.  Nihal Bhardwaj, Senior Associate at SKV Law Offices, said, “Pensions under the 8th Pay Commission are likely to increase in line with the salary revisions, with an average hike of 25-30% expected. Past commissions, such as the 6th and 7th, provided pension increases matching salary hikes, with the latter implementing a fitment factor of 2.57, raising pensions by 23-25%.” He further explained to ET, “Enhancements for retirees may include additional allowances for senior pensioners and higher dearness relief (DR) to offset inflation. Such measures are important to ensure that pensions remain adequate for meeting rising costs while aligning with employee expectations for equitable post-retirement benefits. The exact percentage increase for the 8th Pay Commission will only be known once the commission submits its report and the government approves its recommendations.” The fitment factor, a multiplier used to calculate the revised basic pay and pension, plays a key role in determining pension hikes. For example, if the fitment factor is set at 2.5 and the current basic pension is Rs 30,000, the revised basic pension would increase to Rs 75,000. At the start of the new pension structure, the dearness relief (DR) is usually reset to zero. Over time, pensioners will receive periodic DR increases to account for inflation, resulting in regular pension hikes.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 17, 2025

The stock is expected to witness further movement in Friday's session, following the announcement of its robust Q3 FY25 results. RIL posted a 12% year-on-year (YoY) increase in consolidated net profit to a record Rs 21,930 crore for the third quarter of financial year 2024-25 (FY25). The company’s performance was driven by growth in its key business segments, including digital services, retail, and the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) division.advertisementGOOD Q3 FY25Revenue for the quarter rose 7.7% YoY to Rs 2.67 lakh crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 7.8% to Rs 48,003 crore. The EBITDA margin improved by 10 basis points to 18% compared to the same period last year, and by 1 percentage point from the previous quarter.RECOVERY IN O2C BUSINESS Revenue for the quarter rose 7.7% YoY to Rs 2.67 lakh crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 7.8% to Rs 48,003 crore. The EBITDA margin improved by 10 basis points to 18% compared to the same period last year, and by 1 percentage point from the previous quarter.RECOVERY IN O2C BUSINESS The O2C segment, which had faced challenges in recent quarters, showed significant improvement in Q3. The division's EBITDA grew 2% YoY to Rs 14,402 crore, while revenue rose 6% YoY to Rs 1.49 lakh crore. Chairman Mukesh Ambani said, “The O2C business showcased its innate resilience, registering growth even in this prolonged period of volatility in the global energy markets.” The improvement in O2C performance was attributed to volume-led growth and higher polymer deltas, reflecting a recovery in the business amid challenging global energy conditions.JIO PLATFORMS DELIVERS STRONG GROWTH Reliance’s digital services arm, Jio Platforms, continued its strong performance. Profit for the segment increased 26% YoY, while EBITDA rose nearly 19% YoY. Growth in this segment was driven by sustained subscriber additions and higher customer engagement, with more users upgrading to 5G networks. Jio’s home broadband services also maintained their market-leading position, contributing to the strong performance.MIXED RESULTS FOR OIL AND GAS BUSINESS The oil and gas segment faced some challenges in Q3, with both operating profit and revenue declining. Lower volumes of gas and condensate from the KGD6 basin impacted earnings. However, this was partially offset by higher coal bed methane (CBM) gas volumes and a slight increase in KGD6 gas prices.BROKERAGE VIEW RIL shares have undergone correction over the last six months, falling as much as 20%. This decline has made the stock more attractive in terms of valuation, with several global brokerages maintaining a positive outlook. Emkay Global said that after a 24% decline, the stock is forming a base around the Rs 1,200 level and is currently in a sideways trend. The brokerage added, “Bullish momentum is expected above Rs 1,270.” Target prices from brokerages for RIL stock remain as high as Rs 1,690.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Must Watch

The move is expected to signal a policy shift and provide the crypto industry with a more prominent role in shaping government decisions. According to sources mentioned in the report, the order will designate cryptocurrency as a national imperative, encouraging government agencies to collaborate with the industry. Additionally, it is likely to establish a cryptocurrency advisory council to advocate for the sector's policy needs. Bitcoin was trading at $101,021.39, with a market cap of $2 trillion at the time the article was being written. CRYPTO INDUSTRY’S INFLUENCE Donald Trump has received considerable support from the cryptocurrency industry, including donations from prominent companies such as Coinbase and Ripple to his inaugural committee. On Friday, just days before the beginning of his second term at the White House, the industry is set to host an ""Inaugural Crypto Ball"" in Washington, celebrating its ties with the incoming administration. This initiative would represent a huge shift for the crypto sector, which has faced numerous regulatory challenges under President Joe Biden's administration. Federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have launched more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto companies in recent years. The proposed executive order may include a directive requiring all government agencies to review their policies on digital assets. There is also discussion about pausing ongoing litigation involving cryptocurrency firms, sources told Bloomberg. This could potentially halt legal actions against major players such as Binance Holdings Ltd. and Ripple Labs Inc., a move seen as a top priority by the industry.CREATION OF NATIONAL BITCOIN STOCKPILE Another key aspect under consideration is the creation of a national Bitcoin stockpile, the report mentioned.  The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, confiscated during various investigations, according to analytics firm Arkham. Bitcoin's price has surged by nearly 50% since the November election, reaching over $100,000, partly due to speculation about the potential stockpile. The proposed stockpile would formalise the government's holdings of Bitcoin and reflect a strategic shift in how the US approaches cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has seen remarkable growth in 2024, with its value more than doubling over the year. Kara Calvert, Vice President for US Policy at Coinbase Global Inc., commented on the importance of Trump’s potential move. ""What I think Donald Trump is going to do is signal that the United States is back and we are ready to lead in this industry. What it’s signaling to other countries is be careful, or you won’t keep up,"" she told Bloomberg. Trump has also made bold promises during his campaign, vowing to transform the US into the global capital of cryptocurrency. His administration is expected to issue several executive orders covering various industries within his first few days in office. Despite facing regulatory hurdles during the Biden administration, the cryptocurrency industry in the US has continued to grow. Prominent financial firms, including BlackRock Inc., have launched spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The ADR closed nearly lower at $21.57 after the company announced its third-quarter results during post-market hours on January 16. Infosys shares were down 5.40% at Rs 1,822.10 on the BSE at 10:15 am. Earlier, the company's shares had hit a day's low of Rs 1,815.85.  It may be noted that the country's second-largest IT services provider reported an 11% year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 6,806 crore. Revenue from operations grew by 8% YoY, reaching Rs 41,764 crore, with constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 6.1% YoY.  The company upgraded its FY25 CC revenue growth guidance to 4.5%-5% from 3.75%-4.5% and maintained its operating margin guidance of 20%-22%. Despite the positive YoY performance in Q3 and revenue guidance, the shares of Infosys failed to gain due to a possible slowdown in the fourth quarter, due to factors such as seasonality and fewer working days. Emkay Global Financial Services has slightly tweaked its FY25-27 earnings-per-share (EPS) by less than 1%, taking into account the performance of the company in the third quarter.  The brokerage has retained a 'Buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,150.

The S&P BSE Sensex fell 440.99 points to 76,601.83 at 9.51 am, while the NSE Nifty50 declined 107.60 points to trade at 23,204.20. Most of the other broader market indices also fell in early trade today, leading to a surge in volatility, which has been decreasing throughout the week.advertisementWHY DID STOCK MARKET FALL IN EARLY TRADE? The benchmark indices were pulled down by a sharp drop in banking and IT stocks, following the third quarter results of some major companies. The Nifty IT index was down 2.6% as 7 of the 10 constituents were trading in negative territory. The fall in IT stocks was a result of Infosys’ shares falling over 5.3% after the company reported its Q3 results yesterday. The drop, however, came as a surprise as the company raised its revenue forecast. On the other hand, Axis Bank dragged down banking stocks after the lender’s quarterly profit missed street estimates due to slower loan growth and rise in provisions for bad loans. In addition, sustained selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continues to disrupt the momentum on Dalal Street. On the brighter side, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) has posted better-than-expected Q3 results, positing a 12% increase in y-o-y net profit to Rs 21,930 crore. Prathamesh Masdekar, Research Analyst, Stoxbox, said, “Reliance Industries has grown exponentially and set new benchmarks demonstrating strength and resilience across all businesses during the quarter.” “Overall, we believe RIL remains a strong long-term bet, given its scale, diversification, and execution capability,” he added.WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO? Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said the correction in the market has made large-cap valuations reasonable. “Nifty is now trading at around 19 times estimated FY 26 earnings. Therefore, long-term investors, who can ignore the volatility caused by FII selling, can use the dips to buy high-quality large-caps. The bounce back of this segment is only a question of time,” he added.

With salary and pension revisions on the horizon, all eyes are on the fitment factor, a critical element determining the extent of these enhancements. Let's explore what the fitment factor is and how it affects the salaries of millions of people.advertisementWHAT IS THE FITMENT FACTOR? The fitment factor is a multiplier used to calculate revised salaries and pensions for government employees. It plays a pivotal role in determining the quantum of financial benefits. Under the 7th Pay Commission, the fitment factor was set at 2.57, resulting in a significant boost to salaries and pensions. The minimum basic pay jumped from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 per month, while pensions saw a similar rise from Rs 3,500 to Rs 9,000. The maximum salary and pension were revised to Rs 2,50,000 and Rs 1,25,000, respectively.WHAT IS THE PROJECTED FITMENT FACTOR FOR 8TH PAY COMMISSION? Projections for the 8th Pay Commission suggest a fitment factor ranging between 2.28 and 2.86. If realised, the minimum basic pay could increase from Rs 18,000 to anywhere between Rs 41,000 and Rs 51,480, marking a substantial financial uplift for employees. If the fitment factor’s projections materialise, the revised salaries could significantly uplift the financial well-being of government employees and retirees.WHEN WILL THE 8TH PAY COMMISSION BE IMPLEMENTED? The salary and pension hikes under the 8th Pay Commission will be calculated by applying the fitment factor to the existing basic pay. With the commission’s implementation date set for January 2026, the government is expected to establish the commission by mid-2024. This timeline allows ample time for reviewing economic conditions, inflation rates, and feedback from employee unions and stakeholders.IMPACT OF 8TH PAY COMMISSION While the exact fitment factor will depend on prevailing economic and policy considerations, the 8th Pay Commission’s recommendations are poised to enhance the financial well-being of lakhs of people across the country.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 17, 2025

The stock, which closed at Rs 1,040.20 in the previous session, opened at Rs 1,006.95 on Friday and slid further to Rs 974.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). This decline came after the bank reported a 3.8% rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ending 31 December 2024, reaching Rs 6,304 crore, compared to Rs 6,071 crore in the same period last year. However, this growth fell short of market expectations, causing investor concerns.advertisementAXIS BANK Q3 FY25 RESULTS Axis Bank reported an interest income of Rs 30,954 crore for Q3FY25, marking an 11% increase from Rs 27,961 crore in the same quarter of the previous year. Despite this growth, the stock has struggled recently, with a 13.49% fall over the past month, a 24.93% decline in the past six months, and a 9.29% drop over the past year. The bank’s net interest income (NII) grew 9% year-on-year to Rs 13,606 crore, while the net interest margin (NIM) for Q3FY25 stood at 3.93%. The operating profit increased by 15% year-on-year to Rs 10,534 crore. Core operating profit rose 14% year-on-year to Rs 10,102 crore. Operating costs grew at a slower pace, increasing by just 1% year-on-year compared to a 9% rise in the previous quarter. Axis Bank’s provisions and contingencies for the quarter stood at Rs 2,156 crore, including specific loan loss provisions of Rs 2,185 crore. The bank holds cumulative provisions (standard and additional) of Rs 11,875 crore as of 31 December 2024. These provisions are above the non-performing assets (NPA) provisioning included in its provision coverage ratio (PCR) calculations. The total provision coverage ratio, including specific, standard, and additional provisions, was at 151% of gross non-performing assets (GNPA) as of the quarter’s end. The annualised credit cost for the quarter was reported at 0.80%. Amitabh Chaudhry, the Managing Director and CEO of Axis Bank, said that the bank concluded 2024 on a strong note. He highlighted efforts to strengthen its business operations, expand its reach, and add new branches across India.SHOULD YOU BUY? The sharp fall in Axis Bank’s shares has led to mixed reactions from analysts. While some see the stock as a buying opportunity after the recent correction, others have raised concerns about the bank’s performance in certain areas. Jefferies maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on Axis Bank with a target price of Rs 1,430. The firm noted that gross and net slippages were higher than expected, while deposit and loan growth remained within forecasts. However, higher provisioning costs and uniform income margins matched predictions. Bernstein also kept an ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,300. The brokerage pointed to stagnant recoveries, rising credit costs, and slowing growth in operating expenses as key takeaways. Nuvama lowered its target price for Axis Bank from Rs 1,335 to Rs 1,220 but maintained a ‘Buy’ rating. The firm said that the stock is trading at 1.5 times its book value for FY26 estimates, offering some downside protection after the correction. Nuvama revised its earnings per share estimates down by 2% for FY25 and 5% for FY26 due to low growth and declining NIM, offset by lower operating expenses.

According to the latest World Bank report, India’s economic growth is projected to remain steady at 6.7% annually for the next two fiscal years, starting April 2025. The forecast is a silver lining to the broader South Asia region, which is expected to see growth rise to 6.2% in 2025-26. The report suggests that the services sector will continue to perform strongly, while manufacturing looks poised to benefit from government initiatives to enhance the business landscape. Private investment is set to get a boost, balancing a likely slowdown in public spending. However, there are some challenges. The World Bank has flagged a softer growth projection of 6.5% for 2024-25, citing sluggish manufacturing and a dip in investment activity. Still, private consumption remains the silver lining, thanks to improved rural incomes and better agricultural output. Closer to home, experts appear to echo this tempered optimism. The FICCI Economic Outlook Survey pegs India’s GDP growth at 6.4% for FY25, a step-down from earlier estimates of 7%. Ratings firms like Acuité and CareEdge also see growth in the range of 6.4-6.5%. Meanwhile, Nomura is more bullish with a 6.7% estimate, and the Reserve Bank of India recently revised its FY25 projection to 6.6%. India’s GDP, which clocked a stellar 9.7% in FY22 before settling at 7% in FY23 and 8.2% in FY24, has been on a roller-coaster ride. Looking ahead, GDP growth will depend on multiple factors, including announcements in the upcoming Budget 2025, global growth, interest rate trajectory, and more.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Must Watch

For those looking to optimise returns, transferring funds from an Employee Provident Fund (EPF) account to a National Pension System (NPS) account could be a game-changer. But is it the right move for everyone? Let’s look into the process, tax implications, and factors to consider.advertisementHOW TO TRANSFER EPF FUNDS TO NPS Transferring funds from EPF to NPS is possible, but there are steps to follow. A one-time transfer of your EPF corpus to an NPS Tier 1 account is tax-exempt under Section 10(12), as it is not treated as a contribution to NPS for that year. To initiate the transfer, you need an active NPS Tier 1 account. The process can be completed through your employer or directly via a Point of Presence (POP) or the eNPS portal. Submit a transfer request to your current employer, who will forward it to the recognised EPF office. The funds will then be credited to your NPS account. However, keep in mind that this shift is irreversible, so evaluating its suitability is critical.SHOULD YOU MAKE THE SWITCH? The decision to transfer EPF funds to NPS depends on your financial goals, asset allocation, and risk tolerance. Here are some key considerations: For equity exposure: If you lack exposure to equity investments, moving funds to NPS can help diversify your portfolio. The ‘active’ NPS option allows up to 75% equity allocation until age 50, which reduces gradually as you age. However, the ‘auto’ option limits equity allocation, especially for those nearing retirement. Accessibility of funds: EPF provides more flexibility, as the entire corpus can be accessed tax-free at retirement. In contrast, NPS requires 40% of the corpus to be reinvested in an annuity, with the income taxed. Tax implications: While interest earned in NPS Tier 1 is tax-free, only 60% of the corpus is tax-exempt at maturity. The remaining 40% annuity income is taxable. In other words, transferring funds from EPF to NPS can enhance returns, especially for those seeking equity exposure. However, the decision must align with your financial goals, liquidity needs, and risk appetite. After all, a well-planned retirement isn’t just about returns—it’s about financial freedom and peace of mind.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Must Watch

676af6f3-1d40-4d11-817c-ce6e59e7a36b,8th Pay Commission: How much salary increase can government employees expect?Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw confirmed the decision and said that the commission would be formed soon to revise the pay structure for central government employees and pensioners.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/8th-pay-commission-salary-hike-how-much-salary-increase-can-government-employees-expect-fitment-factor-2666199-2025-01-17,"For government employees, a salary hike often feels like a festive bonus, arriving just in time to ease financial pressures. The announcement of the 8th Pay Commission is no different. With rising inflation making it harder to manage monthly expenses, the news of the 8th Pay Commission brought hopes of a pay hike for central government employees.  The Union Cabinet approved the establishment of the 8th Pay Commission on Thursday. Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw confirmed the decision and said that the commission would be formed soon to revise the pay structure for central government employees and pensioners.advertisementSALARY HIKE  One of the most pressing questions is the expected hike in salaries and how the hike will be calculated. According to experts, the fitment factor, which plays a key role in determining pay increases, may be set between 2.5 and 2.8 times the current basic pay. This means that government employees earning a basic pay of Rs 18,000 could see their salaries increase to Rs 45,000, providing a much-needed boost. Krishnendu Chatterjee, Vice President and Business Head at TeamLease, shared insights on the expected changes with India Today Digital. “Considering the inflation factor, there are indications that fitment factor for salary hike may stay between 2.5 - 2.8 times of their current salaries, which will give a significant boost to employee salaries between 40k - 45k at the current base of 18k"" said Chatterjee. HOW TO CALCULATE SALARY HIKE? To estimate the revised salary, employees can multiply their current basic pay by the fitment factor. ""Multiply the Basic Pay by 2.5 - 2.8 times,"" said Chatterjee. For example, if an employee’s basic pay is Rs 25,000 and the fitment factor is 2.7, the revised salary would be Rs 67,500. This formula helps employees gauge the potential increase in their pay under the 8th Pay Commission. The final salary hike will depend on various factors, including inflation adjustments and prevailing market rates. Inflation plays a significant role as the commission aims to ensure that the revised pay structure addresses the rising cost of living. The 8th Pay Commission will likely build upon the changes introduced by the 7th Pay Commission, which came into effect in January 2016. The 8th Pay Commission is expected to complete its recommendations by the end of 2025. Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 17, 2025

Here's how you can still secure emergency fundsThough bad credit limits borrowing options and raises interest rates, some lenders still offer loans.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/bad-credit-here-is-how-you-can-still-secure-emergency-funds-2666242-2025-01-17,"Life’s unpredictability often leads to financial emergencies at the most inconvenient times. If you have a low credit score, getting a loan can feel challenging. But don’t worry—there are ways to get emergency loans even with bad credit. Here’s a simple guide to help you through the process.UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGE OF BAD CREDIT A credit score below 650 is typically considered poor, stemming from missed payments, high credit usage, or loan defaults. While such scores restrict borrowing options and result in higher interest rates, several lenders cater to individuals with bad credit. By focusing on factors like income stability, collateral, or even a guarantor’s backing, these lenders make emergency loans accessible.STEPS TO SECURE AN EMERGENCY LOAN Identify the right lender: Compare options and choose a lender offering competitive terms despite your low credit score. Prepare required documents: Ensure you have ID proof (Aadhaar/PAN), income evidence, and address verification ready for quick processing. Submit your application: Complete the application process online or offline, based on convenience. Evaluate offers carefully: High interest rates and hidden charges can make borrowing expensive, so scrutinise terms before accepting. Plan for repayment: Timely EMI payments can prevent further credit score deterioration and even help improve it.TIPS FOR BOOSTING YOUR LOAN APPROVAL CHANCES To improve your chances of getting a loan approved with a bad credit score, start by applying for a smaller loan amount, as this makes you less risky in the eyes of lenders. Providing collateral can further increase your approval chances, as it offers the lender security. Alternatively, applying with a guarantor who has a good credit score can make a significant difference. Demonstrating a stable income is also crucial, as it reassures lenders of your ability to repay the loan on time. Lastly, clearing any outstanding debts can enhance your financial profile and increase your credibility as a borrower. In other words, emergency loans are a viable option for managing unforeseen financial crises, even with a poor credit score. However, careful evaluation of terms and responsible repayment planning are essential. Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 17, 2025

While this decision brings hope for improved pay scales, the government has not yet announced a specific timeline for establishing the commission or implementing its recommendations. This raises an important question, how long will it take before government employees actually see the benefits of the 8th Pay Commission? advertisementTIMELINE OF 7TH PAY COMMISSION The 7th Pay Commission was formed in February 2014. By November 2015, it submitted its recommendations, which were implemented in January 2016. The process took approximately 22 months from the commission’s formation to the implementation of its recommendations. If the 8th Pay Commission follows a similar pattern, government employees can expect to wait around two years after the commission is formed for the revised pay structure to take effect. However, as of now, no formal notification or timeline for the formation of the 8th Pay Commission has been released.HOW THE PAY COMMISSION WORKS The formation and operation of a Pay Commission involves several steps, which take considerable time. For instance, the 7th Pay Commission was chaired by Retd. Justice Ashok Kumar Mathur, with Vivek Rae and Dr Rathin Roy as members and Meena Agarwal as the Secretary. Their work included holding extensive consultations, collecting data, and analysing existing pay structures. ""The commission conducts extensive consultations and holds multiple meetings to gather data, analyze existing pay structures, and consider input from various stakeholders, including employee associations. After thorough deliberation, the commission prepares a report detailing its recommendations regarding salary structures, allowances, and pension increments. The entire process can take around 2 years, depending on the complexity of the issues at hand and the commission's findings,"" said Nihal Bhardwaj, Senior Associate, SKV Law Offices told India Today Digital.  He further added that the 7th Pay Commission conducted over 76 meetings with different officers, stakeholders, and public service commissions of other countries before submitting its report. Once the report is prepared, it is submitted to the government, where the Finance Ministry and other authorities review the recommendations. After approval, the recommendations are implemented through resolutions issued by the Department of Expenditure under the Ministry of Finance.  Implementing a new pay commission involves  financial implications. The 7th Pay Commission estimated a financial impact of Rs 1,02,100 crore in FY 2016-17. Salary and pension changes took effect from January 1, 2016, while revised allowances, based on recommendations from a panel led by then Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa, came into effect on July 1, 2017.FACTORS FOR SALARY & PENSION HIKE Pay Commissions consider various factors when making recommendations. ""Inflation adjustment, state of the economy, the market pricing of essential commodities, current DA rate and employee expectations,"" said Teamlease Staffing.  Taking into account the above factors, ensures that the revised pay structure addresses both the financial realities of the government and the needs of its employees. To estimate the revised salary, employees can multiply their current basic pay by the fitment factor, which is expected to be between 2.5 - 2.8 for the 8th Pay Commission.  ""Multiply the Basic Pay by 2.5 - 2.8 times,"" said Chatterjee. The Ministry of Finance and the Department of Expenditure play a crucial role in implementing the Pay Commission’s recommendations. The Department of Expenditure evaluates the proposals and issues orders for implementation. ""The Prime Minister, as the head of the government, holds substantial influence over this process, ensuring that the recommendations align with broader governmental policies and fiscal capabilities,"" said Bhardwaj.

But a new force now dominates these corridors of power. It doesn't wear Armani. It doesn't drink martinis at lunch. It never sleeps. It keeps working. Artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived at Wall Street, and it's rewriting every rule in the book. AI is executing trades at speeds that make human reflexes look glacial. A recent report from Bloomberg Intelligence suggests 2,00,000 banking jobs on Wall Street could evaporate in the next few years—each one representing a desk that might soon gather dust—due to AI. What’s surprising is the fact that the same AI algorithms recommending tonight's Netflix binge are now analysing market trends, approving million-dollar loans, and chatting with high-net-worth clients. Yet beneath the surface of this AI takeover lies a more nuanced story.  This isn't just another tale of machines replacing humans—it's a forced evolution, as dramatic as Wall Street's leap from paper tickets to Bloomberg terminals. The trading floor's next chapter is being written in binary.AI’S GROWING FOOTPRINT  AI is not confined to disrupting the banking and financial sector alone. According to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Future of Jobs Report 2025, clerical and secretarial roles in various industries face the prospect of steep declines. Jobs like administrative assistants, ticket clerks, and cashiers are being replaced by AI-driven tools.  The report also warned that as many as 39% of existing skills could become outdated by 2030, making it necessary for workers to adapt to new realities. However, not all industries face job losses. Sectors requiring human oversight, creativity, and physical presence—such as healthcare, construction, and agriculture—are expected to experience job growth. The care economy, including nursing and social work, is also set to expand due to the irreplaceable human touch required in these professions.AI IS ALSO CREATING OPPORTUNITIES While AI is displacing certain roles, it is also opening doors to opportunities in emerging fields. According to a McKinsey & Company report, AI could create 20–50 million new jobs globally by 2030, spanning sectors like healthcare and technology. These new roles include AI trainers and teachers, who ensure AI systems are accurate and develop innovative applications. Data analysts and scientists are also in demand to interpret the vast amounts of data generated by AI systems, providing valuable insights for better decision-making. Additionally, human-machine teaming managers play a crucial role in ensuring smooth collaboration between AI systems and human workers. AI ethics and policy specialists are emerging as key professionals addressing ethical and regulatory challenges associated with AI implementation. So, are the wolves of Wall Street really in danger of being replaced by AI? Not entirely; they're adapting. And tomorrow's financial titans can't just be quantitative geniuses or smooth-talking deal-makers.  They’ll have to be a new breed of professionals—those who can wield the power of AI while retaining the human touch that no machine can replicate. The key is to develop skills machines can't match, build relationships algorithms can't forge, and find ways to make technology amplify their human insights rather than replace them.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Trending Reel

The S&P BSE Sensex ended 423.49 points lower at the closing bell, whil the NSE Nifty50 settled 108.60 points lower at 23,203.20. Broader market indices were mixed, but volatility rose during the trading session. Major sectoral indices such as Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial Services and Nifty IT fell sharply, triggering today’s slide.

On the other hand, the top gainers on the Nifty50 were BPCL, Reliance, Coal India, Nestle India and Hindalco. It may be noted that Reliance’s 2.65% jump during the session was a major factor behind limiting the losses on Dalal Street. The company’s shares jumped during the session after positing strong results in the third quarter. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Declines in the banking and IT sectors negatively impacted large caps, causing domestic markets to end lower following a volatile session.” “A cautious outlook on discretionary spending led to a decline in IT stocks while private banking stocks declined due to expectations of subdued deposit and credit growth, as well as tighter liquidity conditions. We expect investors to adopt a risk-averse stance on the ongoing Q3 results,” he added.  Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said, “Markets remained under pressure throughout the trading session as rising US bond yields continues to create uncertainty amongst local investors” “With FII fund outflows from domestic equities remaining strong, geo-political uncertainty and concerns over slow pace in US rate cuts going ahead is keep investors on the edge,” he added.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Must Watch

However, securing these loans at high-interest rates can lead to a heavy financial burden. The good news is that, with some strategic planning, you can obtain a personal loan at a much lower interest rate. Let’s explore five effective ways to ensure you get the best deal possible.advertisementSTRENGTHEN YOUR CREDIT SCORE A good credit score is your ticket to lower interest rates. Lenders evaluate your creditworthiness primarily through this score. If your score is low, start improving it by paying off outstanding debts, maintaining a low credit utilisation ratio, and rectifying any errors in your credit report. A high score not only enhances your chances of approval but also secures better terms.LEVERAGE YOUR EMPLOYER’S REPUTATION The company you work for can influence the loan terms you receive. Employees of well-reputed organisations are often viewed as low-risk borrowers, which can result in better interest rates. If you work for a smaller company or are self-employed, you might face higher rates, but having a solid financial track record can still work in your favor.SKIP PRE-APPROVED OFFERS ON CREDIT CARDS Pre-approved personal loan offers on credit cards may seem convenient, but they often come with higher interest rates. Instead, consider applying directly to a lender. By doing so, the lender can assess your current credit score and financial status to offer a more competitive rate. This extra effort can translate into significant savings.ADD A CO-APPLICANT Applying with a co-applicant who has a strong credit profile can improve your eligibility for a loan at a lower rate. Lenders consider the combined creditworthiness and income of both applicants, reducing perceived risk.NEGOTIATE WITH THE LENDER Negotiation can be a powerful tool. Compare offers from multiple lenders and use competitive rates as leverage. Many lenders are open to matching or beating competitor rates to secure your business. While personal loans are a convenient financial tool, securing them at the lowest possible interest rate requires careful planning. By improving your credit score, avoiding pre-approved offers, and negotiating smartly, you can reduce your financial burden significantly. A little effort today can lead to substantial savings tomorrow.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 17, 2025Trending Reel

Experts argue that easing the tax burden on individuals is key to spurring consumption, the backbone of India's economic growth.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/8th-pay-commission-salary-hike-central-government-tax-relief-in-budget-demands-private-sector-fitment-factor-2666336-2025-01-17,"With the government announcing the setting up of the 8th Pay Commission, which would see the salaries of government employees go up substantially, there is a clamour for leaving more money in the hands of private sector workers, who make up a bulk of the tax-paying middle class. The demand is that the government must now provide tax relief to individuals in Budget 2025-26. The decadal pay commission, whose award would be implemented in 2026, and a relief for taxpayers in the Budget would help boost consumption, which accounts for 55-60% of India's GDP. ""Government employees are getting the Pay Commission. Private sector employees are getting new taxes,"" reads a post from an X handle that comments on public policy and governance.   The demands to reduce taxes come as the government's bet on reducing corporate taxes to spur investment and consumption failed to work. Despite 15-year-high profits, corporates haven't increased wages, which beat inflation growth. Experts say the government now has to put more money in the hands of individual taxpayers to boost consumption-led growth. ""There needs to be immediate relief for individual taxpayers in the Budget to boost consumption and the economy,"" political analyst and commentator Amitabh Tiwari tells India Today Digital. It isn't unusual for the government to plan consumption-led growth through pay commissions. Amid the global financial crisis in 2008, the government had gone for a higher fitment factor of 1.86 against the recommended 1.74 to boost consumption. ""The 8th Pay Commission will see an increase in the pay scale for the central government employees, which in turn will help spur demand. A softening in consumption is being witnessed,"" Kranthi Bathini, equity strategist at WealthMills Securities, tells India Today Digital. He says the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations would increase demand and consumption growth.  Bathini says there has been a long-standing demand for tax relief from the middle class. ""The middle class believes it has been paying taxes, but aren't getting enough sops from the government.""  The 7th pay commission of India started trending on Google on January 16. It peaked on January 16 at around 3 pm. Other subcategories like fitment factor, expected salary in the 8th pay commission, and benefits of the 8th pay commission were also trending. Revealing the clamour around a reduction in taxes for individuals, the term income tax has also been trending on Google along with pay commission. WHY INCOME TAX STRUCTURE IS HURTING THE MIDDLE CLASS Amitabh Tiwari finds two main issues with the tax structure that is hurting the middle class, which is the main driver of consumption in India. ""While the government has kept increasing the exemption limit over the years, the top income tax bracket of 30% kicks in at a low level of Rs 15 lakh,"" says Tiwari, adding that it is very low when compared to several countries, including the US. Central government employees numbering 49 lakh and pensioners at 65 lakh make a small portion of the actual taxpayers at 2.8 crore. Tiwari points to how though the number of those filing tax returns has increased from 3.35 crore in 2013-14 to 7.54 crore in 2023-24, those really paying tax has just gone up from 1.66 crore to 2.81 crore in 10 years. That's because individuals filing zero-income tax returns has seen a massive jump from 1.69 crore in 2013-14 to 4.73 crore in 2023-24. That's because the income tax exemption limit has gone up over the years. ""Though this meets the government's socio-political objective, it doesn't meet the economic objective. In several countries, no income is exempt from tax,"" Tiwari tells India Today Digital.advertisementBUDGET 2025-26 MIGHT ADD INCOME TAX SLABS FOR RELIEFThe demand for relief comes amid rising inflation and at a time when the government's collection of income tax is higher corporate tax.For relief, Amitabh Tiwari suggests widening of the tax net and increasing tax slabs gradually, where the highest tax rate kicks in at a much higher income level of Rs 50 lakh, instead of the now Rs 15 lakh.Kranthi Bathini says there is great anticipation that income tax slabs are going to be increased in Budget 2025-26. ""As per the initial feelers that are coming from this Budget, the slabs are going to be increased,"" he adds. Tiwari explains that such a move will prevent a small section of middle class taxpayers from doing the heavy lifting and give a boost to consumption, which is the main driver of the Indian economy, accounting for around 55-60% of our GDP.Bathini says there is a need to increase consumption by boosting disposable income. ""At this point of time, any kind of pay hike will definitely spur growth in the economy,"" he says.While the government has constituted the 8th Pay Commission for government employees, relief for individual taxpayers will leave more cash in the hands of the middle class and help push consumption-driven growth of the economy.Published By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Jan 17, 2025

The announcement comes just days before the Union Budget 2025 and aims to align salaries with current economic conditions and inflation rates. As the anticipation around the 8th Pay Commission grows, here is a look at the major changes that were part of the 7th and 6th Pay Commissions. advertisementSALARY AND PENSION HIKE IN 7TH PAY COMMISSION The 7th Pay Commission came into effect on January 1, 2016. It introduced many major changes for central government employees.One of the most critical aspects was the fitment factor, which was set at 2.57.  What this meant was that the basic pay would be multiplied by 2.57, leading to increased salaries across all levels amongst central government staff. The 7th Pay Commission also recommended a minimum basic salary of Rs 18,000, marking an increase from the previous Rs 7,000 under the 6th Pay Commission. In addition, pensions saw a decent increase. For pensioners, the minimum basic pension rose to Rs 9,000, up from Rs 3,500 under the 6th Pay Commission.WHAT HAPPENED IN 6TH PAY COMMISSION? The 6th Pay Commission, which was implemented in January 2006, introduced modest changes but still improved salaries and pensions. The fitment factor under the 6th Pay Commission was 1.86. Therefore, the minimum basic salary was revised to Rs 7,000, up from Rs 2,750 in the 5th Pay Commission. Pensioners also benefited marginally, with the minimum basic pension increasing from Rs 1,275 to Rs 3,500 per month.WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE 8TH PAY COMMISSION? As of now, nothing is clear about what exactly can be expected under the new pay commission. However, some reports suggest that it is expected to introduce a more major revision to salaries and pensions.  Unconfirmed projections for the 8th Pay Commission indicate that the fitment factor could range from 2.28 to 2.86. If this happens, the minimum basic pay may rise from Rs 18,000 to anywhere between Rs 41,000 and Rs 51,480, providing a big financial boost for central government employees.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 18, 2025

Much like the market's volatile swings, his policies have always kept the world guessing. Back in November, news of Trump’s return to the White House sent the Sensex soaring by over 900 points, sparking optimism across Dalal Street. But as January 20 approaches, bringing Trump 2.0 into focus, the euphoria has turned into uncertainty. Will Trump's second stint as US President steer the Indian stock markets to new highs, or will it lead to more downward bearish sentiment?UNCERTAINTY OVER DALAL STREET The initial stock market rally after Trump’s victory was driven by hopes for business-friendly policies and a stable global outlook. However, the volatility since then reflects growing concerns about his administration's approach to trade, geopolitical tensions, and economic policies. Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President of Research at Religare Broking Ltd, highlighted the potential mixed effects of Trump’s return. He said, “The return of Donald Trump as US President could bring mixed implications for Indian stock markets, depending on his policies. His 'America First' agenda might tighten trade conditions, but stronger U.S.-India ties could benefit sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and defense. Mishra further added that a potential revival of H-1B visa restrictions might pressure Indian IT firms, while easing policies would be positive. Trump’s tough stance on China could position India as a strategic partner, attracting FDI into manufacturing and defense, but heightened geopolitical tensions might increase market volatility. ""His pro-fossil fuel policies could stabilise or lower crude oil prices, benefiting India as an oil importer. Global volatility under Trump’s unpredictable style might lead to temporary market fluctuations. A stronger dollar could trigger foreign outflows, impacting the rupee and equities, while a weaker dollar would support FPI inflows. Investors should focus on domestic fundamentals to navigate potential volatility,"" Mishra told India Today Digital. KEY CONCERNS  Trump’s election has already caused significant adjustments in global markets. Satish Chandra Aluri from Lemonn Markets Desk said, “Trump's election as US President has already led to a sharp adjustment in global markets even before he took office. Expectations of business-friendly policies (lower taxes, less regulation, etc.) and strong US growth prospects have led to capital flows into US assets from elsewhere across the globe."" ""The threat of tariffs/trade war has also led to expectations of a rise in inflation, as tariffs can push prices higher, thereby undercutting the progress made so far by central banks, which could put brakes on further rate cuts. This, in turn, pushed the US yields and US Dollar higher, which is generally a headwind for emerging markets like India,"" he added.  The US Dollar index appreciated by approximately 9% since October last year, and benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield rose around 100 basis points to 4.8% levels, putting pressure on risk assets. ""Indian markets are already reeling under this pressure. Foreigners have net sold Rs 27,889 crore so far in the new year, over and above the Rs 1 lakh crore in the October-December quarter last year. Apart from cross-asset implications, Trump’s actions as President, especially on trade/tariffs on Indian imports and the recent debate surrounding the H-1B visa programme, can have huge implications for exporters (engineered goods, electronics, gems and jewellery, and pharma) as well as IT sector names,"" Aluri said.  The strengthening US Dollar has pushed the Indian rupee to record lows, which, combined with foreign outflows from Indian markets, has created additional challenges.  Analysts expect the rupee to remain under pressure unless corporate earnings in India improve significantly.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 19, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Anderson is under scrutiny for colluding with hedge funds in preparing reports to target various companies, added the report based on a Canadian portal, which cited documents filed before a court in Ontario.  The portal stated that documents filed in a defamation case at the Ontario Superior Court revealed that Moez Kassam, head of Canada’s Anson hedge fund, admitted to sharing research with various sources, including Hindenburg’s Nate Anderson. The Market Frauds portal, cited in the PTI report, said that the court documents ""allegedly revealed"" that Hindenburg Research ""colluded with Anson"" while preparing a report.  It also highlighted the fact that preparation of bearish report without disclosure of participation can be charged as securities fraud by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Though it is common for short-sellers to borrow a security, sell it on the open market, and later repurchase it at a lower price following negative reports about companies, the involvement of hedge funds is something that raises concerns.  This is because such funds may place parallel bets that amplify downward pressure on stock prices. Anderson, Anson and Kassam are yet to issue any statement on the matter. The portal, quoted by PTI, said, ""We know for a fact, from the email conversations between Anderson and Anson Funds, that he was indeed working for Anson and published whatever they told him to, from the price target to what should and shouldn't be in the report"". ""He asked them multiple times if they needed 'more'. From what we can see in the dozens of exchanges, at no time did he have editorial control. He was being told what to publish,"" the portal claimed. In addition, the Market Frauds portal also shared screenshots of some email interactions between Hindenburg and Anson to support its charge. It claimed to have accessed these screenshots through the documents available with the Ontario court.  ""There are multiple counts of securities fraud for both Anson Funds and Nate Anderson, and we have only gone through 5% of what's in there as of the time of writing,"" the portal said. ""From what we have read so far, it is almost a certainty that when the whole exchange between Hindenburg and Anson reaches the SEC, Nate Anderson will be charged with securities fraud in 2025,” it added.  The report added that when the association first emerged, Hindenburg Research said it received “hundreds of leads each year from diverse sources,"" such as industry experts, whistleblowers and other investors.  ""We rigorously vet each lead and have always maintained full editorial independence over our work. The portal went on to highlight one such report published by Hindenburg Research about Facedrive, a Canadian company that went public through a reverse merger as an eco-friendly ride-sharing service. The short-seller had claimed that the company was overvalued and lavishly paying promoters. As per the portal, Anson had allegedly exchanged emails with Anderson over the report and added that court documents revealed that the hedge fund had knowledge of when the report was to be published.  Just last week, Anderson made an announcement about shutting down Hindenburg Research, which came under the spotlight in India after publishing a scathing report about billionaire Gautam Adani’s conglomerate, the Adani Group.  Anderson shared a detailed post, stating that the research firm’s work is complete, and it is time to move on.  ""As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research,"" he said in a blog post.Published By: Vivek Published On: Jan 19, 2025Must Watch

This wealth went in the hands of the richest 10% of Britons, who received $33.8 trillion of the wealth, says Oxfam's latest report, which was published on Monday. The report further mentioned that 52% of the above-mentioned wealth ended up in the hands of the UK’s richest individuals, followed by the UK’s emerging middle class, which gained 32% of the wealth. The Oxfam report also mentioned that colonialism was responsible for ruining Indian industrial output by imposing strict protectionist policies that prevented Asian textiles from competing in the market. In 1750, the Indian subcontinent accounted for 25% of global industrial output, which was drastically reduced to a mere 2% by 1900, mentioned the report. Oxfam further critiqued the British colonial regime as a “drug pusher,” for using the opium trade to gain advantage over its colonies. It alleged that the British used large-scale poppy cultivation in poorer regions of eastern India and exported the same to China, which led to the Opium War and subsequently deepened inequalities.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Must Watch

EBITDA before ESOP costs improved by Rs 145 crore QoQ to Rs (41) crore, with the company maintaining its target to achieve EBITDA profitability before ESOP costs by Q4 FY25. The revenues from Paytm’s payments services segment grew to Rs 1,059 crore, while financial services revenue rose 35% QoQ to Rs 502 crore. The platform processed a Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of Rs 5 lakh crore during the quarter, reflecting a 13% QoQ increase. Merchant subscriptions for payment devices grew by 5 lakh during the quarter, reaching 1.17 crore. Meanwhile, the net payment margin stood at Rs 489 crore, driven by higher subscription revenue and stable payment processing margins. The company’s cost optimisation efforts continued to deliver results, with indirect costs dropping 7% QoQ and 23% YoY. Employee expenses for the first nine months of FY25 were reduced by Rs 451 crore YoY, surpassing Paytm’s annual cost-saving target of Rs 400-500 crore. Loan disbursements during the quarter totaled Rs 3,831 crore in Q3 FY25 versus Rs 3,303 Cr in Q2 FY 2025. More than 50% of these loans were issued to repeat borrowers, indicating strong customer retention. A substantial portion of the loans was distributed under Paytm’s Direct Lending & Guarantee (DLG) model, known for its higher upfront cost but enhanced long-term profitability. This model’s success has drawn increased interest from lenders, further strengthening the company’s financial services business. Paytm continues to prioritise a compliance-first approach and innovation in its merchant payment solutions, including new devices and payment aggregation tools. The company is also focused on regaining its UPI market share to January 2024 levels, scaling its financial services offerings, and leveraging AI-driven automation to enhance operational efficiency. With a cash reserve of Rs 12,850 crore as of Q3 FY25, the company is well-positioned to sustain its growth momentum. Paytm’s strategic execution and focus on profitability solidify its status as a leader in India’s fintech sector, driving the country’s ongoing digital transformation.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Must Watch

A NCLT bench, led by Judicial Member Mahendra Khandelwal and Technical Member Dr Sanjeev Ranjan, granted the liquidation petition filed by the airline’s Committee of Creditors, reported Bar and Bench. Go First’s lenders decided to liquidate the bankrupt budget carrier’s assets in August of last year after rejecting bids by interest suitors. In May 2023, the airline had filed a plea under Section 10 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), requesting admission to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). It may be noted that the airline had received two bids as part of the bankruptcy process, and one of them even bumped up the offer after a push by lenders. However, the bids were ultimately rejected. Go First's total dues to creditors stand at Rs 6,521 crore. Some of the creditors are Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank and Deutsche Bank. The approval of the liquidation plea is a welcome development for the lenders, as all hopes of the airline's revival were lost after Go First's foreign aircraft lessors were allowed to take back their planes after a prolonged legal tussle.

Vodadone Idea shares were trading at Rs 10, up 9.65%, with a market capitalisation of Rs 69,839.22 crore at the time the article was being written.  The rise in the Vodafone Idea stock has been witnessed after media reports surfaced that the government may waive 50% interest and 100% penalties related to the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues.  The dues were imposed on telecom firms like Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel as per a 2019 ruling by the Supreme Court. Vodafone Idea shares had closed at Rs 9.12 and opened at Rs 10.03 on Monday.  The stock is trading very far from its 52-week high of Rs 19.15 which it reached on June 28, 2024. The shares of Vodafone Idea hit its 52-week low of Rs 6.60 on November 22, 2024.  If the plan to waive the AGR dues is actually implemented, it will result in a huge relief for the telecom industry.  Media reports also suggest that the government could announce the relief for the telecom industry in the upcoming budget, which could be the second such move since September 2021.  ""We maintain SELL on VIL and HOLD on Indus as VIL’s long-term sustainability is still contingent on significant favourable government support,"" said JM Financial Institutional Securities Limited.  ""The Supreme Court (SC) had closed the telcos’ last legal remedy on the AGR matter, after it dismissed their AGR curative petition in Sep’24. Hence, waiver of any AGR dues could be a huge positive for VIL and a significant positive for Indus; it is also positive for Bharti and neutral for Jio,"" it added.  Vodafone Idea shares have gained 35.14% in the past month but have fallen 37.07% in the last half year. Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 20, 2025

While volatility on Dalal Street gained during the trading session, gains in major shares such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Wipro, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, SBI and Reliance Industries contributed to the market gains. The S&P BSE Sensex had jumped over 600 points in early trade. At 12:35 pm, the 30-share index was up 512.23 points to 77,131.56. The NSE Nifty50 was trading 130.35 points higher at 23,333.55.KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK JUMPS 10% One of the major factors behind today’s gains on Dalal Street was a 10% jump in the share price of Kotak Mahindra Bank. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares gained after the private lender reported strong results in the third quarter. Analysts have also shared bullish views on the lender’s stock after the Q3FY25 results.WIPRO’S BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED Q3 PERFORMANCE IT giant Wipro’s share price also jumped sharply after it reported better-than-expected results in the December quarter. Wipro’s stock jumped as much as 8% in early trade to hit a day’s high of Rs 305.35.  Wipro’s consolidated profit jumped 24% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 3,354 crore and revenue from operations rose 0.5% to Rs 22,319 crore. The IT firm also declared a dividend of Rs 6 per share. Although Wipro’s results were in line with estimates, brokerages still want investors to remain a bit cautious due to challenges in critical verticals and geographies.STOCK MARKETS IN ‘WAIT AND WATCH’ MODE Despite today’s gains, Dalal Street is likely to remain volatile as global stock markets will be in a wait and watch mode as Trump 2.0 unfolds today, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “Many executive actions, particularly on immigration, are expected from the President starting from day one. Markets will wait and watch for the nature of the decisions and their likely impact,” Vijayakumat added. On the brighter side, he highlighted that the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) report on Global Economic Outlook projected India to register a solid growth of 6.5% for 2025 and 2026 for India. “This is positive.” He also noted that there is a flurry of Q3 results this week and the market will respond to the results depending on, apart from the numbers, the outlook and management commentary.

Further, it has also announced streamlining of personal detail corrections. Both these measures aim at reducing delays and grievances, thereby providing relief to both employees and employers. Let’s see how these changes work.advertisementSIMPLIFICATION OF PROCESS  Earlier, PF transfer requests needed employer verification, adding delays that could stretch to 14 days or more. Now, members with fully compliant e-KYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) can now self-correct errors online without requiring employer intervention, approval of EPFO or additional documents. Subscribers can file transfer claims directly through the EPFO portal using an Aadhaar one-time password (OTP). The newly introduced measures are expected to minimise the turnaround time, thereby benefiting about 94% of the 13 million claims filed during FY 2024-25, which would now instantly reach the EPFO. This change also addresses the backlog of nearly 20 lakh transfer claims that have been pending for over two weeks in the previous nine months alone.MINIMISING GRIEVANCES AND TURNAROUND TIME  With the employer’s role being reduced to a great extent, the turnaround time for processing transfer claims will drop significantly. As of now, 17%  of them relate to transfer-related grievances.  The newly-introduced reforms not only reduce these grievances but also ensure faster resolution, benefiting both the employees and employers.SEAMLESS CORRECTION OF PERSONAL DETAILS  The EPFO has also announced streamlining of personal detail corrections. Subscribers with a Universal Account Number (UAN) issued on or after October 1, 2017can now self-correct errors online without requiring employer intervention, approval of EPFO or additional documents. But, for the UAN issued before the said date, employers make corrections through a simplified documentation process and without the need for EPFO approval.  In other words, the above measures are a step towards empowering the Indian workforce, thus ensuring that their hard-earned savings are efficiently managed.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Must Watch

This initiative comes as part of the government’s commitment to create a more taxpayer-friendly and efficient framework.advertisementCALL FOR A SIMPLER TAX STRUCTURE  As per a PTI report, a committee in charge of revising the law is contemplating replacing the 63-year-old Income Tax Act, 1961, instead of amending the existing law. The committee intends to divide the Income Tax Act into two or even three parts, for greater clarity and efficiency. The bill will be introduced directly in Parliament, wherein stakeholder inputs including those of taxpayers and experts would be incorporated, before being finalised. As per sources, the draft law is almost ready and is likely to be presented during the latter part of the Budget session, which is scheduled from January 31 to April 4.FORMATION OF SPECIALISED SUB-COMMITTES In fact, an internal committee has been formed by The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which would supervise the review process. Also, 22 specialised sub-committees have been formed to study the various aspects of the Act. In order to ensure that the new bill addresses current economic challenges, public feedback has been sought in areas including language simplification, litigation reduction, simplified compliance and identifying obsolete provisions. Around 6,500 suggestions have been received from stakeholders by the Income Tax Department. In other words, the new law is expected to minimise disputes and litigation, and be easily understandable, thereby creating a more transparent system for taxpayers.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time. Oxfam’s research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Joe Biden last week of a “dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.” The group’s sharp-edged report, titled “Takers Not Makers,” also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990. The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.WHAT’S THE WORRY ABOUT? ... THE ‘NEW ARISTOCRACY’ President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum’s event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation — including his own — and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser. “What you’re seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,” Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk. “It’s not about one specific individual. It’s the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,” he added. Like Biden’s call for making billionaires “begin to pay their fair share” through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam — a global advocacy group — called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to “dismantle the new aristocracy.” The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay “living wages” to workers.HOW ARE THE POOREST FARING? Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said. Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has “barely changed” since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaire List” as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich. By contrast, at least four new billionaires were “minted” every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or “crony connections,” it said. On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.WILL IT BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AT DAVOS AGAIN THIS YEAR? Despite the growing gap between the super rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world. The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries. Trump’s return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza. Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for “Global Risks Report,” which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and “societal polarization” — a nod to the gap between rich and poor. As in past years, protesters calling for more economic equality, taxing the rich and pressing other demands took to the streets. Some blocked roads to Davos, snarling traffic in places and delaying trips for some attendees to the event, which runs through Friday.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Trending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/budget-2025-how-can-government-make-healthcare-more-affordable-2667381-2025-01-20,"All eyes are set on February 1, as the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to unveil the Budget 2025. India's healthcare sector anticipates the introduction of policies that promote prevention, innovation, and affordable care. Here's a look at some of the key expectations of the healthcare sector from Budget 2025.FOCUS ON PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE  With an increase in ailments related to the heart and a rise in lifestyle diseases, people are urging a keen focus towards preventive healthcare. Rajneesh Chopra, Managing Director, Amway India, “Although awareness around wellness is growing, significant barriers to access the same and affordability remain a concern, particularly when it comes to nutrition and dietary supplements. These challenges hinder the full realisation of a healthier, more resilient population.” He added, “A key step in this direction would be rationalising the GST from the current 18% on health and wellness products, including dietary supplements.”EXPANDING GST EXEMPTIONS  Healthcare experts are urging enhancing GST exemptions and input tax credits on dietary health and wellness products, which would go a long way in promoting holistic wellness across the country. “A key step in this direction would be rationalising the GST from the current 18% on health and wellness products, including dietary supplements,” states Rajneesh Chopra. In the words of Dr. Sharmila Tulpule, Founder & Director, Orthobiologix Biotech Pvt. Ltd., “A reduction of GST and Customs Duty on medical devices and surgical inputs could help lower treatment costs, making advanced procedures and life-saving interventions more affordable for patients.”REDUCING TAXES ON MEDICAL EQUIPMENTS  The healthcare sector expects lowered costs on medical equipment in Budget 2025, thereby boosting affordability and accessibility. Moreover, reducing import duties and promoting domestic manufacturing can significantly lower the cost of treatment, benefitting both the patients and the healthcare providers.   Dr. Jay Goyal, Senior Eye Surgeon and Director, Surya Eye Hospital, says, “The upcoming budget must focus on lowering taxes on medical equipment and increasing subsidies for advanced procedures for diseases like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.”BOOSTING R&D  The healthcare sector expects a higher budgetary allocation, particularly to promoting research and development. Mr Masaharu Morita, Founder and Program Director at NURA, “With the help of the government’s industry-friendly policies, AI-enabled healthcare companies can channelise more investments in the healthcare sector, particularly in the adoption of AI and advanced technologies.” Dr. Sharmila Tulpule, added, “Encouraging emerging fields like regenerative medicine, robotics, and advanced diagnostics will drive innovation and position India as a leader in medical advancements."" If taken into consideration, these measures would align with the government’s Swasth Bharat mission and place the country as a global leader in holistic wellness.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Nowadays, several lenders offer lifetime free cards, while many others waive off fees if you spend a specific amount yearly. Hence, it is advised to access your spending habits and opt for those credit cards with benefits which you actually use.NEGOTIATING AND REWARD REDEMPTION At times, banks may waive your annual fees as a goodwill gesture, if you are a loyal customer with a good credit history.  In order to negotiate a waiver, contact your bank, tell them about your regular payments and responsible usage. Moreover, some credit cards allow their customers to use the accumulated rewards points to waive off the annual fees. Hence, check your card’s reward program and plan your spending to accumulate these reward points.SPENDING SPECIFIC AMOUNT  Several credit cards waive the annual fees if a customer reaches a particular spending limit. Hence, it is advisable to switch to a credit card which offers more benefits or rewards and has lower annual fees, if your existing credit card does not align with your current needs. In other words, lowering or waiving off credit card annual fees is easier than you think, if you negotiate with your bank wisely and are well-informed.

In an exclusive conversation with Rahul Kanwal, News Director, India Today and Aajtak, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 in Davos, Brende acknowledged that incoming trade tariffs under the Trump administration could impact the global economy but added that there will be a growth in global trade.  “Donald Trump is a dealmaker,” Brende said, acknowledging Trump's strategy of using tariffs as leverage in negotiations. Reflecting on Trump’s first term, he said, “Look at Trump 1.0—trade grew globally when he was president the last time, and economic growth was strong.” Brende said while some tariffs may be introduced, especially targeting nations with significant trade deficits with the US, Trump’s aim will likely be to negotiate favourable deals. “Sometimes they (US) put tariffs out there and see what happens down the road,” he added, pointing to Trump’s transactional approach.COLLABORATION IN A 'MULTIPOLAR' WORLD During the interview, Brende also spoke about the current geopolitical landscape, which according to him is ""fragmented,"" with rising competition between the US and China shaping the global agenda. “The geopolitical backdrop for Davos this year is the most complicated in generations,” he said. The competition, along with increasing conflicts and less international cooperation, has created what Brende described as a “geopolitical recession.” Brende also spoke about a ""new world order"" where nations are competing for influence. ""It is definitely going to be a more multipolarised world with more players. We also see more emerging economies taking more room and also playing a bigger role in the world economy—be it Indonesia, Malaysia, Africa, and definitely India,"" he said.  He said the multipolar world will continue to have ""key actors"" like the US, given the fact that it comprises almost 30% of the global economy. According to him, the focus this year at Davos will be on collaboration in specific areas, which will benefit all the stakeholders in some way or another.  ""We still need to collaborate on mitigating greenhouse gases. We need to collaborate even in a competitive world for future preparedness,"" Brende added.WHAT TO EXPECT FROM WEF 2025? Brende also highlighted the need to revive global growth amid this challenging environment. “There is a lot of realism related to the economic outlook,” he said, adding that participants in Davos are focusing on ways to achieve trend growth of 4% in the coming years. He indicated that the focus at the WEF 2025 will be achieving greater cooperation and boosting global growth, even in an era of growing protectionism. As far has Trump 2.0 is concerned, Brende remains optimistic that there will be a balance between competition and cooperation. Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Tune InMust Watch

US President Donald Trump on Monday said he would impose tariffs and taxes on ""foreign countries"" ""to enrich"" Americans and said he will create an ""external revenue service"" to collect ""massive amounts"" of duties and other revenues from foreign sources. Speaking at his inauguration, Trump said he would immediately begin overhauling the US's trade system to protect Americans.

Traders appear to be engaging in short-covering as significant volatility is anticipated on Tuesday.""

""The newly elected US President is expected to sign multiple executive orders, which could introduce heightened volatility in the markets, prompting traders to adjust their positions,"" he said.  Upadhyay expects the market sentiment to remain cautious in the near future.  ""Despite the positive undertone, overall sentiment remains cautious as the market continues to trade well below its crucial 200-day EMA, indicating underlying weakness.

Zomato shares were trading 9.42% lower at Rs 218.25 at 10:22 am. Shares of the food delivery giant had also declined in the previous session. The company’s net profit in Q3 FY25 declined to Rs 59 crore from Rs 138 crore in the same period a year ago. This marked a staggering 57.25% drop in net profit. While revenue from operations rose to Rs 5,405 crore, the overall growth was muted in the third quarter.WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO? Despite today’s sharp decline in Zomato’s share price, most brokerages remain optimistic about the company’s future performance. For instance, brokerage firm Nomura noted that Zomato faces a more challenging landscape but added that its quick-commerce division, Blinkit, is poised to secure a top-two spot in the immensely popular market. Jefferies, too, remains optimistic about Blinkit’s performance and is confident about the management’s goal to double Blinkit’s store count by 2,000 by December 2025. Despite this, the brokerage cut its target price on the stock to Rs 255, albeit retaining a ‘HOLD’ rating on the stock. Brokerage firm Bernstein retained an ‘OUTPERFORM’ rating on the Zomato stock, with a target price of Rs 310. It also highlighted that the recent correction in the stocks was due to rising competition in the quick commerce space. Nuvama Institutional Equities also stated that Blinkit’s dark store additions are outpacing expectations, leading to faster growth. ""We believe this bunching up of cost for dark store addition shall hurt profitability in the short-term, but shall ultimately lead to bunching up of profitability in future quarters as these stores mature,"" Nuvama said. Nuvama has cut its target price on the stock to Rs 300, but it has retained its ‘BUY’ call. Among other brokerages, CLSA has a target price of Rs 400 on Zomato stock, while BofA Securities has kept it at Rs 375 and Nomura India has set it at Rs 290.

If you're an entrepreneur building your business, you absolutely should work hard, and do whatever it takes,"" Poonawalla said.  The CEO of Serum Institute mentioned that there's no substitute for hard work but the quality of work, and working strategically is of importance.  His recent comments come amid the ongoing debate over the work-life balance and 70-hour workweek talks.  Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy cleared the air about his 70-hour workweek remark on Monday, saying that no one can forcefully implement it on others. After stirring up a fierce debate on social media by suggesting young Indians should work 70 hours a week earlier last year, Narayana Murthy issued a clarification while speaking at IMC's Kilachand Memorial Lecture. ""There's nobody who can say you should do this, you should not do it,"" the Infosys co-founder said.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Must Watch

Read to find out how brokerages rated Paytm's Q3 results and how the company's stock will perform in future.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/paytm-stock-price-one97-communication-shares-fall-brokerage-view-target-price-rating-q3-results-2667897-2025-01-21,"Shares of One97 Communication Limited (OCL), the parent firm of digital payments firm Paytm, fell as much as 7% on Tuesday. The drop in Paytm's share price came after the company reported its Q3FY25 results, following which analysts have said the company missed its Q3 contribution margin due to higher loan guarantee (DLG) costs. Analysts, however, acknowledged that the fintech company has seen an improvement in its business metrics in the third quarter, citing steady increase in gross merchandise value (GMV) and loan disbursements. In a note, JM Financial said it expects the impact of DLG cost to normalise with the contribution margin reverting back to 55% (excluding UPI incentives) and the company reporting PAT profitability next quarter, thanks to UPI incentives worth Rs 350 crore. “We reiterate our BUY rating with March 2026 target price of Rs 1,250, valuing Paytm at 70x FY27E PER,” said the note. Motilal Oswal Financial Services maintained its contribution profit estimates for FY25/FY26 and estimate it to turn EBITDA positive by FY27. “We value Paytm at Rs 950, based on 18 times FY30 Ebitda discounted to FY26E, which corresponds to 6.1 times FY26E sales,"" said the brokerage firm, while maintaining its ‘NEUTRAL’ rating on the stock. Analysts at Yes Securities also exuded confidence about Paytm’s EBITDA breakeven plans. It has kept its ‘ADD’ rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1,050. Emkay Global, which recently upgraded that Paytm stock to ‘BUY’ with a target price of Rs 1,050, also shared optimistic views about future growth. It said factors like strong merchant payment/lending business, improving MTU and other factors “should put” Paytm on an early path to profitability in FY26E. At 1:15 pm, Paytm shares were trading 4.30% lower at Rs 859.20 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/donald-trump-uncertain-tariff-policy-keeps-asian-markets-dalal-street-on-edge-key-takeways-2667927-2025-01-21,"Benchmark stock market indices have been buzzing since early morning, with volatility sending the Sensex and Nifty50 swinging between gains and losses. One moment, the Sensex was up nearly 200 points, and the next instance, it was down 800 points.  At the time of writing this article, the 30-share Sensex was down nearly 500 points and the 50-share Nifty was trading 100 points lower. The India VIX or volatility index, which is a measure of the market's expectation of volatility over the near term, was up 4%, reflecting the edgy mood on Dalal Street. This comes after Donald Trump returned to the White House for his second term as US President. While Trump did sign several executive orders, he did not implement any immediate tariffs, keeping global markets guessing about his next move. Here are three things investors should know:UNCLEAR TARIFF PLANS Donald Trump had earlier hinted at imposing tariffs of up to 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese imports. However, no immediate action was taken, leaving markets guessing. The lack of specifics has created uncertainty for global trade and investors, suggested Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Markets.ASIAN MARKETS FEEL THE HEAT Khoo said as a result of this inconclusive policy stance, Asian markets were mixed, with China, South Korea and India witnessing declines. “This lack of definitive action on tariffs spurred caution among investors, who remain vigilant for further announcements that might reshape global trade,” he added.FUTURE TARIFF SCARE While Khoo suggested that broad-based, day-one tariffs appeared unlikely from the outset, the possibility of more selective, near-term import levies remains open. And this seems to have spooked investors around the globe. Moreover, Khoo added that the US President could even go forward and impose a global tariff early in his administration. This could significantly shake up global trade. “Historically, similar tariff threats have triggered volatility in Asian markets. In 2018, for instance, US tariffs on steel and aluminum prompted a wave of uncertainty, leading to short-term declines before gradual recoveries as investors adjusted to the new environment,” Khoo said. “Consequently, while current fluctuations may persist, Asian markets have historically demonstrated resilience, and the ultimate impact will hinge on the scope and timing of any upcoming US trade measures,” he added.

The Sensex tumbled 1,300 points to 75,773 at around 2:45 pm, while the Nifty50 fell below 23,000. All other broader market indices also collapsed during the trading session. The main reason behind the stock market crash was uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's tariff plan after he returned to the White House for his second term.  Here are all the factors that led to today's bloodbath on Dalal Street: TRUMP TARIFF UNCERTAINTY As mentioned earlier, the uncertainty over Donald Trump's tariff plan triggered panic among investors. In an earlier article, we explained how the unprdictability of tariff plans has led to higher volatility on Dalal Street. HEAVYWEIGHT STOCKS DECLINE Major stocks across several sectors fell sharply during the trading session, leading to today's downturn. Zomato was on course to register an 11% decline and was the top loser on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Other heavyweight stocks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Reliance and SBI also tumbled sharply during the session, leading to the stock market slump. Q3 RESULTS FAILS TO IMPRESS A majority of companies that have reported their Q3 results have either failed to meet expectations or barely scraped through. Only a handful of companies have managed to defy expectations. And a Bloomberg consensus estimate has indicated that the earnings per share (EPS) of Nifty50 companies may grow by just 3% year-on-year in the third quarter. Only the capital goods, healthcare and telecom sectors are likely to register double-digit profit growth. VOLATILITY SKYROCKETS Volatility also spiked during the session due to the prevailing sentiments among Dalal Street investors. Investors remain worried about the impact of Trump's delayed tariff announcements, which could lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty for them. Had Trump executed his tariff plans, it could have provided clarity to investors on which sectors will be hit. However, experts said that the ambiguity surrounding Trump's tariff plan will force investors to ""wait and watch"" for a longer period and this could lead to a longer period of volatility on Dalal Street. FII SELLING CONTINUES The above factors have just made the situation worse on Dalal Street, given that it is already facing an exodus of foreign institutional investors (FIIs). As of January 20, FIIs have pulled out equity holdings worth over Rs 48,000 crore. In an uncertain market, FII selling could intensify and hit domestic stock market investors harder.

""India could afford to cut back on some of its tariffs just for its own sake because this is an important opportunity for India to plug itself into global supply chains,"" Gopinath told Rahul Kanwal, News Director, India Today and Aajtak, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 in Davos She also said that India remains an attractive destination for businesses but needs to address the tariff issue.  ""The US is going to have bilateral negotiations with all their trading partners, to address what they feel are unfair trade practices,"" she said. She said that India's focus should be on domestic reforms rather than tariff battles as it looks to become a global hub for manufacturing.  ""In terms of what prevents people from going into India, it is about still the ease of doing business, the infrastructure, the ability to buy land or sell land, contract enforcement,"" she said. On India's growth outlook, Gopinath maintained an optimistic view despite recent slowdowns. The IMF projects India's growth at 6.5% for the fiscal year, which she believes represents the country's current potential growth rate. ""For the fiscal year as a whole, our growth number is 6.5%. So we do expect to see a recovery. But first, potential growth is also at 6.5%. So again, this comes back to if you want to be able to raise potential growth by a lot more, you're going to have to do the soft reforms,"" she said. Gopinath called the slowdown in growth ""temporary,"" attributed largely to delays in public infrastructure project implementation. She mentioned the importance of continuing public infrastructure investment, particularly at the state level, while maintaining macro stability.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Must Watch

Selling pressure was broad-based, with sectors like realty, energy, and auto leading the losses. The broader indices also came under pressure, each shedding over 2%.

During the interview, Gopinath discussed the potential impact of US President Donald Trump’s plan to impose trade tariffs on some countries, global growth, bilateral trade between India and America, cryptocurrency and more. Below is the full text of her interview with Rahul Kanwal:IMPACT OF DONALD TRUMP’S PLANNED TRADE TARIFFS Rahul Kanwal: I want to start by asking you about what you're making of American President Donald Trump's determination to impose new trade tariffs. From the IMF's lens and from your own personal point of view, how do you see that pan out in actuality, belligerence versus reality? Gita Gopinath: You know, President Trump said he would hit the ground running, and he has done that, and he's announced a lot of measures. He's been more concrete on immigration and on energy, on tariffs on trade policy more generally. He has, you know, pointed to intent, but we have yet to see what exactly he will do. The reason I'm saying that is because if you look at the tariffs that were done in 2018-19, The details didn't matter in terms of what products you put your tariffs on. That's going to determine how much of an inflationary effect it will have. How countries retaliate, that was absolutely critical for what the consequences were going to be. But, you know, in general, what we have seen based on historical evidence is that if we end up in a place where there are lots of tit-for-tat tariffs that happen, then that's a net negative for the world as a whole.IMPACT OF POTENTIAL TARIFFS ON GLOBAL GROWTH Rahul Kanwal: So how much of an impact do you think this could have on global growth? It will of course determine, as you say, it will be determined by what tariffs he imposes, what countermeasures the other countries employ. But how do you see this impact global growth? Because the latest IMF forecast seems to suggest global growth slowing down on its own even before these tariffs have come into place. Gita Gopinath: So, in addition to knowing what the details are on the tariffs, there are lots of other policies that are being announced by the US government. So, for example, which they plan to do, which is to make the tax cuts permanent to have more financial deregulation. There is a lot of positive sentiment. Foreign direct investment into the US is very strong at this point. So, all of that can have an offsetting effect. So, in fact, our near-term assessment is that there are more upside risks to the US economy. Now, what that usually means is that if there's more growth in the US economy, it does have spillovers to the rest of the world, and that can be positive, too. While many of the other policies on the trade front and so on will be more of a downside risk for the rest of the world. What I'm trying to say is that it's not just about trade and tariff policy, but there's a lot that's happening on taxes, a lot that's happening on immigration, on energy, and so on. We have to look at the sum total to be able to say what will happen to global growth.SHOULD INDIA CUT BACK ON TARIFFS? Rahul Kanwal: President Trump has called India a tariff king and threatened taxes, tariffs against India as well. How do you see that impact the India-America bilateral trade and India's growth and India's desire to build its own economy at this time? Gita Gopinath: This is going to be an environment where the US is going to have bilateral negotiations with all their trading partners to address what they feel are unfair trade practices that the fact that they get, their products get imposed higher tariffs than what the US imposes on products coming out of other countries. And so, you know, there is a valid point of whether this is a level playing field or not and, therefore, I think countries will have to negotiate this. As you know, and I've said this before to you too, I mean, our view at the IMF is that India could afford to cut back on some of its tariffs just for its own sake because this is an opportunity for India to plug itself into global supply chains. Everybody is looking to diversify and I hear from almost everyone that India is a very attractive destination. But to be able to go in, you will need somewhat lower tariffs in India too. So that will help India directly. Again, but like I said, every country is going to be negotiating this.HOW CAN INDIA ATTRACT MORE INVESTMENTS? Rahul Kanwal: There are two trends playing out simultaneously. One, India trying to attract some of the China plus one investment into the 'Make in India' story. The other, Donald Trump determined to get companies to invest and manufacture in the United States. To what extent could that mar India's chances? You're saying reduce tariffs, plug into global supply chains, but you've also got America determined to pull manufacturing into mainland United States. Gita Gopinath: Well, the US is actually quite successful now in being able to attract investment into the US. So, if you look at foreign direct investment around the world, the US is an incredibly attractive destination. It's taking a bigger and bigger share of foreign direct investment flows. I think the best thing for India to do to offset some of that is actually to focus on the domestic reforms. In terms of what prevents people from going into India, it is still about ease of doing business, the infrastructure, the ability to buy land or sell land, contract enforcement. Those are the kinds of aspects that are more of a constraining factor. So, the more India can do in terms of structural reforms at home, and it's done a lot, not to deny that, it's done quite a bit, especially in terms of public infrastructure, it's done a lot, and to keep that momentum going, that will be what will change the story for India.advertisementWHAT SHOULD BUDGET 2025 FOCUS ON? Rahul Kanwal: You're talking about the need for the Indian government to usher in a new range of reforms. You've got a big budget coming up and this is one year when there are just two elections in the states and they're very far spread out. So it's an actual opportunity to push some reform through. On economic policy, what are the key reforms you and the IMF are looking out for from India?Gita Gopinath: So, I think firstly, it is important to continue on the path of public infrastructure investment. And implementation needs to be timely.This is just at the central government level, but I'm talking at the state government level. There is still a big need for that, and so pushing more on that front is going to be important.It's also important to keep India's macro stability. And it's done very well in terms of inflation and what the RBI has done in terms of managing inflation. It's done a really great job. On the fiscal front, of course, India's debt levels are high.It's not an imminent concern. But that's something in terms of the budget to determine what you can do, because you need to be able to raise some revenues too while you undertake the spending. You know, making sure that it's done in a growth-friendly manner is going to be important.WHAT’S BEHIND INDIA’S GROWTH SLOWDOWN? Rahul Kanwal: India has seen a slowdown in economic growth in the second quarter of this financial year, with growth slowing to 5.2%. Overall, annual growth forecasts are down as well. Now there's a big debate raging over whether this is a temporary slowdown caused by the elections, by the pullback in capex by the government, or is this more cyclical? How do you come out of this debate?Gita Gopinath: So, the 5.2% we see as a temporary thing. That reflects the fact that there have been some delays in implementing some of the public infrastructure projects.But we see that picking up. And we do continuously see strength in rural consumption. I remember last time we talked about that. For the fiscal year as a whole, our growth number is 6.5%. We do expect to see a recovery. But for us, potential growth is also at 6.5%. Again, this comes back to if you want to be able to raise potential growth by a lot more, you're going to have to do this over the fall.Rahul Kanwal: So you've reduced what you think is India's potential growth in the medium term to about the mid-6%, right?Gita Gopinath: 6.5%. Yeah, but I mean, I don't think we've been that far off from 6.5%.NEED FOR GLOBAL CRYTO FRAMEWORKRahul Kanwal: Talking about cryptocurrency, I remember speaking with you last time, and you generally weren't very bullish on cryptocurrency. Now you've got the President of the United States who's highly bullish himself. Does that change your perspective on how you're viewing cryptocurrencies and the stability and the future of this asset?Gita Gopinath: The way we've always viewed it is that crypto has both risks and opportunities. There is a technology that's underlying it in terms of distributed ledger technology that many companies are actually using for other purposes, like for their payment platforms, for having more security in their contracts.That is all extremely welcome. And that's why innovation is good. There are many faces of innovation, and this is all fine.But at the same time, there are risks. And therefore, we do think countries around the world need a solid crypto-policy framework that protects consumers, that prevents your financial stability risks from building up. You can have both, and you have to hit the sweet spot there.IS THERE A NEED TO REGULATE AI? Rahul Kanwal: Speaking of regulation, there's a need for regulation on artificial intelligence as well. Do you see anything at all which leads the world towards having some kind of a common governance architecture? Or will it just be the case of development and use cases running far faster than any governance around?Gita Gopinath: First of all, for AI, it's much more than just regulation. There are issues about what governments do in case AI ends up with a lot of people losing their jobs.How do you also get innovation going? What kinds of policies will encourage innovation? So it's not just about the regulation aspect, but there are multiple aspects.Rahul Kanwal: So let's break it down one by one. You spoke about the potential impact of artificial intelligence on jobs. I was just in a conversation at the World Economic Forum on Industries in the Intelligent Age. And the argument being made by chief executives is that the impact on jobs isn't as severe as was being made out initially. How do you view this? How bad or how much of an impact will artificial intelligence have on jobs, particularly in India?Gita Gopinath: I think we haven't seen the first of it at this point. It's still early days. So we're still in the realm of the hypothetical and the theoretical at this point based on some estimates that one can do.Rahul Kanwal: What are your estimates?Gita Gopinath: Our estimate is for the world as a whole, 40% of jobs are exposed to AI. But at about half of that, 20% will benefit from AI and 20% will be displaced. But there's a wide variation. So advanced economies are at 60% exposure. India is at 26% exposure. So there's a lot of variation over here. We'll see what happens in terms of the labour market.I think a good thing to remember from past history is that when you actually see the impact of automation on the job market is the first year of a recession. So, you don't see it in normal times. You don't see it in good times.When you have a recession...and then in that first year, that's when 90% of automation-related job losses happen. So, I don't think we should be sanguine at this point. We should be careful what may come in the future.What governments can do for us is to make sure that they're only benefiting from AI side. That requires digital public infrastructure, scaling, making sure your population can actually use AI. Otherwise, they will be on the losing end.Rahul Kanwal: So, let's spend some time talking about that because India seems to have taken on the mantle of being the use case capital of the world. Instead of focusing on building large language models of its own, it is attempting to do that, but really trying to implement artificial intelligence and its capabilities. Do you think that's the right approach? How would you, because you're also of Indian origin, how would you think a country and an economy like India should really be approaching artificial intelligence?Gita Gopinath: I think that's a good place for India to be. It does not necessarily have to be in the foundational models producing side. There are a ton that can be done in terms of application and especially for a country like India, even in education and healthcare space, these applications can be very helpful and they have to be tailored to country circumstances, which is why the industry has an advantage in doing that.But I mean the bottom line is as long as you have the right environment for companies to innovate, venture capital is going to be very important, the right level of skilled labor is going to be very important, education is going to be very important, creating that ecosystem.INDIA-CHINA EQUATIONRahul Kanwal: How strong a pushback do you see from China on some of the trade measures that the United States may implement and how should India be navigating its dealing with the Chinese economy just at this moment because after a lot of deadlock along the line of actual control, there's ultimately now a bit of a thaw and the question is at what speed do you accelerate that?Gita Gopinath: Countries for their own selfish interests benefit from cooperating, and therefore, I expect all countries are going to sit across the table and negotiate what they think is good for their countries and by the way, cooperation as I said has been good for the world and for everybody individually.So we'll see how this plays out. I mean the last time China did retaliate was the US.We'll see what happens. It's too early to speculate.Rahul Kanwal: But do you see the fragmentation of the global economy, the division into two camps, that trend accentuate or do you think they're more likely to find ways of being able to navigate these divisions?Gita Gopinath: We are already seeing signs of...what we call geoeconomic fragmentation, which is when you look at trade, it is much more stronger between countries that are more geopolitically aligned. Geopolitical alliance is becoming a bigger factor in explaining who trades with whom, who invests in which country.So we're already seeing the seeds of that. And I expect that's going to continue.Now, unlike, you know, 50 years ago, when so-called non-aligned countries were a very small share of world GDP, they're much stronger now, India, Mexico, all of them are much bigger economies, and they can play a much bigger role in terms of being a bigger part of the global supply chain and seeing how trade gets rerouted.Rahul Kanwal: So do you see a fragmentation in the medium term of the world into two trading blocks?Gita Gopinath: I don't think I would point to a very stark break in terms of completely fragmented world, but we certainly have drifted away from the strong rules-based multilateral trading system that we've been used to for a couple of decades.WHAT SKILLS SHOULD YOUNGSTERS DEVELOP?Rahul Kanwal: Before I end, I want you to speak to young people who are watching you at this moment and wondering what kind of skills should they be developing to be able to navigate, succeed, and survive in a world dominated by artificial intelligence where machines are much smarter than men. How should they be preparing for the job market given the realities that face them?Gita Gopinath: Well, I mean, firstly, I still believe that STEM will be important. I don't think machines are going to completely take over all aspects of STEM. So, STEM will remain important.But also, just in terms of investing in creativity, in terms of investing in teamwork, in terms of, you know, thinking at a much higher level as opposed to in terms of the minutiae. I think all of that, building those skills is going to be important.SHOULD US REVISIT IMMIGRATION POLICY?Rahul Kanwal: There's a big debate raging over immigration. You know, ultimately it seemed that Donald Trump came out on the side of Elon Musk on the issue of H-1B visas. But do you see this argument impacting skilled labor wanting to move to a country like the United States or not really? That the pull is just too much and it won't impact who comes and who doesn't?Gita Gopinath: For many countries, including the US, there is certainly a need to revisit immigration policy. It has created a lot of stress in the US. And so it's not unusual to see that they are thinking of how to change the system. And, you know, we remain of the view that skilled labour is critical for economies in the world. And if you can get the best talent from other parts of the world, you should attract that into your economy.Rahul Kanwal: The American president talks about taking over Greenland. Canada is becoming the 51st state and talking about taking over the Panama Canal. How do you see that potentially play out in the months to come?Gita Gopinath: Well, that's not something I can talk about. I think we stay out of those kinds of issues. We'll see what, if any, economic impact that could have.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Must Watch 
 Rahul Kanwal: You're talking about the need for the Indian government to usher in a new range of reforms. You've got a big budget coming up and this is one year when there are just two elections in the states and they're very far spread out. So it's an actual opportunity to push some reform through. On economic policy, what are the key reforms you and the IMF are looking out for from India? Gita Gopinath: So, I think firstly, it is important to continue on the path of public infrastructure investment. And implementation needs to be timely.This is just at the central government level, but I'm talking at the state government level. There is still a big need for that, and so pushing more on that front is going to be important. It's also important to keep India's macro stability. And it's done very well in terms of inflation and what the RBI has done in terms of managing inflation. It's done a really great job. On the fiscal front, of course, India's debt levels are high. It's not an imminent concern. But that's something in terms of the budget to determine what you can do, because you need to be able to raise some revenues too while you undertake the spending. You know, making sure that it's done in a growth-friendly manner is going to be important.WHAT’S BEHIND INDIA’S GROWTH SLOWDOWN?  Rahul Kanwal: India has seen a slowdown in economic growth in the second quarter of this financial year, with growth slowing to 5.2%. Overall, annual growth forecasts are down as well. Now there's a big debate raging over whether this is a temporary slowdown caused by the elections, by the pullback in capex by the government, or is this more cyclical? How do you come out of this debate? Gita Gopinath: So, the 5.2% we see as a temporary thing. That reflects the fact that there have been some delays in implementing some of the public infrastructure projects. But we see that picking up. And we do continuously see strength in rural consumption. I remember last time we talked about that. For the fiscal year as a whole, our growth number is 6.5%. We do expect to see a recovery. But for us, potential growth is also at 6.5%. Again, this comes back to if you want to be able to raise potential growth by a lot more, you're going to have to do this over the fall. Rahul Kanwal: So you've reduced what you think is India's potential growth in the medium term to about the mid-6%, right? Gita Gopinath: 6.5%. Yeah, but I mean, I don't think we've been that far off from 6.5%.NEED FOR GLOBAL CRYTO FRAMEWORK Rahul Kanwal: Talking about cryptocurrency, I remember speaking with you last time, and you generally weren't very bullish on cryptocurrency. Now you've got the President of the United States who's highly bullish himself. Does that change your perspective on how you're viewing cryptocurrencies and the stability and the future of this asset? Gita Gopinath: The way we've always viewed it is that crypto has both risks and opportunities. There is a technology that's underlying it in terms of distributed ledger technology that many companies are actually using for other purposes, like for their payment platforms, for having more security in their contracts. That is all extremely welcome. And that's why innovation is good. There are many faces of innovation, and this is all fine. But at the same time, there are risks. And therefore, we do think countries around the world need a solid crypto-policy framework that protects consumers, that prevents your financial stability risks from building up. You can have both, and you have to hit the sweet spot there.IS THERE A NEED TO REGULATE AI?  Rahul Kanwal: Speaking of regulation, there's a need for regulation on artificial intelligence as well. Do you see anything at all which leads the world towards having some kind of a common governance architecture? Or will it just be the case of development and use cases running far faster than any governance around? Gita Gopinath: First of all, for AI, it's much more than just regulation. There are issues about what governments do in case AI ends up with a lot of people losing their jobs. How do you also get innovation going? What kinds of policies will encourage innovation? So it's not just about the regulation aspect, but there are multiple aspects. Rahul Kanwal: So let's break it down one by one. You spoke about the potential impact of artificial intelligence on jobs. I was just in a conversation at the World Economic Forum on Industries in the Intelligent Age. And the argument being made by chief executives is that the impact on jobs isn't as severe as was being made out initially. How do you view this? How bad or how much of an impact will artificial intelligence have on jobs, particularly in India? Gita Gopinath: I think we haven't seen the first of it at this point. It's still early days. So we're still in the realm of the hypothetical and the theoretical at this point based on some estimates that one can do. Rahul Kanwal: What are your estimates? Gita Gopinath: Our estimate is for the world as a whole, 40% of jobs are exposed to AI. But at about half of that, 20% will benefit from AI and 20% will be displaced. But there's a wide variation. So advanced economies are at 60% exposure. India is at 26% exposure. So there's a lot of variation over here. We'll see what happens in terms of the labour market. I think a good thing to remember from past history is that when you actually see the impact of automation on the job market is the first year of a recession. So, you don't see it in normal times. You don't see it in good times. When you have a recession...and then in that first year, that's when 90% of automation-related job losses happen. So, I don't think we should be sanguine at this point. We should be careful what may come in the future. What governments can do for us is to make sure that they're only benefiting from AI side. That requires digital public infrastructure, scaling, making sure your population can actually use AI. Otherwise, they will be on the losing end. Rahul Kanwal: So, let's spend some time talking about that because India seems to have taken on the mantle of being the use case capital of the world. Instead of focusing on building large language models of its own, it is attempting to do that, but really trying to implement artificial intelligence and its capabilities. Do you think that's the right approach? How would you, because you're also of Indian origin, how would you think a country and an economy like India should really be approaching artificial intelligence? Gita Gopinath: I think that's a good place for India to be. It does not necessarily have to be in the foundational models producing side. There are a ton that can be done in terms of application and especially for a country like India, even in education and healthcare space, these applications can be very helpful and they have to be tailored to country circumstances, which is why the industry has an advantage in doing that. But I mean the bottom line is as long as you have the right environment for companies to innovate, venture capital is going to be very important, the right level of skilled labor is going to be very important, education is going to be very important, creating that ecosystem.INDIA-CHINA EQUATION Rahul Kanwal: How strong a pushback do you see from China on some of the trade measures that the United States may implement and how should India be navigating its dealing with the Chinese economy just at this moment because after a lot of deadlock along the line of actual control, there's ultimately now a bit of a thaw and the question is at what speed do you accelerate that? Gita Gopinath: Countries for their own selfish interests benefit from cooperating, and therefore, I expect all countries are going to sit across the table and negotiate what they think is good for their countries and by the way, cooperation as I said has been good for the world and for everybody individually. So we'll see how this plays out. I mean the last time China did retaliate was the US. We'll see what happens. It's too early to speculate. Rahul Kanwal: But do you see the fragmentation of the global economy, the division into two camps, that trend accentuate or do you think they're more likely to find ways of being able to navigate these divisions? Gita Gopinath: We are already seeing signs of...what we call geoeconomic fragmentation, which is when you look at trade, it is much more stronger between countries that are more geopolitically aligned. Geopolitical alliance is becoming a bigger factor in explaining who trades with whom, who invests in which country. So we're already seeing the seeds of that. And I expect that's going to continue. Now, unlike, you know, 50 years ago, when so-called non-aligned countries were a very small share of world GDP, they're much stronger now, India, Mexico, all of them are much bigger economies, and they can play a much bigger role in terms of being a bigger part of the global supply chain and seeing how trade gets rerouted. Rahul Kanwal: So do you see a fragmentation in the medium term of the world into two trading blocks? Gita Gopinath: I don't think I would point to a very stark break in terms of completely fragmented world, but we certainly have drifted away from the strong rules-based multilateral trading system that we've been used to for a couple of decades.WHAT SKILLS SHOULD YOUNGSTERS DEVELOP? Rahul Kanwal: Before I end, I want you to speak to young people who are watching you at this moment and wondering what kind of skills should they be developing to be able to navigate, succeed, and survive in a world dominated by artificial intelligence where machines are much smarter than men. How should they be preparing for the job market given the realities that face them? Gita Gopinath: Well, I mean, firstly, I still believe that STEM will be important. I don't think machines are going to completely take over all aspects of STEM. So, STEM will remain important. But also, just in terms of investing in creativity, in terms of investing in teamwork, in terms of, you know, thinking at a much higher level as opposed to in terms of the minutiae. I think all of that, building those skills is going to be important.SHOULD US REVISIT IMMIGRATION POLICY? Rahul Kanwal: There's a big debate raging over immigration. You know, ultimately it seemed that Donald Trump came out on the side of Elon Musk on the issue of H-1B visas. But do you see this argument impacting skilled labor wanting to move to a country like the United States or not really? That the pull is just too much and it won't impact who comes and who doesn't? Gita Gopinath: For many countries, including the US, there is certainly a need to revisit immigration policy. It has created a lot of stress in the US. And so it's not unusual to see that they are thinking of how to change the system. And, you know, we remain of the view that skilled labour is critical for economies in the world.

c0083612-7a91-4ee6-890c-e762e339f0bd,"A decade of budget evolution under ModiCoalition dynamics could influence future budgetary decisions, particularly in the welfare sector. Will the government maintain its current priorities?",https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/a-decade-of-budget-evolution-under-narendra-modi-2668150-2025-01-21,"The Union Budget for 2025-26 will be an interesting exercise for the ruling BJP. The saffron party now has to contend with influential coalition partners trying to push their agendas — a problem it has not faced in the last decade. Will this affect the Centre’s fiscal priorities? To get a clearer picture, India Today’s Data Intelligence Unit analysed ministry-wise budget allocations over the last decade.  As per the budget allocation for 2024-25, the Finance Ministry continues to dominate the budget, with a 38.6 per cent share in FY25, a slight increase from 37.3 per cent in FY20 and 36.7 per cent in FY15. The Defence Ministry secured the second spot, but its budget share declined from 17.1 per cent in FY15 to 12.9 per cent in FY25. However, in absolute terms, its allocation more than doubled, rising from Rs 2.8 lakh crore in FY15 to Rs 6.2 lakh crore in FY25. Infrastructure ministries saw the most remarkable growth in budget allocations, reflecting the government’s emphasis on development and connectivity. Road Transport and Highways climbed from rank nine in FY15 to rank three in FY25 in terms of money allocation. Its budget share rose from two to six per cent, but allocations increased from Rs 0.3 lakh crore to Rs 2.8 lakh crore over the same period. Railways experienced extraordinary growth, moving from rank 11 in FY15 to rank four in FY25. Its share rose from 1.8 to 5.3 per cent, while its allocation skyrocketed by 748 per cent, from Rs 0.3 lakh crore in FY15 to Rs 2.5 lakh crore in FY25. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution dropped from rank three in FY15 to rank five in FY25. Its share declined from 7.11 per cent in FY15 to 4.63 per cent in FY25, but allocations grew significantly from Rs 1.2 lakh crore to Rs 2.2 lakh crore.   Similarly, the Ministry of Rural Development slipped from rank five in FY15 to rank sixth in FY25, its budget share falling from 4.2 per cent to 3.7 per cent. However, its allocation nearly doubled, from Rs 0.6 lakh crore in FY15 to Rs 1.8 lakh crore in FY25, indicating sustained rural investment. The Agriculture Ministry saw a major boost, with allocations increasing from Rs 0.2 lakh crore in FY15 to Rs 1.3 lakh crore in FY25, a 450 per cent jump. The Communications Ministry emerged as a rising star, climbing from rank 15 in FY15 to rank ninth in FY25. Its share grew from one per cent to 2.8 per cent, as allocations increased from Rs 0.2 lakh crore to Rs 1.2 lakh crore. On the other hand, some ministries saw slower growth, like the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers dropped from four per cent in FY15 to three per cent in FY25, though its allocation rose modestly from Rs 0.7 lakh crore to Rs 1.6 lakh crore.  These are the ministries where the Narendra Modi government spent more than 80 per cent of the budget in FY25 and the analysis shows a clear shift in the government’s priorities over the decade, with an increased focus on infrastructure, digital connectivity, and national security. Welfare sectors like consumer affairs and rural development still receive significant funding but are no longer at the forefront. Coalition dynamics could influence future budgetary decisions, particularly in the welfare sector. Will the government maintain its current priorities, or will it realign to accommodate partners? Only time will tell.Published By: Pathikrit SanyalPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Tune InREAD |  What to expect from Budget 2025: Growth, taxes, and fiscal realities in numbersMust Watch

Despite slower economic growth, the government is expected to stick to its fiscal discipline plan.",https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/budget-2025-growth-taxes-fiscal-realities-in-numbers-2668140-2025-01-21,"India’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, faces a challenging task as she delivers her eighth Budget speech on February 1. Amid slowing economic growth, sticky inflation, and tepid private investment, the government must boost consumption and infrastructure spending while keeping the fiscal deficit in check. The balancing act hinges on the state of public finances.A NEW CHAPTER FOR INCOME TAX Simplifying India’s six-decade-old income tax law will likely be a headline measure. Weak consumption and inflation have dampened demand, with private investment stuck in wait-and-watch mode. Tax relief may help break this stalemate. The government set a January 2025 deadline to overhaul the Income Tax Act 1961, aiming to reduce disputes and litigation while improving clarity. It was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her July 2024 budget speech: “I am now announcing a comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act,1961. The purpose is to make the act concise, lucid, and easy to read and understand. This will reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax certainty to taxpayers. It will also bring down the demand embroiled in litigation. It is proposed to be completed in six months.” FISCAL DEFICIT: A RIGHTROPE Fiscal deficits occur when government spending exceeds income. While necessary during crises, sustained high deficits pose economic stability risks, especially with elevated debt levels. The fiscal consolidation roadmap, announced in the FY22 budget, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.5 per cent of the GDP by FY27. FY25's deficit is projected at 4.9 per cent of the GDP, or Rs 16.1 trillion. Despite slower economic growth, the government is expected to stick to its fiscal discipline plan. “Notwithstanding the growth slowdown in FY25 and the likely minor growth improvement in FY26, the government will adhere to its fiscal consolidation roadmap provided in the medium-term fiscal policy-cum-fiscal strategy statement with the FY25 budget and peg the FY26 fiscal deficit at 4.5 per cent,” says Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist and head of public finance at Ind-Ra, a rating agency. DIRECT TAXES LEAD Direct taxes have outpaced indirect taxes since FY22, reflecting a shift in revenue sources. In FY25, direct taxes accounted for 57.5 per cent of gross tax revenue, up from 52 per cent in FY22. However, indirect taxes, primarily governed by the GST Council, no longer see significant changes in the Union Budget, except for import duties. SPENDING AND REVENUE India’s revenue-to-GDP ratio has fluctuated modestly over 30 years, peaking at 12.5 per cent in 2004 before falling to 8.5 per cent in 2021 during the pandemic. Spending, meanwhile, has shown more variability, averaging 14-16 per cent of the GDP. The fiscal gap has narrowed, with FY25 revenue projected at 9.8 per cent of the GDP and spending at 14.8 per cent. CAPITAL SPENDING Capital spending is critical for growth but faces hurdles. It is projected at 23.05 per cent of the total budget or 3.4 per cent of the GDP in FY25, with Railways, Road Transport, and Defence accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. Election-related spending slowed investment early in FY25, causing a 12.3 per cent drop in project spending over the first eight months. Meeting the year’s target will require a staggering 64.7 per cent growth in spending over the next four months. CLOSING GAPS This year’s budget must address weak growth, inflation, and external developments such as Donald Trump’s return as president of the US — a country that consumes a fifth of India’s exports and is a major source of fund inflows. With GDP growth expected to slow to 6.4 per cent, the weakest since the pandemic, fiscal consolidation limits the government’s flexibility to bolster social and economic priorities. Sitharaman’s ability to navigate these challenges will define Budget 2025 and set the tone for India’s economic trajectory.Published By: Pathikrit SanyalPublished On: Jan 21, 2025Tune InREAD |  2024's climate chaos: Why Budget 2025 must prioritise climate actionMust Watch

— IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) January 21, 2025 ""Trying to bring them back into the US by putting up tariffs typically doesn't work,"" the former RBI Governor asserted.  Explaining the impact of the tariff hike on the US, Raghuram Rajan cited examples of bigger economies like China and how they import goods from small countries like Vietnam to reduce manufacturing costs.  ""Trying to bring those goods back into the US by imposing tariffs usually doesn’t work as intended. If possible, production will simply move to another location. For example, what was being manufactured in China is now shifted to Vietnam,"" Rajan said.  ""If universal tariffs are implemented, they may prevent imports from other countries, but that would force production to occur in the US at a much higher cost. There's a reason why China is doing it — it's cost-effective,"" he added.  Further in his conversation, Rajan also pointed out the uncertainty in foreign investments if tariffs will change overnight.  ""There would be great uncertainty about where to invest if tariffs could change overnight. Not just the US, remember there would be retaliatory tariffs as well. I believe that the President has in mind three benefits — it will even the playing field, it will be a source of revenue and a source of jobs,"" he added.  Soon after taking the oath of office, Trump, the 47th President of the United States, reiterated that he would impose 100 per cent import tariffs on the Brics nations, which also includes India, in case they took any steps towards cutting the use of the dollar in global trade.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Jan 21, 2025

During the interview, Rajan highlighted his views on Trump's plans to impose tariffs on some countries, including India, how the economy and job creation is progressing under the Narendra Modi-led central government and the rupee vs dollar situation. Here are the full excerpts of the interview:ON TRUMP'S TARIFF IMPACT ON INDIA Rahul Kanwal: What is the real impact you think Donald Trump's tariff measures could have on the global economy and most importantly, on India's growth? Raghuram Rajan: Well, I think they are a big source of uncertainty and a potential source of disruption for the rest of the world. For the US, I don't think they'll be as beneficial as the administration thinks, partly because, you know, goods are made outside the US for a reason. It's cheaper to make it outside. Trying to bring them back into the US by putting up tariffs, typically if they could, they'd go somewhere else. You know, what was being made in China will go to Vietnam. If you're going to put universal tariffs, maybe you could stop them from coming in from elsewhere, but they have to be made in the US at a much higher cost, because there's a reason China made it. I think the higher costs, the fact that the rest of the world is disrupted, and their economies, which are already weaker than the US for the most part, weakened even further.Of course, the great uncertainty about where you invest when tariffs could change overnight, not just from the US, because remember, there'll also be retaliatory tariffs. I think there's a big source of potential disruption in the world. I do think that the president has three benefits in mind. One, he believes it will even the playing field. The US is running deficits because everyone else cheats. The second is that this could be a source of revenue. The third is this could be a source of jobs. We could question each one of these, especially the source of revenue, because it's actually small in relative to the US's economy size. In terms of whether they'll create jobs, a lot of manufacturing is already automated, even in a country like India. Bring it back to the US, it gets even more automated. So I'm not sure if this is going to create a lot of jobs, especially at the high school education level where there's a lot of anxiety. Rahul Kanwal: So there is the question of competitiveness, which you say the US doesn't have, which is why these jobs moved outside. But then there is also the aspect of economic coercion. We're already seeing how corporate America is trying to kiss the ring as it were. Therefore, does that then impact India's opportunity to be China plus one gateway, whereas a lot of companies think, hey, Donald Trump is calling us, cajoling us or coercing us? So is it better to set up manufacturing in the US than to look at countries like India? Raghuram Rajan: I think it creates uncertainty because one of the things that President Trump respects is the market. If the market starts tanking on the basis of some preliminary set of tariffs, clearly there will be a revisit to the tariffs. Rahul Kanwal: How are the markets likely to react? Raghuram Rajan: I think if you said, you know, suddenly after the markets had, had been expecting no or moderate tariffs, 60 per cent tariffs on, on China, 25 per cent on the rest of the world, it would be seriously adverse for the markets. I think that is partly why the decision has been postponed some by because we heard it would come on February 1 for Canada and Mexico. Also, the other concern is there's a lot of other stuff wrapped up in these tariffs, right? Remember, when the BRICS countries were talking about an alternative payment system, there was a threat of tariffs. If you do that, the threat of tariffs, if you have too many drugs being produced in your country and sent across, if you have immigrants. I mean, at some point, the world is also going to get a little jaded. But of course, this is the most powerful country in the world. So you don't want to upset the president. You want to be on the right side, but how much can you do? So at some point, countries are also going to say the only thing they will listen to is the same kind of medicine, so you will have tariffs imposed from the other side. Canada apparently has already prepared some. This is not going to end well if it continues along this path. Rahul Kanwal: What kind of inflation pressures could it create on consumers in the US and the spiral effect on consumers in India if these new tariffs are actually imposed? Raghuram Rajan: Well, I think from the Indian perspective, it would be more limited because we don't import that much from the US and even if we impose tariffs on the US, that's not going to be a huge problem. I think the concern for India will be more if Chinese goods get stopped at the US border, will they try and find a home elsewhere and similarly for Mexican goods and so on. I think in the US itself, tariffs will increase the price in the market. Some of it will be absorbed by the producer, but some of it will be passed on. If it is a one-time thing, I think the Fed will look through it because it's a one-time increase in prices. But if it's steady, if it creates more inefficiencies that create more inflation, if workers start demanding higher wages because they're protected from competition from the rest of the world, those could be sources of more steady higher inflation. So yes, it's inflationary, but maybe one-off and the Fed will look through it. But there could be a steady ramp up in inflation, in which case the Fed has to even more sort of stay with higher interest rates for longer.advertisementON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN INDIARahul Kanwal: There's a big debate in India about whether the dip that we've seen in economic growth in the second quarter of this fiscal. Is it a short-term phenomenon caused by the elections or caused by the pullback in capex because of the general elections or is this more cyclical? Where do you come out on this deeply contentious debate - short-term with an immediate recovery or more cyclical?Raghuram Rajan: Well, in one quarter, it's very hard to be assured that you have the right answer. But for some time, I have been worried about the strength of consumption, which has been less than normal over the last year, year-and-a-half and two years. What has instead compensated is infrastructure spending, which undoubtedly the government has been very successful in elevating growth rates.But of course, what was missing last quarter was infrastructure spending. So you could see that when that's taken off, the economy is weaker than we thought it was. The other component that's important to focus on is the weakness were earlier in the lower middle-class consumption and the consumption of the poor. Now you are seeing that the upper middle-class consumption has slowed down somewhat.So my sense is, broadly speaking, what is the reason for consumption slowing, especially when the stock market till recently was quite buoyant? It has to be concerns about the economic future, which means things like jobs. Do we have reasonable jobs? Are our children getting well employed? Do we feel confident enough about the future to spend?You can see a lot of spending was being supported by borrowing, the unsecured borrowing that the RBI cracked down on. So these are all signs that at the edges, all is not well. Now that doesn't mean we will plummet in terms of growth. I still think our baseline is about six, but six is not enough because we're not creating the jobs for those young people coming in.Rahul Kanwal: India's growth numbers demonstrate the dependence on government capital expenditure. We've been waiting for private investment to kickstart. Capacity utilisation has been in the mid-seventies, which is typically when you see a fresh investment cycle kickstart. It hasn't happened fully so far, even though the likes of Neelkanth Mishra and others say they can see some green shoes. What's your reading? Will we see a full-fledged investment cycle? Why is it being delayed? When does it start?Raghuram Rajan: It's been delayed for a long time, right? I mean when I was the governor eight years ago I used to worry about why investment isn't coming back on. There too, we were flirting with the 70s and 75. We said when it hits 75, it's going to come in, but it didn't quite come in. That's I think, is the big puzzle.Why is private industry not investing? Partly I mean, partly the answer is positive. It's because they've become more productive. They're using their capital better. But partly the answer is negative, that they're not sure of strong demand going forward and not preparing in time because you would think if they see demand down the line, they should be preparing well in advance and they don't seem to be.It's a big source of worry. It would be nice if that came on board. Maybe a part of the worry is also with Indian exports along with the tariff situation. But of course, the tariff situation is more like a post-US election. But, I do think this is a huge concern and a puzzle. I don't have a quick answer to why they are not doing it.ON INVESTMENT CLIMATE IN INDIARahul Kanwal: The Finance Ministry or RBI has been dealing with this situation where capacity utilisation has been in the mid 70s, despite the reduction in corporate taxes. Private investment hasn't really kick-started in a big way except for some green shoots in some sectors. What are your policy recommendations? How can we change that?Raghuram Rajan: As you know, investment is a lot about animal spirits. It's about the sense of edulience, the confidence that private industry has about the future and also involves a certain amount of risk-taking. I don't quite know if demand will be there, but let me invest.In fact, what happens is you get a virtuous circle because they invest, because they create jobs, there is a sense of confidence that permeates the economy and they invest. I would say in the early 2000s, in the previous government, you saw that confidence building up. When you talk to private industry, it was, ""We can beat the world."" I don't sense the same kind of confidence any more.It's no longer, ""We can beat the world, but we need protection against all those people who have support from the government."" We're talking again of industrial policy. We've talked about the PLI scheme before, but we need crutches. That wasn't the case in the early 2000s. So it seems to me that part of the answer is that private industry itself hasn't got that confidence to go out and invest which it needs.Now, I don't know if it is tax cuts. We've already cut the tax rate on private corporations quite a bit. I don't know if it's investment incentives, but it has to be more a sense that we can be world beaters. And that's disappeared for some reason.ON SKILL TAPPING IN INDIARahul Kanwal: Is there any way that can be changed? Because a lot of it is just spirits, right? You said animal spirits. Can any policy or nudge impact that?Raghuram Rajan: I think you can talk a good game as a politician and say we're going to grow. These are hard-bitten business people. Unless they see the underpinnings or they have these animal spirits from somewhere, it's going to be very hard to get them to put their money in the ground. So I mean, I think the government was doing what it could on the physical capital side, that is infrastructure spending. I wonder, and I've been saying this again and again, whether we can do more on the human capital side.Take the fact that right now I was meeting an NGO here. He was saying we've got all these bright poor children. We identified them. They're really smart. But they can't get into the IITs. They can't get into tech colleges. So we have a thin layer of very good schools and very good universities. Can we expand that?Because that's where we are getting our longer term sort of, the people who are going to these GCCs, the people who are going to create new jobs. So maybe it's to shift the focus of government spending. We talked about skilling in the last budget. I'd love to see how we are doing there, but we need to do far more.ON PLANS OF GOVERNMENT REDUCING INCOME TAXESRahul Kanwal: Some analysts have spoken about the possibility of bringing in a reduction in income tax rates as a means of creating more consumption, that this is the right opportune time. Would you recommend to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that on February 1, one of the things she should do to spur demand is to reduce income tax?Raghuram Rajan: It's not so much the tax rate I would worry about. I think our fiscal situation, though the government has spent a lot of time trying to keep it on track, is not that sound. I mean, fiscal situations have deteriorated all over the world. But when our nominal growth is where it is. Our debt starts becoming an issue with the kind of combined government and state and central fiscal deficit.Right now, those numbers are very comparable. How much growth do we have in the economy and how much our fiscal deficit is? This means that we don't have much room to expand spending without seeing debt grow much faster than we want.So I would say at this point, it's not so much on cutting taxes, as on spending in a more effective way. When we spend on a more effective way, I would say that focusing on increasing the quality of our human capital at every level. Whether it's the health of our children, reducing malnutrition, or improving the quality of primary schools, improving the quality of our universities.I think across the board, if we invest, we have a chance in the new economy of the future. If we don't invest, I think we're going to reach the point where we want to be a developed country without the human capital to do it. We may have reasonable infrastructure, but we need human capital, people of high caliber. With 1.4 billion people, that has to be our most important asset.ON JOB CREATION IN INDIARahul Kanwal: When we spoke last, the biggest concern was around rural consumption. Now, there's a lot of talk about urban distress.
In fact, some analysts have spoken about the middle-class shrinking. Some FMCG CEOs have spoken about it. We've got fund houses speaking about the great Indian middle-class shrinking. Your reading of the data around the spirits of the middle-class and whether middle class numbers and their consumption actually coming down?Raghuram Rajan: Again, a good time in the Indian economy was the early 2000s, when we saw a lot of reforms, but we also saw strong growth, but also spirits were strong. If you look at applications to the IAS, to the civil services, they were falling at that time.More recently, you see it going up significantly. Then you hear these horror stories about how many people apply for low-level railway jobs with PhDs and with MBAs and so on. I think that what we really are seeing is a lot of angst about job creation, good jobs, not any false job, but good jobs. It can't be all of the government (jobs).The government only has a limited number of jobs on its own. But even facilitating private sector jobs, what it can do is create the backbone for more jobs to be created. Take tourism, for example. It is very employment intensive. Can we do more to facilitate tourism? Just visas. I mean, my friend from China is an academic from Stanford. Why doesn't he get a visa to come in? Let's look at these nitty-gritty things.We want people to come from across the world to spend money in India, but you can take sector after sector. For instance, in plumbing, it's hard to find a good plumber in a city in India. Can we train more people in that? I think we can grow jobs. We have to accept that they aren't all going to be IAS, but they can be pretty good jobs.ON PRODUCTION-LINKED INCENTIVES Rahul Kanwal: One of the government's big ideas has been production-linked incentives, and we spoke about it the last time we had a conversation. It's been a mixed track record. In some sectors, for example, like mobile manufacturing and solar panels. We've seen some positives because of the PLI schemes, but on balance, what's your reading of the efficacy of PLIs when it comes to job creation?Raghuram Rajan: Well, I think what has happened is in a bunch of industries which are very capital-intensive. We haven't seen much job creation and where we've put enormous subsidies at play, for example, chips. I would say there's more of a concern that this is about national security than about creating a flourishing chip industry and creating jobs. I mean, chips are very capital intensive but it is not going to create many jobs.Rahul Kanwal: Do you think that's a bad idea?Raghuram Rajan: I think the kind of investment we're doing in manufacturing chips is that we're already designing chips. Should we put more money into creating more chip designers where there is a lot of added value? NVIDIA is worth over 3 trillion. TSMC, which makes the highest-value added chips, is about USD 750 billion on a good day. These are comparisons, but broadly speaking, manufacturing is not where the value added is. It's in the design, the intellectual property.That's where we have people who can actually, if trained up, make a difference. I saw a number that we have 3 lakh chip designers. We don't have a single chip manufacturing unit as yet. Should we be putting more value into chip design and maybe create our own version of NVIDIA? Hopefully, eventually.Rahul Kanwal: I spoke to Ashwini Vaishnav about this. The minister's argument is it's about building a full ecosystem. Also the fact that there is so much global uncertainty. We've seen the kind of norms the US has come out with recently under former President Joe Biden. We're seeing how China is pushing against Taiwan.And the dependence on companies like NVIDIA, dependence on companies like TSMC. So you have to start somewhere in the government's argument and build an ecosystem. Even if the chips being produced are far bigger and more outdated technologically, then you can't get to the cutting edge right away.Raghuram Rajan: So the issue is time and place to make that kind of investment, right? Right now, I think the real issue is do we have enough capability to train our people to the levels that are needed? We're building these chip factories. We can't get the engineers to actually construct them.We've got to get them from outside. But broadly, I would even disagree with the idea that we need the entire ecosystem in India. You know, ASML makes machines for chips in the Netherlands. There's no big chip manufacturer in the Netherlands. That's the kind of specialisation that is required in the world economy to be at the frontier.You can be the best machine maker in the world without having a chip industry. You can be the best foundry, as in Taiwan, but you don't have to have a chip designing this framework. Chip designers are all in the US.Can we build a chip design industry because our human capital is available? Let's invest more in our human capital. That would be my argument to something like we need the ecosystem. That said, I'm saying don't prevent any manufacturing. But, you know, think carefully when you're putting so much money in terms of subsidies because we're competing with the US.We're competing with Taiwan. Those guys are going to create a glut in chips sooner rather than later. Why not buy the chips when they create the glut? Yes, I understand there's a security rationale. By all means, to the extent that we need some of those chips for our military, let us buy them, create inventories and create surpluses. That'll be far cheaper than trying to make them.ON EMPLOYMENT-LINKED INCENTIVESRahul Kanwal: In the last budget, the government came out with employment-linked incentives. One year down, how do you see that play out? Should Nirmala Sitharaman double down on ELIs or is that not working out the way the government would have wanted?Raghuram Rajan: I think the broader issue of bringing people into work and training them on the job is extremely important, given we need jobs in any way we can get. I think that was a good idea. I think the skilling announcements that were made then are also good ideas. What I would love to see is careful monitoring of where we are and how it's working.This is not the Press Information Bureau giving us some numbers, which God only knows where they came from. But put out the numbers, let people do research on it, say, 'here is where we're doing well, here's where we're not doing so well'.A modern economy needs to run on the basis of careful data analysis. We're not even getting the data, let alone the analysis. I think if we are to do these things well, I mean, remember, we had a Skill India programme, which didn't really take off because a lot of people apparently were funded to actually do it, but the outcomes weren't that great.Rahul Kanwal: We have our own internship scheme with the big NSE listed companies. Do you think that's a good idea?Raghuram Rajan: I think all ideas are good until they've proven bad. Let's try it out. As I said, we need all the jobs we can. Let's try it out. But measure what happens just because you went into Hindustan Lever or L&T doesn't necessarily mean that you're employable. If the course you've got was terrible.On the other hand, you can go to a small entity and get a variety of experiences which make you very employable. So can we just measure? Are you employed for two years? We have the data, we can find the data. You know, do you pay income taxes two years from when you were trained? What is your job? What are you doing? You know, just track it.ON RUPEE VS DOLLAR SITUATIONRahul Kanwal: There is a new governor at the RBI. The Indian rupee has been depreciating. The last governor's thinking seems to have been to hold off on the depreciation. The new governor seems to have a slightly different thinking. What do you see as being the medium-term outlook for the rupee? To what extent should the rupee be allowed to depreciate, especially given the potential for a political backlash against the central government?Raghuram Rajan: So I think we have to be a lot more mature about the rupee-dollar exchange rate than public dialogue sometimes. 
First, if the dollar is appreciating vis-a-vis the euro, to hold it from appreciating vis-a-vis the rupee means that then we become uncompetitive in our exports to the euro or to anywhere else which is depreciating.So what you need to look at is across the basket of currencies is how we're doing. My sense is that pretty much every country has depreciated against the dollar. We haven't appreciated or depreciated against other currencies, but we have against the dollar. Since everybody's looking at the dollar, we look like we're doing badly. But if you look at the euro, it's closing on parity with respect to the dollar, which means quite a bit of decline over the last year. I won't worry too much.The exchange rate is a means for the economy to adjust to things like tariffs, things like the fact that capital is flowing into the US. So don't overreact to the rupee vs dollar.Rahul Kanwal: So what would be the natural exchange rate for the Indian rupee versus the dollar at this moment?Raghuram Rajan: I don't want to put a number out there. I think the RBI does these calculations, but others can also do it. What is the real effective exchange rate that we feel comfortable with? Which means taking down both the depreciation but also the inflation rate in India versus the rest of the world. I don't think we should hold the rupee at a level which is unsustainable.That just means wasting our foreign exchange reserves and we will need it at some point if things become more difficult in the global economy. So I would say, do what the RBI has always been doing, which is focus on reducing volatility, but don't try and determine what the level is. Let it move towards whatever level it has to move to keep the economy in balance.Rahul Kanwal: There has been some commentary about letting the rupee slide to a hundred rupees to a dollar, that being a more natural exchange rate at this moment given what is happening globally.Raghuram Rajan: I would not think that from what I know, I don't think 100 is the right place. I don't know exactly what is. What I would look at is, which I haven't done, look at the weighted exchange rate against other currencies as well as our inflation and make sure the real effective exchange rate hasn't crept up. That would make us uncomparative.It coming down too much would make it more comparative but would create the potential for some kind of volatility down the line. So I would say reasonable balance is to keep it fairly reasonable until tariffs hit. When tariffs start being imposed, if they are imposed against India, one of the answers is to let the rupee depreciate some.ON INFLATION IN INDIARahul Kanwal: The other question is about interest rates and the RBI's position on whether there should be a reduction or should it be held off. How would you view this question?Raghuram Rajan: I have never commented on RBI's monetary policy. I just commented peripherally on exchange rates. Look, I think the RBI has an inflation targeting regime. It has to feel comfortable that inflation is coming down and then it can cut rates.I think the problem in the economy to some extent is not supply. We seem to have a reasonable supply. You can see that in the core inflation numbers. They have been going at very moderate rates. The issue seems to be more demand. Now, of course, inflation has been high because of food, especially vegetables. I understand that's coming down. That may give the RBI more room. But, clearly what it has to do is keeping in mind the state of the economy and adjust monetary policy rates accordingly.Rahul Kanwal: What can be done to spur demand? There's a big budget. There's a monetary policy review as well. How should policymakers be spurring demand?Raghuram Rajan: Again, this goes back to something short term or is it something longer term? I think it's this confidence, not just in the industrialists, which we talked about earlier. It's also in people, in their futures. Yeah, politicians can make you feel that things are great. But if their daily lives aren't matching that, then they're going to cut back.I think you need to give them a greater sense that they will have better jobs. They will have better incomes. Then you will see the consumption pick up. That's why I'm saying this is not a temporary thing. I think we're seeing it exposed because infrastructure came down this time, and we focused on the growth numbers.But consumption has been more tepid relative to the past in recent times. I would say even post-pandemic. That would suggest something has broken. That, to my sense, is household confidence, which the way to repair it is to do much more on the job front, which is why I think the skilling, the apprenticeship, the trying to get incentives for job creation. All those are good.ON PLANS TO TAX ULTRA-RICH IN INDIARahul Kanwal: Thomas Piketty has spoken about the need for a wealth tax of 2 per cent on the ultra-rich in India. Do you think at this stage in India's economic journey that's a good idea? A lot of people are pushing back saying this wealth tax haven't worked elsewhere and that Piketty is completely wrong.Raghuram Rajan: Well, I think Piketty has been right about growing inequality across the world. Whether that's fixed through a huge or even a wealth tax. Part of the problem is the very rich also know how to get around taxes. I mean, it's very hard to see any place where wealth taxes get you a lot.There's a wealth tax in the US, 40-45 per cent of your wealth, you know, once it's beyond 20 million. Why aren't these billionaires unhappy? Why aren't they trying to change it? Because nobody is really going to be hit by it. They put it into various trusts and there's a whole lot of lawyerings that goes on, which ensures that the ultimate wealth tax that will be collected will be tiny.I think it may be a reasonable idea to collect more in taxes from wealthier people to try and generate more growth by the various spending that has to take place. But I am not sure that wealth taxes will do it for you. As far as other income taxes are, we are pretty high already.ON EASE OF DOING BUSINESS IN INDIARahul Kanwal: There's been a trend of high net worth individuals leaving India to go to Dubai, the UK and elsewhere. What would you recommend be done to try and change that? Why do you think that's happening? Can the government do something to try and change that?Raghuram Rajan: That's another issue that I should study more. What you hear is people are trying to establish multiple areas of residence and wealth so that they're more diversified against policy change wherever it happens. I don't know how big this is as a factor driving them.But I would try and create more incentives to bring money into India. So one of the big issues I hear from business people is the ease of doing business. We've talked a lot about it in India. But again and again, you hear horror stories of a tiny business easy to open.Once it's a big business, then I attract all the inspector raj, the tax authorities. Everybody's intent on making my life miserable. It's hard running a business in India even today despite the government's sort of focus on ease of doing business.Can we make it easier so that you say, 'oh look, there's all that demand that needs to be satisfied'. Let me invest and let me create more job opportunities for people. So I do think we need to create an environment which attracts investment, whether it be domestic or foreign.Published By: Prateek ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 22, 2025ALSO READ |  IMF's Gita Gopinath on Trump tariffs, impact on global growth, AI and moreMust Watch 
 Rahul Kanwal: There's a big debate in India about whether the dip that we've seen in economic growth in the second quarter of this fiscal. Is it a short-term phenomenon caused by the elections or caused by the pullback in capex because of the general elections or is this more cyclical? Where do you come out on this deeply contentious debate - short-term with an immediate recovery or more cyclical? Raghuram Rajan: Well, in one quarter, it's very hard to be assured that you have the right answer. But for some time, I have been worried about the strength of consumption, which has been less than normal over the last year, year-and-a-half and two years. What has instead compensated is infrastructure spending, which undoubtedly the government has been very successful in elevating growth rates. But of course, what was missing last quarter was infrastructure spending. So you could see that when that's taken off, the economy is weaker than we thought it was. The other component that's important to focus on is the weakness were earlier in the lower middle-class consumption and the consumption of the poor. Now you are seeing that the upper middle-class consumption has slowed down somewhat. So my sense is, broadly speaking, what is the reason for consumption slowing, especially when the stock market till recently was quite buoyant? It has to be concerns about the economic future, which means things like jobs. Do we have reasonable jobs? Are our children getting well employed? Do we feel confident enough about the future to spend? You can see a lot of spending was being supported by borrowing, the unsecured borrowing that the RBI cracked down on. So these are all signs that at the edges, all is not well. Now that doesn't mean we will plummet in terms of growth. I still think our baseline is about six, but six is not enough because we're not creating the jobs for those young people coming in. Rahul Kanwal: India's growth numbers demonstrate the dependence on government capital expenditure. We've been waiting for private investment to kickstart.

I don't sense the same kind of confidence any more. It's no longer, ""We can beat the world, but we need protection against all those people who have support from the government.""

Because that's where we are getting our longer term sort of, the people who are going to these GCCs, the people who are going to create new jobs. So maybe it's to shift the focus of government spending. We talked about skilling in the last budget.

It's in the design, the intellectual property. That's where we have people who can actually, if trained up, make a difference. I saw a number that we have 3 lakh chip designers. We don't have a single chip manufacturing unit as yet. Should we be putting more value into chip design and maybe create our own version of NVIDIA? Hopefully, eventually. Rahul Kanwal: I spoke to Ashwini Vaishnav about this. The minister's argument is it's about building a full ecosystem. Also the fact that there is so much global uncertainty. We've seen the kind of norms the US has come out with recently under former President Joe Biden. We're seeing how China is pushing against Taiwan. And the dependence on companies like NVIDIA, dependence on companies like TSMC. So you have to start somewhere in the government's argument and build an ecosystem. Even if the chips being produced are far bigger and more outdated technologically, then you can't get to the cutting edge right away. Raghuram Rajan: So the issue is time and place to make that kind of investment, right? Right now, I think the real issue is do we have enough capability to train our people to the levels that are needed? We're building these chip factories. We can't get the engineers to actually construct them. We've got to get them from outside. But broadly, I would even disagree with the idea that we need the entire ecosystem in India. You know, ASML makes machines for chips in the Netherlands. There's no big chip manufacturer in the Netherlands. That's the kind of specialisation that is required in the world economy to be at the frontier. You can be the best machine maker in the world without having a chip industry. You can be the best foundry, as in Taiwan, but you don't have to have a chip designing this framework. Chip designers are all in the US. Can we build a chip design industry because our human capital is available? Let's invest more in our human capital. That would be my argument to something like we need the ecosystem. That said, I'm saying don't prevent any manufacturing. But, you know, think carefully when you're putting so much money in terms of subsidies because we're competing with the US. We're competing with Taiwan. Those guys are going to create a glut in chips sooner rather than later. Why not buy the chips when they create the glut? Yes, I understand there's a security rationale. By all means, to the extent that we need some of those chips for our military, let us buy them, create inventories and create surpluses. That'll be far cheaper than trying to make them.ON EMPLOYMENT-LINKED INCENTIVES Rahul Kanwal: In the last budget, the government came out with employment-linked incentives. One year down, how do you see that play out? Should Nirmala Sitharaman double down on ELIs or is that not working out the way the government would have wanted? Raghuram Rajan: I think the broader issue of bringing people into work and training them on the job is extremely important, given we need jobs in any way we can get. I think that was a good idea. I think the skilling announcements that were made then are also good ideas. What I would love to see is careful monitoring of where we are and how it's working. This is not the Press Information Bureau giving us some numbers, which God only knows where they came from. But put out the numbers, let people do research on it, say, 'here is where we're doing well, here's where we're not doing so well'. A modern economy needs to run on the basis of careful data analysis. We're not even getting the data, let alone the analysis. I think if we are to do these things well, I mean, remember, we had a Skill India programme, which didn't really take off because a lot of people apparently were funded to actually do it, but the outcomes weren't that great. Rahul Kanwal: We have our own internship scheme with the big NSE listed companies. Do you think that's a good idea? Raghuram Rajan: I think all ideas are good until they've proven bad. Let's try it out. As I said, we need all the jobs we can. Let's try it out. But measure what happens just because you went into Hindustan Lever or L&T doesn't necessarily mean that you're employable. If the course you've got was terrible. On the other hand, you can go to a small entity and get a variety of experiences which make you very employable. So can we just measure? Are you employed for two years? We have the data, we can find the data. You know, do you pay income taxes two years from when you were trained? What is your job? What are you doing? You know, just track it.ON RUPEE VS DOLLAR SITUATION Rahul Kanwal: There is a new governor at the RBI. The Indian rupee has been depreciating. The last governor's thinking seems to have been to hold off on the depreciation. The new governor seems to have a slightly different thinking. What do you see as being the medium-term outlook for the rupee? To what extent should the rupee be allowed to depreciate, especially given the potential for a political backlash against the central government? Raghuram Rajan: So I think we have to be a lot more mature about the rupee-dollar exchange rate than public dialogue sometimes. 
First, if the dollar is appreciating vis-a-vis the euro, to hold it from appreciating vis-a-vis the rupee means that then we become uncompetitive in our exports to the euro or to anywhere else which is depreciating. So what you need to look at is across the basket of currencies is how we're doing. My sense is that pretty much every country has depreciated against the dollar. We haven't appreciated or depreciated against other currencies, but we have against the dollar. Since everybody's looking at the dollar, we look like we're doing badly. But if you look at the euro, it's closing on parity with respect to the dollar, which means quite a bit of decline over the last year. I won't worry too much. The exchange rate is a means for the economy to adjust to things like tariffs, things like the fact that capital is flowing into the US. So don't overreact to the rupee vs dollar. Rahul Kanwal: So what would be the natural exchange rate for the Indian rupee versus the dollar at this moment? Raghuram Rajan: I don't want to put a number out there. I think the RBI does these calculations, but others can also do it. What is the real effective exchange rate that we feel comfortable with? Which means taking down both the depreciation but also the inflation rate in India versus the rest of the world. I don't think we should hold the rupee at a level which is unsustainable. That just means wasting our foreign exchange reserves and we will need it at some point if things become more difficult in the global economy. So I would say, do what the RBI has always been doing, which is focus on reducing volatility, but don't try and determine what the level is. Let it move towards whatever level it has to move to keep the economy in balance. Rahul Kanwal: There has been some commentary about letting the rupee slide to a hundred rupees to a dollar, that being a more natural exchange rate at this moment given what is happening globally. Raghuram Rajan: I would not think that from what I know, I don't think 100 is the right place. I don't know exactly what is. What I would look at is, which I haven't done, look at the weighted exchange rate against other currencies as well as our inflation and make sure the real effective exchange rate hasn't crept up. That would make us uncomparative. It coming down too much would make it more comparative but would create the potential for some kind of volatility down the line. So I would say reasonable balance is to keep it fairly reasonable until tariffs hit. When tariffs start being imposed, if they are imposed against India, one of the answers is to let the rupee depreciate some.ON INFLATION IN INDIA Rahul Kanwal: The other question is about interest rates and the RBI's position on whether there should be a reduction or should it be held off. How would you view this question? Raghuram Rajan: I have never commented on RBI's monetary policy. I just commented peripherally on exchange rates. Look, I think the RBI has an inflation targeting regime. It has to feel comfortable that inflation is coming down and then it can cut rates. I think the problem in the economy to some extent is not supply. We seem to have a reasonable supply. You can see that in the core inflation numbers. They have been going at very moderate rates. The issue seems to be more demand. Now, of course, inflation has been high because of food, especially vegetables. I understand that's coming down. That may give the RBI more room. But, clearly what it has to do is keeping in mind the state of the economy and adjust monetary policy rates accordingly. Rahul Kanwal: What can be done to spur demand? There's a big budget. There's a monetary policy review as well. How should policymakers be spurring demand? Raghuram Rajan: Again, this goes back to something short term or is it something longer term? I think it's this confidence, not just in the industrialists, which we talked about earlier. It's also in people, in their futures. Yeah, politicians can make you feel that things are great. But if their daily lives aren't matching that, then they're going to cut back. I think you need to give them a greater sense that they will have better jobs. They will have better incomes. Then you will see the consumption pick up. That's why I'm saying this is not a temporary thing. I think we're seeing it exposed because infrastructure came down this time, and we focused on the growth numbers. But consumption has been more tepid relative to the past in recent times. I would say even post-pandemic. That would suggest something has broken. That, to my sense, is household confidence, which the way to repair it is to do much more on the job front, which is why I think the skilling, the apprenticeship, the trying to get incentives for job creation. All those are good.ON PLANS TO TAX ULTRA-RICH IN INDIA Rahul Kanwal: Thomas Piketty has spoken about the need for a wealth tax of 2 per cent on the ultra-rich in India. Do you think at this stage in India's economic journey that's a good idea? A lot of people are pushing back saying this wealth tax haven't worked elsewhere and that Piketty is completely wrong. Raghuram Rajan: Well, I think Piketty has been right about growing inequality across the world. Whether that's fixed through a huge or even a wealth tax. Part of the problem is the very rich also know how to get around taxes. I mean, it's very hard to see any place where wealth taxes get you a lot. There's a wealth tax in the US, 40-45 per cent of your wealth, you know, once it's beyond 20 million. Why aren't these billionaires unhappy? Why aren't they trying to change it? Because nobody is really going to be hit by it. They put it into various trusts and there's a whole lot of lawyerings that goes on, which ensures that the ultimate wealth tax that will be collected will be tiny. I think it may be a reasonable idea to collect more in taxes from wealthier people to try and generate more growth by the various spending that has to take place. But I am not sure that wealth taxes will do it for you. As far as other income taxes are, we are pretty high already.ON EASE OF DOING BUSINESS IN INDIA Rahul Kanwal: There's been a trend of high net worth individuals leaving India to go to Dubai, the UK and elsewhere. What would you recommend be done to try and change that? Why do you think that's happening? Can the government do something to try and change that? Raghuram Rajan: That's another issue that I should study more. What you hear is people are trying to establish multiple areas of residence and wealth so that they're more diversified against policy change wherever it happens. I don't know how big this is as a factor driving them. But I would try and create more incentives to bring money into India. So one of the big issues I hear from business people is the ease of doing business. We've talked a lot about it in India. But again and again, you hear horror stories of a tiny business easy to open. Once it's a big business, then I attract all the inspector raj, the tax authorities. Everybody's intent on making my life miserable. It's hard running a business in India even today despite the government's sort of focus on ease of doing business. Can we make it easier so that you say, 'oh look, there's all that demand that needs to be satisfied'. Let me invest and let me create more job opportunities for people. So I do think we need to create an environment which attracts investment, whether it be domestic or foreign.Published By: Prateek ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 22, 2025ALSO READ |  IMF's Gita Gopinath on Trump tariffs, impact on global growth, AI and moreMust Watch

Investors will be keeping a keen eye on the results as the stock of HDFC Bank has fallen 8.62% in the last month.  HDFC Bank shares closed marginally below, falling 0.33% at Rs 1,645.75 in the last trading session.  India's largest private sector lender is expected to report muted profit growth in its December quarter results, according to market analysts and brokerages. HDFC Bank might see net profit grow between 0-3%, with net interest income (NII) increasing by 6-8% year-on-year. Financial solutions and broking services firm Axis Securities projects HDFC Bank to report a 2.2% year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 16,737 crore for the December quarter compared with Rs 16,373 crore in the same quarter last year. Net interest income (NII) is expected to increase by 8.1% year-on-year, reaching Rs 30,778 crore compared to Rs 28,471 crore in the same period last year. Provisions are anticipated to rise 18.6% sequentially to Rs 3,203 crore from Rs 2,700 crore in the previous quarter, although this marks a 24% decline from Rs 4,217 crore in the corresponding period a year ago. The pre-provision operating profit is projected to stand at Rs 25,098 crore. ""Deposit growth was better than credit growth, LDR improved marginally; credit growth was significantly below the industry growth. Margins are likely to remain stable QoQ with a slight positive bias. Opex ratios are expected to remain steady. Slippages may remain under control. The management commentary on deposit accretion and resultant credit growth and Margin improvement trajectory will be watched,"" it said.  Sharekhan, another leading brokerage, points out that while deposit growth has been encouraging, lending hasn't kept pace with market trends. They forecast a slight dip in profits to Rs 16,264 crore. The bank's provision for bad loans might rise to Rs 3,203 crore, up 18.6% from the September quarter but significantly lower than last year's figure of Rs 4,217 crore, according to market estimates. Investors will closely monitor management comments on several key aspects during today's earnings announcement. Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) projects HDFC Bank's net profit to reach Rs 16,644 crore, marking a 1.7% year-on-year growth. The brokerage anticipates a 6.5% YoY increase in net interest income (NII) to Rs 30,335 crore. It also expects cost ratios to be well-managed and margins to remain largely steady. Nuvama's research suggests a marginal decline in net interest margins to 3.43% from last quarter's 3.46%. However, they remain more optimistic about profit growth, projecting a 3.2% increase to Rs 16,900 crore.

However, Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said that he is not worried about the reduction in tax rates but instead about the need for more effective government spending, particularly in human capital development. Speaking to India Today News Director Rahul Kanwal on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Rajan expressed concerns about India's fiscal situation. ""It's not so much the tax rate I would worry about. I think our fiscal situation, though the government has spent a lot of time trying to keep it on track, is not that sound,"" the former RBI governor said, while highlighting that fiscal situations have worsened globally. Rajan said that with current nominal growth rates, debt becomes a concern when considering the combined state and central fiscal deficits. ""Our debt starts becoming an issue with the kind of combined government and state and central fiscal deficit. Right now, those numbers are very comparable. We don't have much room to expand spending without seeing debt grow much faster than we want. So I would say at this point, it's not so much on cutting taxes, as on spending in a more effective way,"" he said.  Instead of tax cuts, Raghuram Rajan advocated for more targeted and effective government spending, particularly in developing human capital. ""When we spend in a more effective way, I would say that focusing on increasing the quality of our human capital at every level - whether it's the health of our children, reducing malnutrition, or improving the quality of primary schools, improving the quality of our universities,"" he said. The former RBI chief highlighted the importance of human capital in India's development journey.   ""If we invest, we have a chance in the new economy of the future. If we don't invest, I think we're going to reach the point where we want to be a developed country without the human capital to do it,"" he added.  Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday expressed strong concerns over newly-appointed US President Donald Trump's proposed tariff hikes. Rajan described the tariff hike plans as a ""big source of uncertainty"" that could disrupt global economic stability. These comments come ahead of the upcoming Union Budget, where experts have suggested the possibility of income tax rate cuts to boost consumption, which will induce growth.

The fall in Zomato’s share price comes after a period of strong gains as its profit in the third quarter dipped sharply to Rs 59 crore. While analysts did acknowledge the drop in net profit in Q3FY25, they remain bullish about the company’s quick commerce division, Blinkit.SHOULD YOU BUY OR AVOID?

Brokerage firms such as Nomura, Jefferies, and Bernstein are all optimistic about Zomato’s long-term growth potential. However, most of the brokerages said the near-term losses may be higher due to the rapid expansion of dark stores. It is also worth noting that brokerages such as Nuvama Institutional Equities and Jefferies have trimmed their target price on Zomato’s stock. ZOMATO Q3 PERFORMANCE

Trump, who took office on Monday, has pledged tariffs of 10% on global imports, 60% on Chinese goods and a 25% import surcharge on Canadian and Mexican products, Reuters reported. In the case of Canada and Mexico, Trump warned of imposing tariffs on these countries if they failed to stop illegal immigration into the US and crack down on drug cartels. Trump's pledge to implement a trade policy of 'tariff and tax' on other countries, also has implications for countries like India, which currently imposes tariffs on certain US products.HOW COULD TARIFFS IMPACT STOCK MARKETS?  The newly elected US President has not announced any tariffs on India, but how would Trump's tariff plans affect the stock market in India, if he actually did? ""After this Trump tariff war, India will be neutral on this front. The impact on India but the domestic centric sectors are going to insulate it. As far as tariffs are concerned, by and large, India's trade with the US is more concerned about IT services and also with respect to pharma, is concerned. IT is going to benefit because of the strength in the US economy. The impact of the tariffs on India in the medium to short term is going to be neutral, but we need to wait and watch how the actual tariffs are going to come in the coming days,"" said Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist, WealthMills Securities Pvt Ltd. ""One can look at stocks in defence, railways. These are the sectors one needs to keep on their watch list. And capital goods also. Investors can add on stocks names like BEML in the railway space, Afcon in the infrastructure and L&T for the medium to long term,"" he told India Today Digital, suggesting stocks that investors could add to their portfolio.  Donald Trump has also threatened BRICS nations with up to 100% tariffs over de-dollarisation.  Speaking to reporters upon assuming office, Trump said, “As a Brics nation, they'll face a 100% tariff if they so much as even think about doing what they thought, and therefore they will give it up immediately.” “If the Brics nations want to do that, that's okay, but we're going to put at least a 100% tariff on the business they do with the United States. It's not even a threat. In fact, since I made that statement, Biden said they have us over a barrel. I said, No, we have them over a barrel. And there's no way they're going to be able to do that.” Bathini, however, said that the newly elected President is focussed on countries like Canada, China, Canada, Brazil, tec and hence investors will have to wait and watch how the situation unfolds for India.

There could be a push to boost green jobs as well.,https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/budget-2025-3-things-government-can-do-to-tackle-climate-change-2668386-2025-01-22,"The government is expected to announce key measures to tackle climate change and boost green energy in the Union Budget 2025 to address rising concerns over environmental disasters. Experts who spoke to IndiaToday.in shared their expectations ahead of the budget, saying that climate action is the need of the hour. Announcements related to clean energy will be crucial, and there could be a push to boost green jobs as well.  Here are some key expectations from the government:FOCUS ON CLEAN ENERGY AND GREEN JOBS Manoj Bansal, Partner at Grant Thornton Bharat, said the government will be focused on meeting its climate goals while supporting development. He stressed that policies for clean energy and green technologies are important priorities and should find mention in the budget. “The budget may also include support for domestic carbon markets, set to launch next year. There is hope for incentives to encourage private companies to invest in climate solutions.” Green jobs, which focus on sustainability, clean energy, and eco-friendly practices, will also be in focus. Bansal wants the government to create more green jobs and industries.  “Collaboration between the government and industry is key. This budget could boost innovation, create green jobs, and help India move toward a low-carbon future while meeting global climate commitments,"" he added. REDUCE EMMISSIONS AND INCENTIVISE ESG FRAMEWORKS Other important expectations shared by experts were related to reducing carbon emissions and incentivising carbon accounting and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) frameworks.  Vivek Mehra, Co-founder & Chief Sustainability Officer, Onlygood.ai, said, ""With India’s commitments to reducing emissions intensity and creating significant carbon sinks, this budget could drive transformative changes across sectors.”  “Industries require incentives to adopt carbon accounting and ESG frameworks, ensuring compliance with emerging regulations and global climate goals. Measures to promote investment in cleaner technologies, renewable energy, and energy efficiency will be crucial,"" he added. Mehra further mentioned that clear carbon pricing mechanisms and developing voluntary carbon markets could further encourage industries to actively reduce their emissions. In other words, the upcoming Budget 2025 could go a long way in shaping the country’s low-carbon and sustainable future and at the same time, make efforts to accelerate the country’s journey towards climate leadership.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The decline in the company’s share price came a day after Q3FY25 results, where it reported a 43% rise in net profit to Rs 326 crore. While the life insurance company beat analysts’ estimates, shares of the company declined as brokerages only maintained a neutral stance. Analysts at Goldman Sachs maintained a ‘neutral’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 650, slightly lower than the earlier Rs 665. It acknowledged the company’s strong annual premium equivalent (APE) growth, but added that it came at the cost of margins. It also highlighted that the product mix has shifted towards lower-margin products, which is another negative factor. Brokerage firm Macquarie also maintained a ‘neutral’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 725. It said that the growth in value of new business (VNB) remains disappointing. It also estimated VNB margin of 23.9% in FY25E in comparison to 22.8% in the nine months of FY25. The brokerage further highlighted that it will be challenging for ICICI Prudential to sustain the VNB margin at current levels, despite new surrender rules taking effect from the second half of FY25. It also projected VNB Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for FY25-27E is 14%. Emkay Global also noted that the life insurance company reported weak performance for the nine months of FY25, especially mentioning the VNB margin of 22.8%. Other brokerages such as Nuvama and Antique Stock Broking also highlighted the lower-than-expected VNB margin, which remains a concern. At around 11:36 am, shares of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance were trading 7.73% lower at Rs 586.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 22, 2025

Though experts had earlier told IndiaToday.in that major tax relief measures are unlikely in the budget, taxpayers are still hoping for some incremental changes that will boost disposable income, given the fact that the government is also looking to boost consumption. Akhil Chandna, Partner at Grant Thornton Bharat, said that ""new tax incentives for affordable housing could offer relief to first-time homebuyers and stimulate the real estate sector."" The country’s vast middle-class population is also calling for the inclusion of tax-saving provisions and deductions under the new income tax regime. At present, the new income tax regime comes with lower tax slabs and a standard deduction of Rs 75,000, which is Rs 25,000 more than the old regime’s Rs 50,000. However, the new regime still lacks the benefit of key deductions that make the old regime so popular amongst salaried taxpayers in the country, especially those with home loans. The government can also look at rationalising capital gains taxation, as it will not only provide a boost to investors but also the broader economy. But that looks unlikely given the fact that an announcement on this was made in the previous budget. Pranav Haridasan, MD and CEO, Axis Securities, said, ""Taxation expectations are centered around rationalising capital gains tax to simplify compliance and encourage broader market participation.” While there has been some speculation about a cut in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), Haridasan said this seems unlikely given the government’s focus on revenue. “Instead, there could be targeted relief for individual taxpayers through higher deductions under section 80C and potential adjustments in the new tax regime to support consumption,” he added.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Tune InMust Watch

With the Union Budget presentation on February 1, the financial services sector remains under the spotlight. Several experts told IndiaToday.in that they will watch out for announcements such as a better digital lending ecosystem along with an increased focus on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Firstly, experts have called for increased access to financial services, which would be crucial for accelerating economic growth. Yashoraj Tyagi, CEO, CASHe, said, “The lending sector expects some major changes in the upcoming Union Budget. Increased credit fraud, limited access to customer protection tools and cyber scams have temporarily disrupted the digital lending ecosystem.” He added, “This year's budget presents opportunities to introduce policies that can strengthen digital infrastructure and enhance access to financial services.” Shikhar Aggarwal, Chairman of BLS E-Services explained, “The Indian government has been actively promoting financial inclusion, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. These efforts aim to integrate underserved populations into the formal financial system, providing them with access to essential financial services.” Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) play an important role in an economy as they fill the gap between the conventional banking system and the underserved sectors of the country. Thomas John Muthoot, Chairman of Muthoot Pappachan Group noted, “Approve dedicated credit lines for NBFCs from banks to facilitate seamless digital lending to micro-retailers, addressing credit gaps in underserved sectors and promoting financial inclusion.” This would accelerate economic participation from the rural sectors, which in turn would contribute to the nation’s overall growth and development. Experts have also called for the adoption of policies that support digital literacy and strengthen the nation’s digital financial ecosystem, thus creating a more effective and secure financial environment. Dilip Modi, Founder and CEO, Spice Money said, “As we look forward to the Union Budget 2025-26, it is imperative to prioritise measures that strengthen the digital financial ecosystem, particularly in rural India, where initiatives like Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) and Bharat Connect have become lifelines for millions.”Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Tune InMust Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/tcs-wipro-infosys-why-are-it-stocks-rose-today-despite-high-market-volatility-2668498-2025-01-22,"On a day when most sectors are struggling on Dalal Street, information technology (IT) stocks defied the odds to register strong gains. In fact, gains in heavyweight stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCLTech played a big role in providing support to the benchmark indices after they suffered a massive crash in the previous session. TCS shares were up 3.04% to Rs 4,158.45 at 3:00 pm, Wipro gained 3.37% to trade at Rs 308.40, and Infosys jumped 3.11% to Rs 1,856.70. Most other IT stocks such as HCLTech, Tech Mahindra were also trading 1-3% higher during the session despite rising volatility and negative sentiments on the stock market. And this was reflected in the Nifty IT index, which rose over 2%.WHY DID IT STOCKS GAIN TODAY? IT stocks are trading in positive territory today due to a mix of positive developments. For starters, US President Donald Trump did not go for stringent tariff measures right after he returned to White House. While it has led to some volatility in global markets, it seems to have provided temporary relief to IT firms. Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said that the stock markets may have taken Trump’s tariff threat too seriously. Trump’s orders and announcements have been disruptive so far, but he has steered away from announcing tariffs like he had stated before. Other than that, IT stocks also benefitted from gains in US markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.24% higher, while Nasdaq Composite also rose 0.64%. This was another factor behind the positive performance of IT stocks on Dalal Street. Positive Q3 results from IT companies have also contributed to today’s rally. Large-cap IT companies such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro have delivered strong Q3 results, and the same is expected from Coforge and Persistent Systems today.

The Sensex settled 566.63 points higher at 76,404.99, while the Nifty50 rose 130.70 points to end at 23,155.35. The biggest gainers during the session were IT stocks, with the Nifty IT index rising 2.14%, the highest among all other sectoral indices. Even as volatility eroded gains across most sectors, IT heavyweights such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech and Tech Mahindra registered strong gains. According to experts, IT stocks benefitted from the overnight rally on Wall Street and also no immediate action by US President Donald Trump on his tariff threats. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, ""The IT sector led gains, recovering from recent losses. Apart from Banking and IT, most sectors posted losses, with the realty sector being the hardest hit for consecutive days."" Other than that, positive Q3 momentum of IT companies also helped in today’s rally, with two big companies – Coforge and Persistent Systems – set to report third quarter results today. Despite today’s gains, which came during the last hour of trading, the situation remains volatile on Dalal Street. However, some analysts are of the view that the ongoing correction provides an opportunity to investors to accumulate specific large-cap stocks that have been performing well, and are expected to gain in the long term.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Must Watch

In fact, several credit card issuers offer the option of converting your bills into Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs), thereby providing immediate relief. But will it impact your credit score and financial health? Let us understand in this article. Credit card users can opt for smaller, monthly instalments spread over a fixed period instead of paying the entire purchase amount in one go. However, while using this option, one needs to pay the processing fees as well as the interest charges.advertisementWILL IT IMPACT CREDIT SCORESwitching to EMI will not have an adverse effect on your credit score as the lender considers it a structured repayment strategy. However, the impact on your score depends on how well you manage the EMIs. Switching to EMI will not have an adverse effect on your credit score as the lender considers it a structured repayment strategy. However, the impact on your score depends on how well you manage the EMIs. Timely payments can improve your credit score over a period of time, thus, giving a boost to your creditworthiness. However, any default or delay in the EMI payment can impact your credit score adversely.WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF EMI CONVERSION Interestingly, converting credit card bills into EMIs comes with both benefits and drawbacks. It offers immediate relief by breaking big payments into smaller and manageable amounts. Also, the interest rates on EMIs are usually lower than the charges on unpaid balances when only a minimum amount is paid. Moreover, giving a fixed monthly payment makes it much easier to plan your finances. On the contrary, EMIs come with an extra cost, including interest and processing fees.  Missing or not paying EMIs regularly can impact your credit score.   In other words, converting your credit card bill into EMIs requires careful planning and regular monthly repayments.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Trending Reel

Now that Trump has been sworn in as the 47th US President, governments across the world are on the lookout for ways to deal with the tariff threat.  The Indian government is considering options such as reducing tariffs, trade deals, and importing more goods from the US to negate the tariff threat if it becomes a reality, reported Bloomberg.  The government is evaluating options to counter any trade actions a new US administration may take and officials have drawn out multiple scenarios to address a potential widening of India's $35.3 billion trade surplus with the US, as per sources cited in the report. Among the possibilities are boosting purchases of US whiskey, steel, and oil, as well as lowering tariffs on products like bourbon and pecan nuts. India was the US's largest trading partner last financial year, data from India's commerce ministry shows. The government is planning to reduce duties on the goods that are imported to India which are of political importance to the Republican Party, said the report citing one of the sources.  The government is looking to avoid any direct confrontation with the US while also positioning itself to capitalise on any opportunities arising from the US-China trade war. Bloomberg had earlier reported that the PM Modi-led government is planning to take back at least 18,000 illegal Indian immigrants from the US as a strategy to help pacify the Trump tariff threat.  India has always been open to the legitimate return of undocumented Indians to their country, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday, noting that New Delhi is still in the process of verifying those from the US who can be deported to India and the number of such individuals cannot be determined yet. ""As a government, we are obviously very much supportive of legal mobility because we do believe in a global workplace. We want Indian talent and Indian skills to have the maximum opportunity at the global level. At the same time, we are also very firmly opposed to illegal mobility and illegal migration,"" Jaishankar told a group of Indian reporters in the US. The minister was responding to a query on news reports that India is working with the Trump administration for the deportation of some 1,80,000 Indians in the US who are either undocumented, or have overstayed their visas.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 23, 2025

80fa3ea7-be59-4a0d-a4c9-ef5de273cc15,Explained: Why HUL share price fell in early trade today HUL Stock price fell over 3% in early trade as investors reacted negatively to its Q3 results despite a 19% rise in net profit.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/hul-share-price-falls-q3-results-brokerage-views-key-reasons-explained-2668905-2025-01-23,"Shares of FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) fell in early trade on Thursday after the company reported as investors reacted to its third quarter results. HUL shares fell over 3% during intraday trade and were trading 1.40% lower at Rs 2,310.10 at around 10:09 am. On Wednesday, the company reported a 19% rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,989 crore, aided by the sale of its Pureit business. In the same quarter last year, the company had posted a net profit of Rs 2,508 crore. The company’s consolidated revenue stood at Rs 15,559 crore during the quarter, slightly lower than Rs 15,259 crore in the same period last year. Following the Q3 results, analysts and brokerages have shared mixed views on HUL’s stock. Brokerage firm ICICI Securities cut target price to Rs 2,500 from the previous Rs 2,950. While it continues to maintain an ‘Add’ rating on the stock, the brokerage firm has reduced its earnings estimates for HUL to 6%/8% for FY25E/FY26E largely. ""Though HUL is taking strategic actions to contemporise these mass brands along with a portfolio shift towards premium in beauty with the announcement of the acquisition of a Minimalist at a pre-money enterprise value of Rs 3,000 crore, implying a valuation of 6x EV/sales, time period during this transformation is likely to be tough for their growth performance given the macroeconomic context,"" noted ICICI Securities. Mehul Desai from brokerage firm JM Financial said in a post-earnings note that HUL’s earnings print was “below our muted expectation”. “Key negative was flat UVG (on low base) impacted by weaker mix – a function of higher growth in smaller packs (downtrading and slowdown in urban) and Home Care business (which has lower realisation/tonne),” Desai noted. ""Near-term outlook remains challenging – Urban slowdown & weaker mix likely to continue. Although management believes the latter is more transient in nature and doesn’t expect trends to worsen from current levels. The pace of recovery will be contingent on how macro factors (food inflation, real wage growth, etc.) shape up,” JM Financial’s post-earnings note added. The brokerage also noted that the stock is likely to remain under pressure owing to a lack of visibility on double-digit earnings growth. “Valuations below LT avg. provides some cushion to downside. We cut estimate by c.3-4% and multiple to 50x (vs 53x earlier), retain ‘BUY’ with revised target price of Rs 2,600 (earlier INR Rs 2,807),” the brokerage note said. On the other hand, Akriti Mehrotra, Research Analyst, StoxBox, said, “Hindustan Unilever Limited reported a subdued performance in Q3FY25, with key metrics declining due to moderating demand in the FMCG sector, particularly from urban consumption.” Mehrotra said while rural markets are gradually recovering, volume growth across segments remained low to negative, impacted by inflation and stiff competition. “HUL strategically focuses on growth areas, combined with easing consumer price inflation and expected improvements in rural wages, positioning HUL favourably for future demand recovery,” she explained. “Additionally, the company's current valuation remains attractive compared to historical averages, suggesting the potential for medium- to long-term recovery. We will closely monitor the gradual recovery in consumer demand moving forward,” Mehrotra said. However, brokerages such as Goldman Sachs and CLSA indicated in their research notes that the company could face margin pressure due to weak near-term demand. HUL’s Q3 results therefore signal a more concerning picture for the entire FMCG sector too.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 23, 2025

During the interview, Martin Wolf talks about Trump’s leadership approach and how he is an unpredictable person. He said, “Trump is an unpredictable person. He could be a best buddy of you one day and you're out the following day.” Citing Elon Musk's immense popularity across the globe, Wolf says that the long-term stability of Trump- Musk alliance seems doubtful. He noted, “I've tended to assume there will be a blow up because Trump blows up with everybody, Musk, sort of overshadowing him. But Trump may field, this guy's so big and so successful, so much richer than I am that I have to genuflect to him.” Wolf also shared his stance on US economic policies under the Trump administration and said that deregulation and aggressive fiscal policies might overheat the already well-performing US economy. “It's very plausible that inflation will return and, obviously, the Fed is a bit concerned about that already. That could mean higher interest rates, and then you'll have 2 risks. Higher interest rates could slow the economy rather dramatically, but that may be less likely than that you get a you can get real financial tensions,” Wolf explained. He further added, “US will remain a hyper capitalist society.” When asked about how Trump views BRICS, Wolf mentioned that Trump hates countries getting together against the US. “He sees the BRICS as a vehicle for Russian and bubble Chinese power and influence. And the more they coordinate because together they're big, the more it weakens the American position. So he wants to fragment these.” Wolf explained.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Tune InMust Watch

He has even threatened to impose a 100% tariff on BRICS nations, including India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/donald-trump-us-tariff-threat-china-brics-europen-union-mexico-canada-bluff-or-reality-2669016-2025-01-23,"Over the past few days, global markets have been on the edge as uncertainty rises over US President Donald Trump’s plans to impose trade tariffs on some countries. The question now is whether Trump’s tariff threats are genuine or merely a strategic bluff. Trump has been vocal about imposing 10% tariffs on imports from China, 25% on neighbouring Mexico and Canada, and the European Union (EU). He has even threatened to impose a 100% tariff on BRICS nations, including India. The 78-year-old had vowed to implement his tariff plans immediately after taking office, but, interestingly, that hasn’t happened yet. And although Trump recently said his administration was aiming to introduce the tariffs on February 1, the delay has got many experts thinking: Will Trump risk a full-blown global disruption by hitting important nations with trade tariffs?REALITY OR BLUFF? Going by what global economists and experts are saying, Trump is in “wait and watch mode” and may aim for a more transactional approach, eying favourable deals on immigration and other fronts. For instance, World Economic Forum President Borge Brende exclusively told India Today that Donald Trump is a dealmaker, suggesting that the US President could be using tariffs as a strategy to gain leverage. “Sometimes they (the US) put tariffs out there and see what happens down the road,” Brende said. In fact, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro recently told CNBC that Trump’s tariff threat on Canada and Mexico was solely to pressure the two countries to stop illegal migrants and illicit drugs from entering the US. And Trump’s recent tariff threat against the EU suggests that he wants to strike better deals rather than impose any actual tariffs. ""The European Union is very, very bad to us,"" Trump said. ""So they're going to be in for tariffs. It's the only way ... you're going to get fairness,” he added.TRUMP'S UNPREDICTIBILITY  However, economists have also not gone ahead to say clearly that Donald Trump is bluffing, thanks to his sheer unpredictability. Given the fact that Donald Trump actually believes that hitting other countries with tariffs will actually be good for the US economy, the situation remains not only unpredictable but critical for the global economy. Kranthi Bathini, Director, Equity Strategy, WealthMills Securities, said, “President Trump's statements have been creating tremors across the globe and leading to uncertainty with respect to trade across the globe.” Bathini noted how Donald Trump's statements, like the one where he said tariff is the “most beautiful word in the dictionary,"" have added to fears in global markets. IMPACT OF TRADE TARIFFS  Experts have already warned that the planned tariffs could blow out into a full-blown trade war, triggering a negative impact on all nations. The tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China during his first term led to severe disruptions, and the effects are bound to be more pronounced this time with the global economy going through a slowdown. The fallout of a trade war could be high inflation, losses across global stock markets, and possible recessions in several countries. And this could be the reason why the Trump administration is weighing its options before announcing any concrete tariffs.IS INDIA AT RISK FROM TRUMP TARIFFS? Many global experts have stated that India is not directly at risk if Donald Trump does decide to go ahead with his tariff action. Kranthi Bathini also made an important point. He noted that trades are bilateral agreements between two countries, where both parties are looking for the best deal. “President Trump is making deliberate statements, mostly targeting countries like China, Brazil, and Canada, where the US has larger bilateral trades, and they are happening in favour of these countries,” Bathini explained. “With respect to India, our bilateral trade is limited at this point in time in terms of the exchange of goods,” he said, indicating that the impact of tariffs on India will be limited.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 23, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The pharma company's shares tanked up to 6% in early trade, and at around 9:46 am, they were trading 4.35% lower at Rs 1,233.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The drop in the company's share price came despite earnings managing to marginally beat street expectations. It's worth noting that the concerns largely centered on declining revenue from Revlimid, which is a cancer drug that has been a strong growth driver for the company in recent years. Revlimid’s revenue contribution has slowly started declining, with its patent expiry set for January 2026. This means Dr Reddy's will need to find new revenue streams soon. Another factor that led to today's decline was the drug's shrinking margins.  While the management outlined long-term growth strategies, analysts remained divided on their future strategy.WHAT DO BROKERAGES SAY?  Analysts at brokerage firm HSBC said they remain cautious about Dr Reddy's. While the launch of Semaglutide in Canada in early 2026 might provide some relief, HSBC said it may not be enough to fully compensate for the anticipated loss of Revlimid revenue. The brokerage maintained a ‘Hold’ rating with a price target of Rs 1,250. Nuvama Institutional Equities shared a more optimistic view, adding that a combination of Abatacept and Semaglutide could help the company retain a big chunk of its Revlimid earnings. The brokerage reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a price target of Rs 1,533. Meanwhile, JM Financial pointed out that the market may be underestimating Semaglutide’s potential. With its launch slated for Canada and 18 other markets by CY26, JM Financial sees Dr Reddy’s as well-positioned among generic players to capitalise on this opportunity. The brokerage set a target price of Rs 1,753 on Dr Reddy's stock. Dr Reddy’s Q3 Results For the October-December quarter, Dr Reddy’s reported a 2% year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 1,413 crore.

The S&P BSE Sensex was up 204.76 points to 76,725.14 at 9:17 am, while the NSE Nify50 was trading 64.15 points higher at 23,269.50. The other broader market indices were trading marginally higher as high volatility continued to keep investors on the edge. While most of the Nifty sectoral indices were trading in positive territory, none registered a big gain in early trade. On the other hand, Nifty Pharma was down over 1.5%. The top gainers on the Nifty50 were BPCL, Powergrid, Shriram Finance, Coal India, NTPC and Tata Steel. Pharma stocks such as Dr Reddy’s, Apollo Hospitals, Sun Pharma, Cipla were among the top losers. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said, “Nifty may face a volatile session today, with a strong chance of closing below the psychological 23000 mark as uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s tariff plans persists.” “Technically, Nifty is trading well below its 200-day moving average of 23982, and a bearish pattern continues to emerge on the daily charts. Major headwinds include record outflows from Foreign Institutional Investors, amounting to Rs. 66,321.70 crores this January, and ongoing tariff threats,” he added. He advised market investors to keep an eye on key upcoming events, like the FOMC meeting and the Union Budget as they can influence market direction. “Among stocks, UltraTech Cement surged 7% despite a 17% profit decline, while KEI Industries reported strong earnings. Also, watch out for Q3 results from JSW Steel, DLF, and Indigo today,” he added. Meanwhile, Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, indicated that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) will continue to sell, putting pressure on large-cap banking stocks. “The irrationality in the market characterised by fair and even low valuations for largecaps like banking and excessive valuations in the broader market will have to reverse at some point of time. But we don’t know when that will happen,” Vijayakumar said. “The Q3 results of IT companies and the management commentary indicating improving prospects for the sector suggest that the sector is a safe bet now,” he added.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Must Watch

Volatility has been a recurring feature in the past few days owing to various developments across the globe.  The same trend was witnessed today as well. The Sensex and Nifty opened marginally higher but rose quickly within a few minutes, only to come down later and gain again. Sensex scaled to 76,985.95, reaching the day's high, a jump of over 500 points, but was trading at 76,621.03 as of 1 PM. Nifty has also gone about in the same manner.  Kranthi Bathini, equity strategist at WealthMills Securities Pvt Ltd said that the Indian markets are going through a roller-coaster ride.WHAT IS CAUSING MARKET VOLATILITY? ""Foreign portfolio investors continue to be net sellers from the last fortnight. So that's creating some kind of extra volatility coupled with the global, cues,"" said Bathini.  He further explained that India Inc's Q3 results for FY25 have not been enticing the market, which has led to a roller-coaster ride for the stock market.  ""The big major event for Indian markets going ahead is the budget which is scheduled on February 1. And, and the other event is the Monetary Policy Committee meeting in the first week of February. These are the big events for the market. But due to the budget, markets are rangebound at this point of time in consolidation,"" said Bathini.  ""Even though headline indices are in positive territory, we are witnessing some kind of profit booking in them. Mid cap space is concerned. So, overall, Indian markets are in a consolidation phase. And ahead of the budget, some kind of extra volatility is getting created in the markets,"" he added.  Amid this turbulence, one sector has emerged as a steady anchor and has provided support; IT stocks. While the broader markets have been hit by global uncertainties and weak sentiment, the resilience of IT giants has been the only silver lining. But with this unpredictability, should you be worried about your investments?  ""As far as long term investors are concerned, any dip in the Indian market is a good opportunity for investors who want to invest for a time horizon of more than 1 year,"" said Bathini.

2c33091e-c6dc-4469-974a-00af4a37353e,Budget 2025: EV sector pushes for tech investments and smart mobility solutionsExperts anticipate that Budget 2025 would introduce policies that would boost EV sales across the country and help India achieve its goal of reducing carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030.  ,https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/budget-2025-ev-sector-expectations-expansion-of-charging-stations-boost-ev-sales-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-2669565-2025-01-24,"As the unveiling of Budget 2025 approaches, the country’s electric vehicle (EV) sector is hopeful for measures and initiatives to make EVs more affordable and accessible to consumers. Industry leaders and experts anticipate that this budget would introduce policies that would accelerate EV adoption across the country, and help India achieve its goal of reducing carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030.   Akshit Bansal, Founder & CEO, Statiq urged the expansion of EVs for broader penetration across the Tier II cities. “To facilitate this transition, robust infrastructure is paramount, particularly in the form of widespread EV charging stations. Establishing a reliable charging network will instil trust amongst consumers and encourage greater adoption of electric vehicles,” he said. Bansal also suggested the need to convert heavy commercial vehicles to eco-friendly alternatives to address the issue of growing pollution in cities. Ishaan Parwanda, Director, Trinity Touch suggested lowering GST rates on lithium-ion batteries to boost EV sales. “Measures such as reducing the GST on EV batteries, upgrading the infrastructure status for charging stations, and implementing performance-linked incentives for manufacturing are essential. These steps would make the EV market more affordable and accessible to a broader audience,” he mentioned. “There is an urgent need to focus on the domestic production of key EV components, rather than relying on imports. Promoting Atmanirbhar Bharat by introducing special Production Linked Incentives (PLI) and incentives for manufacturing EV components will boost production, reduce the cost of EV vehicles, and make them more affordable for Indian consumers. Such measures will not only advance the EV sector but also position India as a leader in sustainable mobility,” Parwanda said. Furthermore, experts believe that technology development will play a key role in driving the growth of the EV ecosystem in India. Raghav Arora, Co-Founder & CTO, Statiq suggested leveraging the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), to optimise charging networks and improve battery efficiency. “Innovations in battery technology, charging infrastructure, and smart mobility solutions are essential to overcoming existing challenges and enhancing the overall EV experience,” he said. “We hope that the upcoming budget will prioritise investments in technology-driven initiatives that support startups and established players alike in their quest to innovate within the EV space. This focus on technological advancement is crucial for positioning India as a global leader in sustainable mobility,” Arora added.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Tune InMust Watch

In a conversation with India Today News Director Rahul Kanwal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zakaria said, ""It does seem to be stuck in the middle income trap. You know, the number of countries that have made it past the middle-income trap to first-world status are very few. Japan, Korea, maybe you could say Malaysia is getting on the way, Chile in Latin America, Israel. That's it."" Zakaria also said that China's economy ""is not going to grow any time at the six, seven, eight percent that was growing at."" He mentioned poor private sector and consumer sentiment as short-term issues, but warned of larger structural problems especially in President Xi Jinping's policy shifts. ""Xi's philosophy has been a turn away from the model that frankly made China rich, which was to unleash the private sector, unleash openness, innovation,"" he explained. He highlighted China's crackdown on tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent as examples of the government's shift towards a ""government-led, government-first policy."" ""Xi wants China to do very well in artificial intelligence. But how is America doing well in artificial intelligence? By allowing companies like Google and Amazon and Meta and Microsoft to scale up, and become what they call these hyperscalers, have massive capacity. What China is doing is they're killing Alibaba and Tencent and Baidu, their equivalents of those great internet digital companies,"" he said.  Zakaria said that it departs from the private sector-driven growth that propelled China's rapid development, where companies were allowed to ""scale up"" and become ""hyperscalers"" similar to Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in the US.  He mentioned the need for India to learn from China's experience as it walks its own path towards higher-income status. Regarding the broader implications, Zakaria cautioned that China's economic troubles could complicate its geopolitical calculus, including its dealings with the US under the Trump administration. He noted that China's economic slowdown comes at a time of increased global uncertainty and trade tensions.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Must Watch

Details hereThe higher the credit score, the greater are the chances for the approval of your loan requests.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/minimum-credit-score-for-getting-personal-loan-check-details-here-2669673-2025-01-24,"Rahul, a 30-year-old budding entrepreneur, faced rejection when he applied for a personal loan to start his business. The reason for rejection? His credit score was low. Like Rahul, thousands of people face similar rejections when applying for a personal loan without realising how important it is to have a good credit score when securing a personal loan. So, in this article we will talk about what a credit score is and how you can improve it to secure a personal loan.advertisementWHAT IS A CREDIT SCORE? A credit score is an indicator of your creditworthiness and tells how consistent you are with repaying your loans and debts. It is a three-digit number usually ranging from 300 to 850. Lenders take into account credit scores to assess the probability of you repaying loans on time. The higher the credit score, the greater are the chances for the approval of your loan requests. In India, there are four credit bureaus that generate credit scores for individuals. They are - Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL), CRIF Highmark, Equifax, and Experian. Usually, a credit score of 700 and above is considered good for securing a personal loan, while a credit score of 750 and above is considered an excellent score to get a personal loan with attractive interest rates. Hence, maintaining a good credit score is essential for those individuals who are planning to apply for a personal loan. Now, let us look at some common tips to ensure that your credit score remains high. To begin, monitor your credit report regularly. In the event of any discrepancy or error, report the same to the credit information company like CRIF Highmark. Further, maintaining a low credit utilisation ratio (CUR) reflects responsible financial behaviour. Pay your credit card bills regularly and on time. Avoid paying the minimum due amount, as this could negatively impact your creditworthiness in the long run.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Must Watch

Find out how The fitment factor plays an important role in calculating the updated pay and benefits and is likely to be in the range between 2.28 and 2.86 for the 8th Pay Commission.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/8th-pay-commission-fitment-factor-186-percent-hike-in-monthly-pensions-find-out-how-2669984-2025-01-25,"Many in their professional career want to have a relaxed retired life. Imagine you have put in decades of hard work and upon retiring you find that the pension you are getting is hardly covering the rising cost of living and inflationary trends. For several central government employees, this has been the case for years. But the announcement of the 8th Pay Commission which is set to be implemented from January 1, next year, promises to bring the much-needed relief for the lakhs of central government employees and retirees. One of the highly anticipated changes is the fitment factor which plays an important role in calculating the updated pay and benefits. As per various media reports, the fitment factor for the 8th Pay Commission is likely to be in the range of 2.28 and 2.86. If the fitment factor is considered at the higher side, i.e. at 2.86, it could result in a rise in monthly pensions. As of now, under the existing system, Rs 9000 is the minimum monthly pension and, on the other hand, the maximum pension amount is capped at Rs 1,25,000. Now, with the introduction of the 8th Pay Commission and the projected fitment factor being 2.86, the minimum pension would hike to Rs 25,740, which is, a surge of 186%. Moreover, the maximum monthly pension might exceed Rs 3,57,500. Apart from this, the 8th Pay Commission may also witness a revision in other pensionary benefits, which would include, Dearness Relief (DR), gratuity limits and family pensions, which aim to further improve the financial well-coming of retirees and maintain their standard of living amid inflationary pressures.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 25, 2025

Dr. Manoranjan Sharma, Chief Economist, Infomerics Ratings has pointed out several areas where the middle-class household may benefit. “Taxes for individuals in the Rs 3 lakh – Rs 7 lakh tax slab under the new tax regime could be reduced. Further, the exemption limit under this regime could be raised beyond Rs 3 lakh. Also, given high inflation and the compelling need to shore up consumption, the government may provide some relief to taxpayers in the Rs 10 lakh – Rs 15 lakh income tax slab,” he said. Meanwhile, Vivek Jalan - Partner Tax Connect Advisory Services LLP, suggested doing away with the old tax regime and streamlining the new one. “Scrapping the Old Regime totally and rationalising the Income Tax slabs under the new regime – It is a fact that today under the new tax regime, Income Tax has become simpler. Further an exemption of Rs 7 lakh means that taxpayers have to pay NIL tax on the same level of income where they were previously taxed. Hence, the Government should consider and make the new regime the only regime as the Income Tax Act goes for a comprehensive review on 1st Feb 2025,” he said. Sharma hinted that retirement savings might get a boost in this upcoming budget announcement. “The tax-free limit for investments in the National Pension System (NPS) could be hiked from the present limit of Rs 50,000 and withdrawal rules made more flexible. This would help taxpayers enhance their retirement savings,” he mentioned. “Complementary measures such as increased rural employment spending through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), agricultural income support, and rationalised GST rates on essential goods could also figure in the Budget,” added Dr. Manoranjan Sharma. The country’s middle class anticipates that Budget 2025 would introduce a range of measures that would promote savings and address the issues of rising costs, especially given the slowdown in the GDP.

It started with Infosys founder Naryana Murthy's statement that young Indians should work 70-hour workweeks for India to develop, which was met with a lot of flak.  Another comment came from the L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan, advocating a 90-hour workweek. His remarks, including, “how long can you stare at your wife,” drew massive criticism online and led to fresh discussions on the importance of work-life balance. ""Nation-building is at the core of our mandate,"" said L&T defending its chairman. It further said that achieving extraordinary results requires extraordinary effort, particularly in a time when India is striving for progress.

But amid all this talk of nation building, are other fast-developing countries put in the hard yards and extending their working hours? A comprehensive report by Dr. Shamika Ravi, a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, provides a data-driven perspective on this controversial claim. The report reveals that Indians currently spend an average of 422 minutes (approximately 7 hours) per day on paid economic activities, translating to 42 hours per week. This is lower than the proposed 70-hour benchmark, but not as far off as some might assume. The report shows that India's work hours are comparable to other emerging economies. Countries like Vietnam, China, Malaysia, and the Philippines report similar working patterns, while developed OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries average just 33 hours per week.

Dalal Street is getting ready for another week of trading with several global and domestic factors expected to influence investor sentiment. Corporate earnings and key economic data from around the world will likely shape the direction of equities, keeping investors on their toes. The week will begin with China’s NBS Composite PMI for January on Monday, which will provide insights into the health of China’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. On Tuesday, the US Durable Goods Orders for December will indicate consumer spending patterns. Japan’s Consumer Confidence Index for January is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, offering a glimpse into consumer sentiment in the country. The US Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday, January 30, which is widely expected to remain at 4.5%. Alongside this, the US GDP growth rate for the fourth quarter, forecasted at 3.1%, will provide a clearer picture of the country’s economic performance. On Friday, January 31, the U.S. Core PCE Price Index for December, a measure of consumer price changes, will be released, along with the UK Nationwide Housing Price Index, which reflects trends in UK house prices. ""The interplay of rising inflation, global price trends, and corporate performance will be crucial for market participants. Robust performances from these corporate heavyweights could catalyze positive investor sentiment, while any earnings misses may exacerbate market volatility,"" said Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group. The stock market continued its losing streak last week, marking the third consecutive week of declines Both the Nifty and Sensex breached key psychological levels of 23,000 and 76,000, respectively, before recovering slightly. Despite the modest recovery, the indices ended the week with losses of approximately 0.50%. ""All major indices are now trading below their crucial 200-day EMA, underscoring sustained bearish momentum. FIIs have remained consistent net sellers, with outflows exceeding â‚¹69,000 crore in the cash segment so far this month,"" said Singhania.  Corporate earnings have added to the market’s volatility, with lacklustre third-quarter results from some of the largest companies failing to provide the boost investors had hoped for. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers, with outflows exceeding Rs 69,000 crore in January. However, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) stepped in, providing net inflows of Rs 17,577 crore, which helped mitigate some of the impact of FII selling. Alternative asset classes, such as Bitcoin and gold, reached record highs last week, drawing attention and funds away from equities. On a positive note, crude oil prices declined, and the Indian rupee strengthened slightly, offering some support to investor sentiment. The Nifty index ended the week with a 0.48% decline, its third straight weekly loss. The index is now trading below key support levels, including the horizontal zone, the ascending trendline, and the 21-day, 55-week, and 200-day EMAs, confirming a bearish trend. The resistance zone at 23,350–23,450 continues to act as a barrier, with strong selling pressure observed at these levels. On the downside, the market may target 22,850 and 22,600 if the bearish trend persists. ""A 'sell on rise' strategy is advisable until the index sustains above 23,450. However, a breach above 24,450 could indicate a potential recovery toward 23,750,"" said Singhania.  He further said that Bank Nifty followed a similar trend, closing lower for the third consecutive week. It is trading below its horizontal support zone and moving averages, including the 21-day EMA and 55-week EMA. ""The resistance zone at 48,900–49,000 remains a key hurdle, and a breakout above this level could push the index to 49,700. On the downside, support is placed at 47,900, and a breach below this could result in further losses, with 47,200 being the next target,"" said Singhania.  Global trends will be a critical factor in determining market direction next week. Economic data from the U.S., China, Japan, and the UK will offer insights into global economic conditions and their impact on Indian markets. The continued selling by FIIs and the ability of DIIs to absorb the selling pressure will also play a significant role. In addition, corporate earnings results from major companies will be closely watched, as they could either lift investor sentiment or deepen the bearish outlook.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 26, 2025

This 6-day week is likely to be highly volatile with other major events like the Fed decision and the Budget in India. The market is looking forward to fiscal stimulus through income tax cuts in the Budget. If the expectations are met, there can be a relief rally in the market.

The appointment shall be made for a maximum period of five years from the date of assumption of charge or till attaining the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier."" The role of the Sebi Chairperson comes with two salary options: either pay equivalent to that of a Secretary to the Government of India or a consolidated monthly salary of Rs 5,62,500, without provision for a house or car. Madhabi Puri Buch took charge as Sebi Chairperson on March 2, 2022, becoming the first woman to head the market regulatory body. Her three-year term will conclude on February 28, 2025. Prior to her appointment as chairperson, Buch served as a whole-time member of Sebi from April 2017 to March 2022, overseeing various regulatory functions and reforms. The position of Sebi chief traditionally comes with a tenure of three years, though exceptions have been made in the past. For instance, U K Sinha served as Sebi Chairperson for six years, from February 18, 2011, to March 1, 2017, while his successor, Ajay Tyagi, held the post for five years, from March 1, 2017, to February 28, 2022. Madhabi Puri Buch’s tenure as Sebi chief has not been without challenges. Among the key issues was the controversy surrounding allegations of regulatory lapses in matters linked to the Adani Group. This followed claims made by short-seller Hindenburg Research and later criticisms raised by the Congress party. Questions were raised about Sebi’s handling of investments in offshore funds linked to the Adani Group and potential code-of-conduct violations. Buch also faced internal concerns as a group of Sebi employees accused her of creating a “toxic work environment” during her tenure. However, the matter was later resolved.

Sensex fell over 800 points to hit the day's low of 75,348.06, while Nifty fell below the 23,000 mark.  Sensex opened at 75,700.43 after having closed at 76,190.46 in the previous session.  The S&P BSE Sensex fell 818.36 points to 75,372.10, while the NSE Nifty50 dropped by 257.35 points to 22,834.85 as of 10:35 AM. The fall was driven by several global and domestic factors that have been weighing on investor sentiment. The weakness in the market was primarily seen in IT and metal stocks, while mid-cap and small-cap stocks also witnessed significant selling pressure. Analysts believe that a mix of global uncertainty, persistent foreign portfolio investor (FPI) selling, and domestic concerns has led to the downturn. Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) selling pressures One of the key reasons for today’s market fall is the sustained selling pressure from FPIs. In January alone, FPIs have pulled out Rs 69,000 crore from the Indian market. This continuous outflow has overshadowed the strong buying by domestic institutional investors (DIIs), who have invested Rs 67,000 crore during the same period. Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities, said, “Nifty is trading below the crucial 23,000 level. Anything below this creates panic and leads to furious selling. Today, we are witnessing visible pressure in mid-cap and small-cap stocks. Investors are also being cautious due to the upcoming Union Budget and the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decision next week.” Global uncertainties and trade tensions Global factors are also playing a significant role in dampening market sentiment. The US Federal Reserve is set to announce its monetary policy decision, and investors are concerned about further tightening of liquidity. Additionally, rising trade tensions have added to the uncertainty. There are fresh fears regarding the US imposing a 25% tariff on Colombia for its refusal to accept deported illegal immigrants. Similar threats of tariffs on Canada and Mexico have heightened concerns about global trade disruptions. These issues have created volatility in economic and market circles, leading to risk aversion among investors. Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “Sustained FPI selling is impacting the market. Concerns about new tariffs and global trade tensions are weighing heavily on sentiment. Markets are now looking forward to fiscal stimulus through income tax cuts in the Budget. If these expectations are not met, the market may continue to face pressure.” Profit booking and pre-Budget nervousness Another factor contributing to the market’s decline is profit booking by investors ahead of the Union Budget 2025. Markets are hoping for measures like income tax cuts or other fiscal stimulus to boost growth, but the uncertainty surrounding these expectations has added to the volatility. Trivesh, COO of Tradejini, said, “The market is nervous about the global liquidity tightening and the upcoming Budget. Profit booking ahead of the Budget is creating additional pressure. Quarterly earnings have also been subdued, adding to the overall weakness. Additionally, global risk aversion has triggered capital flight, while crude oil prices remain under pressure due to concerns about slowing demand.” The rise of China’s DeepSeek AI technology has raised fears about intensifying competition in the global technology sector. This has added to the cautious sentiment among investors, particularly in IT stocks. Crude oil prices have declined due to demand concerns tied to slowing global growth, but this has not been enough to counter the negative sentiment in equities. The markets are expected to remain volatile in the coming days due to key global and domestic events. Investors are eagerly awaiting the Union Budget on Saturday, as well as the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decision in the first week of February. Market experts suggest that any disappointment in Budget announcements could trigger further selling, while positive measures such as tax cuts or fiscal incentives could lead to a relief rally. However, the overall sentiment is likely to remain cautious until there are clearer signs of earnings revival and economic growth.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Must Watch

— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) January 16, 2025 The 8th Pay Commission is set to be implemented from January 1, 2026, till then the 7th Pay Commission which came into being in 2016 will remain valid. Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw mentioned that the government will soon appoint a chairman and two members to the panel to recommend changes in the pay structure of central government employees. That said, let us look into some of the important FAQs related to it.WHY ARE PAY COMMISSIONS IMPORTANT? Pay Commissions are set up by the government to address the issues faced by government employees related to their pay and pensions, while addressing the rising cost of living. Moreover, they have a broader impact on the economy and consumer sentiment.WHY IS FITMENT FACTOR CRUCIAL? The fitment factor is vital in determining the extent of financial benefits. It is a multiplier used to calculate revised salaries and pensions for government employees. The projected fitment factor for the 8th Pay Commission is said to be in the range of 2.28 and 2.86. On the other hand, under the 7th Pay Commission, the fitment factor was set at 2.57. For the 6th Pay Commission, introduced in 2006, the fitment factor was set at 1.86WHAT IS THE PROJECTED PAY UNDER 8TH PAY COMMISSION? The 8th Pay Commission is expected to increase the minimum basic pay from Rs 18,000 to anywhere between Rs 41,000 and Rs 51,480, offering a substantial financial boost for the central government employees.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 27, 2025

The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 677.78 points to 75,512.78, while the NSE Nifty50 was down 217.45 points to 22,874.75 as of 12:42 AM.  Investors on Dalal Street faced losses as stock markets continued to decline, bringing the market capitalisation of all listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) down by Rs 9.48 lakh crore, settling at Rs 410.03 lakh crore. Experts attributed the sstock market crash to a mix of factors, including weak market sentiment, global uncertainty, and selling pressure from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Persistent FPI outflows and profit bookings have added to the volatility, with concerns about key upcoming events weighing on investor confidence.WHAT NEXT FOR DALAL STREET? Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, commented, ""This 6-day week is likely to be highly volatile with other major events like the Fed decision and the Budget in India. The market is looking forward to fiscal stimulus through income tax cuts in the Budget. If the expectations are met, there can be a relief rally in the market. But if a rally is to sustain, we need data indicating growth and earnings revival."" The weak sentiment has been compounded by sustained FPI selling. FPIs have pulled out Rs 69,000 crore from Indian markets in January so far, further contributing to the downward pressure. Although domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have bought shares worth Rs 67,000 crore during the same period, their efforts have not been enough to counterbalance the losses.GLOBAL CUES RAISE CONCERN Global uncertainties have also played a significant role in dampening investor sentiment. Trivesh, COO of Tradejini, said, ""Markets today have declined due to a mix of global and domestic concerns. The market appears to be nervous about the impact of tightening on global liquidity, as the US Federal Reserve is set to announce its next monetary policy decision."" Adding to these worries are trade tensions and geopolitical risks. ""The rise of China’s DeepSeek AI has raised alarms about the growing competition in the global technology race. Moreover, there is an additional burden of global uncertainty as trade tensions have risen due to tariffs on Colombia,"" Trivesh added. The prospect of new tariffs by the United States is another area of concern. President Trump has reportedly threatened a 25% tariff on Colombia for refusing to take back deported illegal immigrants. Similar tariffs on Canada and Mexico are expected to come into effect from February 1, raising questions about the broader implications of these policies on global trade and economic stability. The prices of crude oil have remained under pressure, reflecting concerns about slowing demand as global growth tapers off. This has added to the challenges for Indian markets, as the country is a major importer of crude oil. Meanwhile, quarterly corporate earnings have been another source of disappointment, failing to provide any relief to the markets. Persistent FII outflows, combined with global risk aversion, have triggered capital flight, adding to the pressure on domestic equities. Domestic investors are also closely watching the Union Budget, which will be presented soon. Market participants are hoping for fiscal stimulus measures, including income tax cuts, to support growth and boost investor sentiment. However, uncertainty around the budget has heightened market volatility, with many investors adopting a cautious stance. Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities, said, “Nifty is trading below the crucial 23,000 level. Anything below this creates panic and leads to furious selling.

With India’s GDP projected to grow between 6.5% and 6.8% in FY25, experts hope that the upcoming budget will introduce key reforms to strengthen the infrastructure sector, which is the backbone of the country. Amrutesh Reddy, Director, NDR InvIT Managers, has urged the government to modernise the country’s infrastructure and supply chain systems. “With India’s GDP growth forecasted at 6.5% for FY25, the emphasis must be on fortifying the nation’s economic backbone through the modernisation of infrastructure and the establishment of efficient, future-ready supply chain systems. These sectors are indispensable to fostering sustained economic growth and enhancing India’s competitiveness on the global stage,” he said. “The budget must focus on addressing systemic challenges and unlocking the sector's full potential. Simplifying land acquisition processes and expediting approvals for logistics and warehousing projects can significantly reduce lead times and enable the timely delivery of critical infrastructure,” Amrutesh Reddy mentioned. Additionally, Reddy has called for the need for simplifying the land acquisition process across the country and accelerating approvals for warehousing projects, to enable timely delivery of key infrastructure. “Incentives for green warehousing and sustainable building practices are essential to align with global environmental standards and future-proof the sector. Supporting the development of integrated industrial parks and export hubs tailored to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) can play a transformative role in boosting India’s manufacturing and export capabilities,” Reddy added. Amit Tandon, CEO & Managing Director, Asia Shipping India is hopeful for substantial budget allocation to key infrastructure projects. “As India strives to become a $7 trillion economy by 2030, we urge the government to focus on infrastructure development, policy consistency, and technology adoption aligned with the National Logistics Policy and PM Gati Shakti,” he remarked. “Key expectations from the upcoming Budget include increased investments in port modernisation, multi-modal logistics parks, and seamless connectivity across transport networks,” Tandon said.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The company’s decision comes as fresh US sanctions on Russian oil producers and tankers disrupt shipments, creating challenges for importers to secure supplies from the world’s second-largest oil producer, trade sources told Reuters. The United States recently imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, targeting its oil producers and shipping networks. This has made it difficult for many countries, including India, to continue sourcing Russian crude oil at the scale seen earlier. As a result, Indian refiners like IOC are turning to alternative sources of oil to meet their domestic demand. In the latest tender, IOC secured crude oil from a mix of African and American sources. The breakdown of the purchases is as follows:
2 million barrels of Nigerian Okwuibome crude from Vitol.
1 million barrels each of Nigerian Akpo and Angolan Mostarda grades from Shell.
2 million barrels of US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland crude from Equinor.
 Sweet crude is preferred due to its low sulphur content, which makes it easier and cheaper to refine into fuel products like petrol and diesel. The recent tender comes just a week after IOC bought 7 million barrels of spot crude from the Middle East and Africa. This included a rare procurement of Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude, showcasing IOC’s ongoing efforts to diversify its sources of crude oil amid global supply challenges. In a related development, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), another Indian refiner, issued its first crude import tender in over a year but chose not to award the tender. The reasons for this decision remain unclear, although market observers speculate it could be linked to pricing or supply concerns. Indian refiners have traditionally relied on a mix of Russian, Middle Eastern, and African crude oil to meet domestic fuel demand. However, with the sanctions limiting access to Russian oil, IOC and other refiners are now focusing on alternative sources. Sweet crude oil grades, particularly from Africa and the US, are emerging as key options, even though they may come at a higher price compared to earlier deals for Russian crude.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Must Watch

So he decided to look for a bank loan but was not sure whether to opt for a personal loan or a business loan. Like Rahul, many people face this dilemma when choosing the right type of loan. In this article we will talk about what personal and business loans are and what is the difference between the two. Personal loans, as the name suggests, help in meeting the personal financial requirements of the borrower. They can be taken for almost anything, be it meeting medical expenses, buying a car or house, for marriage of a son or daughter, etc. On the other hand, business loans are typically designed for entrepreneurs for supporting their business needs, be it purchasing business equipment, expanding business operations, funding salaries, etc. However, business loans must be used exclusively for business purposes and one is not allowed to use the business loan for personal use. Personal loans are usually unsecured loans, while business loans are secured loans that may require collateral. One may not get any tax exemption on personal loans. The loan amount for a personal loan is usually less than a business loan and depends on the borrower’s creditworthiness and credit rating. On the contrary, business loans depend on the size of business, income and credit rating of the borrower. Banks may ask business owners to submit profit and loss statements, balance sheets, business plans, and other reports, while granting business loans. They offer tax benefits to the borrowers. Hence, before applying for a bank loan, one must figure out the exact purpose of the loan and decide what suits his/her personal or business requirements.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 27, 2025Must Watch

Most of the other broader market indices also recovered after Monday’s sharp selloff, sparked by concerns over US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Major heavyweight sectoral indices such as Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial Services and Nifty IT also gained, defying global market trends. Shares of Axis Bank, Wipro, Shriram Finance, Tata Steel and IndusInd Bank were the top gainers on the Nifty50. The top drags were Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, Coal India, M&M and Cipla. Globally, the focus of investors has shifted to Chinese startup DeepSeek, with the emergence of its free AI assistant. The firm said it uses less data and at a fraction of the cost of services available currently. The rising popularity of DeepSeek led to a sharp selloff in US tech stocks yesterday, especially AI-focused companies such as Nvidia, which fell 17%. Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, ""The DeepSeek impact on the US stock market in general, and the tech stocks in particular, has turned out to be a reality check for the overvalued stock market. In the medium-term this is likely to have a sobering effect on markets, globally.” On the Indian market, Vijayakumar said that it appears to be oversold and is set for a rebound. “The RBI’s announcement of measures to boost the liquidity in the banking system by around Rs 1.5 lakh crore is positive for the market. This raises the prospects of a rate cut by the MPC in the February policy meeting. Banks are likely to benefit,” he explained. “After the correction the market is now trading at fair valuations which are in line with long-term (10-year) averages. Investors can utilise the opportunity to buy fundamentally strong high quality stocks. The outperformance of largecaps over mid-and smallcaps is a healthy trend,” he added.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Must Watch

Overnight, chipmaker Nvidia dived 17 per cent, wiping off nearly USD 593 billion in the biggest market capitalisation loss in history. ""We are on the front edge of an urgent re-evaluation of a narrative that has gripped the market for almost two years. That makes it hard to shrug off after 36 hours,"" said Brent Donnelly, president of trading and analytics firm Spectra Markets. Nvidia stock was up slightly in after-hours trading. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.1 per cent and S&P 500 futures were broadly flat. Nvidia supplier Advantest was down 10 per cent in Japan on Tuesday, taking losses for the week so far to nearly 19 per cent. There were further sharp falls for AI-backer SoftBank Group, down 5.5 per cent, and data-centre cable maker Furukawa Electric, down 8 per cent. Both had already fallen heavily on Monday, with SoftBank now 13 per cent lower after two days and Furukawa down 20 per cent. Data centre landlords tumbled in Australia. Tech heavy markets in Taiwan and South Korea were closed for a holiday. Nvidia accounted for most of the 3 per cent drop in the Nasdaq on Monday, though selling extended from Tokyo to New York and hit everything with a slice of the AI supply chain, from cable makers to data centres, power utilities and software firms. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, leapt and safe-haven assets such as government bonds, the yen and the Swiss franc all rallied. Ten-year US Treasury yields fell 9.5 basis points, and were last steady at 4.55 per cent in Asia. Fed fund futures have put in an extra 9 bps of easing by year-end. Even oil prices dropped 2 per cent on worries about energy demand. DeepSeek, a little-known startup from Hangzhou, China, has a free AI assistant it said was developed very cheaply using lower-cost chips and less data than US rivals. ""The narrative that's concerning people here is that DS has delivered performance-topping models on a shoestring budget,"" said JP Morgan sector specialist Josh Meyers in a note to clients. ""This has been seen by some as egg-on-the-face of the big, multi-billion dollar operations like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic. And it's calling into question whether we're going to need multi-billions of dollars in compute capex when DeepSeek's leading distilled models can run natively on an iPhone.""BROAD RISK-OFF MOOD On Wall Street, the S&P 500, dropped 1.5 per cent. Chipmaker Broadcom, fell 17.4 per cent and the Philadelphia semiconductor index dropped 9.2 per cent - its biggest loss since March 2020. Gold prices declined more than 1 per cent as investors liquidated bullion to cover losses elsewhere. Google parent Alphabet fell 4.2 per cent and Microsoft fell 2.1 per cent, with both steadying in after-hours trade. In Europe, the STOXX Europe 600 technology index fell more than 3 per cent and ASML, which makes chip manufacturing equipment, fell 7 per cent. Bitcoin, lately a barometer of markets' risk appetite, dropped below USD 100,000 for the first time in a week before steadying around USD 101,700. The dollar fell nearly 1 per cent against the yen overnight and 0.4 per cent against the Swiss franc  - two currencies that often gain during periods of market unease. Early on Tuesday it ticked higher against both, trading at 155.36 yen and making modest gains elsewhere, holding the euro to USD 1.0454. Markets in China were closed to usher in the Lunar New Year and Hong Kong trade closes at noon. Both the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meet to set interest rates later in the week.Published By: Prateek ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 28, 2025ALSO READ |  Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek hit by 'malicious attacks' amid popularity surgeALSO READ |  Mukesh Ambani buys Nvidia AI chips, plans to build largest data centre in India: Report

e077647c-76d4-4de9-9c26-6e713080a0a1,Explained: Why China's DeepSeek triggered a slide in global AI stocksChinese startup DeepSeek has turned up the heat in the global AI race and its new models have raised hard questions about whether US companies can keep their edge as the landscape shifts beneath their feet.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/deepseek-china-ai-startup-global-technology-stocks-selloff-wall-street-nvidia-openai-microsoft-2671177-2025-01-28,"Last night's trading session on Wall Street left tech and artificial intelligence (AI) companies reeling, with investors scrambling to make sense of the damage. Leading AI chipmaker Nvidia saw its market value nosedive, while shares of tech giants such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Dell Technologies also faced sharp declines. The tremors weren't just limited to Wall Street; AI stocks worldwide felt the impact, all thanks to a Chinese startup called DeepSeek and the buzz around its AI models, DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.advertisementDECODING THE DEEPSEEK DISRUPTION DeepSeek rattled the global tech landscape with its low-cost AI chatbot. Its arrival poses a serious challenge to industry-leading AI models in the US, given the fact that it does it at a fraction of the cost. The Chinese startup's impact hit Wall Street hard during the overnight trading session. The Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.07% while the S&P 500 dropped nearly 1.5%. Tech giants led the fall, with Nvidia's shares dropping nearly 17% to close at $118.58. This marked a staggering $593 billion market-cap loss in a single day—doubling its previous record. The damage spread further as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbled 9.2%, marking its steepest drop since March 2020, with chipmakers facing heavy selling pressure.DEEPSEEK'S 'SPUTNIK MOMENT' DeepSeek's breakthrough has people questioning the worth of industry leaders like OpenAI. Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen didn't mince words, calling DeepSeek's R1 model AI's ""Sputnik moment."" The comparison hits home—just as the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch kicked off the space race in the 1950s, DeepSeek's breakthrough could reshape the AI landscape. The startup's secret? Cost efficiency. DeepSeek claims its AI assistant needs less data than competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. It runs on just 2,000 Nvidia H800 chips, making it cheaper to operate. Better yet, the company says its new DeepSeek-R1 costs 20-50 times less than OpenAI's offerings. It may be noted that DeepSeek’s app surpassed ChatGPT in downloads on Apple’s App Store by Monday. Moreover, the lower chip requirement raises eyebrows for another reason: it could help sidestep US export restrictions meant to slow China's AI progress.BROADER MARKET FALLOUT The damage wasn't limited to Nvidia. Other tech heavyweights like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Dell Technologies took serious hits. Semiconductor giant Broadcom's shares sank 17.4%, while AI-focused infrastructure companies like Digital Realty and Vertiv Holdings also got hammered. The selling spree spread overseas, with Japan's SoftBank and Europe's ASML joining the downward spiral.HOW DID NVIDIA, OPENAI RESPOND? After watching its share price tank, Nvidia acknowledged DeepSeek's achievement but stood its ground, saying that its chips remain crucial to AI development. The chipmaker pointed out that DeepSeek's growing user base will still need substantial processing power, adding that that only high-performance Nvidia GPUs can provide. DeepSeek's AI model even received a word of praise from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. He called that Chinese startup's R1 AI model impressive.  ""DeepSeek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,"" Altman said on X.WHAT NEXT? DeepSeek's arrival has investors rethinking the AI-fuelled demand for chips, data centers, and power infrastructure that drove markets to record highs over the past two years. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told Reuters this could upend the ""entire AI narrative."" Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, put it bluntly: ""The DeepSeek impact on the US stock market, especially tech stocks, is a reality check for the overvalued market."" ""This will likely have a sobering effect on markets globally,"" he added. Some experts see opportunity in the chaos. Daniel Morgan of Synovus Trust Company told Reuters that Nvidia and other chipmakers remain essential for data centers, where the ""real money"" in AI lies. But one thing's clear. DeepSeek's new models have turned up the heat in the AI race. They've raised hard questions about whether US companies can keep their edge as the landscape shifts beneath their feet. For now, DeepSeek has everyone talking about what comes next for AI.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Must Watch

The S&P BSE Sensex was up 779.85 points to 76,146.02 at 12:09 pm, while the NSE Nifty50 gained 198.15 points to trade at 23,027.50. In contrast, most of the other broader market indices fell during the session. However, the overall mood on Dalal Street was much better than yesterday, despite the highly volatile environment.  Here are three points to know about today's stock market rally: BANKING AND FINANCIAL STOCKS GAIN While global markets were hit due to a slide in AI and tech stocks, Sensex and Nifty displayed resilience and surged sharply, supported by a rally in heavyweight banking and financial services stocks. The Nifty Bank index was up nearly 2% and Nifty Financial Services surged over 2%. Banking and financial stocks such as Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv rose sharply during the trading session.RBI MEASURES TO BOOST LIQUIDITY The sharp rise came after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced several measures to boost liquidity in the banking section. Mahesh Agarwal, National Head, Wealth, AUM Capital, said, “RBI announced bold measures to address the liquidity crunch in the domestic financial markets that have been prevailing for a while now.” The announcements by the central bank have also raised hopes of an interest rate cut in February—something that has been pending for a prolonged period. This also provided a boost to realty stocks, with the Nifty Realty index rising 1.8%.MARKET REMAINS VOLATILE The rally in banking and financial services stocks has provided a much-needed boost to the benchmark indices, but the situation remains volatile ahead of Saturday’s Union Budget presentation. “Key upcoming catalysts include the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on January 28-29 and the Union Budget 2025 on February 1,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, further pointed out earlier that the Indian market “appears to be oversold and set for a rebound”. “The RBI’s announcement of measures to boost the liquidity in the banking system by around Rs 1.5 lakh crore is positive for the market. This raises the prospects of a rate cut by the MPC in the February policy meeting. Banks are likely to benefit,” he added.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 28, 2025

SpiceJet shares were trading 3.94% higher at Rs 45.60 on the Bombay Stock Exchange at around 12:54 pm. The low-cost airline’s stock price gained after it announced that the first of its four grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft would resume operations on Wednesday. SpiceJet also aims to restart the other three 737 MAXs and 10 other aircraft by mid-April. It is worth noting that several SpiceJet aircraft have been grounded or deregistered over unpaid dues to lessors. Earlier, the carrier had completed a series of fund raises to settle dues, which has helped it bring its grounded jets back in operation.

The said job cuts have impacted both higher management levels and lower ranks, reported Bloomberg. The planned job cuts come at a time when the company is trying to slash its staff post-integration with former rival Credit Suisse. UBS took over Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue in 2023. It had earlier mentioned that it would be slashing nearly 3000 jobs in Switzerland as a part of this integration. However, the bank is trying to minimise the impact of jobs cuts both domestically and globally, mentioned a spokesperson for UBS. Both UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse employed nearly 35,000 people in Switzerland at the end of 2023. The impacted employees have been given an option to join a program that allows up to a year to find a new role within the bank, and is also offering additional assistance in finding a new role outside the bank, if necessary. The bank is also providing a comprehensive social plan, combining the best features of the previous UBS and Credit Suisse plans, said the spokesperson. These job cuts are occurring during the time when UBS is trying to remove Credit Suisse’s logo from its Zurich headquarters and is working on migrating domestic client data to its own IT systems. Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti told Bloomberg that the reduction in headcount would continue in the wake of the acquisition, adding that the redundancies are ""inevitable"" even as the bank is trying to rely on voluntary leavers wherever possible.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 28, 2025

Indian Share Market: Should the increased stock market volatility prompt investors to exit the market, or is it better to stay calm and stick with their investments? Should they even consider adding more to their portfolios?",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/stock-market-rebounds-today-but-volatility-remains-high-investor-strategy-2671291-2025-01-28,"Dalal Street has been going through a turbulent phase. From sudden bull runs to shocking crashes, the benchmark indices seem to be on a relentless rollercoaster ride. For instance, the 30-share Sensex jumped 900 points today, recovering sharply from the steep fall in the previous session. The broader Nifty and other small-and mid-cap indices are also facing the same situation. With some key events lined up— the US Fed’s policy decision, expiry of F&O contracts for the January series, Union Budget 2025, Delhi Elections, and RBI’s Monetary Policy—it’s almost certain the stock markets will experience periods of volatility till mid-February. Should the increased volatility prompt investors to exit the market, or is it better to stay calm and stick with their investments? Should they even consider adding more to their portfolios? While analysts have acknowledged that domestic stock markets remain extremely volatile, they have advised investors to stay calm and invested. Most of them remain bullish on the stock market in terms of long-term growth. The focus of investors, therefore, should be on remaining cautious and avoiding rash decisions. Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, explained the stock market is “now trading at fair valuations” after the prolonged correction. He went on to say that the valuations at present are in line with long-term (10-year) averages, adding that it could be an ideal time for investors to utilise the opportunity to buy “fundamentally strong and high-quality” stocks. “The outperformance of largecaps over mid-and smallcaps is a healthy trend,” he added. Meanwhile, Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivative - Angel One, takes on a more cautious approach. “The beginning of the eventful week was quite dreadful, as the benchmark slipped convincingly below the 23,000 mark to challenge the supporting trendline of the ‘Falling wedge’, making it worse from a technical point of view,” he said “We have been maintaining our bearish stance since the last 2 - 3 months and have been repeatedly advocating against catching the falling knife. Now, since we are about to enter a crucial and major support zone of 22800 - 22400, we would change our stance from bearish to cautious now,” he added. He also mentioned that from here on, it would be “very difficult to anticipate what the Union Budget has to offer” and other global developments. Chavan noted that unless there is any major disappointment from the budget or any other global aberration, markets are likely to see some respite in the mentioned support zone any time soon. “This certainly does not mean one should start buying throttle; but yes, accumulation in a staggered manner in the coming days is advisable with no leveraged positions. The anticipated increase in volatility presents opportunities to capitalise on market movements, whether they trend upward or downward. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial for navigating the twists and turns that lie ahead,” he added.

These measures are: OMO purchase auctions of Government of India securities for an aggregate amount of Rs 60,000 crore in three tranches of Rs 20,000 crore each to be held on January 30, 2025, February 13, 2025, and February 20, 2025. 56-day Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auction for a notified amount of Rs 50,000 crore to be held on February 7, 2025. USD/INR Buy/Sell Swap auction of USD 5 billion for a tenor of six months to be held on January 31, 2025. Detailed instructions for each operation shall be issued separately. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor evolving liquidity and market conditions and take measures as appropriate to ensure orderly liquidity conditions. Rajeev Radhakrishnan, CIO – Fixed Income, SBI Mutual Fund said that the central bank has undertaken the above measures to tackle the existing liquidity issues. “A host of measures have been announced today that clearly lays out the immediate and pressing task facing the RBI i.e., providing adequate liquidity support to the financial markets. With core liquidity being negative close to about Rs. 80,000 crores, there was clearly a need to add durable liquidity beyond the daily VRR auctions that largely addresses the frictional liquidity tightness in the banking system,” he said. “Starting with the CRR cut announced in the last review, the daily VRR auctions announced a couple of weeks ago and the screen-based OMO purchase conducted over last 2 weeks, the incremental measures announced provide confidence in returning normalcy to the money markets. These incremental actions would add about Rs. 1 trillion of core liquidity infusion and another Rs. 50,000 crores through a slightly longer-term repo auction crossing the quarter,” Rajeev Radhakrishnan added. Upasna Bhardwaj, Chief Economist, Kotak Mahindra mentioned that the central bank’s easing liquidity measures are in line with expectations. “However, we expect more easing will be needed given the continued pressure over the next few months,” she said.

Last year, ITC Ltd decided to demerge its hotel division into an independent entity. It set the demerger ratio at 1:10. This means that those shareholders who, as of January 6, 2025, owned 10 shares of ITC, will get one share of ITC Hotels. In order to qualify for the above, investors had to purchase ITC shares on or before January 3, 2025. Those who purchase ITC shares after January 3 will not be eligible for the ITC Hotel shares.

The loss demonstrates the challenges facing CEO Kelly Ortberg in turning around the planemaker as it cedes more ground to rival Airbus  in the delivery race and comes under the crosshairs of regulators and customers following a series of missteps. Shares of Boeing fell marginally in trading before the bell on Tuesday. Ortberg, who took the reins of the planemaker in August, however, said the company was making progress on restoring stability to its struggling production lines after a harrowing mid-air accident in 2024 raised concerns about the safety of its jets. The company reported a loss of $3.86 billion in the fourth quarter due to what Ortberg called ""disappointing"" charges in several fixed-price defense programs. He, however, added Boeing was ""now more proactive and clear-eyed on the risks"" to the programs. Revenue for the quarter through December fell 31% to $15.24 billion, missing analysts' expectation of $16.21 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Quarterly adjusted loss per share was $5.9, compared with expectations of a loss of $3 per share. Cash burn was $14.3 billion in 2024, compared with a cash flow of $4.43 billion in 2023. Ortberg reiterated the company's four-part plan to turn the business around including undertaking a ""multi-year journey"" to fix Boeing's culture, ""perhaps the most important change we need to make."" After banking record-high profits in the 2010s, Boeing has bled more than $30 billion since 2019 after two fatal crashes of its best-selling 737 MAX jet triggered production quality and safety concerns and worries that it had misled regulators during the plane's certification process. The COVID-19 pandemic further squeezed the company, while the mid-air panel blowout on a nearly new 737 MAX in early 2024 dragged Boeing into another crisis. ""We have completed deep dives on all of our challenging fixed-price development programs,"" Ortberg said on Tuesday in a letter to employees. The company's Defense, Space & Security business lost $5.41 billion in 2024. Ortberg added Boeing has made progress with its supply chain and has returned to an output rate of five 787 jets per month at the end of 2024, despite delays in areas like seats. Boeing's commercial planes division, now focused on getting three of its models certified, has a good handle on fixing a thrust link issue uncovered on its 777X widebody, which resumed flight tests earlier this month, he added. Ortberg was guarded in his message about the status of solving problems with anti-icing systems on the 737-7 and -10 models. The company is ""still working through the testing phase focusing on finalization of the anti-icing design solution,"" he said. The company continues to invest in ""core businesses while streamlining our portfolio in areas that are not core to our future,"" he said.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 28, 2025

UPI payments reached Rs 2.34 lakh crore in October 2024, recording a rise of 37% from last year, according to the latest RBI data. So is it a wise move to link his credit card to UPI payments? Let us try to understand the same as we discuss both the advantages and the disadvantages of linking credit cards with UPI. A credit card enables users to make use of a credit line whenever one is short on cash. While a UPI payment debits your savings account instantly, a credit card offers more flexibility while making purchases.  When one makes payment for each transaction through a savings account, the bank records every transaction. On the other hand, if one pays via UPI linked credit card, the bank records only the payment to the credit card, thus decluttering your bank statement to a large extent. Generally, people use credit cards for making big payments and depend on bank accounts for day-to-day transactions. But by linking UPI to your credit card one can make all the payments using one method. On the contrary, people tend to overspend when using credit cards, as the amount is not instantly debited from the saving account. Relying only on a UPI-linked credit card may backfire when any technical glitch or error occurs. Lastly, not every bank offers UPI activation through credit cards. One may miss out any scheme, reward or benefits offered by other credit cards when solely being dependent on a particular credit card because of its UPI feature. In other words, it is advisable to use UPI-linked credit cards responsibly and without overspending.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 28, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 offering lower taxes and to simplify the tax structure. However, this regime removes some of the popular deductions which are available in the old tax regime. While under the old tax regime a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 is available for the salaried class, under the new tax regime, the same has been increased to Rs 75,000. However, Santhosh Sivaraj, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India urged the government to raise this deduction amount in lieu of rising costs and inflationary pressures. ""Owing to inflation and an increase in prices for both transport and medical since FY 2018-19 when standard deduction was reintroduced, the Hon’ble FM should look at bringing in parity for those opting for either the old or the new tax regime and increase the standard deduction to a minimum of Rs 1.20 lah a year. This would seem practical as any salaried taxpayer would be incurring Rs 10,000 a month / Rs 1.20 lakh a year collectively towards transport and medical expenses,” he said. Another popular deduction under the old tax regime is Section 80C, which covers contributions to LIC and PPF. This section offers a maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh.  Deepashree Shetty, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India has called for the inclusion of Sector 80C under the new tax regime. “Allow deductions up to Rs 2 lakh for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contribution, etc.,” she said. Another popular request from taxpayers is the inclusion of the House Rent Allowance (HRA) into the new tax regime. This would ease the financial burden on the taxpayers to a great extent. Deepashree Shetty pointed out that the HRA exemption will provide much-needed relief to taxpayers, especially those residing in cities with high rental costs.  “The government must extend the scope of House Rent Allowance (HRA) to include high-rental cities of Bengaluru, Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Pune under ‘metro cities’ to provide relief to salaried taxpayers in these areas,” she said, adding to raise the deduction limit for housing loan interest repayment from the existing Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. Will the government include these popular deductions and tax benefits under the new tax regime for the convenience of the taxpayers?

The massive selloff in Nvidia's stock was triggered by the rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which introduced a low-cost AI assistant that investors feared could disrupt the dominance of US companies in the artificial intelligence sector. Nvidia, which lost 17% in Monday’s session, the biggest one-day loss in market history, rose 8.9% on Tuesday as investors looked for buying opportunities. Other tech stocks, including semiconductor, power, and infrastructure companies linked to AI, also regained ground after collectively losing over $1 trillion in market value a day earlier.US TECH STOCKS GAIN GROUND  Much of Tuesday’s gains in the tech sector were driven by major companies like Apple and Microsoft. Apple rose 3.7%, making it the second-biggest boost for the Nasdaq after Nvidia. Microsoft gained 2.9%, recovering from losses earlier in the week. Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, added 2.2%, marking its seventh straight day of gains despite the AI-driven market turmoil. The overall technology sector rose 3.6% on Tuesday after falling 5.6% the day before. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tracks major chip companies, gained 1.1% after suffering a 9.2% drop on Monday, the steepest one-day percentage fall since March 2020. Investors began to question whether DeepSeek’s AI model could truly live up to its claims of lower costs and efficiency. “Yesterday was an initial reaction. Today investors are asking if anybody did any sort of homework and made sure DeepSeek is exactly what they say it is. Can we have more proof that they really built it for so much less?” said JJ Kinahan, president of brokerage firm Tastytrade, in an interview with Reuters. Nvidia closed Tuesday at $128.99 per share, still lower than its Friday close of $142.62. Other major tech stocks also showed signs of recovery. Oracle, which had dropped 13.8% on Monday, ended the session up 3.6%. Marvell Technology, which had fallen 19%, rose 3.5%, while chipmaker Broadcom recovered 2.6% after Monday’s 17.4% drop.EXPERTS BULLISH ON AI STOCKS Despite Monday’s selloff, some investors see the rise of DeepSeek as a positive sign for the AI industry. Steven Cohen, founder of Point72 Asset Management, said at a conference in Miami on Tuesday that DeepSeek’s breakthrough is “actually bullish because it advances the move to artificial intelligence,"" as reported by Reuters.  Traders also showed renewed interest in Nvidia. While the stock suffered a historic drop, options traders quickly returned, betting on a recovery. Cody Acree, a semiconductor industry analyst at Benchmark Company, told Reuters that the emergence of cheaper AI models would not reduce the need for high-performance chips. While companies like DeepSeek may develop cost-effective AI software, they still require powerful hardware to train and operate their models. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek’s model “impressive” but added that competition is a good thing. “We will obviously deliver much better models, and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” Altman said in a social media post. US President Donald Trump commented on DeepSeek, calling it “a wake-up call for our industries.”Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Must Watch

The Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek has made headlines and grabbed eyeballs with its latest AI model, which is said to be 20 to 50 times cheaper to train and operate than OpenAI’s models, as per media reports. The announcement caused a huge reaction in the stock market, leading to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s market value. Investors feared that cheaper AI models would reduce the demand for Nvidia’s high-performance processors. However, Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of Intel and an industry veteran, believes that this reaction is misplaced. In a LinkedIn post, Gelsinger shared his view that DeepSeek’s breakthrough is actually a positive development for the AI industry. He also said that he is buying Nvidia and other AI stocks, taking advantage of the lower prices caused by the market’s reaction. ""The market reaction is wrong, lowering the cost of AI will expand the market. Today I’m an nVidia and AI stock buyer and happy to benefit from lower prices,"" he said in an LinkedIn post.  Gelsinger used DeepSeek’s success as an opportunity to reflect on broader trends in computing. He outlined three key takeaways, based on his decades of experience in the technology sector. Gelsinger dismissed concerns that DeepSeek’s cheaper AI models would reduce the demand for computing power. Instead, he compared the situation to the rise of personal computers and mobile devices. In both cases, making technology more affordable has led to wider adoption and massive industry growth. According to Gelsinger, more affordable AI will lead to deeper integration into various applications, increasing the overall demand for computing power rather than shrinking it. DeepSeek’s success comes despite challenges such as export restrictions and limited access to cutting-edge hardware. Gelsinger pointed out that some of the most crucial breakthroughs in computing have emerged under similar constraints. He said that necessity often drives innovation, and DeepSeek’s ability to create a competitive AI model under difficult conditions is proof of this. Gelsinger also addressed the shift towards proprietary AI models, warning that closed ecosystems could slow down progress and limit transparency. He praised DeepSeek for taking an open-source approach, encouraging collaboration and scrutiny from the wider AI community. “Open wins every time it is given a proper shot,” he wrote. “AI is much too important for our future to allow a closed ecosystem to ever emerge as the one and only in this space.” “The real money in AI is providing the chips for the data centres,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, in an interview with Reuters. “Overall, I view the AI tech selloff today as an opportunity to add high-quality tech shares on weakness.” (Disclaimer: The views, opinions, recommendations, and suggestions expressed by experts/brokerages in this article are their own and do not reflect the views of the India Today Group.

While no rate cuts are expected, the recent pause in the dollar rally and US bond yields has provided some relief. According to experts, this is sentimentally positive for domestic equities, especially after foreign investors pulled out Rs 79,016 crore so far this month. Another positive factor is a recovery in US tech stocks after yesterday's bloodbath. This has provided a boost to domestic IT stocks. POSSIBILITY OF CONSUMPTION BOOST IN BUDGET 2025 Investors are keeping a close watch on the upcoming Union Budget as sources have indicated that the government will provide tax relief and growth-focused measures to boost consumption. While expectations remain tempered, any positive announcements could drive further market momentum. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said, “The focus is now on the Federal Reserve's rate decision and the upcoming Union Budget 2025, where measures to boost consumption and growth are expected.”DALAL STREET REMAIN CAUTIOUS Despite the uptrend in frontline indices, broader market sentiment remains mixed. The Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices have dropped 9.1% and 14.7% in January, respectively, signaling valuation corrections. Analysts see this as a healthy trend, with private financials offering a favorable risk-reward balance.

This could not only push  US tech giants to rethink their AI capital expenditure plans but also benefit Indian information technology (IT) companies.  Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) suggested that a shift from high-cost AI infrastructure to more affordable alternatives could open new opportunities for Indian IT services firms. MOFSL stated that services spending usually follows the investment cycles of big tech companies, much like it did during the cloud adoption phase. While Indian IT firms often play a limited role during heavy capex cycles, they become critical once the focus shifts to cost optimisation, explained the brokerage firm. ""Indian IT can play a significant role in AI evolution by driving platform engineering and outsourced engineering capabilities, helping enterprises design, build, and scale AI-driven solutions. This could position Indian IT as a key player in the low-cost GenAI wave,"" MOFSL said.INDIAN IT FIRMS AND AI Major Indian IT companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra are already strengthening their AI capabilities. TCS in its Q3 results commentary highlighted how ""Agentic AI"" enables it to integrate AI into transactions and workflows, improving efficiency and reducing costs. “Investments in AI, GenAI, and cloud services are driving cost optimisation while enabling business transformation,"" it said. Meanwhile, Infosys’ management said it was developing over 100 Generative AI agents for automation and productivity enhancements. HCL Tech noted that the cost of using large language models (LLMs) has dropped by over 85% since early 2023, making AI adoption more viable. Wipro described itself as an early adopter of Agentic AI, using it for customer service and supply chain optimisation. Meanwhile, Tech Mahindra is focusing on building smaller, enterprise-specific AI models.DEEPSEEK’S R1 DISRUPTS GLOBAL AI DeepSeek’s newly released AI model, R1, has outperformed many existing models in areas like mathematics and coding, and that too, at a fraction of the cost. If DeepSeek’s claims are accurate, AI infrastructure providers like chipmakers and cloud hyperscalers may face challenges, while IT services firms could see faster enterprise AI adoption, according to analysts.  Another brokerage firm, JM Financial, also believes reasoning models and smaller, distilled AI models could be game-changers for enterprise AI applications, which will align with IT firms' growing focus on cost-effective AI solutions. However, MOFSL also stressed the fact that while it’s too early to gauge the direct impact on IT stocks, the long-term outlook for the sector remains positive as AI demand grows.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Trending Reel

Income tax changes to watch out forThe current income-tax law is complex for average taxpayers due to its technical jargon and numerous provisos, circulars, and notifications. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/budget-2025-will-taxpayers-get-relief-income-tax-changes-to-watch-out-for-2671823-2025-01-29,"In the Union Budget 2024, the Finance Minister of India called for a comprehensive review of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘Act’). The purpose as cited in her speech was to make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and understand. The endeavour was to reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax certainty to the taxpayers.  To spearhead this initiative, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (‘CBDT’) established an internal committee. Recognizing the importance of public participation, the committee issued a press release on October 7, 2024, inviting valuable insights and suggestions from the public. The suggestions were invited for simplification of language, litigation reduction, compliance reduction and redundant/obsolete provisions. Since the issuance of this press release, there has been guarded silence from the Government regarding the progress of this crucial review. As Union Budget 2025 looms on the horizon, speculation is rife regarding the potential introduction of a new income tax law. This article discusses some of the key amendments that may be introduced in the upcoming budget to achieve the Finance Minister's vision of a more streamlined and taxpayer-friendly tax regime.Simplifying language of provisions The current income-tax law is complex for average taxpayers due to its technical jargon and numerous provisos, circulars, and notifications. This necessitates reliance on tax lawyers and consultants. Simplifying the language, especially for provisions concerning individual taxpayers like salary, house property, and other income is crucial. This can be achieved by making the provisions more comprehensible and by including illustrations to aid interpretation. Furthermore, rearranging and regrouping the sections in a manner to bring all connected provisions together may make it easier for taxpayers to understand their tax obligations and related compliance.Removal of old and redundant sections  Presently, there are 298 sections in the existing income-tax law. The same is further supplemented by various circulars and notifications. Repeal of various redundant provisions itself will considerably reduce the length of the law.  For instance, provisions such as section 10A, section 10B, section 10BA and section 10C provided for certain profit-linked deduction to specified businesses in the past. As of now, not only the sunset date for commencement of such specified businesses has expired but also the maximum period for which deductions could have been claimed under these sections stands expired. Accordingly, in today’s context, the provisions do not have any relevance and may end up creating unnecessary confusion in the minds of the taxpayers. Accordingly, the same can be omitted from the Act.Publication of income-tax compendium of clarifications One of the key reasons for the piling up of a plethora of cases before various forums is that the legal position which the taxman intends to take with respect to a particular legal provision is not informed to the taxpayers at the very inception. While steps have been taken by CBDT in the recent years to keep the taxpayers pre-informed about Taxman’s position by issuing guidelines such as for section 194O, 194R and 194Q, however, still there lies a huge gap.  In this relation, one of the steps which can be taken by Government is to mandate publication of a compendium of clarifications by the CBDT. The compendium can provide the tax department’s understanding of each provision and also its position on ambiguous issues. All the circulars which have already been issued should also get consolidated to form part of such compendium. Also, the clarifications issued and positions stated in the compendium must be binding on the tax department. The compendium shall act as a one-point reference for the taxpayers and provide them certainty regarding tax implications on their proposed businesses or transactions.Schemes to pay tax on gross basis instead of net basis A significant chunk of tax disputes which are pending before multiple forms in India are on account of allowability of deductions while computing income especially under the head ‘profits and gains from business and profession’. Also, considerable amendments are made each year to provisions which further adds to the complexity. In order to provide certainty to taxpayers and also reduce prolonged litigation, taxation on presumptive income or gross basis of taxation should be promoted. For instance, in the existing law, certain payments to non-residents such as royalty/ fee for technical services are taxable on a gross basis. Similar provisions can be introduced for taxation of certain categories of income earned by residents as well.  Also, in the existing law, there are provisions such as section 44AD and section 44ADA which provide for taxation of presumptive income. However, only limited taxpayers are able to obtain the benefit of said schemes considering the narrow eligibility criteria. The upcoming budget can consider expanding the coverage of such schemes by extending the same to more businesses and by increasing the monetary limits.  Inclusion of new transactions under the ambit of Transfer Pricing Safe Harbour Rules under Rule 10TD of the IT Rules Another welcome move would be rationalisation of safe harbour rules provided for transfer pricing purposes. In the existing rules, safe harbour criteria are provided only for 11 transactions. Amendments should be proposed to expand the list and also to make the safe harbour criteria more reasonable considering the existing business trends. Today, even though the taxpayers may wish to avail the benefit of safe harbour rules, they are discouraged due to significant margin requirement in the rules in comparison to the industry benchmarks. The aforementioned measures will enable the Government to move a step forward for achieving its overall objective of simplification of income tax law. It shall also enable the taxpayers achieve more certainty and reduce prolonged litigation. With Budget 2025 around the corner, the expectations are running high. Let us hope the revamped income tax law is worth all the wait. Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 29, 2025

One of the key areas of focus is expected to be the new tax regime, which the government has been promoting in recent years. ""The new tax regime was first introduced in Union Budget 2020-21 by inserting a new section, 115BAC, in the Income Tax Act for individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs). The Finance Minister, in her budget speech while introducing the new regime, said that this scheme shall bring relief in personal tax and simplify taxation. The new regime provides an option to avail concessional slab limits and tax rates if the taxpayer does not claim specified exemptions and deductions,"" said Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary, Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society (BCAS).WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT PRIORITISING NEW TAX REGIME? ""The government has been clear about encouraging taxpayers to opt for the new regime. The tax statute includes several exemptions, deductions, and allowances, which make income tax return filing and processing complex. The main reason for introducing the new tax regime was to simplify the personal taxation framework with fewer deductions and simple tax rates,"" said Bhuta. He added that the new tax regime also helps the Income Tax Department in processing returns more efficiently, as it reduces subjectivity due to multiple deductions. Since its introduction, the government has made continuous efforts to make the new regime more attractive. ""Improved rebates, modified tax structures and slab rates, reduced surcharges, and the extension of standard deductions are some of the changes made in the last couple of years to encourage taxpayers to transition from the old to the new tax regime,"" he said.DOES OLD TAX REGIME STILL HAVE AN ADVANTAGE? ""The rates under the new tax regime are lucrative, but the non-availability of certain deductions, like interest on loans for acquisition or construction of self-occupied property, has led to its lower popularity,"" said Dipesh Jain, Partner at Economic Laws Practice. He explained that under the old tax regime, taxpayers had the benefit of setting off income earned under any other head with ‘loss from house property’ due to interest paid on home loans, up to a maximum of Rs 2,00,000. This benefit is not available under the new tax regime, increasing the overall tax burden. ""The old tax regime may be more attractive than the new regime if the taxpayer is eligible and can claim higher tax benefits, deductions, and exemptions available under it. However, it is important to note that while the old tax regime offers flexibility for deductions, it involves significant time and cost for effective tax planning, filing, and compliance,"" said SR Patnaik, Partner (Head-Taxation), Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. He added that with the government's focus shifting towards the new tax regime, taxpayers should consider transitioning to align with future policy changes.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Must Watch

The two-wheeler company’s stock rose over 5% to hit a day’s high of Rs 8,803.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). At around 12:27 pm, shares of the company were trading 3.70% higher at Rs 8,702.90.   Bajaj Auto posted a 3% year-on-year (YoY) increase in standalone net profit for the December quarter. Net profit stood at Rs 2,109 crore, while revenue from operations grew 6% YoY to Rs 12,807 crore. On a sequential basis, profit after tax (PAT) rose 5% from Rs 2,005 crore in the September quarter, though revenue fell 2% quarter-on-quarter. It may be noted that the YoY revenue growth was supported by strong exports and gains from the domestic green energy segment. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 6% YoY to Rs 2,581 crore, with operating margins improving 10 basis points to 20.2%. Overall, Bajaj Auto’s volumes grew 2% YoY to 12.24 lakh units, with exports playing a key role in offsetting domestic market weakness.WHAT DO BROKERAGES SAY? Brokerage firm Nuvama maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 10,700. The brokerage highlighted better-than-expected EBITDA, supported by pricing, scale, PLI incentives, and cost management. Analysts at the brokerage expect export growth of over 20% and domestic growth between 6-8%, with revenue and EBITDA likely to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 12%, respectively, over FY25-27E. On the other hand, Axis Capital retained a ‘Sell’ rating, cutting its target price to Rs 7,550 from Rs 8,000. While exports are improving, the brokerage noted that Bajaj Auto lost over 100 basis points in market share over the first nine months of FY25. Lower volume assumptions led to a 7% cut in its EPS estimates for FY25-27E.

The study for the Fiscal Health Index 2025 spans a nine-year period from 2014-15 to 2022-23, when most states are likely to have been governed by more than one political party. The Niti Aayog used data from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) to prepare the Fiscal Health Index of 18 major states. It seeks to make it an annual practice.  Fiscal health refers to financial stability, measured by its ability to manage revenue, expenditure, debt, and deficits sustainably while supporting growth. The Niti Aayog's Fiscal Health Index 2025 ranking has factored in five parameters: quality of expenditure, revenue mobilisation, fiscal prudence, debt index, and debt sustainability. Odisha has emerged as the state with the best fiscal health and is followed by Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand and Gujarat. Not only have Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand emerged as surprises in the Top 5, even Uttar Pradesh, in seventh spot, has pulled off a good show. UP, like Bihar, which is in the 13th spot among the 18 states, was once among the Bimaru states, whose economies were on sickbeds. Also, Bihar (at 13), like Gujarat (at 5), is a dry state. It has chosen to forego excise collections from alcohol sales, which make up for a huge part of most state's earnings.

 The report lauds Odisha, which for the entire part of the study period had seen a government led by Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal.  Odisha excels in fiscal health with the highest overall index score of 67.8. It tops the Debt Index (99.0) and Debt Sustainability (64.0) rankings with better-than-average scores under Quality of Expenditure and Revenue Mobilisation, says the report. The Niti Aayog has flagged concerns regarding the economic state of the laggards. It says Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Kerala face ""significant fiscal challenges"".   Kerala and Punjab are struggling with low quality of expenditure and debt sustainability, while West Bengal faces revenue mobilisation and debt index issues. Here is a table categorising states based on their rank in Niti Aayog's Fiscal Health Index Report 2025

 Poor quality of expenditure means that the states are investing less on capex to build infrastructure while more on refinancing debt and paying wages and pensions.  Andhra Pradesh has a high fiscal deficit, and Haryana has a poor debt profile, the Niti Aayog report says. In the case of Andhra Pradesh, the earlier YSRCP government of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy spent just 10% of its entire budget allocation on capital expenditure, while diverting money towards populist schemes. After bifurcation in 2014, Andhra lost Hyderabad, a major revenue source, to Telugu twin Telangana, which is in 8th spot compared to Andhra's 17th. Several states have gone on borrowing overdrive in recent years to fund their populist measures, prompting even Prime Minister Narendra Modi to warn them, citing the example of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, whose economies went bust. ""See how reckless borrowing has left those countries reeling under debt burdens. If we follow the same example and spend recklessly, as some states have done, thinking that the burden is going to be borne by coming generations, then our country is also going to be ruined,"" Modi said in February 2023.     Pravakar Sahoo, senior lead researcher of the report, also points out that sound fiscal health at the state level is important for the nation's economic resilience. State governments have been doling out freebies, especially in election years, which have hurt the fiscal health of the states. Several states have a deficit budget, which means their spending is way more than their income. The AAP-led Delhi government even went ahead with a Rs 2,100 cash sop for women despite two Delhi government departments warning against giving even Rs 1,000 a month. The coalition government in Maharashtra, which includes the BJP, returned to power on the steam of its Ladki Bahin Yojna, a direct cash transfer scheme.   ""In recent years, fiscal management at the sub-national level has been a policy concern. Therefore, it has become imperative to monitor the fiscal health of states to ensure prudent fiscal management,"" Sahoo said, explaining the need for such a study.   The analysis covers 18 major states that drive the Indian economy in terms of their contribution to the national GDP, demography, total public expenditure, revenues, and overall fiscal stability, according to the Niti Aayog report.  Keeping tabs on the fiscal health of states is important given that they are responsible for approximately two-thirds of public spending and one-third of the total revenue. The country's economic stability hinges on these states to a great extent.Published By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Jan 29, 2025

It is available for a two-year period for a maximum deposit facility of up to Rs 2 lakh.  This government-backed savings scheme carries a 7.5% interest rate and has a partial withdrawal option. It aims to promote financial independence among women. However, the scheme is scheduled to end on March 31, 2025, and it remains uncertain whether it will be extended or not. Though this scheme was launched for a limited period, it played a key role in encouraging savings among women from the lower-income group and promoting women's empowerment. Sneha Jain, Founder & CEO @ Wealth Trust Capital Services told The Economic Times that the government may not continue with the scheme. “It is not likely to get extended as the government has collected good responses & deposits from this scheme last year. There is more shift towards equity investments & mutual funds. So, the response to the scheme wouldn't be as much as seen last year,” she said. On the other hand, Rajani Tandale, Senior Vice President, Mutual Fund at 1 Finance told The Economic Times that an extension of this scheme in the upcoming budget would be a welcome move. “Primarily designed to encourage savings among women in the lower-income group, it serves as an important initiative to build financial security,” she said. “With the scheme set to end on March 31, 2025, an extension in Budget 2025 would be a welcome move to further strengthen women's financial independence. Given the government’s focus on women-centric financial policies, it may consider either extending the scheme or introducing a similar investment alternative to sustain its impact,” Rajani Tandale added.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Tune InMust Watch

But the concerts weren’t just about music lovers swaying to 'Lights will guide you home' or 'Fix You', they were an economic powerhouse in action. Hotels were fully booked, flight prices soared, restaurants overflowed with fans, and even local street vendors saw a windfall. What was once just a night of live music is now a thriving sector, something Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently highlighted as the growing ‘concert economy.’ Live music is no longer just about the experience, but is a full-fledged industry. Much like Taylor Swift’s ‘Swiftonomics,’ concerts in India have shown how they can be economic boosters as well.  ""Today, the concert economy sector is also growing in India. A country which has such a huge legacy of music, dance, and storytelling, India is a huge consumer of concerts. There are many possibilities for the concert economy. The trend of live events and concerts has increased in the last 10 years,"" PM Modi said at the ‘Utkarsh Odisha – Make in Odisha Conclave 2025’ in Bhubaneswar. But what exactly is the 'concert economy' that PM Modi talked about?WHAT IS THE ‘CONCERT ECONOMY’? The 'concert economy' refers to the economic impact of live music events, which generate revenue for multiple industries, including hospitality, transport, food & beverages, merchandise, and event management. The sector has gained attention globally, with studies showing how concerts boost spending across different sectors. For example, the term 'Swiftonomics' was coined to describe the economic effect of Taylor Swift’s record-breaking world tour. The pop star’s concerts provided a major boost to local economies in the US, Europe, Singapore, and the UK. Estimates suggest her tour generated over $4.6 billion in North America alone and added nearly $1 billion to the British economy. The economic impact of concerts extends beyond just ticket sales. It includes increased bookings in hotels, flights, and trains, higher food and drink sales, merchandise purchases, and employment generation in event management and security services. The impact of such concerts is so huge that countries are making exclusive deals.  Taylor Swift’s exclusive deal to perform only in Singapore during her Eras Tour sparked outrage among neighbouring countries. Officials in Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines criticised Singapore for securing the concerts with financial incentives, arguing it deprived them of tourism revenue. Thailand’s Prime Minister claimed Singapore paid millions per show to block other Southeast Asian stops, as per media reports, while Filipino lawmakers called the deal unfair. Indonesia’s tourism minister even apologised to fans, saying Singapore had ""bought out"" the concerts.HOW BIG IS INDIA’S CONCERT ECONOMY? India is rapidly becoming a major market for live music events. A report by EY predicts that the number of large concerts, those with over 5,000 attendees, will reach 300 by 2025, marking a 50% increase from 2018. The revenue from concerts is also expected to reach Rs 1,000 crore, up 25% from current levels. Data from Statista places India at the 7th position globally for revenue from live events, ahead of countries like South Korea, France, and Australia. A Bank of Baroda Research report estimated that between Rs 1,600 crore and Rs 2,000 crore was spent on live events in just three months. The report also mentioned that if the concert sector continues to grow, annual private spending on concerts could reach Rs 6,000-8,000 crore.HOW CONCERTS IMPACT THE ECONOMY Live concerts do not just provide entertainment; they create a ripple effect across various industries: Hospitality: Hotels in concert cities experience near-full occupancy, with increased bookings at premium rates. Food delivery services also see a rise in orders. Transport: Flight bookings to concert locations have jumped as much as 350% for major events. Train bookings have also risen significantly. Employment: Large-scale events create job opportunities in event management, security, and logistics. Coldplay’s concerts are part of a larger trend of global artists choosing India as a key tour destination. International stars like Ed Sheeran, Cigarettes After Sex, and Shawn Mendes are expected to perform in India this year, continuing the trend of major artists performing for Indian audiences and further boosting the 'Concer Economy'.  Indian artists are also capitalising on the growing demand for live events. Punjabi singers Diljit Dosanjh and Karan Aujla have sold out multiple concerts across cities. Diljit’s ‘Dil-Luminati Tour’ saw tickets sell out within seconds, showing the massive demand for live performances. Other international artists have also drawn large crowds in India. Bryan Adams, 65, performed in front of 15,000 fans in Gurugram in December 2024. Dua Lipa and Maroon 5 have also held successful concerts in Mumbai.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 29, 2025Must Watch

Experts are hoping for the merging of both the old and new tax regimes to simplify the tax structure and avoid confusion. As of now, taxpayers need to choose between the old tax regime and the new tax regime, each having its own benefits and challenges. The old tax regime includes a host of exclusions and deductions, including HRA, Section 80C, 80E,80CCC, 80CCD, 80D and Leave Travel Allowance, etc. However, under the new tax regime, which was introduced in Budget 2020, the tax rates were reduced significantly. But, those who choose the new system cannot claim various exemptions and deductions, including HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D, etc. Hence, experts believe that taking the best of both the tax regimes and introducing a unified tax regime would benefit the taxpayers. Deepashree Shetty, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India, urged the government for a unified tax structure, which would bring much-needed clarity and enhanced tax benefits. ""The introduction of two tax regimes - the old tax regime and the new tax regime - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality is far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns,” she said. “In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework,” she added.

Jefferies downgraded Tata Motors from 'buy' to 'underperform'. The firm also reduced its price target to Rs 660 from Rs 930. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/explained-why-tata-motors-share-price-fell-9-percent-today-q3-results-should-you-buy-jefferies-nuvama-2672241-2025-01-30,"Tata Motors share price tanked over 9% in early trade on Thursday, plunging to its 52-week low of Rs 684.25.  Tata Motors share price opened at Rs 715 after having closed at Rs 752.45 in the previous session. The shares were trading at Rs 703.90, down 6.45% at the time the article was being written. It had a market cap of Rs 2,59,132.79 crore.  The fall in share prices came after the company reported its third-quarter (Q3 FY25) financial results, which missed market expectations on Wednesday. The weaker-than-expected earnings led to a correction in the stock, with several brokerage firms downgrading their ratings and cutting price targets. The company’s profit fell 22% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 5,451 crore for the October-December quarter. However, revenue from operations rose 3% YoY to Rs 1.13 lakh crore. The company's Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) declined 15% YoY to Rs 13,032 crore, while its EBITDA margin contracted by 240 basis points (bps) to 11.5%.  The weaker earnings prompted Jefferies, a global brokerage firm, to downgrade Tata Motors from ""buy"" to ""underperform"". The firm also reduced its price target to Rs 660 from Rs 930. The downgrade signalled that Jefferies expected the stock to face further pressure in the coming months. Nuvama Institutional Equities also lowered its price target for Tata Motors by 4% to Rs 720, while maintaining a ""reduce"" call on the stock. Nuvama stated that it had cut its FY25 EBITDA estimate for Tata Motors by 4%. The brokerage firm said it expects muted revenue and EBITDA growth of 2% annually between FY25 and FY27. For Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), Tata Motors' luxury car unit, Nuvama predicted volume contraction due to a decline in the order book, the discontinuation of Jaguar models, and weaker demand in key markets. Morgan Stanley retained its ""equal-weight"" rating on Tata Motors, setting a price target of Rs 853. The firm pointed out that the company’s lower revenue and return on capital employed (RoCE) guidance for JLR was a key concern. It noted that Tata Motors' Q3 numbers were weaker than expected, raising doubts about its near-term performance. UBS, another global brokerage, maintained a ""sell"" rating on Tata Motors, with a price target of Rs 760. The firm stated that the company’s guidance for the fourth quarter appeared ambitious, given the uncertainty in financial years 2026 and 2027. UBS highlighted that China’s economic recovery would play a crucial role in helping JLR achieve a 10% EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) margin in the next financial year.

Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group stated that the government is expected to support military modernisation, strengthen naval assets and give a boost to domestic manufacturing. ""In the realm of defence, we foresee budgetary allocation towards capital expenditure to hover around 7% to 8% in FY26; shall this be given effect, it would amount to approximately Rs 1.9 lakh crore. The modernisation of the defence forces, the strengthening of naval assets, and the promotion of domestic manufacturing would pave the way towards the realisation of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat and a successful Make in India,"" he said. “On the tax front, continuity would be important. Significant alterations in securities transaction tax or long-term capital gains tax would not be contemplated, as maintaining consistency in policymaking is crucial for regaining the confidence of investors during times of economic risks,” he mentioned. Naresh Kumar, COO, Lauritz Knudsen Electrical and Automation expects that the upcoming budget would promote innovation and strengthen business growth. “Sustained investments in infrastructure are imperative for India’s economic growth.  With capital spending on infrastructure now at 3.4% of GDP, we anticipate continued prioritisation of physical, digital, and social infrastructure as the nation works towards the vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047,” he said. “Key initiatives such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline and Gati Shakti Master Plan, especially towards smart cities, road transport and railways, can unlock opportunities for long-term sustainable growth,” added Naresh Kumar. Puneet Singhania anticipates a rise in capex allocation for the railways sector. “We think a record increase in capital spending for the railways, with increments reaching 15%-20%, amounting to about Rs 3 lakh crore. Priorities may include the rollout of the Vande Bharat train service to deliver long-desirable enhancements in the freight sector, juxtaposing contributory multi-modal cargo terminals, while incorporating advanced technologies such as AI into operations,” he added.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The entities whose registration has been revoked are Single Window Securities, Sunness Capital India, GACM Technologies, and Infotech Portfolio. The capital markets regulator said that these entities could have misused their registration without being members of a recognised stock exchange, which could have misled investors. In four separate orders, Sebi explained the main reason for the cancellation, saying that these stock brokers were no longer fulfilling the conditions required for their registration.advertisementWHY SEBI CANCELLED THEIR REGISTRATION Sebi took this step because these brokers failed to meet the necessary registration requirements. Sebi has strict rules regarding the registration of stock brokers. A stock broker must be a member of a recognised stock exchange to hold a valid registration. These four entities lost their stock exchange membership, which meant they no longer qualified to remain registered under Sebi’s Broker Regulations, 1992. The regulator said, “Since the entities are no longer holding membership of any recognised stock exchange, they no longer fulfil the conditions stipulated under Regulation 9(a) of the Broker Regulations, 1992, by which Certificate of Registration was granted to them.” Since the stock exchanges had already expelled these brokers, Sebi decided to cancel their registration. The information regarding their expulsion was communicated to Sebi by the respective exchanges. Even though their registration has been cancelled, these stock brokers remain responsible for any past actions taken when they were active. They also must pay any outstanding fees, dues, or interest owed to Sebi, as per the regulator’s orders. Sebi followed the proper legal procedures under the Intermediaries Regulations, 2008, before revoking their registration. This ensures that the process was transparent and in line with regulatory requirements.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 30, 2025

With inflation and the rising cost of living affecting household budgets, many are expecting the government to introduce income tax cuts, higher deductions, and a more simplified tax structure. Experts believe the budget could bring changes in income tax slabs, raise the basic exemption limit, and deductions under the new tax regime, and deadlines for tax filing, making the system more beneficial for taxpayers.MIDDLE-CLASS EXPECTATIONS: A LONG-STANDING DEMAND India’s middle class, which plays a key role in the country’s economy, has been waiting for meaningful tax relief for several years. Many taxpayers feel the current system does not offer enough benefits, especially when compared to rising expenses. Sandeep Bhalla, Partner, Dhruva Advisors, said, ""Revision of Tax Slabs: Increasing the basic exemption limit from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh and raising the threshold for the 30% tax rate from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh would provide substantial relief."" Many financial experts believe that raising the exemption limit and adjusting tax rates will increase disposable income, encouraging people to spend more, which could help boost economic growth.INCOME TAX RELIEF EXPECTATIONS According to Deepashree Shetty, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India, several key tax reforms should be considered in Budget 2025 to simplify income tax and reduce the burden on taxpayers. Shetty said that the current income tax slabs are inconsistent, with differences of Rs 2 lakh or Rs 3 lakh between various tax brackets. She suggested a more uniform approach with a consistent gap between slabs. She also recommended the introduction of a new 25% tax slab, which would provide further relief for middle-income earners. Currently, tax rates stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30%, and restructuring these slabs could make taxation fairer. Another key expectation is increasing the income limit for the highest 30% tax rate from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, which would benefit many taxpayers by lowering their tax liability.INCLUSION OF POPULAR DEDUCTIONS UNDER THE NEW TAX REGIME The new tax regime, introduced as an alternative to the old system, does not allow many popular deductions. Experts believe that including key deductions will make it more attractive for taxpayers.
Section 80C: Allow deductions up to Rs 2 lakh for expenses such as life insurance premiums and Employees' Provident Fund contributions.
Section 80D: Extend deductions up to Rs 1 lakh for health insurance premiums, helping families manage rising medical costs.
Section 80TTB: Provide a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from bank deposits, post office savings, etc.
Section 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim House Rent Allowance (HRA) under the new tax regime, which would provide relief to those paying rent.
HRA RELIEF FOR HIGH-RENT CITIES Currently, House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemptions are different for metro and non-metro cities. Shetty suggested that cities such as Bengaluru, Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Pune should be included under the ‘metro cities’ category, as they have high rental costs similar to Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. This change would help salaried individuals get a higher tax exemption on their rent, reducing their tax burden.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Must Watch

They are:STANDARD DEDUCTION  To make the new tax regime more attractive for the taxpayers, the government has raised the standard deduction to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000. Under the old tax regime, Rs 50,000 is available.EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTION TO NPS  Under Section 80CCD(2), deduction is available on an employer's contribution to the National Pension Scheme (NPS). However, the taxpayer's contribution to NPS is not available under the new regime, instead it can be claimed under the old regime.TRANSPORT ALLOWANCES FOR SPECIALLY-ABLED PERSON  Specially-abled persons are eligible for deductions on transport allowance under the new tax regime. It covers the commuting expenses from their residence to their workplace.EXEMPTION ON GRATUITY  Gratuity is the lump sum amount received at the time of leaving an organisation after completing a minimum of five years of service. The entire gratuity amount received by the government employee is exempted under the new tax regime. However, for non-government employees, the gratuity amount of maximum Rs 20 lakh is tax-exempt under the new regime.EXEMPTION ON LEAVE ENCASHMENT  Most employers allow employees to carry forward any paid or privilege leave that has not been utilised by them during the year. These leaves can be encashed at the time of resignation or retirement. Under the new tax regime, leave encashment is tax exempted, but, the exemption limit differs for a government and a non-government employee.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Experts hope for the government's efforts to improve the overall quality of education, greater allocations for student loans and integrating artificial Intelligence (AI) into advanced academic programs. Ashutosh Upadhyay, Founder, Cognio Labs believes that AI will be a game-changer in the field of education. ""The education sector is ripe for AI-driven transformation, with global EdTech AI solutions expected to reach $80 billion by 2030. We anticipate budget allocations for developing personalised learning platforms powered by adaptive AI algorithms. Key focus areas should include funding for AI-enabled student assessment tools, virtual learning environments, and automated content generation systems,” he said. “These measures will democratise quality education while creating a future-ready workforce equipped with digital skills,” Upadhyay added. Bhupender Kumar Som, Director, GNIOT Institute Of Management Studies urged increased financial support for students by way of loans and scholarships. “The government should present greater flexibility in education financing through increased allocations for student loans and decreasing rates on education loans, thereby making them accessible to aspiring students across the country,” he mentioned. “We urge the budget to introduce policies that make it much easier for foreign universities to open campuses in India and enable students to receive some of the best education in the world without the need to go abroad,” Bhupender Kumar Som said. Jaskiran Arora, Dean Education Quality, BML Munjal University urged upgrading the country’s education infrastructure and called for increased global partnerships. “To foster development, enhancing foreign investments and enabling foreign currency loans for educational institutions is crucial, particularly to upgrade infrastructure and adopt cutting-edge technology solutions,” he said. “The Budget should also focus on expediting clearances for foreign grants and donations, streamlining regulatory processes, and creating an environment conducive to global partnerships and digital learning capabilities to shape the future of India’s higher education system,” Arora mentioned.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Tune InMust Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/budget-2025-will-25-percent-tax-rate-individual-contributions-to-nps-raising-basic-exemption-limit-be-included-under-new-tax-regime-2672511-2025-01-30,"In order to simplify the tax system, the government introduced a new tax regime in 2020, with concessional tax rates and removal of certain deductions. Nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime for filing income tax returns for fiscal year 2023-24. Below are some of the tax proposals for the new regime which may find place in Budget 2025. Taxpayers could witness a raise in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3,00,000 to Rs 3,50,000, which would offer a much-needed relief to individuals by increasing their disposable income and raising consumption levels. While the employer’s contribution to NPS is tax-exempt under the new tax regime, the same is not the case with individual contributions to NPS. The latter is exempted only under the new tax regime. The government may now extend this exemption under the new tax regime too. Currently, rebate under Section 87A is applicable for income levels up to Rs 7 lakh. The government might extend this to Rs 8 lakh. Apart from the existing tax slabs, the government might announce a new tax slab with a 25% tax rate for income above Rs 15,00,000 to Rs 18,00,000, while income above Rs 18,00,000 may be levied with a 30% tax rate. Meanwhile, as 28% of the taxpayers continue to opt for the old tax regime, the government may also announce a few changes to the old tax regime.  The basic exemption limit may be raised from Rs 2,50,000 to Rs 3,00,000 by the government. Owing to the rising cost of living and increased educational expenses, the existing limit for children's education allowance and hostel allowance might be raised to Rs 2,500 per month and Rs 5,000 per month respectively from the earlier Rs 100 per month and Rs 500 per month. The government might consider extending leave travel concession exemption to international destinations under the old tax regime. Cities like Bangaluru, Gurugram, Noida, Pune, and Hyderabad may be considered for a 50% capping limit under the HRA exemption. The government may extend the house loan interest deduction from Rs 2,00,000 to Rs 2,50,000 and is likely to extend the eligibility period from five years to seven years from the date of acquisition of the property.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Ahead of this, the Finance Minister will present the Economic Survey 2024-25 in Parliament today. The Economic Survey is an important document that reviews the country’s financial health over the past year and provides insights into economic trends, challenges, and opportunities. The Economic Survey 2024-25 will be presented in Parliament between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM. Later in the day, Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran will brief the media at 2:30 PM, where he is expected to highlight the key findings and recommendations of the report. The Economic Survey is prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs under the guidance of the Chief Economic Adviser (CEA). This report is not just a collection of numbers but also offers insights into how different sectors of the economy have performed and what policy measures could be introduced. The survey covers GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, employment trends, foreign exchange reserves, and other critical aspects of the economy. One of the most important elements of the Economic Survey is its focus on emerging economic trends. It provides a roadmap for addressing key issues such as job creation, infrastructure development, financial sector reforms, and climate change policies. The document also looks at global economic factors that could impact India, including oil prices, trade relations, and currency fluctuations. The Economic Survey was first introduced in 1950-51 as part of the Budget documents. In the 1960s, it was separated from the Budget and is now presented a day before the Union Budget. Over the years, the survey has gained importance as it highlights economic strengths and weaknesses, helping the government plan its financial policies. This year, the survey is expected to address concerns such as economic slowdown, inflation, rupee depreciation, and the impact of global uncertainties on India’s economy. It may also suggest steps for boosting domestic consumption, encouraging private investment, and supporting key sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Every year, economists, investors, and policymakers closely follow the Economic Survey as it gives a detailed picture of India’s economic performance and sets expectations for the Union Budget. The document includes key economic indicators, sectoral growth analysis, and forecasts for the coming year.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Tune InMust Watch

This will be her eighth consecutive Budget speech. The Budget session will be held in two parts. The first part will run from January 31 to February 13, while the second part will begin on March 10 and end on April 4. Budget 2025 is expected to bring important changes to the country's tax system and help boost its overall growth with the GDP showing signs of a slowdown. Where to Watch Budget 2025 Live The Budget speech will be broadcast live from 11:00 am on February 1. It can be watched on the official Union Budget website (indiabudget.gov.in) and on Sansad TV. For live updates, you can also tune in to India Today TV and visit Indiatoday.in for the latest news and coverage. This will be Nirmala Sitharaman's second full Budget under the current BJP-led government which is in its third term. She has already tabled six full Budgets and two interim ones. She has now given more Budget speeches than former finance ministers like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P. Chidambaram, and Morarji Desai. In 2019, Sitharaman brought a new change by using a 'bahi-khata' (traditional account book) instead of the usual leather briefcase. Now, the Budget has gone fully digital - no paper is used, and this will continue this year too.  The Union Budget is one of the key financial documents for India. It outlines the government’s expected income and spending for the coming year. More than just a financial statement, the Union Budget helps guide the country’s economic plans and strategies.

Investors are on their toes looking for cues to tell them if market bulls will be dominant or will bearish sentiments take over. The announcements made during the Budget can have an impact on Dalal Street, with positive measures boosting investor confidence and negative ones causing market corrections. But will Sensex and Nifty open for trading on February 1, which is a Saturday? The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) have confirmed that the stock market will remain open for trading on Budget day. In a circular issued on Monday, both exchanges announced that trading will take place as per regular market hours. This means the equity market will function from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM, while commodity derivatives trading will continue until 5:00 PM. However, the T+0 settlement session will remain suspended due to the settlement holiday. The decision to keep the markets open aligns with past instances where trading was allowed on Saturdays for Budget announcements. Similar special trading sessions were held in 2020 and 2015 when the Union Budget was presented on a non-working day. This step ensures that investors can respond immediately to the government’s fiscal policies, tax reforms, and sectoral allocations that often influence market trends. Pre-market trading will take place between 9:00 AM and 9:08 AM, and the benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex will update live throughout the session. Market participants will closely track Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech for policy changes that could impact different sectors. The Union Budget is a crucial event for the stock market as it sets the economic direction for the year ahead. Investors will be looking for key announcements related to infrastructure, banking, manufacturing, and healthcare, which are expected to experience significant movement based on policy measures. Tax reliefs, fiscal deficit targets, and government spending plans will also play a vital role in shaping market sentiment. Historically, the Budget was presented on the last working day of February. However, in 2017, then-Finance Minister Arun Jaitley shifted the date to February 1 to allow more time for policy implementation within the financial year. Since then, the Union Budget has been presented on February 1 each year.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 31, 2025

The survey further said that the manufacturing sector faced pressures due to weak global demand and domestic seasonal conditions.

A strong push towards manufacturing and job creation could further improve the economic outlook.Strong Performance of IT, Auto, and Consumer Stocks Shares of IT, auto, and consumer durable companies have been among the biggest gainers.

While initial reactions may be mixed, markets often recover if key measures align with expectations.""Hopes of Tax Cuts for Individuals and Businesses Market experts believe that possible tax relief for individuals and businesses could boost spending and investments. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, ""Since we are heading into the Budget without a major pre-Budget rally, the chances of a post-Budget rally are higher if the government introduces growth-boosting measures like cuts in personal income tax. However, it is important to note that the Budget's impact on the market will be short-lived. In the long run, stock market trends will depend on GDP growth and corporate earnings.""Slower Selling by Foreign Investors Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been selling stocks in recent weeks, but the pace of selling has slowed down. Kranti Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, said, ""Foreign portfolio investors continue to be sellers, but the volume of selling has reduced significantly. If the Budget offers favourable policies, we may see more buying from both domestic and foreign investors.""Market Looking for Strong Corporate Earnings As corporate earnings for the quarter are being announced, investors are looking for companies with strong profits. Stocks of companies that have reported good results are rising, while those with weaker numbers are facing pressure. Analysts suggest that investors should focus on long-term opportunities rather than short-term movements around the Budget.Will the rally continue after the budget? Market direction in the coming days will depend on the Budget announcements. If the government presents policies that meet investor expectations, the rally could continue. However, unexpected changes or concerns over fiscal spending could lead to volatility. Experts advise investors to remain cautious and wait for the Budget before making major investment decisions.

Can the middle class get more tax relief under the new regime? Here's a look at their top five expectations from the government.advertisementRAISING BASIC EXEMPTION LIMITCurrently, the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime is Rs 3,00,000.

He started his speech with, “I pray to Goddess Lakshmi to shower the poor and middle class with blessings,” and referred to the terms 'innovation, inclusion and investment', hinting that the government is likely to roll out schemes that focus on offering economic and tax relief to these targeted groups. The country’s middle class can expect changes in tax slabs under the new income tax regime. The government may introduce an additional 25% tax rate for income levels between Rs 15,00,000 to Rs 18,00,000, while income above Rs 18,00,000 can be charged with a 30% tax rate, according to sources. It is also expected that the government might include a tax exemption for individual contributions to the National Pension Scheme (NPS) under the new tax regime. This would help reduce the financial burden of the middle class while giving a boost to their consumption levels. Moreover, the basic exemption limit of Rs 3,00,000 is likely to be extended to Rs 5,00,000 under the new regime. Today, President Droupadi Murmu announced expanding the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to an additional three crore famililies. The scheme offers affordable housing to eligible families belonging to the economically weaker section (EWS), lower income group (LIG) and middle income group I (MIG-I). In his speech, PM Modi referred to women empowerment. Hence, it is expected that Budget 2025 will introduce a range of schemes, initiatives and welfare programs targeting women. In other words, if the proposed tax changes, welfare schemes and measures are implemented in Budget 2025, they would provide the much-needed relief for the middle class, poor and women.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Meanwhile, the upcoming budget is expected to focus on core capex investments, particularly in infrastructure, renewable energy, defense, manufacturing, and technology, as highlighted in the Economic Survey. This could generate significant interest in these sectors and impact the broader market momentum.

The survey merely scratches the surface when it comes to workweek duration but comes amid a heated debate fuelled by recent remarks from business leaders advocating 70- to 90-hour workweeks. According to the survey, spending excessive time at work can be detrimental to mental well-being, with individuals working 12 or more hours a day experiencing significantly higher levels of distress. The report mentions studies by the WHO and the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which link working over 55–60 hours per week with increased health risks. ""While the hours spent at work are informally considered a measure of productivity, a previous study has documented adverse health effects when hours exceed 55-60 per week,"" the survey said, referencing findings by Pega F, Nafradi B (2021) and a WHO-ILO joint study on the work-related burden of disease and injury. The report also highlighted a study by the Sapien Labs Centre for Human Brain and Mind, which found that individuals working 12 or more hours a day had significantly lower mental well-being, significantly lower than those spending two hours or less at a desk. ""Spending long hours at one's desk is equally detrimental to mental well-being,"" the survey stated.BUSINESS LEADERS ON WORK-LIFE BALANCE  The discussion around work hours intensified after Larsen & Toubro Chairman and Managing Director SN Subrahmanyan recently remarked that employees should work 90-hour weeks, including Sundays, instead of staying at home. ""How long can you stare at your wife,"" Subrahmanyan had previously said, while expressing ""regret"" over being unable to ask employees to work on Sundays.  Subrahmanyan came under fire for his remark, with many calling his statement ""shocking"".  He was following in the footsteps of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, who suggested a 70-hour workweek, and Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, who quipped, ""Biwi bhaag jayegi (wife will run away)"" if one spent more than eight hours at home. However, these remarks have drawn criticism from within the business community. RPG Group Chairman Harsh Goenka pushed back against the idea, warning, ""Longer working hours is a recipe for burnout, not success."" Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra also chimed in, stating, ""It's not the number of hours you put in but the quality of work that counts."" Similarly, ITC Ltd Chairman Sanjiv Puri emphasised that empowering employees to perform effectively was more important than merely increasing work hours.WORK CULTURE NOT SOLE FACTOR INFLUENCING PRODUCTIVITY AND WELL-BEING ""Even in jobs with the best managerial relationships, about five days per month are lost because workplace culture is but one factor (among several) in determining productivity and mental well-being,"" it noted. Globally, the impact of mental health on productivity is significant. Citing WHO data, the survey stated that around 12 billion workdays are lost annually due to depression and anxiety, resulting in a financial loss of nearly USD 1 trillion. ""In rupee terms, this translates to about Rs 7,000 per day,"" the report estimated. The work-life balance debate in India mirrors a similar controversy in China, where the so-called ""996 culture""-working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week-has faced criticism for its impact on employee health and productivity. The Economic Survey emphasised that if India is to achieve its economic ambitions, immediate attention must be given to the lifestyle choices made during childhood and youth. ""Hostile work cultures and excessive hours at the desk can adversely affect mental well-being and ultimately put the brakes on the pace of economic growth,"" it warned. While fostering a better workplace culture can enhance mental well-being, lifestyle choices and family dynamics also play a crucial role. The survey results indicate that individuals who seldom consume ultra-processed or packaged junk food tend to have better mental well-being compared to those who do so regularly. Likewise, those who rarely exercise, frequently spend their free time on social media, or have distant relationships with their families exhibit poorer mental well-being.Published By: Nakul AhujaPublished On: Jan 31, 2025

The survey presented by the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman cited the country’s opportunities as well as challenges. The Indian economy is expected to grow between 6.3% to 6.8% in FY26, according to the survey. Strong domestic economic fundamentals coupled with steady inflation, stable private consumption and a decreasing inflation rate will help the country sustain its growth momentum. However, geopolitical and trade uncertainties could impact the nation’s growth. The World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund projects the Indian economy to reach $5 trillion by FY28 and $6.307 trillion by FY30. In order to achieve these projected rates, the country must grow at an annual rate of about 10.2% in USD terms for FY25-FY30. In order to become a competitive and innovative economy, the country must attract major investments, according to the survey. The survey also mentioned China's impact on shaping India’s economic future. Since China dominates the global economy for energy transition and supply chains and India has ambitious clean energy goals, the latter’s reliance on Chinese imports could pose economic and strategic challenges, particularly potential supply chain disruptions, currency risks and price fluctuations.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Investors and traders will be closely watching the announcements, as they can impact market sentiment. The Budget is one of the most important events for the stock market, with policy changes and fiscal measures often leading to sharp movements in stock prices. But since today is a Saturday, many are wondering whether the stock market will remain open for trading. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) have confirmed that the stock market will be open for trading on Budget day. In a circular issued earlier this week, both exchanges said that trading would continue as per regular market hours. The equity markets will operate from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM, while commodity derivatives trading will be available until 5:00 PM. However, the T+0 settlement session will remain suspended due to a settlement holiday. Stock exchanges usually remain closed on weekends, but special trading sessions have been conducted in the past when the Budget was presented on a non-working day. Similar instances occurred in 2020 and 2015, ensuring that investors could react immediately to the government’s fiscal decisions. Keeping the market open on Budget day allows investors and traders to respond in real time to key announcements, such as changes in tax policies, government spending plans, and incentives for different industries.STOCK MARKET TIMING TODAY Before regular trading begins, a pre-market session will be held from 9:00 AM to 9:08 AM to help determine opening prices. The benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex will be updated live throughout the day, reflecting market reactions to Budget announcements. The stock market often sees increased volatility on Budget day as investors react to announcements. If the government introduces policies that promote economic growth, markets may rise. On the other hand, unexpected fiscal measures or concerns about high spending could trigger market corrections. Historically, markets have shown mixed reactions on Budget day, with some years bringing strong gains and others seeing sharp declines. Earlier, the Union Budget was presented on the last working day of February. However, in 2017, the date was moved to February 1 to allow more time for the implementation of financial policies within the financial year. Since then, the Budget has been presented on February 1 every year.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 1, 2025

Experts suggest that the Modi 3.0 government may introduce measures to make the new income tax regime more appealing to taxpayers. There is speculation that the Modi 3.0 government may make the new tax regime more attractive by offering higher rebates or additional deductions. Many taxpayers still prefer the old tax regime due to the available exemptions and deductions. However, experts suggest that a simpler tax system could increase the number of people filing tax returns. Dipesh Jain, Partner at Economic Laws Practice, said, ""Choosing between the old and new tax regime is difficult for some taxpayers as they struggle to optimise their tax savings. A simpler tax system with clear incentives and fewer compliances can make tax filing easier and boost participation. The government's focus is to encourage more people to file taxes, and a simpler regime can help achieve this goal.""How to Calculate Your Income Tax?

Devam Sardana, Business Head, Lemonn mentioned that in the previous budget an increase in both STT and LTCG on the listed shares impacted the investors. “In the last budget, there was a dual impact of STT increase and LTCG increase (on listed shares) on the users with an increase in trading costs as well as impact on profitability of the users. Given that the revenue generation would have significantly increased with STT, this can potentially be used to revert the LTCG to 10% in order to ensure even higher market participation and incentivise long-term investment which is critical for the users and the capital market stability,” he said. “This can also address reduction in the flight of capital from India towards global markets and potentially contribute to rupee appreciation as well,” added Sardana.

At the same time, the planned rationalisation of TDS rates—by streamlining various categories into fewer, more uniform slabs—will significantly reduce confusion and compliance complexity across different sectors,” Chilana added.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 1, 2025

According to sources, the Prime Minister walked up to the bench where Sitharaman was seated and expressed his gratitude for presenting her eighth and the Modi 3.0 government's first Budget today. As she presented the Budget for this fiscal, Sitharaman said the top priorities will be to boost growth and enhance the spending power of the middle class, farmers, women and young people.

In one of the biggest reliefs for the middle class, the Finance Minister announced that taxpayers with salaries up to Rs 12 lakh would not be required to pay tax in the new tax regime. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister said the latest Budget is ""for the common man"", with the main focus on farmers, women and the young individuals of the nation.

This announcement is seen as a welcome move for senior citizens as it aims to provide enhanced financial relief, reduce their tax burden and boost their savings. Sitharaman said that since very old National Savings Scheme accounts are no longer earning interest, individuals will now be able to withdraw their savings with no taxes being levied on them. She stated, “A number of senior and very senior citizens have very old National Savings Scheme accounts. As interest is no longer payable on such accounts, I propose to exempt withdrawals made from NSS by individuals on or after August 29, 2024. I am also proposing to allow similar treatment to NPS Vatsalya accounts as is available to normal NPS accounts, subject to overall limits.” Meghna Mishra, Senior Partner at Karanjawala & Co. said, “Overall, this budget is highly beneficial for the middle class and senior citizens, with key measures aimed at increasing savings and boosting consumption. The increase in the TCS threshold limit from â‚¹7 lakh to â‚¹10 lakh and the doubling of the TDS threshold for senior citizens provide significant relief.” In other words, by reducing the tax liabilities for senior citizens, the new framework aims to provide greater financial relief to the retirees and the elderly.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 1, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The Harley-Davidson tariff has been a point of contention for several years between India and the US, and the US President Donald Trump has been batting for its reduction. The Budget announcements are anticipated to alleviate these strains. The import duty on motorcycles with engine capacities up to 1,600 cc, which are imported as completely built-up (CBU) units, has been slashed from 50 per cent to 40 per cent. For motorcycles with engine capacities exceeding 1,600 cc, the reductions are even more substantial with a drop to 30 per cent from 50 per cent. Additionally, the import duty on semi-knocked down (SKD) kits has been reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, and completely knocked down (CKD) units will now be taxed at 10 per cent, down from 15 per cent, according to the Union Budget presented on Saturday. This reduction in tariffs is expected to significantly lower the prices of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in India and will likely make these bikes more accessible to a broader range of customers, potentially increasing sales and market penetration for the brand. The decision to slash tariffs for imported bikes comes as Donald Trump threatened reciprocal taxes on countries that levy high tariffs on US goods. In December last year, asserting his tit-for-tat approach to taxation, Trump said that India’s taxes are excessive and stated, ""If they tax us, we tax them the same amount"". ""The word reciprocal is important because if somebody charges us - India, we don't have to talk about our own - if India charges us 100 per cent, do we charge them nothing for the same? You know, they send in a bicycle, and we send them a bicycle. They charge us 100 and 200. India charges a lot,"" he said.

Most Kerala tea-time snacks come under 18% GST From 'pazhampori' to 'ada' and 'undam pori,' beloved Malayali tea-time snacks find themselves caught in the bewildering GST maze. These humble delicacies come with an 18 per cent GST tag, all because they do not have the required 'classification' to be put elsewhere.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/pazhampori-parippu-vada-ada-malayali-tea-stall-snacks-18-percent-gst-rate-2673379-2025-02-02,"Any Malayali would know what a ‘pazhampori’ is. Anyone who’s ever set foot in Kerala or befriended a Malayali, has also likely encountered the beloved pazhampori.  For those unfamiliar with it, it’s a banana pakora or bhajji—banana fritter—made with the ripe plantain banana, native to Kerala.  And this tax season, let’s bring another lesser known fact to light: it comes under the 18 per cent GST bracket. For comparison, peanut chikki (peanut candy) comes under the 5 per cent GST bracket.  The reason? This quintessential tea-time companion, lacks an HSN (Harmonised System of Nomenclature) code, and in the labyrinthine world of GST, products without specific classifications often default to the highest tax bracket. This isn’t just the tale of one Malayali snack. According to Kiran S Palakkal, president of Bakers Association of Kerala (BAKE), numerous Malayali delicacies, which barely last 6-8 hours on the shelf, face the same highest tax rate, all because of the complexity of how goods are classified under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system.  Biju Prem Shankar, owner and COO of Fresh Products, a Kochi-based traditional snack company, shed light on the complex battle for tax clarity.  “For the past seven years, since GST was implemented, we have been asking for clarifications. Whatever clarification we have got so far is because we sat with chartered accountants, tax specialists and made a table of categories to classify each item and list them to be presented to the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR),” he explained. Then why has BAKE not pushed for pazhampori, or for that matter ‘ada’, ‘unda’, ‘undam pori’, ‘manda kottiyappam’—all Malayali snacks that have a shelf life of less than 24 hours—to be brought under a lesser tax rate?  Because only GST-paying companies can petition for clarification, not associations, Kiran S Palakkal stated. “Fresh Products manufactures unniyappam, and banana, potato, tapioca, jackfruit chips, so we applied for tax clarification on these items. They were not assigned any HSN code prior to this, and we got the ruling only in 2019,” Biju clarified. An unniyappam is a sweet made of rice flour and jaggery fried in oil; it comes under the category of ‘sweet meat’ and thus charged 5 per cent GST. Chips items come under the ‘fried namkeen snacks’ made out of fruits or vegetables classification, hence charged 12 per cent GST. Biju got the GST sorted out for the products his company manufactured so that “during audits the GST Council wouldn’t come back and make us pay the differential taxes, in case we charged it less,” he said. “Almost all Malayali snacks are taxed at 18 per cent GST. And it is not a recent issue or confined to pazhampori or who can apply for clarification to the AAR,” Kiran explained, saying it is much more complex than just categorisation. “The minute difference exists because there are thousands of products without an HSN code. And to be honest, all of them cannot be assigned one,” Biju said. As Biju pointed out, “Even region to region, a simple item will have its recipe tweaked. For example, ingredients used to make unniyappam in Kerala are used to prepare adhirasam in Tamil Nadu, and they both would come under ‘sweet meat’ category.” Adding another layer of complexity is the point of sale. “These same items if sold at a restaurant or a hotel will only be charged 5 per cent GST, all because these come under service goods,” Kiran explained. A completely different impediment for manufacturers lay in trying to charge GST on their products. “Kerala bakeries are different from the bakeries in the North,” Biju said. “In the North, they are actual bakeries selling baked confectionery. For other items like Indian sweets, savoury snacks, they have sweet shops. Then there are coffee shops and cafes.” “But in Kerala, a bakery is a generic term for a coffee shop selling Indian sweets, confectionery, namkeen (savoury fried snacks) items all in one place,” he explained. That makes it even more complicated to assign GST, as product to product, it varies, Kiran said. “These bakeries in Kerala they buy our Malayali snacks from MSMEs, small housewives preparing these items in their kitchens, or cooperatives like Kudumbashree selling snacks and bakery items,” Biju revealed, “unlike in a supermarket where packaged food needs to have specified information on it.” “The complexity of varying GST on different food items was brought up last year, too, by the owner of Coimbatore-based restaurant chain Sree Annapoorna’s D Srinivasan,” Biju recollected. Biju was talking about the incident in September 2024 during an interaction between Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and representatives of MSMEs and Chamber of Commerce in Coimbatore. Srinivasan had quipped: “The problem is that GST is applied differently to each item. For example, there is no GST on a bun, but if you add cream, GST becomes 18 per cent. Customers are asking to be given the bun and cream separately to save money.” “We are not trying to make a political statement. We, and I mean all food item manufacturers, especially the MSMEs, want a more uniform and simpler GST regulations to make our lives easier. This will benefit customers as well,” Kiran said. In the end, the pazhampori stands as a symbol of a larger issue: traditional culinary heritage clashing with modern tax complexity, where both makers and consumers hope for a simpler, more palatable solution. Until then, this beloved banana fritter carries not just the weight of its golden-brown crust, but also the burden of an 18 per cent GST tag. Published By: Deepthi Published On: Feb 2, 2025

In an interview with PTI, she said a 3 per cent depreciation in the rupee against the US dollar in past few months is a matter of concern as it makes imports costlier, but she rejected criticism that the local currency has seen all-round weakness. ""I am concerned but I will not accept the criticism that 'Oh Rupee is weakening!' Our macroeconomic fundamentals are strong. Rupee wouldn't be stable against all the currencies if the fundamentals were weak,"" she said. The Indian rupee has been under pressure in the last few months but it continues to be the least volatile currency against the US dollar among its Asian and global peers. The reasons for the rupee hitting record lows almost on a daily basis against the US dollar range from widening trade deficit to a surge in the dollar index after the US Federal Reserve hinted at fewer rate cuts in 2025. The Reserve Bank has reportedly spent USD 77 billion from its foreign exchange reserves to defend the rupee from falling sharply in the spot market, taking India's foreign exchange reserves down to USD USD 629.557 billion as on January 30, 2024, from USD 701.176 billion on October 4, 2024. ""Rupee's volatility is against the dollar. Rupee has behaved in a far more stable fashion than any other currency,"" Sitharaman said. Rupee volatility is noticeable as the dollar is strengthening. ""RBI also has been looking at ways in which it will interfere in the market only to stabilise the need for avoiding huge volatility based reasons. So we are all closely watching the situation,"" she said. She termed critics pointing to rupee volatility and depreciation as ""a very quick argument"". ""But in today's dollar strengthening environment and in the new US administration, the rupee will have to be understood in its relationship with the dollar (and) the fluctuations which come as a result of that.

""It is important to understand that the 25% tariffs imposed on Mexico and Canada are to punish them for issues like immigration and illicit trade in fentanyl. Trump may use tariffs again against other countries on non-trade issues. China’s response to the 10% tariffs has been more responsible. For now, they have not reacted like Mexico and Canada by imposing tariffs on imports from the US. Instead, they are moving the WTO against the US action.

Market experts believe that while the budget had some positive aspects, certain key areas did not meet expectations. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said, ""The market had mixed reactions due to the 10% year-on-year rise in capital expenditure (capex) for FY26, which was lower than expected. Sectors like railways, defence, and infrastructure, which the market relies on for performance, saw limited benefits, leading to cautious sentiment."" He added that consumption-driven sectors, which should benefit the most from higher disposable income, did not have a major impact on the broad market due to their market position. However, in the coming months, the market will likely factor in the overall benefits of the tax cuts and business-friendly measures.Budget 2025: Key announcements impacting the market One of the biggest highlights of the budget was the income tax relief for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. Sitharaman announced that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh per year under the new tax regime will not have to pay any income tax. “I am happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable on income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime,” the finance minister said in Parliament.Market outlook: What lies ahead? Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, believes that while the budget is positive overall, the focus has been more on consumption than capex spending. ""Markets had anticipated a stronger push towards capital expenditure, but the government has chosen a balanced approach. Defence spending has increased by 10%, which is still a positive sign for the markets,"" he said. He also pointed out that the next major trigger for the stock market will be the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy announcement in February. ""If the RBI announces a rate cut of 25 basis points, it will boost liquidity in the market and improve sentiment for banking and financial services stocks. The market has been waiting for such a move for a long time. A rate cut will further support the overall market sentiment,"" he added.Which stocks can investors bet on? For investors looking at opportunities in the current market, consumption-related stocks could be a good bet. According to Kranthi Bathini, “Investors with a medium to long-term view should consider FMCG stocks, as these companies have been in consolidation mode for nearly a year. Given their attractive valuations, we may see buying interest in consumer discretionary and consumer staples in the coming months.” The long-term outlook for the Indian stock market remains positive, but economic growth will be a key factor. “The GDP growth is currently projected at 6.9-7%, but for stronger market performance, it should ideally be in the 7-8% range. This would act as a positive trigger for Indian markets over the long term,” Bathini added.

One of the key highlights is that individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh will not have to pay any income tax under the new tax regime. However, this change has also led to some confusion, particularly regarding the terms 'rebate' and 'marginal relief.' With the introduction of new tax slabs, the Income Tax department has addressed concerns through explanations. While the rebate ensures that those earning up to Rs 12 lakh have no tax liability, marginal relief helps taxpayers who earn slightly above this limit so that they do not end up paying much higher taxes than those below the threshold.What is marginal tax relief? Marginal relief is a benefit given to individuals earning just over Rs 12 lakh. It ensures that the extra tax payable is not more than the additional income earned beyond the rebate limit. This prevents a situation where a small increase in income leads to a sharp jump in tax liability. For example, if a person earns Rs 12.10 lakh, their tax liability under the revised slabs would be Rs 61,500. However, with marginal relief, the individual would only need to pay Rs 10,000 as tax. This keeps their post-tax income close to that of someone earning Rs 12 lakh, who pays no tax.Who can benefit from marginal relief? Marginal relief is applicable only to individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh. The maximum rebate available under the new tax regime is Rs 60,000. However, marginal relief applies only to incomes up to approximately Rs 12.75 lakh. Beyond this amount, regular tax slabs will apply, and no additional relief will be available.New tax slabs and rates Under the revised new tax regime, the updated income tax slabs are:
Rs 0-4 lakh – Nil
Rs 4-8 lakh – 5%
Rs 8-12 lakh – 10%
Rs 12-16 lakh – 15%
Rs 16-20 lakh – 20%
Rs 20-24 lakh – 25%
Above Rs 24 lakh – 30%
 While the rebate and marginal relief are aimed at benefiting salaried individuals and small business owners, they do not apply to special categories of income. Taxpayers with income from capital gains, lottery winnings, or other special-rate earnings are not eligible for this relief. The marginal relief benefit applies strictly to standard income taxed under Section 115BAC. Experts believe that these tax changes will help increase disposable income for the middle class. Manmeet Kaur, Partner at Karanjawala & Co, said, ""The government aims to support the middle class by increasing the minimum tax-free slab from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime, along with a Rs 75,000 standard deduction.

The sharp decline comes despite the recent Budget announcements, as global factors and foreign investor activity continue to weigh on market sentiment. All the sectoral indices were trading in red other than Nifty consumer durables given the tax relief provided by the Finance Minister in her recent budget speech.  By 10 AM, the S&P BSE Sensex was down 707.67 points at 76,798.20, while the NSE Nifty50 fell by 242.55 points to 23,239.60. The decline in the stock market was led by heavyweight stocks like banking, financial, IT, metal, and energy sector stocks. Why is the market falling today? Several factors are putting pressure on Indian markets, including global trade tensions, foreign investor activity, and post-Budget adjustments.Global trade tensions after new US tariffs One of the biggest reasons for the market decline is the fresh round of tariffs imposed by the US on Mexico, Canada, and China over the weekend.
25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports
10% tariffs on Chinese goods
 These measures have increased concerns about a possible trade war, leading to a decline in markets worldwide. Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares, said, ""The markets were expected to be in the red after the US imposed new tariffs on key trading partners, sparking fears of a trade war. Even though India is not directly affected, the global impact is being felt in our markets as well. Investors are also reacting to sectoral changes from the Budget, while focus has now shifted to the upcoming MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) meeting.""Foreign investor selling puts pressure on markets Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been selling Indian stocks in recent months.
FPIs sold nearly Rs 1 lakh crore worth of Indian equities in January.
After the Budget, investors are watching to see if this selling continues.
 Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, said, ""Foreign investors had reduced their participation before the Budget. Now, we need to see how FPIs behave today. Their activity will be crucial in determining if the markets recover or fall further. Trump’s tariff announcements have added more pressure on Indian markets in the short to medium term.""Rupee hits all-time low The rupee fell to a record low of Rs 87.07 against the US dollar on Monday, as global currency markets reacted to fresh trade tensions. The decline came after US President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on key trading partners, strengthening the US dollar and putting pressure on Asian currencies. The rupee dropped 0.5% in early trade, and traders expect further weakness throughout the day.Strengthening US dollar leads to FII outflows The US dollar index has risen above 109.6, making the American currency stronger. A stronger dollar usually leads to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) selling their holdings in emerging markets like India. Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explained, ""Despite an excellent Budget, the market is under pressure due to Trump’s tariffs and rising global uncertainty. The 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were imposed for reasons beyond trade, and this could mean similar actions against other countries in the future. China’s response has been more measured so far, moving to the WTO instead of imposing counter-tariffs. But overall, the dollar’s strength is leading to more FII selling in India, adding to market pressure.""Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 3, 2025Must Watch

The company has warned that this dispute could impact its $1.5 billion investments in India and harm the country’s foreign investment climate, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters. The tax dispute began in September 2024, when Indian authorities issued a $1.4 billion tax notice to Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto Volkswagen India unit. Officials alleged that Volkswagen misclassified its imports to pay lower customs duties. According to the government, Volkswagen broke down imports of some VW, Skoda, and Audi cars into separate components, instead of declaring them as completely knocked down (CKD) units. CKD units attract a higher 30-35% import tax. Individual car parts are taxed at a lower 5-15% rate. Authorities claim Volkswagen imported nearly complete vehicles in an unassembled condition but used a loophole to pay less tax by classifying them as separate parts.Volkswagen’s defence: The government knew about this model Volkswagen has denied any wrongdoing and says it had been transparent about its import model. The company argues that it informed Indian authorities in 2011 about its ""part-by-part import"" method and had received official clarifications supporting this approach. The lawsuit, filed on January 29 in the Mumbai High Court, as quoted by Reuters, said, ""The tax notice is in complete contradiction of the position held by the government ... (and) places at peril the very foundation of faith and trust that foreign investors would desire to have in the actions and assurances of the administration."" Volkswagen has said it is using all legal options while continuing to cooperate with authorities to ensure compliance with local and global laws. A government source told Reuters that if Volkswagen loses the case, the total tax and penalty amount could reach $2.8 billion. For context, in 2023-24, Volkswagen India reported sales of $2.19 billion (Rs 18,100 crore) and made a net profit of just $11 million. This means the tax penalty could be far greater than Volkswagen India’s annual revenue and multiple times its profit.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 3, 2025Must Watch

The review, which follows crypto-friendly policy announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump, could further delay publication of a discussion paper on cryptocurrencies that was due for release in September 2024. ""More than one or two jurisdictions have changed their stance towards cryptocurrency in terms of the usage, their acceptance, where do they see the importance of crypto assets. In that stride, we are having a look at the discussion paper once again,"" India's Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth said in an interview. Seth said that because such assets ""don't believe in borders"", India's stance cannot be unilateral. He did not specifically mention the United States, where Trump last week ordered the creation of a cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing new digital asset regulations and exploring the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile, making good on his promise to overhaul U.S. crypto policy. Indians have poured money into cryptocurrencies in recent years despite the country's tough regulatory stance and steep trading taxes. India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) issued show-cause notices to nine offshore cryptocurrency exchanges in December 2023 for non-compliance with local rules. Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, was hit with a fine of 188.2 million rupees ($2.25 million) in June 2024, a month after it registered with the FIU in an effort to resume operations in the country. Last year, India's market watchdog recommended that several regulators oversee trade in cryptocurrencies, in a sign that at least some authorities in the country are open to allowing the use of private virtual assets. That position stood in contrast to statements by the nation's central bank, which has maintained that private digital currencies represent a macroeconomic risk.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 3, 2025

The tax-free threshold has been increased from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 12 lakh. And with a standard deduction of Rs 75,000, salaried taxpayers earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh annually do not need to pay any tax. But what if you have a higher annual income, say Rs 13 lakh or more? You can still end up paying no tax. This is because you can still opt for eligible deductions under the new income tax regime. For instance, a person can claim deductions under the new tax regime for investments in the national pension scheme (NPS). Under Section 80CCD(2), deduction of up to 14 is available on an employer's contribution to the National Pension Scheme (NPS) However, the taxpayer's NPS contribution is not deductible under the new regime and can only be claimed under the old regime. Let’s break it down with an example.  For an annual income of Rs 13.5 lakh, assuming a 50% basic salary of Rs 6.75 lakh, an NPS contribution of Rs 94,500 (at 14%), and a standard deduction of Rs 75,000, the taxable income reduces to Rs 11.8 lakh, resulting in zero tax under the new regime. Taxpayers who are opting for the new tax regime should note that an annual income of up to Rs 13.7 lakh can be free from tax if the employer contributes to NPS. However, at the moment, not many corporates have adopted the NPS benefit for employers. In fact, not many employees are also keen on signing up for NPS due to the long lock-in period and partial 60% withdrawal on maturity rule. The remaining 40% has to be invested in an annuity scheme for a steady source of income (pension) after retirement.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 3, 2025Must Watch

""Instead, it may cause challenges to the global economy, heightening global financial risks. International trade, which had flourished under the framework of globalisation, now faces threats from the new protectionist policies.

The company has called the demand contradictory to India’s import tax rules. Volkswagen has warned that this tax dispute could affect its $1.5 billion investment in India and impact the country’s appeal as a destination for foreign investment. The case is currently being heard in the Bombay High Court. ""Volkswagen AG has instituted legal proceedings against the Union of India, challenging an unprecedented and exorbitant tax demand of $1.4 billion, which the automaker contends is not only legally unsustainable but also violative of the fundamental principles of taxation jurisprudence,"" said Tushar Kumar, Advocate, Supreme Court of India. WHY HAS VOLKSWAGEN FILED THE LAWSUIT? Kumar explained that the crux of Volkswagen’s petition lies in the allegation that Indian tax authorities have arbitrarily and retrospectively sought to reclassify its imports of automotive components as completely knocked-down (CKD) units, thereby imposing a substantially higher duty structure of 30-35%, as opposed to the 5-15% duty applicable to component imports.  ""The Income Tax Department claims that the Company has wrongfully categorised nearly complete cars as individual parts, allowing it to pay lower customs duties. As per the Indian Tax rates, Importing completely knocked-down (CKD) car kits attracts a lower 5-15% duty and Importing fully assembled cars (Completely Built Units - CBU) incurs a 30-35% duty. The claim of the Govt was that Volkswagen took undue advantage of the CKD rate and has now issued a demand to recover the difference,"" said Alay Razvi, Managing Partner, Accord Juris. IMPLICATIONS OF THE LAWSUIT Volkswagen denied all the allegations and claimed that the classification was done with government approval by following proper procedure and necessary clearances were obtained. However, the tax demand contradicts India’s own regulations. Volkswagen explained how the Tax Department is taking inconsistent stance.  ""Volkswagen explained how it is jeopardising its reputation in the Indian market. The case stands posted to February 05, 2025. In the event the case is dismissed, Volkswagen can file an appeal before the Supreme Court,"" said Razvi.  The ruling against Volkswagen could impact the tax treatment of other companies operating in India. ""Volkswagen will have to pay heavy tax demand which can have a major impact on the company and subsequently other companies who will end up paying the said amount. It could lead to financial crises in the automobile sector. In the event , Volkswagen  is successful, it will set a precedent on how similar cases can be handled in the future,"" added Razvi.

This decision is expected to be one of the key discussions at the meeting. The official agenda for the meeting has not yet been shared, but media reports indicate that finalising the interest rate for the current financial year will be a priority.  An official communication confirmed that the 237th meeting of the CBT will take place on February 28. “The 237th meeting of the CBT of the EPF is scheduled to be held on February 28,” said an official document as quoted by Businesstoday.in.  The CBT, which is led by the Union Minister for Labour and Employment, is the top decision-making body of the EPFO. It includes representatives from employer associations, trade unions, and central and state government officials. For the financial year 2023-24, the EPFO had set the interest rate on provident fund deposits at 8.25%, an increase from 8.15% in 2022-23. The upcoming meeting will decide whether the interest rate will be increased further or remain unchanged. The last CBT meeting was held on November 30, 2024, where a key decision was taken regarding interest payments on PF settlements. Earlier, interest-bearing claims were not processed between the 25th and the end of each month, leading to a loss of interest for members. The new rule ensures that interest will be paid until the date of settlement, which is expected to reduce delays and improve fund management. According to the EPFO’s Annual Report for 2023-24, which was approved in the previous CBT meeting, the number of contributing establishments increased by 6.6% to 7.66 lakh from 7.18 lakh in 2022-23. The number of active EPF members also saw a rise of 7.6%, growing from 6.85 crore in 2022-23 to 7.37 crore in 2023-24. With more people contributing to the EPF and expectations of higher returns, the interest rate decision at the upcoming meeting will be closely watched as millions of employees rely on these deposits for their long-term savings.

The rally in the stock market can be attributed to three key factors: Global market recovery - After a sharp fall in equity markets worldwide on Monday, positive signs emerged on Tuesday. The US administration decided to temporarily freeze tariffs on Mexico and Canada, sparking optimism among investors. Experts believe this strategy of imposing tariffs and then negotiating could be extended to China as well, reducing concerns of a prolonged trade war. Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “The decline in the dollar index to 108 is a positive development. Investors, especially domestic institutional investors (DIIs), are likely to increase their investments, particularly in discretionary consumption segments such as automobiles, white goods, jewellery, hotels, and food delivery businesses.” Rupee recovery - The Indian rupee recovered by 13 paise, moving from its all-time closing low of 87.28 to 86.98 against the US dollar. The improvement in the currency’s value eased concerns among foreign investors, helping boost market sentiment. Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, said, “The global cues are quite positive, and statements from the US about relaxing trade tariffs have also supported the market’s recovery. After two days of losses, buying interest from Indian investors has increased. Additionally, the services PMI index has touched a six-month high of 57, indicating a pickup in economic activity.” Rate cut expectations from RBI - Investors are anticipating a 25-basis-point rate cut in the upcoming RBI monetary policy. This expectation has added to market optimism, as lower interest rates can reduce borrowing costs and boost economic growth. Bathini added, “The market is already factoring in the possibility of an interest rate cut. If the RBI takes this step, it could further support economic recovery and corporate earnings.”Sectors leading the rally Most sectoral indices were trading in the green, with banking, financials, IT, and auto stocks showing strong gains. The FMCG sector was the only one in red, as some profit booking was seen after last week’s gains. Stocks of NBFCs like Bajaj Finance, M&M Finance, and Shriram Finance were showing strength, indicating continued positive momentum in the sector. Aditya Gaggar, Director at Progressive Shares, noted, “We continue to remain bullish on the auto sector, with a stock-specific approach.

NBFCs are performing well, and we expect this trend to continue.”Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Must Watch

One of the key announcements by the Finance Minister Nirmal Sitharaman was the introduction of 'Prime Minister Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana', which aims to enhance agricultural development, crop diversification and adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. This programme is expected to benefit 1.7 crore farmers across 100 districts with low productivity. In order to address the issue of underemployment in agriculture, the government has announced the ‘Rural Prosperity and Resilience’ programme. It aims to create job opportunities in rural areas and focusses on rural women and youth, young, marginal and small farmers, and landless families. The scheme also aims to incorporate global and domestic best practices, with financial support from multilateral development banks. Sanjay Shirodkar, Co-Founder, Wavar said, “The Union Budget 2025-26 reinforces the government’s commitment to sustainable agriculture and farmer empowerment. The introduction of the PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana and the enhanced credit support for farmers are welcome steps that will drive innovation and technology adoption in the sector.” Next, a 'National Mission on High Yielding Seeds' will be implemented to improve seed quality, ensuring high yields, pest resistance and climate resilience. Budget 2025 also introduced the ‘Mission for Cotton Productivity’, to facilitate improvements in productivity and sustainability of cotton farming. Moreover, to ease credit access, the government has announced Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) for extending short-term loans, which would benefit 7.7 crore farmers, fishermen, and dairy farmers. Rajnikant Behera, Executive Director – Finance, RSB Group has welcomed this move. “With agriculture as a key growth driver, expanded KCC credit (short-term loans of up to Rs 5 lakh), will enable farmers to invest in advanced machinery, driving demand for quality agricultural equipment,” he mentioned. Vasu Naren, Chairman & Managing Director, Sona Machinery said, “With the right policy support and effective implementation, these initiatives in the Union Budget 2025 will modernise India’s agricultural landscape, enhance value addition, and accelerate the country’s journey toward self-sufficiency in key commodities.""

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/consumption-capex-has-the-government-prioritised-spending-over-growth-2674524-2025-02-04,"The key focus of Budget 2025 was income tax relief for the middle class, which was expected given the anticipation of boosting consumption amid a slowdown in the GDP.  The government also maintained its fiscal deficit target at 4.4% of GDP while focusing on improving the ease of doing business. Unlike previous Budgets, which aimed to boost capital expenditure (capex) by increasing allocations, this time the priority seems to be ensuring efficient use of funds rather than just raising spending. However, an important point to discuss is, has the government given more importance to consumption at the cost of capital expenditure? Or has it struck a balance between the two? Sunil Damania, Chief Investment Officer at MojoPMS, believes the Finance Minister has not shifted focus away from capital expenditure. ""If we analyse the total capex—which includes central government spending, grants provided to state governments, and investments by central public sector enterprises—it is projected to reach Rs 20 lakh crore by FY2026. For an economy with a size nearing Rs 350 lakh crore, this level of capex is highly significant and supportive of growth,"" he said.  He also highlighted the Rs 1 lakh crore tax rebate announced in the Budget. Unlike a one-time stimulus, this is a recurring benefit that will improve disposable incomes over the long term, thereby boosting consumption. According to him, the government has adopted a well-balanced strategy, promoting both capex and consumption to sustain economic momentum.FOCUS ON CONSUMPTION? Some experts, however, feel that the government has moved away from aggressive capex-led growth. Harsh Madhusudan Gupta, Fund Manager at Ionic Asset, believes the government has “effectively closed the post-Covid capex mega-push chapter” and is now letting consumption and private capex lead the next phase of economic growth. He pointed out that the large income tax cuts in the new tax regime were aimed at increasing disposable income and driving consumption. “A faster-than-expected reduction in the fiscal deficit to 4.4% of GDP could help bond yields ease, especially as India enters the Bloomberg Emerging Market Bond Index this week. This also makes a rate cut by the RBI in its February 7 policy meeting more likely,” he added. Concerns were raised about Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPI) after heavy outflows in January. However, experts expect a recovery in February. Damania said that the US stock market appears overvalued and is facing uncertainties due to tariff-related policies. This could lead to increased capital flows into emerging markets like India. “As for the US tariffs, it is unclear how beneficial they will be for their economy. Markets will react to developments as they unfold,” he said.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Tune InMust Watch

This would help result in greater savings among retirees.EXTENSION IN UPDATED TAX RETURN FILING Union Budget 2025 has extended the time limit to four years from the current two years for filing the updated income tax returns, thereby allowing more time for taxpayers to voluntarily disclose their correct income.TAX EXEMPTION ON NSS WITHDRAWALS Withdrawals made from the National Pension Scheme (NPS) on or after August 29, 2024, will be exempted from tax.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/why-hindenburg-went-after-adani-group-founder-nathan-anderson-breaks-silence-2674623-2025-02-04,"Hindenburg Research founder Nathan Anderson spoke for the first time about why the US-based short-selling firm decided to investigate the Adani Group. In an interview with news agency PTI, Anderson said the decision was based on “red flags” raised by some media groups. He also defended the firm’s findings, saying he stood by all the reports published by Hindenburg.  “We initially saw media articles outlining red flags, took a closer look, and just kept following the evidence,” he said in the interview. The Hindenburg report, released in January 2023, accused the Adani Group of using offshore companies to inflate revenue and manipulate stock prices while accumulating debt. The report led to a sharp fall in the stock prices of Adani Group companies, wiping out over $150 billion from their market value. However, over time, the group managed to recover a major portion of the losses. Addressing claims that Hindenburg’s report was an attack on India’s economic growth, Anderson rejected the allegations. “We have always believed in India’s potential and view market transparency and strong corporate governance as key factors that can fuel India's growth story,” he said. Adani Group had strongly denied the allegations made in the report and called it a deliberate attempt to damage its reputation. The matter reached the Supreme Court of India, which later ruled that no further investigation was needed beyond the ongoing probe by market regulator Sebi. In January 2025, Anderson announced that he was shutting down Hindenburg Research. He clarified that the decision was not due to legal or personal threats. “As to why I retired, is all in the letter. It is not based on any threat, health issue, personal issue, or otherwise,” he said. Many questioned why Anderson did not step away and let someone else run Hindenburg. He responded by saying that the brand was too closely tied to him. “Hindenburg is basically synonymous with me. If it was a software application or a bicycle factory, you could sell the application or the factory. But when it's research driven by me, you can't really just hand that off,” he explained. However, he hinted that his former team might continue working under a different brand. “I am happy to support the team if they want to launch a new brand, which I expect they will,” he said. Despite shutting down Hindenburg, Anderson maintained that all the firm’s reports, including the one on Adani Group, were accurate. “We 100% stand by all of our research findings,” he said.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Must Watch

At the Budget Round Table 2025 event organised by India Today and Business Today, Sitharaman did not clearly mention any policy related to cryptocurrencies or VDAs (virtual digital assets). When mentioned that 97% of the country’s crypto trading has shifted offshore, which has led to a loss of about Rs 6,000 crore in TDS revenue to the government, owing to the government’s strict stance on cryptocurrencies, the FM took note of it. When asked if President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly stance may influence India’s approach, Sitharaman said, “We are not against distributed ledger technology.” However, the government is focused on tackling these transactions, hence it introduced TDS and TCS for cryptocurrency assets.

When asked about the contrasting approach of Washington DC and Delhi on cryptos, Sitharaman said, “That’s right, we are India.

However, credit cards generally come with prerequisites like minimum credit score, monthly income, proof of employment, etc., which a student may not be able to fulfil. However, to address this gap, banks have come up with student credit cards with relaxed eligibility criteria. They may be standalone credit cards or add-on cards which are issued alongside the primary credit card being issued to a family member. That said, this article would explore eligibility, documentation and the application process for owing a student credit card.WHAT IS THE ELIGIBILITY OF STUDENT CREDIT CARD? Generally, a student credit card is issued to an applicant aged 18 years and above. The applicant should have enroled at a college or university. He/ she must be an Indian citizen.DOCUMENTS REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR A STUDENT CREDIT CARD Key documents for applying for a student credit card include an Aadhaar card, PAN card, the latest passport-sized photographs and an ID card issued by a college or university.APPLICATION PROCESS For applying for an add-on credit card, the family member who has the credit card with the bank must apply for the same. Download and complete the application form. Furnish the self-assessed photocopy of the PAN card and address proof of the applicant. While obtaining a credit card against a fixed deposit, the applicant must hold an FD account in the bank. While using a credit card, a student may enjoy benefits like emergency funds backup, and building a good credit score. However, it can have drawbacks too. At times, students fall into a debt trap as credit cards can feel like ‘free money’. Also, when compared to regular credit cards, student credit cards may have higher interest rates. That said, while the credit card can be a valuable financial tool, users must be aware of its potential misuse and pitfalls. Hence, a wise and responsible use of credit cards is the need of the hour.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 4, 2025Trending Reel

Currently, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) follows a four-tier structure with slabs at 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent, and 28 per cent. Luxury and demerit goods fall under the highest 28 per cent bracket, while essential items, including packed food, are taxed at the lowest 5 per cent rate. To simplify this framework, the Council-chaired by Sitharaman and comprising state finance ministers - has set up a Group of Ministers (GoM) to review and recommend changes. ""The process of rationalising and simplifying GST rates began nearly three years ago. Over time, its scope expanded, and now, the work is almost complete,"" Sitharaman said at the India Today-Business Today Post Budget Round Table. She emphasised the need for a thorough review, particularly concerning items of daily consumption, to ensure meaningful reforms. ""It was important not to miss this opportunity. The original intent was to have fewer and lower rates, and that remains our focus. I hope the GST Council will take a decision soon,"" she added. The finance minister's remarks come days after she presented the Union Budget 2025-26, which introduced significant income tax relief for the middle class. Addressing speculation, Sitharaman dismissed claims that the tax relief was politically motivated ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, asserting that it reflects Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to taxpayers. She also clarified that there are no plans to ""shut down"" the old tax regime. On capital expenditure, Sitharaman reiterated that spending has not been reduced but has, in fact, increased. The Budget has allocated Rs 11.21 lakh crore for capex in 2025-26, which is 4.3 per cent of GDP-higher than Rs 10.18 lakh crore in the revised estimates for FY25. She highlighted the steady rise in capex allocations over the years, from Rs 4.39 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs 10 lakh crore in FY24, demonstrating the government's commitment to infrastructure growth.

This will be the first policy meeting of Sanjay Malhotra as RBI Governor.  Analysts are divided on whether the RBI will cut the repo rate for the first time in nearly two years or maintain the current rate to manage inflation and currency stability. The six-member committee will announce its decision on February 7, 2025.WILL RBI CUT KEY LENDING RATES? Experts believe the RBI may reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to support economic growth, especially after the Union Budget 2025 focused on boosting demand. The repo rate has been unchanged at 6.5% since February 2023, and the last rate cut was announced during the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020. Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda, believes economic conditions are suitable for a rate cut. “The budget has provided a growth stimulus, and inflation is expected to ease. However, the rupee remains under pressure due to global trade uncertainties,” he said. While some believe a rate cut is likely, others feel the RBI may wait for global economic conditions to stabilise before making any changes. Edelweiss Mutual Fund predicts a 50 bps rate cut in the first half of 2025, saying that monetary policy will have to play a key role in supporting economic growth. Rumki Majumdar, Economist at Deloitte, believes the RBI will take a cautious approach. “Balancing inflation and credit growth is tricky. While there is pressure to cut rates, the RBI may choose to keep rates unchanged but maintain an easy policy stance,” she said. Umeshkumar Mehta, CIO at SAMCO Mutual Fund, feels that global factors will influence the RBI’s decision. “Bond yields in the US are rising due to inflation concerns, putting pressure on the Indian rupee. To avoid further depreciation, the RBI may choose to keep rates unchanged,” he explained.FACTORS THAT COULD IMPACT RATE CUTS The RBI’s decision will depend on several factors: Inflation trends: Inflation has remained above 5%, but a downward trend could encourage a rate cut. Currency stability: The rupee has been under pressure due to rising US bond yields and global trade tensions. Economic growth: With the government focusing on economic expansion, a rate cut could help boost demand. Global uncertainties: Trade wars and fluctuating commodity prices could impact the RBI’s approach. The stock market and bond markets will react based on the RBI’s decision. If the central bank cuts rates, banking stocks may see gains, and borrowing costs for businesses and individuals could come down. However, if rates remain unchanged, markets may turn volatile as investors adjust their expectations.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Must Watch

The benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, both closed over 1.5% higher, driven by gains in banking and financial stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex jumped 1,397.07 points to settle at 78,583.81, while the NSE Nifty50 climbed 378.20 points to close at 23,739.25. According to market experts, the next target range for Nifty stands at 23,900–24,200. The banking sector played a major role in Tuesday’s recovery, and analysts believe that the market’s momentum will depend on how the banking index moves beyond the 50,200 level. Ajit Mishra, SVP-Research at Religare Broking Limited, said, “Given the current market conditions, we continue to focus on selective stock picking, with a preference for large-cap and large mid-cap stocks.” Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Ltd., suggested that a buy-on-dips strategy remains ideal, as it has been successful in recent sessions. He added, “The Budget Day high of 23,630 now acts as immediate support, while the bullish gap near 23,400 is a key demand zone.” However, he warned that geopolitical tensions and ongoing trade wars could lead to volatility in the markets. Domestic factors such as the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting and the Delhi state elections will also influence investor sentiment. Banking stocks have been rising ahead of the RBI policy meeting, where analysts expect a rate cut. This will be the first policy meeting under the new RBI governor, making it a key event for investors. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said, “While overall market sentiment remains positive, large-cap stocks are the preferred choice. Meanwhile, banking stocks are rallying in anticipation of a rate cut in this week’s RBI policy.”STOCKS TO WATCH TODAY Several stocks will be in focus in today’s trade due to earnings announcements and key business developments.
Swiggy, Reliance Power, and Info Edge will be in focus as they are set to announce their quarterly results today.
Titan reported a 0.6% drop in net profit for the third quarter, at Rs 1,047 crore. However, its total income grew 25% year-on-year to Rs 17,723 crore.
Tata Power posted an 8% rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, reaching Rs 1,031 crore, compared to Rs 953 crore in the same period last year.
Hero MotoCorp, Bandhan Bank, and Tata Power are also expected to be in focus due to various corporate updates.
DEFENCE STOCKS IN FOCUS Defence stocks have been showing signs of recovery, driven by strong order books and rising exports. Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, said, “The defence sector still has strong earnings visibility. The defence budget has been increased to Rs 11 lakh crore, marking a 10% rise from the previous year.” He highlighted that Indian defence companies exported more than Rs 21,000 crore (about $2 billion) worth of goods last year. “Despite high valuations, these companies have a clear earnings outlook. After a 20-30% correction from their peak, defence stocks now look attractive for long-term investors,” he said.

US-China trade war: China's countermeasures appear more restrained compared to its approach during the previous trade war. This has raised a key question: Is China playing it safe in the latest trade standoff with the US?,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/china-us-tarifff-trade-war-actions-impact-all-factors-explained-2675093-2025-02-05,"China has hit back after US President Donald Trump announced new 10% tariffs on Chinese goods. Beijing's response included duties on about 80 American products, an investigation into Google, tighter controls on critical minerals, and the blacklisting of two US companies. However, this time, China’s countermeasures appear more restrained compared to its approach during the previous trade war. This has raised a key question: Is China treading cautiously in the latest trade standoff with the US? The answer lies in Beijing’s current economic challenges and the large trade gap it has with America. Rather than matching Trump’s move entirely, China imposed tariffs on a smaller set of US goods worth around $14 billion, according to Bloomberg News. The careful response marks a shift from its earlier strategy, when it would retaliate with equal measures against US tariffs. Instead of matching Trump's move completely, China only put tariffs on a small portion of US goods worth $14 billion, reported Bloomberg News. This careful approach is in stark contrast to how China acted during Trump's first term, when they would match US tariffs dollar for dollar.WHY CHINA HAS MORE TO LOSE The change in China’s strategy seems to be due to ongoing economic challenges. The country is dealing with falling prices and trying to fix problems in its property market. Right now, China heavily depends on selling goods overseas to keep its economy growing. The math makes China's position even more difficult. China sells more than three times as much stuff to the US as it buys from them. This means China has fewer American products it can put tariffs on if it wants to fight back. As Larry Hu from Macquarie Group told Bloomberg, China is being restrained because it ""has more to lose"" due to this huge trade imbalance with the US. Therefore, instead of getting into a full-blow tariff war, China might focus more on supporting its own economy through internal measures. Experts suggest China might try to make peace by promising to buy more American oil and gas, keeping its currency stable, or fulfilling previous trade promises. Both sides seem interested in making a deal. Trump has said he wants to talk with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, though he's in no rush. There are other issues on the table too, like Trump wanting China's help to stop the war in Ukraine and demanding changes to TikTok's ownership. For now, China is trying to look strong without making things worse. Josef Gregory Mahoney from Shanghai's East China Normal University told Bloomberg that it's like ""two giants sizing each up and testing each other's resolve while also playing to their domestic audiences before shaking hands."" But if things escalate, China's heavy reliance on exports to the US means it might have the most to lose in a full-blown trade war.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The arbitrator is likely to be a retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as per the report. The main issue is whether the right to appoint trustees belongs to the executors of Ratan Tata’s will, the Tata family, or the members of the Tata Trusts. Ratan Tata had set up two entities in 2022 to manage his personal wealth for charitable purposes—the RTEF under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013 and the Ratan Tata Endowment Trust. The RTEF also holds minor stakes in Tata Digital and Tata Technologies. Ratan Tata held a 0.83% direct stake in Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, and had a net worth of Rs 7,900 crore, as per the Hurun India Rich List published in August 2024. However, sources estimate his total wealth to be above Rs 15,000 crore. According to people familiar with the matter, Ratan Tata was clear that the RTEF should remain independent of Tata Trusts, which currently controls Tata Sons with a 66% stake. During his lifetime, Ratan Tata expressed a desire to use a major portion of his fortune for charitable and community purposes. Most of his wealth will be managed by the foundation, while the remaining assets will be handled by the trust. There is also a possibility that his collection of luxury cars, which includes a Ferrari and a Maserati, may be auctioned, with the proceeds going to the foundation. Before his passing, Ratan Tata had named RR Shastri and Burjis Taraporewala as holding trustees of the RTEF and had appointed Jamsheed Poncha as the CEO as per the report. He had also expressed his preference for Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran to be the managing trustee. However, there is no clarity on who holds the authority to appoint trustees after his passing. Ratan Tata had chosen Darius Khambata, Mehli Mistry, and his half-sisters, Shireen and Deanna Jejeebhoy, as the executors of his will. Khambata, a senior counsel, is one of the executors, but sources suggest that since he is already involved, a legal expert senior to him may be needed for guidance. Mistry, a close associate of Ratan Tata, is also a board trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, two of the main Tata charities. The four executors have not commented on the matter. Once the probate is completed, the foundation is expected to receive a large influx of funds from Ratan Tata’s stake in Tata Sons and other group companies. Ratan Tata, who passed away in October 2024 at the age of 86, wanted the RTEF to focus on areas of philanthropy that were new, relevant, and under-represented. He also aimed for the foundation to promote research into future technologies that could help modern India and support long-term projects with a significant positive impact on society. The RTEF is currently a board-managed entity and follows the guidelines outlined for charitable organisations. Legal experts believe that in cases where there are no specific instructions in a will, the responsibility of administering the estate lies with the executors, who must follow the wishes of the deceased. Ajay Khatlawala, managing partner at Little & Co, told ET that since RTEF is registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013, it will be governed by its Memorandum of Association, Articles of Association, and the provisions of the Companies Act. The rules for appointing trustees or directors will be determined by the Articles of Association of RTEF. Khatlawala also said that this situation could set a precedent for how legacy foundations are managed in India. He said it highlights the importance of having clear written instructions in a will to prevent disputes and confusion among stakeholders after the passing of the founder.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Must Watch

Asia's third-largest economy has been struggling with slackening consumption. To try and boost spending, the government gave some tax relief to the middle class at its annual budget on February 1 but shied away from announcing big reforms which are much needed to prop up growth. The HSBC final India Services Purchasing Managers' Index INPMIS=ECI, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 56.5 in January from 59.3 in December, a tad lower than a preliminary estimate of 56.8 but comfortably ahead of the 50-mark separating contraction from growth. ""The business activity and new business PMI indices eased to their lowest levels since November 2022 and November 2023 respectively,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. ""That said, new export business partly countered the downtrend and continued to rebound from a dip in late-2024, in line with official data."" Demand for services rose at the slowest pace in 14 months but remained sturdy. It was supported by international demand that was the strongest in five months. The future activity sub-index moderated to a three-month low but the fall was insignificant and firms hired new staff at one of the fastest paces since the inception of the survey in December 2005. Inflationary pressures picked up, as both input costs and prices charged rose at a strong pace. But India's retail inflation eased to a four-month low in December, increasing the chances of easier monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of India is widely expected to cut its key repo rate on Feb. 7, a Reuters poll taken last week showed. Slower services growth overshadowed a six-month high pace of expansion in the manufacturing sector INPMI=ECI and dragged the overall Composite PMI down to 57.7 last month from 59.2 in December.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Must Watch

It may be noted that this is Sam Altman’s first visit to India since 2023 and comes amid regulatory scrutiny in the country. His visit also comes at a time when India is stepping up efforts to develop homegrown AI solutions. Altman, who had previously dismissed India’s ability to develop large-scale AI models, has said that the country should play a leading role in AI. He also highlighted India's growing role in AI and revealed that it is OpenAI’s second-largest market globally.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Trending Reel

A showroom staff member then leads him to his ""order,"" which appears to be a Skoda Kylaq, the company’s new sub-compact SUV. The video ends with the words ""Skoda x Zepto: Coming soon,"" and the caption hints at a launch date of February 8.

 While the teaser does not confirm the exact details, it suggests that Skoda cars could soon be available for purchase through Zepto. However, it remains unclear how this system will work. The ad does not specify whether Zepto will offer deliveries in just a few minutes, as it does with groceries, or if the process will take longer due to the paperwork and logistics involved in selling a car. More details are expected to be revealed soon. Zepto entering this space may seem surprising, but it aligns with the rapid growth of quick commerce in India. Initially, platforms like Zepto, Blinkit, and Swiggy Instamart focused on small, everyday purchases. However, consumer demand has evolved, and these platforms now offer high-value products like smartphones, gaming consoles, and other expensive electronics. If Zepto successfully launches car deliveries, it could change the way vehicles are sold in India. Traditionally, buying a car involves multiple steps, including visiting a showroom, test-driving the vehicle, completing paperwork, and securing financing. If quick commerce companies can simplify this process, it could appeal to tech-savvy consumers who prefer convenience over traditional dealership experiences.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Trending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/government-accuses-kia-of-tax-evasion-in-vw-like-dispute-report-2675260-2025-02-05,"India has accused South Korea's Kia of evading taxes of $155 million by misclassifying component imports, but the carmaker has denied wrongdoing, the latest fight by a foreign automaker with New Delhi over tariffs, according to a document and two sources. Kia competes with Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki in the world's third-largest auto market, where it has a share of 6% of roughly 4 million units a year, and its Kia Seltos and Sonet SUVs are among the top sellers. Foreign companies in India face headaches from high taxes and long-drawn-out investigations. For example, Tesla has publicly complained about high taxes on imported EVs and Volkswagen last week sued over a demand for a record $1.4 billion in back taxes that it called ""impossibly enormous"". Tax officers sent a confidential notice to Kia's Indian unit in April 2024, flagging alleged tax evasion of 13.5 billion rupees, according to a government notice Reuters is reporting for the first time. The offence centered on incorrect declaration of imports of components for the assembly of the carmaker's luxury Carnival minivan, the notice showed. In a statement to Reuters, Kia India said it made ""a detailed response, supported by comprehensive evidence and documentation to substantiate"" its stand and the authorities were still reviewing the matter. Kia India is committed to complying with all regulations and has ""consistently cooperated with"" authorities, it added. India's finance ministry and customs officials did not respond to Reuters queries. In its 432-page notice, the government said tax authorities found Kia's Carnival ""car model was being imported in parts or components in separate lots"" via different ports, with the ""intent to discharge lesser customs duty"". Kia devised the strategy to ensure the imports ""could not (be) detected by customs,"" it added in the notice, issued by a customs commissioner in the southern city of Chennai. Two sources said Kia's case was similar to that of Volkswagen, accused of evading a higher tax of 30% to 35% applicable on parts imported in ""completely knocked down"" or CKD form in a single shipment, instead shipping separate parts over days, making them eligible for a tax rate of just 10% to 15%. During the investigation, Kia's website showed the Carnival model sold in India as being in ""CKD"" form, with retail sales of 9,887 units between 2020 and 2022, the tax notice said. The Volkswagen investigation spanned 14 car models from the Skoda Kodiaq to the Audi A3 and the Volkswagen Tiguan. In contrast, Kia's case concerns only the Carnival model, a seven-seater priced around $73,500, which is among its most expensive cars in India.KIA COULD FACE $310 MILLION PAYOUT Indian tax rules could require Kia to pay up to $310 million if it loses the dispute, or roughly double the amount evaded, due to penalty and interest. The latest available corporate filings in India show Kia's domestic annual sales of $4.45 billion in fiscal 2022/23 were its highest ever, up 53% on the year, for net profit of $243 million. Last week, India slashed import duties on fully-built high-end motorcycles to 30%, in a move widely seen as looking to placate U.S. President Donald Trump, who has in the past called India a ""tariff king"". But fully-assembled imported cars still attract a levy of more than 100%. Kia has deposited 2.78 billion rupees ($32 million) ""under protest"" as it continues to fight the Indian tax notice, which is still proceeding, said a government source who declined to be named as the matter is private. In 2022, authorities searched Kia offices and a factory in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and took statements from India executives, some of whom the document identifies as Chief Procurement Officer Lee Sang Hwa, and Chief Finance Officer Kiho Yoo. During the investigation, Kia executives ""changed their stance and have made efforts to mislead,"" the tax notice stated, referring to statements on imports, manufacturing and taxation. Kia was accused of importing more than 90% of the parts for Carnival, constituting a car in CKD form, which attracts higher tax, it added. India's head of indirect taxes, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, told Reuters the law was clear and some automakers were flouting it by not paying applicable CKD duties. ""If they are on the wrong side, then the department will have to issue a notice,"" he said in an interview on Tuesday.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 5, 2025

There are expectations that the central bank’s MPC will decide on cutting the key rates for the first time in 5 years by 25 basis points (BPS). The last time the MPC announced a rate cut was way back in May 2020. While analysts have mixed views on whether the RBI will cut the repo rate, a positive announcement could provide another boost to consumption after the recent tax cuts in the Union Budget 2025. So, will the RBI’s MPC cut rates tomorrow or stay focused on keeping inflation under control? Here are 4 things you need to know:25 BPS RATE CUT LIKELY A 25 basis points (bps) rate cut is widely anticipated, marking the first reduction since the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020. The repo rate has remained steady at 6.5% since February 2023, following a cumulative 250 bps hike between May 2022 and February 2023. Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, believes that a cut is likely despite concerns over the depreciating rupee. “The market is moving into a consolidation phase on expectations of a pickup in growth in the coming quarters. In the near term, the market is likely to get a mild boost from a possible 25 bps rate cut by the MPC tomorrow. Even though steadily depreciating INR doesn’t provide a favourable macro backdrop for a rate cut, the MPC is likely to go for a 25 bps cut tomorrow to keep the optimistic momentum provided by the Budget going,” he said. Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda, also supports the likelihood of a rate cut. “The budget has provided growth stimulus, and inflation is expected to ease. However, the rupee remains under pressure due to global trade uncertainties,” he noted. On the other hand, Rumki Majumdar, economist at Deloitte, expects the RBI to maintain a cautious approach. “Balancing inflation and credit growth is tricky. While there is pressure to cut rates, the RBI may choose to keep rates unchanged but maintain an easy policy stance,” she said. Umeshkumar Mehta, CIO at SAMCO Mutual Fund, highlighted global factors influencing the RBI’s decision. “Bond yields in the US are rising due to inflation concerns, putting pressure on the Indian rupee. To avoid further depreciation, the RBI may choose to keep rates unchanged,” he said.NEUTRAL STANCE TO CONTINUE The government’s fiscal approach in the Union Budget 2025 has provided room for a potential rate cut to stimulate growth. India’s GDP growth slowed to a seven-quarter low of 5.4% in Q2 FY25, adding pressure on the central bank to support economic expansion. According to Bajaj Broking Research, the MPC is expected to maintain its neutral stance, allowing flexibility in future policy decisions. The brokerage also noted that RBI’s recent liquidity measures aim to stabilize the financial system, reinforcing expectations of monetary easing. Edelweiss Mutual Fund predicts a total rate cut of 50 bps in the first half of 2025, emphasizing the need for monetary policy to complement fiscal measures in boosting demand.INFLATION AND RUPEE PROBLEM Inflation remains a key factor in the RBI’s decision-making. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for FY26 is projected at 4%, with January inflation expected to be below 4.5%. December inflation stood at 5.22%, marking four consecutive months above 5%, while food inflation eased to 8.4% from 9% in November. Despite easing inflation, concerns over currency stability persist.  The rupee has been under pressure due to rising US bond yields and global trade tensions. A rate cut could further weaken the currency, prompting the RBI to adopt a wait-and-watch approach.POSSIBLE IMPACT ON STOCK AND BOND MARKETS The stock and bond markets are expected to react sharply to the RBI’s decision. A rate cut could benefit banking stocks and lower borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, boosting consumption. However, if rates remain unchanged, volatility may rise as investors recalibrate their expectations. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, highlighted the dual factors influencing market sentiment. “All eyes are on Friday’s RBI MPC decision, with hopes for a rate cut to boost consumption,” he said.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 6, 2025

In early trade, Swiggy shares dropped over 7% to hit a new 52-week low of Rs 387 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). At around 11:37 am, Swiggy shares were down 4.16% lower at Rs 400.70.WHY SWIGGY SHARES ARE FALLING? Swiggy’s stock price fell after the company reported a consolidated loss of Rs 799 crore in the third quarter of FY25, compared to Rs 574 crore in the same period last year. The company’s loss also increased on a sequential basis in Q3FY25. Revenue from operations in Q3FY25 increased 31% year-on-year (yoy) to Rs 3,993 crore. On a sequential basis, the revenue grew 11% from Rs 3,601 crore. It may be noted that Swiggy’s increased losses can  be attributed to a 32% yoy increase in Q3FY25 expenses, which rose to Rs 4,898 crore from Rs 3,700 crore in the same period a year ago.WHAT DO BROKERAGES SAY? Brokerages shared mixed views about Swiggy’s Q3FY25 results. While UBS maintained a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 515, Macquarie kept its ‘Underperform’ rating on Swiggy with a target price of Rs 325. Explaining its bullish stance on Swiggy, UBS said the company’s management has reiterated its group-level breakeven targets, but highlighted that margin pressure is expected to persist in coming quarters. It also noted that Swiggy does not have any plans for dark store expansion like Zomato, indicating that this could be a negative going forward. Macquarie noted that Swiggy’s quick commerce economics faces challenges, with the segment reporting a wider-than-expected loss. It said network expansion and rising competitive intensity have hurt margins of Swiggy, adding that the period of hyper-competition is expected to continue for a few more quarters. The brokerage also said it prefers Zomato over Swiggy. Meanwhile, Nuvama noted that Swiggy’s food delivery segment remains stable, but added that competitive intensity continues to pressurise margins.

Here are the key takeawaysOne of the most significant initiatives announced is the establishment of a High-Level Committee for transformative reforms across sector regulations.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/india-bets-on-pro-business-policies-in-budget-2025-here-are-the-key-takeaways-business-friendly-reforms-2675596-2025-02-06,"With a series of transformative measures aimed at bolstering exports, enhancing infrastructure, revitalising agriculture, and implementing tax reforms to further improve the ease of doing business, the Union Budget 2025 reflects the Government's unwavering commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment, aligning with global standards and promoting sustainable economic growth. Over the past decade, India has demonstrated a steadfast dedication to enhancing ease of doing business through both financial and non-financial reforms. This year’s Budget builds upon this foundation, introducing a mature trust-based regulatory framework that can modernise outdated regulations, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, streamline compliance requirements, and promote investment. One of the most significant initiatives announced is the establishment of a High-Level Committee for transformative reforms across sector regulations. This Committee will be tasked with conducting a comprehensive review of all non-financial sector regulations, certifications, licenses, and permissions with the objective of strengthening trust-based governance. The recommendations of this Committee are expected to pave the way for smooth and efficient regulatory practices, particularly in the inspections and compliance processes.  In the financial sector, the government plans to establish a mechanism under the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), to evaluate the impact of current financial regulations and guidelines. This mechanism will also develop a framework to improve the adaptability and expansion of the financial sector, ensuring that regulations support innovation and economic growth while upholding financial stability.  Building upon the Jan Vishwas Act of 2023, which decriminalised over 180 legal provisions, the Government will introduce the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 to decriminalise more than 100 additional provisions across various laws. By reducing the criminalisation of minor offenses, the Bill seeks to encourage self-governance and reduce the compliance burden on individuals and businesses. This will foster an environment where businesses can operate with greater flexibility and confidence, without fear of undue legal repercussions. To streamline the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, the Government will roll out a revamped Central KYC Registry. This includes implementing a streamlined system for periodic updates, making it easier for businesses and individuals to comply with KYC requirements. The enhanced system aims to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency in the verification process. A simplified and standardised KYC framework will help financial institutions and businesses seamlessly onboard customers while ensuring security and compliance. A system with an automated requirement for updates at regular intervals can also strengthen the enforcement mechanism and achieve the underlying objectives of the KYC requirement. Steps to simplify and expedite the approval process for company mergers have also been proposed. The scope for fast-track mergers will be widened, and the process simplified, facilitating smoother corporate restructuring and consolidation. This is expected to enhance operational efficiency and competitiveness among Indian businesses. By reducing bureaucratic hurdles, companies will be better positioned to swiftly adapt to evolving market conditions and implement growth strategies with increased agility. In the spirit of ‘First Develop India’ and to attract more foreign investment, the Government will raise the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) limit in the insurance sector from 74% to 100%. This enhanced limit will be available to companies that invest the entire premium in India. Additionally, the proposal to review and simplify the existing guardrails and conditionalities in relation to foreign investment will make the sector more attractive to global investors. This can spur considerable capital inflows, strengthening the insurance industry and increasing consumer access to a broader range of financial products.  Additionally, the Government intends to overhaul the existing model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) to enhance its appeal to foreign investors. This move comes in the wake of BIT agreements signed with two countries in 2024, including the India-UAE BIT, underscoring India's dedication to fostering a welcoming environment for international investors. A well-designed BIT framework will offer increased predictability and legal security for investors, further solidifying India’s standing as an attractive investment destination. All in all, the Budget introduces a comprehensive set of reforms and initiatives designed to propel India's economic growth, enhance the ease of doing business, and attract foreign investment. By modernising regulatory frameworks, simplifying compliance procedures, and fostering an environment of trust-based governance, the Government aims to create a dynamic and resilient economy. These reflect a forward-looking approach, signalling that India is poised to navigate the complexities, challenges and opportunities of the global economic landscape. However, the success of these proposals will depend on their implementation and the response from industry stakeholders. (Moin Ladha is a Partner and Priyal Sanghvi is Associate at Khaitan & Co.

The government announced key financial reforms aimed at lowering the tax burden and allowing better financial security for them. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced a raise in the tax deducted at source (TDS) threshold on interest for senior citizens. Previously, the limit was Rs 50,000 a year. But now, the limit is increased to Rs 1,00,000 from the financial year 2025-26, thereby leaving more money in the hands of senior citizens. Sneha Pai, Senior Director, Direct Tax, Nexdigm, welcomed this move by the government. “The majority source of income for a senior citizen is interests on deposits. The government has doubled the interest limit attracting tax withholding from Rs 50000 currently to Rs 100,000. The increase in limit leaves higher disposable amount in the hands of the senior citizen,” she said. “It also aligns with the fact that senior citizens have lower tax liabilities and are unnecessarily subjected to tax withholding on interest incomes,” Pai added. Also, the TDS limit for rent payments has been increased from Rs 2.40 lakh to Rs 6 lakh a year, thus lowering the compliance burden for elderly taxpayers, and giving them enhanced financial flexibility and security in their retirement years. Sakchi Jain, CA and Financial Educator said relief on rental income provides much-needed financial security for senior citizens. “Budget 2025 brings significant financial relief for senior citizens, ensuring better income security and tax benefits. The TDS exemption on interest income has been doubled from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh, allowing seniors to earn more from Fixed Deposits (FDs), Recurring Deposits (RDs), and savings accounts without tax deductions,” Jain said. “These measures collectively enhance disposable income, reduce tax liabilities, and provide greater financial security for senior citizens,” she added.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The bill is likely to be referred to the Standing Committee for further discussion and refinement of its provisions.WHAT WILL IT FOCUS ON? The government has already made it clear that the bill will not introduce any new taxes and just focus on simplifying tax laws, removing ambiguities, and ensuring ease of compliance for taxpayers. In addition, several amendments are expected to be introduced to the existing law, with a focus on reducing litigation. One of the provisions could include a reduction in penalties for certain offences, making the tax framework less punitive and more taxpayer-friendly. A crucial aspect of the new bill will be the simplification of legal language, ensuring that even ordinary taxpayers can easily understand tax provisions and their implications.advertisementPublished By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 6, 2025

Should you pick the new tax regime for lower rates or stick to the old one for deductions?,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/old-vs-new-tax-regime-which-one-should-you-choose-for-income-above-rs-12-lakh-2675644-2025-02-06,"The Union Budget 2025 introduced some major changes to the new income tax regime, aimed at providing relief to middle-class taxpayers. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed an increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs 4 lakh and raised the income threshold for rebate under Section 87A to Rs 12 lakh. With this, people earning an income of Rs 12 lakh from salary won't have to pay any tax. In fact, with a standard deduction of Rs 75,000, people with an annual income of Rs 12.75 lakh won't have to pay tax. This has made the choice simple for millions of taxpayers with income less than Rs 12.75 lakh. But what if you earn more than Rs 12.75 lakh? Should you still opt for the sweetened new income tax regime or the deduction-heavy old income tax regime? In this article, we will help you determine whether the old or new tax regime suits you better. WHEN SHOULD YOU OPT FOR THE NEW TAX REGIME? The new tax regime is ideal for taxpayers who: 1) Have an income of Rs 12 lakh or below, as they qualify for a full rebate under Section 87A. 2) Do not have deductions under Section 80C (such as Provident Fund, PPF, life insurance, or housing loan principal repayment) or Section 80D (medical insurance premium). 3) Prefer a simplified tax filing process with minimal compliance requirements. If you do not claim substantial deductions and want a hassle-free tax filing process, the new tax regime can be beneficial as it offers lower tax rates without the need for detailed documentation.WHEN SHOULD YOU OPT FOR THE OLD TAX REGIME? The old tax regime is more suitable for individuals who can claim high deductions, including: 1) Section 80C: Contributions to PF, PPF, life insurance premiums, repayment of the housing loan principal, etc. 2) Section 80D: Medical insurance premiums for self and family. 3) House Rent Allowance (HRA) and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA). $) Home loan interest deductions. The old tax regime allows taxpayers to reduce their taxable income significantly if they maximise these deductions. But for it to be more beneficial than the new tax regime, the total deductions must be higher than the break-even threshold for their income level.Below is a break-even analysis by CA Dr. Suresh Surana for annual income up to Rs 10 crore:  The table below provides a comparative analysis of the tax liability under both regimes and the minimum deductions needed to make the old tax regime more beneficial:

 



Break-even analysis by CA Dr. Suresh Surana.
KEY TAKEAWAYS If your total taxable income is Rs 12 lakh or below, the new tax regime is the obvious choice, as no tax is payable due to the rebate. If your deductions exceed the minimum break-even amount for your income slab (as shown in the last column of the table), then the old tax regime is preferable. If you have minimal deductions, opting for the new tax regime will result in lower tax liability and a simpler filing process.WHICH TAX REGIME SHOULD YOU CHOOSE?       High deduction claimers (especially above Rs 8.5 lakh in deductions) should stick with the old tax regime. Individuals with lower deductions should switch to the new tax regime to benefit from lower tax rates and reduced paperwork. Salaried individuals should also consider the standard deduction of Rs 75,000, which is available only under the new tax regime. Lastly, the choice between the old and new tax regime should ideally be made based on individual financial situations and tax-saving strategies. A tax consultant or CA can help evaluate the best option based on your income, deductions, and financial goals.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 6, 2025

fc4a80dd-badd-4b28-a6d2-899d2a0a56f2,How much can you save with maximum deductions under old income tax regime?Old tax regime: What if someone earning above Rs 12.75 lakh annually chooses the old regime and claims the maximum deductions? Will it result in tax savings? This article explores the key deductions available under the old income tax regime and the maximum amount one can claim.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/old-income-tax-regime-maximum-deductions-savings-calculations-explained-2675707-2025-02-06,"The new income tax regime has become better than before after the fresh proposals in the Union Budget 2025. With no tax payable up to Rs 12.75 lakh, many taxpayers are expected to shift to the new tax regime.  In contrast, the budget had nothing for the old income tax regime, which had been the preferred choice for salaried individuals with more annual income and investments. While the government does not have any plans to shut it down, the old income tax regime could see a massive drop in adoption from the next financial year. But what if someone earning above Rs 12.75 lakh annually chooses the old regime and claims the maximum deductions? Will it result in tax savings? This article explores the key deductions available under the old income tax regime and the maximum amount one can claimKEY DEDUCTIONS THAT REDUCE TAXABLE INCOME Under the old income tax regime, taxpayers can claim deductions under different sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961, to lower their taxable income. These include: Standard Deduction: Salaried individuals and pensioners can claim a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 under Section 16. Investments under Section 80C: Contributions to instruments like Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity-Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), National Savings Certificates (NSC), tax-saving fixed deposits, and life insurance premiums qualify for a deduction of up to â‚¹1,50,000. Additional Deduction for NPS: Under Section 80CCD(1B), an additional â‚¹50,000 deduction is available for contributions to the National Pension System (NPS), over and above the Section 80C limit. Employer contributions to NPS under Section 80CCD(2) are also deductible, up to 10% of salary (or 14% for government employees). House Rent Allowance (HRA): Taxpayers living in rented accommodation can claim HRA deductions under Section 10(13A). The deductible amount is the least of:
Actual HRA received
50% of salary (for metro cities) or 40% (for non-metro cities)
Rent paid minus 10% of salary
 Home loan interest deduction: A deduction of up to Rs 2,00,000 is allowed under Section 24(b) on interest paid for a home loan on a self-occupied property. For rented properties, there is no upper limit on the interest deduction, but the maximum loss that can be set off against other income in a year is Rs 2,00,000.CHECK ADDITIONAL TAX BENEFITS Beyond these common deductions, taxpayers can claim additional benefits under specific sections: Medical Insurance (Section 80D):
Up to Rs 25,000 for self, spouse, and children
An additional Rs 50,000 for senior citizen parents
Maximum deduction: Rs 1,00,000
 Education Loan Interest (Section 80E): Interest on education loans for higher studies is fully deductible without an upper limit, but only for eight years from the start of repayment. Savings Interest (Sections 80TTA & 80TTB):
Rs 10,000 deduction for savings account interest (for non-senior citizens).
â‚¹50,000 deduction for senior citizens (includes fixed deposit interest).
 Donations to Charities (Section 80G): Donations to specified funds and institutions are eligible for a 50% or 100% deduction, subject to conditions. For example, contributions to the PM CARES Fund and the National Defence Fund qualify for a 100% deduction without a limit.WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM DEDUCTION POSSIBLE? Pallav Pradyumn Narang, Partner at CNK, suggested that deductions of up to Rs 8.50 lakh can be claimed under the old tax regime.  ""The old tax regime is beneficial if the exemptions and deductions such as HRA, LTA, and Chapter VI-A deductions are more than Rs 8 lakh and the total income is up to Rs 5 crore. In these instances, the taxpayer will pay less tax under the old regime compared to the new tax regime,"" Narang said.  Consider a salaried individual earning Rs 25 lakh per year. If they maximise their deductions, the taxable income could be significantly reduced:


Deduction Component
Maximum Deduction (â‚¹)




Standard Deduction
50,000


Section 80C (EPF, PPF, ELSS, etc.)
1,50,000


NPS (80CCD(1B))
50,000


Home Loan Interest (Self-Occupied)
2,00,000


Medical Insurance (Self & Senior Citizen Parents)
1,00,000


Education Loan Interest (80E)
No limit (assume Rs 1,00,000)


HRA (for a metro city)
2,50,000


Savings Interest (80TTA/TTB)
50,000


Total Deduction
Rs 8,50,000


 With these deductions, the taxable income reduces to Rs 16.5 lakh. However, a simple calculation shows that the new income tax regime is still better for someone earning Rs 25 lakh. Therefore, even after claiming Rs 8.50 lakh in deductions under the old regime, the tax outgo will slighlty more in comparison to the new tax regime. OLD VS NEW REGIME: WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE? For taxpayers who have minimal deductions, the new tax regime with lower slab rates is the obvious option. And for individuals with high investments, home loans, and eligible expenses, the old regime may lead to lower tax outgo. However, with the reduced tax slabs and rates under the new regime, only a handful of individuals with very high annual incomes and investments may benefit slightly.  Simply put, the new income tax regime seems to be the easier and better choice for most taxpayers after the massive changes in the Union Budget 2025.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Must Watch

The food delivery brand, however, will continue to be called Zomato. Goyal said the decision marks a new chapter for the company as it expands beyond food delivery. ""When we acquired Blinkit, we started using ‘Eternal’ internally to distinguish between the company and the brand/app. We also thought that we would publicly rename the company to Eternal, the day something beyond Zomato became a significant driver of our future. Today, with Blinkit, I feel we are there,"" he wrote. The renaming comes weeks after Zomato entered the BSE Sensex on December 23, which coincides with the 17th anniversary of its founding. ""Becoming the first tech startup in India to make it to the Sensex is a moment of pride and also a moment of reflection, bringing with it a heightened sense of responsibility,"" Goyal said. Eternal Ltd. will house four businesses—Zomato, Blinkit, District, and Hyperpure. Once shareholders approve the change, the company will transition its corporate website from zomato.com to eternal.com, and its stock ticker will shift from ZOMATO to ETERNAL. Calling ""Eternal"" a powerful yet daunting name, Goyal said, ""It is a tall order to live up to. Because ‘Eternal’ carries both a promise and a paradox. True permanence isn’t built on bold claims of invincibility or the swagger of success.""  Goyal said this is not just a name change but a mission statement. ""A reminder etched into our identity that we will endure—not because we are here, but because we need to get there,"" he said. Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Trending Reel

However, defaulting on personal loans can have serious consequences, including immediate and long-term consequences. It also negatively impacts one’s credit score. That said, this article explores what happens when a borrower defaults on a personal loan. Generally, banks or lenders impose hefty penalties, or late fee charges in case of a missed EMI amount. They may even impose higher interest charges and additional charges for collection efforts. Eventually, the total amount due gradually increases, making it even more challenging to repay the loan amount. A default on a personal loan amount will have a negative impact on your credit score. This damage will be reflected on your credit report, making it difficult to secure a loan in future. In case of multiple instances of missed repayments or EMIs, the lender will issue a notice for repayment and can even initiate legal action against the borrower. In an event of genuine financial hardship, the borrower can approach the lender for modification of the loan amount or payment deferral and may even negotiate a one-time settlement amount. However, this reduced amount to close the loan, will adversely impact your credit score. In other words, taking a personal loan involves huge financial responsibility. One must weigh one’s repaying capacity before availing a personal loan and must not borrow more than needed. Take proactive measures to avoid being a loan defaulter and ensure timely payments of the loan amount.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 6, 2025Must Watch

The announcement, made on Friday, marks the first rate cut since May 2020 and comes under the leadership of newly appointed RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra. This decision means home loan interest rates will come down, bringing relief to homebuyers. The repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks. When the repo rate is reduced, banks can borrow funds at a lower cost, which often leads to cheaper loans for customers. With this latest cut, home loan EMIs are expected to decrease, making property purchases more affordable. ""Lower home loan interest rates will provide much-needed relief to homebuyers, making property purchases more affordable by reducing EMIs.

Developers will benefit from easier access to funds, helping them complete projects faster and meet the rising demand,"" said Manju Yagnik, Vice Chairperson of Nahar Group and Senior Vice President of NAREDCO- Maharashtra.  Before the announcement, analysts were uncertain about whether the RBI would lower the rate or keep it unchanged to manage inflation and maintain currency stability.

After assessing the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the MPC unanimously decided to reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent with immediate effect,"" said RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra.  The rate cut announced by the committee is the first since 2020. This was also the first policy meeting of Sanjay Malhotra as RBI Governor. ""The RBI’s decision to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% supplements recent announcements in the budget aimed at boosting spending and spurring economic growth,"" said Boman Irani, President, CREDAI National. This supportive monetary policy was imperative, especially after the recent 50-basis-point reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), which has already injected significant liquidity into the banking system. As inflations continues to remain a notch higher than the medium-term target of 4%, the central bank has its task cut out - Contain inflation, inject liquidity into banking system and cut repo rates in the coming quarter too. ""On the domestic front, as per the First Advance Estimates (FAE), real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to grow at 6.4 per cent (y-o-y) in 2024-25 supported by a recovery in private consumption,"" said Malhotra.  The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from April 7 to 9, 2025.Published By: sharangee Published On: Feb 7, 2025

Sanjay Malhotra, RBI’s newly appointed Governor, made this announcement at the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Friday. The central bank would also roll out ‘fin.in’ for the financial sector later. The said move aims to strengthen the digital security framework and tackle growing financial fraud. The central bank in its latest notification mentioned, ""The Reserve Bank shall implement the 'bank.in' exclusive Internet Domain for Indian banks. Registration of this domain name will commence from April this year. This will help avoid banking frauds. This will be followed by the ‘fin.in’ domain for the financial sector."" Starting April 2025, all the Indian banks will be mandated to operate under ‘bank.in’ domain. This will help customers to differentiate legitimate banking websites from lookalike and fraudulent websites, thereby reducing digital fraud. The RBI has also introduced Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) for domestic digital payments, thus enhancing stricter measures for online banking. ""The Reserve Bank has been taking various measures to enhance digital security in the banking and payments system. Introduction of Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) for domestic digital payments is one such measure. It is proposed to extend AFA to online international digital payments made to offshore merchants, who are enabled for such authentication,” stated the central bank. The bank further mentioned in its notification,""Banks and NBFCs must continuously improve preventive and detective controls to mitigate cyber risks. They must develop robust incident response and recovery mechanisms, reinforced through periodic testing, for operational resilience."" The said move would help combat cybercrime, prevent malicious activities, and strengthen the country’s financial ecosystem.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Must Watch

The announcement was made by Sanjay Malhotra, in his first key address after being appointed as the RBI Governor in December last year. That said, the following are the six key announcements from the MPC meeting:REPO RATE CUT The central bank has announced a cut in the repo cut by 25 basis points to 6.25% from 6.5%. As a result, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands at 6%, while the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate are now at 6.50%. Radhika Rao, Executive Director and Senior Economist, DBS Bank said, ""The RBI monetary policy committee voted unanimously for a 25 bps rate cut, backed by a cautious view on growth while winter disinflation in food is expected to limit price stability risks."" ""Notably, an emphasis on the flexibility of the inflation targeting framework suggests the MPC might be more tolerant of intermittent modest supply driven volatility. The GDP forecasts point to growth staying below 7% this year and the next,"" she added.GDP OUTLOOK With a reduction in the repo rate and an expected recovery in industrial activity and robust household consumption, along with positive business sentiments, the RBI has projected the real gross domestic product (GDP) at 6.7% for 2025-26. Quarterly projections for GDP growth are enumerated as follows: Q1: 6.7% Q2: 7% Q3: 6.5% Q4: 6.5%CHEAPER HOME LOANS With a reduction in the repo rate, the rate of interest on home loans will witness a dip, thereby bringing much-needed relief to the homebuyers. This would give a boost to demand for housing and encourage investment in the real estate sector, benefitting both end-users and investors.INFLATION OUTLOOK The RBI mentioned that headline inflation eased during November-December 2024, as compared to 6.2% in October.  The central bank anticipates core inflation to remain moderate. However, uncertainty in global financial markets and adverse weather conditions coupled with volatility in energy prices may pose a risk. Anticipating a normal monsoon in the coming year, the central bank has projected consumer price index (CPI) inflation for 2025-26 to be at 4.2%. CPI inflation projections for the upcoming quarters are as follows: Q1: 4.5% Q2: 4.0% Q3: 3.8% Q4: 4.2%RBI'S STANCE ON INDIAN ECONOMY The central bank will continue with its neutral monetary policy stance owing to the global economy’s slow pace of disinflation, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and policy uncertainties.WOMEN EMPOWERMENT The RBI in its endeavour to enhance women’s role in financial decision-making and household budgeting, will launch a campaign titled ""Financial Literacy: Women’s Prosperity,” commencing from February 24. It has urged banks across the country to actively participate in the above-mentioned campaign to promote women’s financial inclusion in the broader economic growth and stability.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Must Watch

But what no one saw coming was a Rs 500 crore twist, with one name standing out like an unsolved puzzle, Mohini Mohan Dutta. Dutta, a businessman from Jamshedpur, has reportedly been left over Rs 500 crore, reported The Economic Times. His name in the will has sparked curiosity, as Ratan Tata, who passed away in October 2024, was known to be a private person. Ratan Tata also left behind a share for his siblings, his butler Subbiah and German Shepherd Tito have also been provided for in his will as per media reports.  Ratan Tata, the former Chairman of Tata Sons, the parent company of Tata Group companies, died on October 9. He was 86.WHO IS MOHINI MOHAN DUTTA? Mohini Mohan Dutta, now in his 80s, is a businessman who first met Ratan Tata in the early 1960s. Their first meeting reportedly took place at the Dealers’ Hostel in Jamshedpur when Tata was 24 years old as per media reports and still finding his way in the family business. Dutta has said that meeting Tata changed the course of his life. Dutta’s career has had close links with the Tata Group. He began his journey with the Taj Group and later founded Stallion Travel Agency. His company eventually merged with Taj Services, a division of the Taj Group of Hotels, in 2013. Tata Industries had an 80% stake in the business before Tata Capital acquired and later sold it to Thomas Cook (India). Dutta remains a director at the rebranded TC Travel Services and holds shares in Tata Group companies, including Tata Capital, which is preparing for a stock market listing. Dutta was not just a business associate—his relationship with Ratan Tata appears to have been deeply personal. A report by ToI describes him as “more than an associate, an adopted son,” though legally, Tata never married or had children. Dutta’s daughter also has ties to the Tata Group, having worked with Tata Trusts for nearly a decade after starting her career at Taj Hotels. He was present at Ratan Tata’s birth anniversary event at the NCPA in Mumbai in December 2024, which was attended by Tata’s closest associates.WHAT WILL MOHINI MOHAN DUTTA GET? According to The Economic Times, Dutta has been left one-third of Ratan Tata’s residual estate. This includes bank deposits worth over Rs 350 crore and proceeds from the auction of Tata’s personal belongings, such as paintings and watches.  However, media reports suggest that Dutta believes his inheritance will be worth Rs 650 crore, a figure that does not match the executors’ current estimates. The remaining two-thirds of Ratan Tata’s residual estate have been left to his half-sisters, Shireen Jejeebhoy and Deanna Jejeebhoy. The will is being executed by Tata Trusts trustees Darius Khambata and Mehli Mistry, along with Tata’s half-sisters. Ratan Tata’s half-brother, Noel Tata, and his children have not been included in the will. Meanwhile, Tata’s brother Jimmy Tata has been left Rs 50 crore, as per reports.

The markets saw a volatile session, initially falling nearly 200 points, then gaining over 200 points before dropping more than 500 points later in the day. PSU banks and FMCG sector stocks were the worst hit, as most sectoral indices traded in the red. But why did the market react this way? The S&P BSE Sensex was down by 539.72 points to 77,516.79, while the NSE Nifty50 declined by 147.50 points to 23,455.60 as of 2:43 PM.  Despite expectations of a rate cut, investors seemed disappointed with the RBI’s decision and its stance on future rate cuts.WHY IS STOCK MARKET FALLING TODAY?Rate cut already priced in The RBI’s rate cut was widely expected, so markets had already factored it in. Experts say this is why the announcement did not boost sentiment. ""It was widely anticipated that the RBI would deliver a rate cut, so the market has not reacted much to it. In fact, India’s 10-year bond yields have spiked as the committee unanimously voted to continue with a neutral stance. We believe that this rate cut is a step in the right direction. However, the size and timing of further rate cuts will depend on how the US Federal Reserve moves forward,"" said Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives at SAMCO Securities.Profit booking after recent rally In the past few days, markets had rallied in anticipation of the rate cut. The Nifty had surged 500-700 points recently, meaning investors took the opportunity to book profits after the announcement. ""Over the last few days, in anticipation of the rate cut, the markets have rallied. After the announcement, we saw profit booking during the intraday session. Once the Nifty broke the 23,500 support level, we saw some selling pressure. However, as long as the market stays above 23,000, the medium to short-term outlook remains positive,"" said Kranthi Bathini, Director - Equity Strategy, WealthMills Securities. ""Right now, we are seeing technical adjustments in the market. Breaking below 23,500 led to more profit booking, but overall, market sentiment remains positive in the medium term,"" Bathini added.
Banking stocks: PSU banks were among the worst performers today as rate cuts generally impact their net interest margins.
FMCG stocks: Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies also saw declines as investors booked profits after recent gains.
Bond market impact: India’s 10-year bond yields rose, indicating that bond investors were not fully convinced by the RBI’s move.

The bill is part of a broader push to reform the taxation system. The new legislation, which is often referred to as the Direct Tax Code, is aimed at overhauling the existing tax structure, making it more streamlined and transparent. While presenting the Union Budget 2025, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the government’s intent to bring a new Direct Tax Code. The bill is likely to be referred to the Standing Committee for further discussion and refinement of its provisions.WHAT WILL IT FOCUS ON? The government has already made it clear that the bill will not introduce any new taxes and just focus on simplifying tax laws, removing ambiguities, and ensuring ease of compliance for taxpayers. In addition, several amendments are expected to be introduced to the existing law, with a focus on reducing litigation. One of the provisions could include a reduction in penalties for certain offences, making the tax framework less punitive and more taxpayer-friendly. A crucial aspect of the new bill will be the simplification of legal language, ensuring that even ordinary taxpayers can easily understand tax provisions and their implications. The bill would reflect the government’s decade-long efforts focused on enhancing taxpayer convenience. During her Budget speech on February 1 in the Lok Sabha, the Finance Minister mentioned the tax department’s approach of ""trust first, scrutinise later,"" assuring the government’s continued commitment to ease compliance. ""It will be simple to understand for taxpayers and reduce litigation,"" said Nirmala Sitharaman. Sandeep Chilana, Managing Partner, CCLaw, said, “A complete overhaul of the Income Tax Act is a bold step, but the real question is whether it will truly simplify compliance or just reorganise complexities.” “If the new law can bring predictability, reduce disputes, and ease tax administration, it will be a game-changer. However, businesses and professionals will be watching closely to see how it handles legacy issues like retrospective taxation, complex exemptions, and litigation-heavy provisions.

Employees in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands will be exempt from the cuts ""due to local regulations,"" while those in more than a dozen other countries across Europe, Asia and Africa will receive their notifications between February 11 and February 18, it said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the posts. The company confirmed last month that it was planning to trim about 5% of its ""lowest performers"" and backfill at least some of the positions.

Unlike with previous company-wide layoffs, Meta was planning to keep its offices open on Monday and would not issue any updates providing further details on the decisions, Gale said in her post. A separate memo, posted by VP of Engineering for Monetization Peng Fan also on Friday, asked staffers to assist with an expedited hiring process for machine learning engineers and other ""business critical"" engineering roles.

After introduction in the Upper House, the bill will be sent to a parliamentary standing committee for scrutiny. The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the bill on Friday. ""Yesterday, the Cabinet cleared the New Income Tax proposal, I hope to have it introduced in the Lok Sabha in the coming week. Post that it will go to a committee,"" Sitharaman said in a media briefing after addressing the post-Budget customary meeting with the central board of directors of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The bill will again go to the Cabinet after the parliamentary committee gives its recommendations on it. After Cabinet approval, it will again be introduced in Parliament. ""I still have three critical stages to pass through,"" Sitharaman said to the query regarding rollout of the new income tax law. Sitharaman had first announced a comprehensive review of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 in the July 2024 Budget. The CBDT had set up an internal committee to oversee the review and make the Act concise, clear, and easy to understand, which will reduce disputes, litigations, and provide greater tax certainty to taxpayers. Also, 22 specialised sub-committees have been established to review the various aspects of the Income Tax Act. To another question, the Finance Minister said last week's Budget announcement on customs duty rationalisation is a work that has been on since the last two years. ""So we had rationalised some even two years ago. We also set certain norms saying evergreening is not going to happen on anti-dumping duties, which had played a big role in giving some kind of a protection for India's own manufacturing capabilities,"" she said. Sitharaman further said with every such expiry date getting closer, the government will review it thoroughly, and only in exceptional cases duties will be extended, but most often they should be concluded so that the protection does not become a perpetual protection. ""So, this is an ongoing process. We want to make India a lot more investor-friendly, trade friendly, and at the same time, balance it with Aatmanibhar Bharat where we need to have production, particularly through the MSMEs. We will provide the tariff protection as required by the industry,"" the Finance Minister, who presented her eighth straight Budget on February 1, said. In her Budget speech, Sitharaman had announced rationalisation of customs tariff structure for industrial goods. As part of comprehensive review of customs rate structure announced in July 2024 Budget, on February 1, 2025 she proposed to remove seven tariff rates. This was over and above the seven tariff rates removed in the 2023-24 Budget. There will be now only eight remaining tariff rates, including 'zero' rate.Published By: Vivek Published On: Feb 8, 2025Must Watch

The benchmark indices opened lower and continued to decline as selling pressure intensified. The BSE Sensex lost over 600 points, while the NSE Nifty dropped close to 200 points in early trade. The Sensex fell to the day's low of 77,189.04 after closing at 77,860.19 in the previous session. As of 10:30 AM, the Sensex was down by 579.15 points to 77,281.04, while the Nifty50 declined by 177.90 points to 23,382.05. Market experts pointed to multiple factors driving the selloff. Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, said that foreign investors continue to sell their holdings, which is adding pressure on the market. ""Indian markets are witnessing selling pressure from foreign portfolio investors. After the rate cut and also, the recent budget, it's not able to enthuse the foreign portfolio investors. They continued to be the sellers. One thing is the earning traction, okay, that has been missing in the markets in the medium to short term. That's creating pressure on Indian markets. As long as Nifty is about 23,000, the medium to short term direction is in a positive direction,"" said Bathini. RUPEE HITS ALL-TIME LOW The rupee weakened to a record low on Monday as concerns over potential U.S. trade tariffs led to losses in regional currencies. Traders told Reuters that the RBI may step in to stabilise the currency if needed. In early trade, the rupee slipped to 87.95 per U.S. dollar, breaching its previous record low of 87.58 from last week. As of the latest update, it was trading at 87.93, down 0.6% for the day. A weaker rupee increases the cost of imports, particularly crude oil, and affects foreign investment sentiment. Analysts believe that if the trend continues, the RBI may have to take further steps to stabilise the currency.METAL STOCK DRAG MARKET LOWER Metal stocks were among the worst performers as US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said that the new 25% tariffs would be imposed on all steel and aluminium imports, in addition to existing duties. He mentioned that the official announcement would be made on Monday, with tariffs coming into effect almost immediately. The news led to a sharp selloff in metal stocks in India. The Nifty Metal index dropped 2.94%, with major companies witnessing steep declines. Vedanta Limited fell 4.61%, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL) lost 4.16%. Tata Steel declined 3.48%, and JSW Steel was down 3.04%. National Aluminium Company dropped 2.90%, NMDC lost 2.88%, and Jindal Steel & Power fell 2.35%. The broad decline in metal stocks reflected fears of lower demand and pricing pressure due to the new tariffs.WHAT'S AHEAD?  The recent Delhi election results were expected to bring some stability to market sentiment, but global concerns and foreign investor activity have overshadowed the impact. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) noted that the BJP’s victory in Delhi should be a positive sign for markets, as it eases concerns about political stability at the Centre. The BJP secured 48 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly elections, ending a 27-year gap in its rule in the state. MOFSL attributed the win to the party's campaign focus on ""double-engine"" governance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, and a strong anti-incumbency factor against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). While this result is expected to boost confidence, MOFSL believes that market attention will now return to corporate earnings, company guidance, and global economic trends. Uncertainty over U.S. trade policies and foreign investor selling could continue to impact the market in the coming days.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 10, 2025

In January 2025, the UPI processed 16.99 billion transactions in a month worth Rs 23.48 lakh crore, as per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) data.

Let us look at some of the common UPI-related frauds.PHISHING Here, fraudsters send fake UPI links which look similar to the original URL of the merchant. On clicking the link, users are directed to malicious apps where auto-debit happens, thereby causing victims to lose their money.SENDING FAKE REFUND MESSAGES  Some fraudsters send requests urging users to send back the money which was mistakenly transferred to them. While the initial credit and messages are fake, the payment made by the victim is real.SIM CLONING Here fraudsters create a duplicate sim of the victim’s mobile number. They then use this SIM card to access the victim’s UPI account and transfer the amount without the victim’s knowledge.IMPERSONATION Fraudsters often at times impersonate banks or organisations and trick victims to reveal sensitive information like UPI account, OTP and PIN details.THROUGH ANY DESK  Sometimes fraudsters trick gullible victims, impersonating bank employees or customer care representatives and convince them to download screen-sharing apps like Any Desk. They then access the victim’s computer or mobile phone, and carry out fraudulent transactions. Below are a few tips to prevent UPI fraud. Never share your UPI PIN with strangers or any person you don’t trust, do not click on any online link irrespective of how tempting it might seem to click, and always be cautious of dubious applications and never download apps from untrusted sources.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 10, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/new-vs-old-income-tax-regime-budget-2025-check-revised-tax-rates-slabs-and-will-you-benefit-2677466-2025-02-10,"The new income tax regime is set to become the preferred option for the majority of taxpayers in the upcoming financial year, following the proposals in the Union Budget 2025. Taxpayers couldn’t have asked for more from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Income tax rates have been slashed, and tax slabs have been rationalised further.  The basic exemption, or income free from taxation, has been increased to Rs 4 lakh. Those earning up to Rs 12 lakh do not have to pay any tax under the new regime due to the increased tax rebate under Section 87A. In fact, salaried individuals with an annual income of Rs 12.75 lakh won't have to pay any tax, given the standard deduction of Rs 75,000 under the new regime.  High-income earners (above Rs 24 lakh per annum) will also benefit under the new regime, and are likely to save Rs 1.1 lakh in tax annually.WHO BENEFITS?  The changes in the new tax regime will provide substantial relief to middle-class taxpayers, particularly those who previously relied on deductions and exemptions to reduce their tax liability. With wider tax slabs, many will find that even without these benefits, their overall tax outgo is lower. Take the case of Rajeev Sharma, a Mumbai-based IT professional earning Rs 20 lakh annually. Under the old regime, he used deductions under Sections 80C, 80D, and HRA to bring his taxable income down, but this required a lot of financial planning. However, under the new regime, with a higher basic exemption and revised slabs, his tax burden will reduce by Rs 30,000 without the need to optimise exemptions. The new income tax regime is also a clear winner for those in the Rs 12-24 lakh income bracket. For instance, Ritu Arora, a marketing executive in Bengaluru, used to pay Rs 3.2 lakh in taxes on her Rs 22 lakh salary under the old tax regime after deductions. But under the new tax regime, her tax liability will now drop by nearly Rs 50,000.FOR INCOME BETWEEN RS 24-50 LAKH While middle-income taxpayers benefit, the reforms also extend to high-income groups. Individuals earning between Rs 24 lakh and Rs 50 lakh will now save Rs 1.1 lakh annually. Consider Akash Mehta, a business consultant in Delhi with a salary of Rs 35 lakh. Previously, he relied on deductions for home loan interest, NPS, and insurance premiums to manage his tax liability. The new regime’s rationalised slabs, however, mean he will save on tax without any additional investment planning. While he will miss out on exemptions, his tax savings will still amount to Rs 85,000 per year.OLD VS NEW REGIME: WHICH WORKS BEST FOR YOU? Despite the advantages, not everyone will benefit from switching. Those with substantial deductions, such as high home loan interest payments and corporate NPS contributions, may find the old regime more advantageous. Take Meghna Sinha, a senior banking executive earning Rs 60 lakh annually. Her deductions and exemptions total Rs 8.5 lakh, thanks to investments, home loan interest, and tax-saving schemes. Even with the new slabs, her tax outgo is around Rs 84,000 lower under the old regime. Simply put, the new tax regime offers better benefits than before, but taxpayers should assess their finances before making the switch. According to tax experts, those with minimal deductions are likely to benefit the most, while individuals with high exemptions and a high annual income might still prefer the old system.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 10, 2025

83161abc-33e8-41d2-8d6c-a3681ad8f7d6,"When will your home, auto loans EMIs get cheaper after RBI rate cut?Experts say that borrowers with repo rate-linked loans will see an immediate or near-term reduction, while those with MCLR-linked loans may have to wait longer.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/rbi-rate-cut-home-auto-loan-emis-when-will-it-get-cheaper-explained-2677556-2025-02-10,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points for the first time in nearly five years, offering relief to home and auto loan borrowers. However, the timing of lower loan rates depends on the type of loan one has. Experts say that borrowers with repo rate-linked loans will see an immediate or near-term reduction, while those with MCLR-linked loans may have to wait longer.advertisementWHY THE DELAY FOR MCLR LOANS?Following the rate cut, RBI Deputy Governor Swaminathan J, said, ""We will see an immediate impact on loans linked to external benchmarks. In loans linked to MCLR, it will take two quarters for the effect to play out.” Following the rate cut, RBI Deputy Governor Swaminathan J, said, ""We will see an immediate impact on loans linked to external benchmarks. In loans linked to MCLR, it will take two quarters for the effect to play out.” “The existing deposits will be carried on the contracted rate; only the new deposits will see changes. So, monetary policy transmission to deposit rates will also take about two quarters,” he added. Shivaji Thapliyal, Head of Research at Yes Securities, also said, “Banks will reprice repo rate-linked loans lower by 25 bps immediately or in the near term. However, they will manage net interest margins through various levers, including MCLR repricing.” Loans tied to MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds-Based Lending Rate) take longer to reflect rate cuts because they are influenced by factors like a bank’s cost of funds, deposit rates, and operating expenses. With high competition for deposits, a liquidity deficit, and elevated funding costs, banks are unlikely to pass on the full benefit quickly. An expert told The Economic Times that sustained transmission of rate cuts would require a surplus liquidity environment, which is currently lacking. Without additional liquidity measures, banks could face a deficit of up to Rs 2.5 lakh crore by March-end, further pressuring rate transmission.HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE? For borrowers with MCLR-linked loans, the impact of the rate cut could take at least two quarters to materialise. These loans typically have a six-month reset period, meaning the revised rates may only take effect next year. On the other hand, external benchmark-linked loans, such as those tied to the repo rate, will see faster transmission. Since these loans are directly linked to the RBI’s policy rate, banks are required to pass on rate changes almost immediately, usually within a month. As a result, borrowers with repo rate-linked loans should expect their EMIs to reduce sooner compared to those under MCLR.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Must Watch

In a post on social media platform X, Gupta also highlighted the importance of long-term investments. ""The SIP was meant to be a simple savings-investment instrument for the common person. A fill it, shut it, forget it one because most people struggle with markets, market caps, and SIPs,"" she said. She explained that balanced allocation is essential when investing in these segments. ""Everything, including mid and small, is good in balance. Even an average flexi-cap fund has 30% allocation to this category,"" she noted. Addressing concerns about volatility, Gupta pointed out that returns can appear unattractive when measured from peak to trough periods. ""If you look at the returns of anything from the top of the cycle to the bottom (e.g., 2006 to 2013), they will not look pleasant,"" she said. Liquidity, according to her, remains a crucial factor. ""Liquidity is very important and can be managed. We have disclosed liquidity numbers in our funds well before regulators asked and maintain this liquidity, without taking cash calls or holding a lot of large-cap,"" she added. Gupta reiterated that patience and a long-term approach are essential for SIP investors. ""The critical thing that no one can disagree about is that the key to making money is to hold on to SIPs for a long time. 10 years. More,"" she said. Citing the performance of Edelweiss Mutual Fund’s midcap fund, which was launched in 2007, she said, ""Here are the rolling 10-year lump sum returns, the minimum return is 10%. The minimum SIP return is 8%. Regular plan. Nothing can convince me these are bad numbers. And by the way, no negative returns in 10 years."" She advised investors not to be swayed by short-term concerns or market noise. ""Don't fall for fear-mongering or 10-day debates. Focus on finding a good manager and holding for 10 years, in a sensible balanced way,"" she added.

The fall in the stock market led to a loss of Rs 6 lakh crore in investor wealth as market bulls took control of the Dalal Street.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/stock-market-crash-dalal-street-bleeds-as-investors-lose-rs-6-lakh-crore-will-the-fall-continue-2677583-2025-02-10,"The stock markets faced a sharp decline on Monday, with both the Sensex and Nifty falling by nearly 1%. The drop came amid concerns over global trade after US President Donald Trump warned of new tariffs and rupee hitting its all-time low didn't help the Dalal Street either. The fall in the stock market led to a loss of Rs 6 lakh crore in investor wealth as market bulls took control of the Dalal Street. The BSE Sensex was trading 704.40 points, or 0.90%, lower at 77,155.79, while the NSE Nifty50 was down 226.90 points, or 0.96%, at 23,333.05 around 2:20 PM. Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, said that foreign investors continue to sell their holdings despite the recent rate cut from RBI and tax saving measures in the Union Budget. The rupee weakened to its lowest level ever on Monday due to concerns over U.S. trade policies. In early trade, the rupee slipped to 87.95 per U.S. dollar, breaking its previous low of 87.58 from last week. It was last trading at 87.93, down 0.6% for the day. Metal stocks saw heavy selling after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports. Trump said the announcement would be made on Monday, and the tariffs would take effect almost immediately.WILL D-STREET SEE MORE DECLINE?  Market analysts believe that the sharp fall may not be over yet, as multiple factors continue to affect investor sentiment. Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said that despite the BJP’s strong performance in the Delhi elections, the market is unlikely to see a sustained rally. He said that with the U.S. dollar index above 108 and the 10-year U.S. bond yield above 4.4%, foreign investors are likely to continue selling. This will limit any major gains in the stock market. The recent depreciation of the rupee has also raised concerns. The rupee fell 49 paise on Monday to hit 87.92 against the U.S. dollar. The decline was driven by losses in Asian currencies following Trump’s tariff announcement. The RBI’s latest policy decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) was expected due to the economic slowdown. However, the central bank has not shifted to an accommodative stance due to global uncertainty. Analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities said that the RBI is likely to cut rates further in the coming year, but it will move cautiously due to global economic risks. They expect economic growth to remain slow in the near term and believe that aggressive rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve or an improvement in exports could help the Indian economy recover. Dr. Vijayakumar said that valuations in the Indian stock market are still high, especially in midcap and smallcap stocks. He said the market needs strong triggers such as better GDP growth and corporate earnings to see a sustained recovery. Until then, he believes the market is likely to remain within a specific range, with no major uptrend. He advised investors to focus on high-quality largecap stocks that are fairly valued, as they are expected to be more stable in the current market conditions. The Sensex and Nifty have already corrected by 10-11% from their all-time highs, while the BSE midcap and smallcap indices have fallen 15% each from their 52-week highs. Some stocks have lost as much as 50% from their peak values. Despite concerns, analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) believe the BJP’s win in Delhi will boost confidence in the market. They said that with the Union Budget behind and the RBI taking steps to ease liquidity, market sentiment may improve slightly. However, they warned that global factors, such as Trump’s trade policies and foreign investor selling, could continue to create uncertainty. They recommend investors to focus more on largecap stocks rather than midcap and smallcap stocks due to valuation differences.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Must Watch

The decline came as investors reacted to US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The BSE Sensex dropped 548.79 points to close at 77,311.80, while the NSE Nifty50 lost 178.35 points to end at 23,381.60. This marked the fourth straight session of losses for the benchmark indices, with Sensex and Nifty falling by 1.5% during this period. The rupee fell to an all-time low, adding to market worries. A weaker rupee increases import costs and affects companies with high foreign debt, making investors more cautious. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, ""The US tariff threats continued to impact the market sentiment. Domestic yield is inching higher as investors stay cautious on riskier assets and navigate their investments to safe haven assets like gold. On the earnings front, the companies are facing downgrades in estimates due to a weak demand environment, margin pressure, and a cautious near-term outlook."" The metal sector saw heavy losses as concerns grew over the impact of U.S. tariffs. The Nifty Metal index was one of the worst-performing sectors, tumbling 2.6%. Tata Steel dropped 3.1%, making it one of the top Nifty 50 losers. Other major metal stocks such as JSW Steel, Hindalco Industries, and Vedanta also declined. Analysts said Trump's tariff announcement could lead to an oversupply of metals in other markets, which may reduce base metal prices. This added pressure on metal stocks, which are already facing challenges due to margin concerns. The broader market also witnessed selling pressure. Midcap and smallcap stocks fell sharply, with both the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices declining by 2.1% each. HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries, two of the biggest stocks in Sensex and Nifty, dropped 1% each. Experts believe that the selling in mid and smallcap stocks is due to high valuations and concerns over earnings growth. All 13 major sectors ended in the red. Banking stocks faced profit booking, with HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank slipping by 1% each. FMCG stocks traded weak as concerns over rural demand continued to weigh on investor sentiment. IT stocks remained under pressure due to global uncertainty and currency volatility. VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today said that as an economy, we could remain in a bear phase, further affected by slower GDP growth, depreciating rupee, continuous tariff threats, weak domestic demand, costlier imports, and a widening trade deficit. ""Collectively, these factors hint at a prolonged bear phase. Besides these, Nifty and Sensex have already corrected by 12% this quarter and are likely to slump further, as current market conditions could leave a lasting impact on company earnings and GDP growth. Considering these aspects, the index could gain support between 23,200 and 23,050 and face resistance between 23,410 and 23,480 in the next session,"" she added.

Here's why Tax-savings incentives like the Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) not only helped individuals lower their taxes but also induced disciplined savings habits, particularly among young people in developing financial prudence early in their careers.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/opt-for-new-income-tax-regime-but-dont-stop-investing-here-is-why-2677532-2025-02-10,"Several tax-incentives were introduced in Budget 2025 under the new tax regime. While these tax reliefs are aimed at reducing taxes and easing compliance, many people are wondering if it would impact their savings habits. The old income tax regime offered several tax-savings incentives under Section 80C, like the Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), and life insurance premiums. The interest being offered under these schemes ranges from 7.9% to 15%. It helps taxpayers to choose from a variety of options that best suit their financial goals and preferences. Moreover, Section 80C served a dual purpose. It not only helped in reducing taxable income, but also developed disciplined savings habits. Taxpayers, particularly young people, begin investing in them, thereby developing financial prudence early in their careers. The mandatory lock-in period in most of the tax-saving instruments under Section 80C, instils long-term financial discipline and encourages goal-based financial planning. Further, investing regularly helps build wealth over a period of time, allowing money to work and generating returns which simple savings can not. In an era with changing family structures, regular investments help create a corpus for children’s higher education, buying a house, going for a holiday, and setting aside funds for retirement and contingencies. With increasing life expectancy, retirement planning and setting aside funds for contingencies has become essential. Hence, investment in pension schemes, or mutual funds ensures steady returns even after retirement. On the other hand, the government has announced reduced tax slabs under the new tax regime, to make it more attractive for taxpayers. It has done away with most of the deductions and exemptions. Some people might say that it may lead to reduced savings, as people would lack any motivation to invest in tax-saving investments and become spendthrifts. In fact, investments are not just about deductions, they help build funds and derive the benefit of compounding over a period of time and ensure financial independence in later years. Also, experts say that the annual rush to make tax-saving investments helped people develop the habit of saving. In other words, one should not get discouraged in the absence of tax-savings deductions. As we move towards a simplified tax regime, people should think of new ways that motivate them to make prudent financial choices and investment decisions.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Now, house owners can claim nil annual value for up to two self-occupied houses. This implies that one does not have to pay taxes on the second house if it's not rented out. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her speech said, “Presently taxpayers can claim the annual value of self-occupied properties as nil only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Considering the difficulties faced by taxpayers, it is proposed to allow the benefit of two such self-occupied properties without any condition.” This move has been welcomed by taxpayers as it reduces their financial burden and brings ease in tax compliance. Sakchi Jain, CA and Financial Educator, said that the move has made homeownership more affordable.  ""Budget 2025 introduces key reforms aimed at tax relief, financial inclusion, and economic stability. Homebuyers now benefit from tax relief on two self-occupied properties, making homeownership more accessible,"" she said. ""One major change is in house property taxation. Previously, tax relief was available only for one self-occupied house. Now, if you own two houses and live in both, you can claim tax benefits on both properties, making homeownership more affordable,"" Jain mentioned. Kaushal Agarwal, Co-Founder & Director of The Guardians Real Estate Advisory said that the tax exemption of two self-occupied houses has eased the financial burden and simplified compliance. “The Union Budget 2025 brings significant relief for homeowners by allowing tax benefits on two self-occupied properties instead of just one. Earlier, individuals had to pay tax on the notional rental income of a second home, adding to their financial burden. This change simplifies tax compliance and recognises the need for housing flexibility, especially for families with homes in different cities for work, investment, or personal reasons,” he said. Chandresh Vithalani, Partner at Palladian Partners Ltd said that the tax benefits on two self-occupied houses will give a boost to the real-estate market. “The Union Budget 2025 delivers a strong push for the real estate sector through a well-rounded approach that balances affordability, investment incentives, and project completion. By increasing the income tax exemption limit, homebuyers now have greater purchasing power, enhancing demand for residential properties,” he said. “The move to allow tax benefits on two self-occupied properties instead of just one encourages multiple homeownership, making real estate a more attractive long-term investment avenue,” Vithalani added. In other words, the reform would encourage investment across the country’s real-estate segment, enhance affordability for homebuyers, thereby strengthening market confidence.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Feb 10, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Hotard, who will take up the position on April 1, is currently the executive vice president and general manager of Data Center & AI Group at Intel, according to the chipmaker's website. Telecom gear makers, struggling with lower sales of 5G equipment, have been looking for ways to diversify their markets and break into growing areas such as artificial intelligence. ""He has a strong track record of accelerating growth in technology companies along with vast expertise in AI and data centre markets, which are critical areas for Nokia's future growth,"" Nokia's Chair Sari Baldauf said in a statement. Shares were up 1.6% at 4.7 euros by 0854 GMT on Helsinki's stock exchange, which was up just 0.45%. JPMorgan analysts called the CEO transition a surprise as they said Lundmark had been successful at ""steadying the ship"". ""Given that a new CEO has already been appointed, it looks like this transition was in the works for some time. With the Datacentre and AI background of the new CEO, it is clear which areas Nokia wants to focus on,"" they said in a note. This view was echoed by analysts at Inderes, who see the change as a strategic shift towards Nokia's Network Infrastructure unit, where data centres and AI investments are fostering new growth opportunities. Last year, Nokia made a move to buy US optical networking gear maker Infinera in a $2.3 billion deal to gain from the billions of dollars in investment pouring into data centres to cater to the rise of artificial intelligence. Lundmark, who was appointed as Nokia's CEO in 2020, will stay on as an advisor to Hotard until the end of the year, the company said. In September, Nokia declined media reports saying the company was looking for a new chief executive. ""The planning for this leadership transition was initiated when Pekka indicated to the Board that he would like to consider moving on from executive roles when the repositioning of the business was in a more advanced stage, and when the right successor had been identified,"" Baldauf said. Nokia shares are up 27.85% over the past year, but are down more than 90% since peaking in June 2000. Its infrastructure business, increasingly integrating AI technologies, focuses on building and maintaining communication systems, including data centres, servers, and routers. Its mobile networks unit concentrates on technologies and services enabling mobile communication, including the development and management of cell towers and 5G technologies.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Feb 11, 2025

Even the tax cuts in the Union Budget 2025 and the RBI’s 25 bps rate cut have not been able to reduce the market anxiety, and experts have indicated that the benchmark indices could remain under pressure for a prolonged period.

69506c34-4630-4c3d-89a0-d94e82c48a9b,Explained: Why Zomato share price plunged over 5% todayZomato stock price: Shares of the company have been under pressure ever since global brokerage firm Jefferies raised concerns over rising competition in the quick commerce space.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/zomato-stock-price-falls-over-5-today-key-reasons-behind-decline-2678081-2025-02-11,"Shares of food delivery giant Zomato fell over 5% in early trade on Tuesday, continuing its poor run. Zomato shares were down 5.24% to Rs 215.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at 11:01 am. The stock is down nearly 9% in the past five trading sessions. Shares of the company have been under pressure ever since global brokerage firm Jefferies raised concerns over rising competition in the quick commerce space. Jefferies analysts quoted in a CNBC-TV18 report raised concerns over profitability due to the rising competition and discounting pressures affecting profitability. While 2024 was a breakout year for Zomato’s stock in terms of valuation growth, Jefferies analysts indicated that trend of high growth is unlikely in 2025 due to the intense competition in the Q-com sector. Jefferies has downgraded Zomato’s stock to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ and slashed the target price to Rs 275 from Rs 335. The brokerage firm, however, indicated that Zomato’s valuation is not “excessively expensive”, citing the company’s strong execution and opportunity in the quick commerce space. Jefferies fears that the intense competition in the sector, with aggressive strategies by existing players and entry of new competitors, could lead to higher discount offers that could hurt Zomato’s medium-term profitability. Considering these factors, Jefferies has sharply reduced Blinkit's EBITDA forecast for FY26-27 and halved its target multiple to 6x. For Zomato, the brokerage cut EBITDA estimates by 12% for FY26 and 15% for FY25, while lowering profitability projections by 17% for FY26 and 18% for FY27. EPS estimates were also slashed by 20% for FY26 and 21% for FY27.
