Check detailsWhile a low credit score may present challenges, using strategies like reduced DTI, and showing income stability, etc. can help secure a personal loan and improve your credit for the future.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/can-you-get-a-personal-loan-with-low-credit-score-follow-these-tips-check-details-2652396-2024-12-19,"Getting a personal loan with a low credit score might seem challenging, but it’s not impossible. While most lenders prefer a credit score of 750 or above, individuals with lower scores can still secure a loan by strengthening their case in other ways.HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR OBTAINING A PERSONAL LOAN WITH A LOW CREDIT SCORE Bring in a guarantor or co-applicant
Personal loans are unsecured, meaning no collateral is required. If your credit score is below the lender’s threshold, consider involving a guarantor or co-applicant with a stable income and good credit score. This boosts your credibility and enhances your chances of approval. Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio (DTI) Your DTI ratio shows how much of your income goes toward loan repayments. If your credit score is low, keep your DTI low to show strong repayment capacity. Prove income stability
Highlight recent salary hikes or additional income sources to reassure lenders of your repayment capacity. Sharing these details can help convince them of your financial stability. Opt for a smaller loan amount
Applying for a smaller loan amount reduces the lender’s risk and increases your chances of approval. Discuss with the bank if a reduced amount aligns with your needs and eligibility. Explore secured credit options
If traditional loans seem out of reach, consider taking a secured credit card against a fixed deposit. This not only meets your credit needs but also helps build your credit score over time.WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT SCORE Make timely payments on EMIs and credit card bills. Maintain a low credit utilisation ratio. Retain old credit cards for their positive impact on your credit history. Avoid multiple credit applications simultaneously, as it signals credit-hungry behaviour. While a low credit score can be a hurdle, it’s not a deal-breaker. By leveraging strategies like involving a guarantor, reducing DTI, or showcasing income stability, you can secure a personal loan. Additionally, focus on improving your credit score to access better financial opportunities in the future. Stay proactive, and don't let a low score hold you back from reaching your financial goals!Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

This comes after reports that the coffee chain is pushing back plans for some new Starbucks store openings until later in its existing schedule. In a stock exchange filing, the company said, “This is with reference to the news article titled - “Starbucks to Exit India Due to High Costs, Bad Taste, and Mounting Losses”. The Company would like to state that the information in the said article is baseless.” According to a separate report earlier this week by news agency Reuters, fewer customers are walking into cafes, which has coerced Starbucks to recalibrate its plan to open more stores.  Tata Consumer CEO Sunil D'Souza told the news agency last week: “We will calibrate for the short term — maybe instead of opening 100, we will open 80 now, and next year we will open 120 instead of 100.” However, Starbucks is still focussed on its goal to open 1,000 stores by 2028. ""In India, good quality real estate with traffic... is a challenge,"" he said, contrasting that to the ""massive development of malls"" in China. Despite the challenges, Tata Consumer's CEO remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of their investment in coffee. In the last financial year, Starbucks reported a 12% increase in sales, reaching $143.6 million, however its net loss widened. The company's revenue in the first half of this year showed only a slight increase. According to data from business insights provider Tofler, Starbucks' revenue in the last financial year had more than doubled compared to four years ago.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

The Sensex ended 964.15 points lower at 79,218.05, while the Nifty50 settled 247.15 points lower at 23,951.70. All broader market indices finished in the red, mirroring the global market rout triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish rate stance. Sectoral indices faced intense selling pressure, with Nifty IT, Nifty Bank, and Nifty Financial Services logging steep losses. However, Nifty Pharma emerged as the session’s bright spot, gaining nearly 2% as investors sought refuge in defensive stocks amid the volatile market environment. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the market downturn to heightened concerns following the Fed's indication of prolonged higher interest rates. “The Indian market saw a widespread decline following a global sell-off driven by the US Fed’s hawkish stance on interest rates. Sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as banking and real estate, significantly bore the brunt.” Adding a note of relief, he highlighted the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) unexpected decision to keep its interest rate unchanged, which helped ease selling pressure. “Despite this, investor caution persisted amid ongoing FII selling, with a strategic shift towards defensive sectors like pharma as evidenced by their outperformance,” Nair added. As global cues remain uncertain, market participants are likely to keep a close watch on upcoming central bank announcements and inflation data to gauge future market direction.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

Mamata Machinery’s unlisted shares are trading at a premium of Rs 200 or 82.3% in the grey market as it continued to garner strong demand from investors after opening today. This sharp rise in GMP suggests that the market is optimistic about the company’s future prospects. Mamata Machinery, a leading manufacturer of packaging machines, seeks to raise Rs 179.39 crore from its offer for sale, with promoters selling up to 73.82 lakh equity shares at a face value of Rs 10 each. The price band for the IPO is set at Rs 230-243 per share, with a lot size of 61 shares. Retail investors will need a minimum of Rs 14,823 to apply for one lot, while the maximum bid will require Rs 1,92,699 for 134 lots. The subscription window will remain open until December 23, 2024, with shares expected to list on the BSE and NSE on December 27, 2024. Anand Rathi Research and Bajaj Broking have both recommended subscribing to the IPO. Analysts at Anand Rathi are confident about the company's future, citing its strong R&D investments, innovative leadership, and a healthy return on net worth of 27.4% for FY24. They believe the IPO is fairly priced relative to its peers, giving it a competitive edge. Bajaj Broking also supports the IPO from a long-term perspective. The company’s diversified revenue streams, particularly its presence across the polyester, cotton, and technical textile sectors, reduce its reliance on any single segment. Mamata Machinery’s solid financial health, consistent revenue growth, and focus on innovation and sustainability are expected to drive future growth. While Mamata Machinery’s IPO is generating strong interest, investors should consider its long-term growth potential and solid fundamentals when making a decision. The sharp rise in GMP reflects positive market sentiment, but as with any investment, careful evaluation is key.

In early trade, the S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 1,153.17 points to 79,029.03, while the Nifty also fell sharply over 200 points. At around 12:05 pm, Sensex was down 896.84 points to 79,288.13 and Nifty was trading 232.70 points lower at 23,966.25.  All the other broader market indices were also trading in negative territory. WHAT TRIGGERED THE MARKET BLOODBATH? The US Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate cut met market expectations but failed to comfort investors due to its cautious guidance. The Fed indicated only two more rate cuts in 2025, dashing hopes for a more aggressive easing cycle. This announcement triggered a Wall Street meltdown, with the Dow Jones plunging 1,123.03 points (2.6%) to 42,326.87. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also nosedived 3.6% and 3% respectively. Asian markets followed suit, with indices in Japan, China, and South Korea losing up to 1.2%. This was the key factor behind today's meltdown on Dalal Street. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital, said, ""The US Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25-point rate cut, coupled with signals of reduced future cuts, has led to a significant sell-off in global markets. This rate cut could make Indian assets less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to capital outflows."" In addition, the rupee also hit a record low today, further hurting market sentiments.  ""Additionally, the rupee's continued decline to new lows has further soured sentiment. A prolonged depreciation of the rupee could exacerbate the trade deficit and heighten inflationary pressures in the future,"" Aggarwal said. ""The higher import bill stemming from a weaker rupee adds to these concerns,"" he added.  Rising US bond yields and a stronger dollar also exacerbated concerns about capital outflows from emerging markets, including India. The dollar index surged to 108, while the US 10-year bond yield climbed to 4.5%. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out Rs 1,316.81 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday, adding pressure on the rupee, which risks further depreciation. Domestic investors stepped in, buying Rs 4,084.08 crore worth of shares, cushioning the market to some extent.WHAT NEXT?  Technical experts highlighted 23,900 on the Nifty as a crucial support level, aligning with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Analysts expect the index to stabilize between 23,800 and 23,900, with the Put-Call Ratio at 0.55 signaling an oversold market. Investor wealth eroded by Rs 6.57 lakh crore, shrinking the total market valuation to Rs 446.03 lakh crore from Rs 452.60 lakh crore the previous session, reflecting the day’s severe market carnage. ""The reduction in global growth and demand presents another challenge, with potential negative implications for pricing across key sectors. In the short term, heightened market volatility is expected,"" Aggarwal said.  He, however, highlighted that investors ""should avoid panic selling during these fluctuations and focus on fundamentally strong securities with minimal exposure to global factors"".

This decline comes after the US Federal Reserve cut key interest rates by 25 bps and signalled fewer rate cuts in 2025, putting additional strain on the currency, which has already been under pressure due to weak capital inflows and other economic challenges. The rupee dropped to 85.0650 against the US dollar in early trade, compared to 84.9525 on Wednesday. The pace of the rupee’s depreciation has accelerated recently, with the fall from Rs 84 to Rs 85 taking just two months. In contrast, the slide from Rs 83 to Rs 84 took 14 months, and it took 10 months for the rupee to weaken from Rs 82 to Rs 83. The rupee’s decline is not an isolated event, as other Asian currencies also weakened on Thursday. The Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indonesian rupiah all fell by 0.8%-1.2% during the day. The sell-off in Asian currencies followed the Federal Reserve’s latest policy guidance. The Fed’s ""dot plot,"" which outlines its rate expectations, now projects only two rate cuts in 2025, half of what was previously signalled in September. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments further added to the market’s caution. He said, ""From here, it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts.""WHAT'S DRIVING THE FALL  The rupee’s weakening has been driven by a combination of global and domestic factors. India’s economic growth slowed to a seven-quarter low in the July-September period, while the merchandise trade deficit has been widening. Capital inflows into the country have also remained subdued. Persistent strength in the US dollar has added to the rupee’s troubles. Expectations of robust US economic policies have kept the dollar strong, and the Fed’s latest guidance is expected to further boost the greenback’s value. India’s slowing economic growth has also led to speculation that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may need to cut rates soon, adding to downward pressure on the rupee. Akshay Kumar, Head of Global Markets at BNP Paribas India, noted, ""In the short term, we can expect upward pressure on USD/INR to remain."" The challenging environment for the rupee has prompted investors to raise their short positions on the currency to a two-year high, according to a recent Reuters poll. The rupee has already weakened by 2% so far this year, placing it in the middle of the performance pack among Asian currencies. Despite routine interventions by the Reserve Bank of India to stabilise the currency, analysts believe the rupee’s muted volatility of recent years may not continue in 2025.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/market-crash-dalal-street-bloodbath-3-reasons-behind-today-fall-us-fed-rate-cut-weak-rupee-2652125-2024-12-19,"The stock markets tanked in early trade on Thursday, mirroring losses in global markets, extending their losses for the fourth consecutive session. This drop followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points for the third time in a row. While the rate cut was anticipated, the Fed’s cautious outlook on further cuts disappointed investors, dampening hopes for a year-end rally. The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 1,153.17 points, or 1.44%, to 79,029.03, while the Nifty declined by 213.10 points, or 0.88%, to 23,985.75. This marked the fourth consecutive day of losses for the benchmark indices. Leading the slide, Wipro dropped 2.64% to Rs 304.35, making it the worst-performing stock on the Nifty. Other significant losers included Shriram Finance, Asian Paints, Hindalco, ONGC, Infosys, and Tata Steel, which all declined by more than 2%.GLOBAL SELL-OFF The US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates to the range of 4.25%-4.50% was in line with market expectations. However, the Fed’s guidance for only two more rate cuts in 2025—against market hopes for three or four—spooked investors. This triggered a sell-off in Wall Street, with the Dow Jones dropping 1,123.03 points (2.6%) to 42,326.87, the Nasdaq falling 716.37 points (3.6%) to 19,392.69, and the S&P 500 tumbling 178.45 points (3.0%) to 5,872.16. The cautious outlook also impacted Asian markets. Indices in Japan, China, and South Korea fell by up to 1.2%, and the sentiment carried over to Indian markets. Analysts suggest that the sharp correction may end hopes of a ""Santa rally"" in the final weeks of December.DOMESTIC CONCERNS Weak data on the domestic front added to the selling pressure. The rise in the US dollar and bond yields led to concerns about foreign outflows from Indian markets. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, reached 108. Meanwhile, the 10-year US bond yield increased to 4.5%. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers, pulling out Rs 1,316.81 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday. Analysts noted that a stronger dollar and higher bond yields typically lead to capital outflows from emerging markets, adding pressure on local currencies. The rupee is now at risk of further depreciation against the dollar, which could make Indian assets less attractive to global investors.KEY LEVELS Technical analysts highlighted critical support levels for the Nifty. Rajesh Bhosale from Angel One stated that 24,000 would act as a psychological level, while 23,900—aligned with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement—would serve as key support zones. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd, said that the Put-Call Ratio (PCR) of 0.55 indicates an oversold market. This suggests that Nifty might stabilise in the 23,800–23,900 range and trade sideways in the short term. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services explained that high market valuations require only a small trigger for a sharp correction. The Fed’s guidance, which indicated slower rate cuts in 2025, provided that trigger. Vijayakumar added that while the Fed chief’s comments about the US economy and labour market were positive, markets reacted negatively as expectations were not met. Nomura analysts had also predicted a hawkish Fed stance, expecting the pace of rate cuts to slow in the coming year. Their prediction materialised, with market sentiment turning cautious globally.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

At one point of time, the Sensex was down over 1,100 points in early trade but swiftly recovered to settle down below 900 points.  Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that when valuations are high the market needs only a trigger to correct sharply. ""This trigger was provided by the Fed guidance of fewer rate cuts in 2025, which went against market expectations. Even though the  rate cut of 25 bp was in tune with the market’s expectation, the indication of only two cuts of 25 bp each in 2025 against market expectation of three or even four cuts spooked the market resulting in a sharp sell-off in Wall Street. The Fed chief’s comments regarding the economy and the labour market are, in fact, positive, suggesting a resilient US economy. But always the market gets spooked when the reality falls short of expectations,"" he added.  India VIX, which measures market volatility, rose by 3.70%.The Nifty Midcap100 index fell 0.84%, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index declined 1.02%.  The dollar index rising above 108 and the 10-year bond yield spiking to 4.52 % are clearly negatives from the perspective of FII fund flows. But this is likely to be only temporary. ""Sharp cuts in the market today will provide opportunities for investors to buy. The broader market will be impacted less despite high valuations since the FII impact will be negligible in this segment. Therefore, there can be a sharp bounce back in growth stocks in this segment. Long-term investors, who can ignore short-term gyrations, should focus on fairly valued large-caps which will provide buying opportunities for investors who are prepared to wait,"" said Vijayakumar.

The Fed’s decision, along with its forecast of fewer rate cuts in 2025, rattled investors across the globe, leading to widespread sell-offs in equities. The US Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, bringing it to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. The move was widely anticipated; however, the Fed surprised markets by signalling a slower pace of rate cuts in the coming year. In its latest projections, the Fed halved the number of quarter-point cuts it expects in 2025, reducing them from four to just two. This unexpected shift has raised concerns that higher interest rates may persist longer than previously thought. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation has ""eased significantly"" but remains ""somewhat elevated"" compared to the central bank's target of 2%. Powell expressed optimism about the US economy, adding that the Fed is ""significantly closer"" to ending its current rate-cutting cycle.GLOBAL MARKET REACTIONS Wall Street reacted negatively to the Fed’s announcement, with all three major US indices—Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq—posting their biggest single-day losses in months. Yields on US Treasurys surged as investors adjusted to the prospect of prolonged higher interest rates. Asian markets followed suit, with major indices in the region also trading lower. Gift Nifty, an indicator for the Indian markets, was trading around 23,935—about 320 points below Nifty futures’ previous close—suggesting a gap-down opening for Indian equities.IMPACT ON SENSEX AND NIFTY The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to mirror global trends and open in the red. Market participants remain cautious about the broader implications of the Fed’s slower pace of easing, especially as inflation and global economic uncertainties persist. “Bullish sentiments took a hit after the Fed reduced its projections for rate cuts in 2025. While the 25 basis point rate cut was expected, the trimmed outlook for future cuts has upset market sentiment. Nifty’s 200-day moving average at 23,816 may come under pressure as the indices look poised for a negative opening,"" said Mehta Equities in its theme of the day for the markets. WHAT TO EXPECT Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd said that a sharp sell-off has been witnessed in global markets following a hawkish rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. ""Gift Nifty indicates a gap-down opening, continuing the three-day losing streak. The first major support to watch is the low of the December series at 23,923, with the 200-DMA around 23,800 serving as a critical support level. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) at 0.55 reflects an extremely oversold market, suggesting a possibility that Nifty could find support in the 23,923–23,800 zone and trade sideways. Overall, the market remains largely range-bound, with a focus on sector-specific and stock-specific movements,"" he added.  Investors in the Indian markets will be closely monitoring global cues, including the performance of US stock futures and Asian indices. The impact of the Fed’s decisions on foreign institutional investments (FIIs) in Indian equities will also be a key factor. While the Fed's move is seen as a step closer to ending its current rate-cutting cycle, its cautious approach has cast uncertainty over the pace of global economic recovery. Indian markets, like their global counterparts, will remain on edge as they navigate this evolving economic landscape. Dalal Street has faced a rough patch over the past few trading sessions. The benchmark indices, the S&P BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty50, extended their losses on Wednesday, leaving investors worried about their year-end performance. The Sensex dropped by 502.25 points to close at 80,182.20, while the Nifty50 declined by 137.15 points to settle at 24,198.85. Financial and banking heavyweights were among the major losers, dragging the indices down further. ""The Indian market is experiencing a breakdown in the early Santa Claus rally, with the impact being more pronounced in India compared to developed markets due to the rapid appreciation of the dollar. Market sentiment remains cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting and potential policy and tariff shifts from the incoming US administration,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

To address widespread confusion, the Income Tax Department has released a detailed brochure on December 11, 2024, to help taxpayers navigate their disclosure obligations. With penalties and prosecution on the line, timely compliance is essential.advertisementWHO NEEDS TO REPORT AND WHAT TO DISCLOSE?All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
 The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES Taxpayers must declare foreign income and assets in the applicable ITR for the assessment year they were a resident in India. The deadlines are as follows: Original returns: File by July 31, 2024. Belated or revised returns: File by December 31, 2024. If a return has already been filed without these disclosures, taxpayers can revise their ITR using the correct form and schedules before the December deadline. Accurate documentation, such as acquisition details and income generated, is critical.CONSEQUENCES OF NON-DISCLOSURE Non-compliance can result in penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh if foreign assets exceed Rs 20 lakh (excluding immovable property). Further, prosecution under the Black Money Act could be initiated for false or incomplete disclosures. Late filers have until December 31, 2024, to submit belated or revised returns to avoid legal repercussions. Disclosing foreign income and assets not only ensures compliance with Indian tax laws but also avoids double taxation under international agreements. The Income Tax Department has simplified the process through a brochure that explains the steps to disclose and claim relief. Taxpayers should take this opportunity to file accurate returns and align with both the Income Tax Act and the Black Money Act. With heavy penalties and legal actions looming, timely disclosure isn’t just advisable—it’s indispensable for financial integrity.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

At 10:28 am, the S&P BSE Sensex fell 274.86 points to 78,943.19, while the NSE Nifty50 dropped 67.90 points to 23,883.80. Broader market indices also traded in the red as volatility spiked, pressuring blue-chip stocks. Nifty50’s top losers included Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra, Ultratech Cement, M&M, and Shriram Finance. Meanwhile, Dr Reddy’s, Titan, NTPC, Hindalco, and Power Grid emerged as the session’s top gainers. Meanwhile, the rupee hit a fresh record low of 85.10 against the US dollar, raising concerns about potential foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “FII buying seen in early December is reversing, with this week’s selling reaching Rs 12,229 crore. This shift is impacting large-cap stocks, particularly in the financial sector.” He advised retail investors to adopt a contrarian strategy, noting, “Quality large-caps will likely bounce back soon.” He also highlighted the resilience of pharma stocks and projected strength in IT, citing positive results from Accenture and the growing profitability of generative AI services. The recent sell-off comes after the Fed’s 25-basis-point rate cut and a reduced forecast for interest rate reductions in 2025.

The rupee surpassed its previous low of 85.0850 reached on Thursday and settled at 85.10 by 10:00 am. Traders reported state-run banks offering dollars, likely on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which helped limit further depreciation. Despite the intervention, the rupee remained under pressure due to several domestic and global factors.WHAT'S BEHIND THE RUPEE'S DECLINE?  India's economic growth slowing to a seven-quarter low and a widened merchandise trade deficit have raised concerns among investors. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve’s projection of fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid sticky inflation has strengthened the US dollar, making emerging market currencies like the rupee more vulnerable. “Higher trade deficit along with slow growth figures puts the rupee on test with outflows from domestic equity markets. For USD/INR, positionally 84.70 now acts as a good base while the door remains open for 85.50 levels,"" Kunal Sodhani, Vice President at Shinhan Bank India, told news agency Reuters.  The dollar index hovered near a two-year high of 108.4 after stronger-than-expected US GDP growth and a sharp decline in weekly jobless claims boosted confidence in the US economy. Foreign investors also contributed to the rupee's woes, selling nearly $500 million worth of Indian stocks on Thursday. However, routine interventions by the RBI have kept the rupee’s volatility relatively lower than that of its Asian counterparts. Investors now await the US core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation data, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, due later on Friday, which could further influence currency markets.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Must Watch

Despite initial reservations about market timing and potential risks for customers, Kamath emphasised the growing demand and the business need to offer MTF. Sharing the news on X, Nithin Kamath said, “I don't know if it is a good time with the fall in the markets, but we are finally launching MTF, which allows you to buy stocks for delivery by borrowing money from us.” He added, “I haven't been sure about this product for a long time because of obvious reasons. Customers who trade for delivery tend to ignore the impact of the cost of borrowing, and there's always the risk of the trade going against them, which leads to a bigger loss.” Talking about the growth of MTF in the last few years, he said, ""But in the last 3 to 4 years, MTF has grown tremendously, with pretty much everyone offering it. Considering the number of customers asking us for the feature, it didn't make business sense for us to not offer it.""
 


WHAT IS MTF?The Margin Trading Facility (MTF) enables investors to trade with leverage, allowing them to buy stocks for delivery even if they don’t have the full amount upfront. Investors can borrow up to 80% of the stock's value, depending on the stock.In simpler words, through MTF, investors pay only a portion of the total stock value, with the broker funding the remainder as a loan. Interest is charged on the borrowed amount, making MTF a strategic yet cost-sensitive trading option.HOW DOES MTF WORK? The Margin Trading Facility (MTF) enables investors to trade with leverage, allowing them to buy stocks for delivery even if they don’t have the full amount upfront. Investors can borrow up to 80% of the stock's value, depending on the stock. In simpler words, through MTF, investors pay only a portion of the total stock value, with the broker funding the remainder as a loan. Interest is charged on the borrowed amount, making MTF a strategic yet cost-sensitive trading option.HOW DOES MTF WORK? MTF allows investors to purchase stocks for delivery with leverage, enabling them to trade even if they don’t have the full amount. Up to 80% of the stock value can be borrowed, subject to an interest rate of 0.04% per day (Rs. 40 per lakh). For example, if you want to buy shares worth Rs. 400 but have only Rs. 100, you can use MTF. Providing 25% of the total value as your initial investment, the broker funds the remaining Rs. 300, allowing you to purchase shares worth Rs. 400. The stocks must be pledged with the broker as per Sebi guidelines.WEIGHING THE REWARDS AND RISKS MTF can amplify your returns. If a stock you buy for Rs. 400 rises to Rs. 450, your profit of Rs. 50 translates to a 50% return on your Rs. 100 investment. However, if the price drops to Rs. 350, you lose Rs. 50, eroding 50% of your investment. While MTF offers the potential for higher gains, it also comes with increased risks due to leveraged trading and borrowing costs. The Margin Trading Facility can be a powerful tool for maximising limited funds, but it demands responsible usage. Stay informed, diversify your investments, monitor balances, and have a clear exit strategy to navigate risks effectively and unlock the full potential of this feature.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Higher returns often come with elevated risks, while safer options yield modest rewards. For those willing to embrace calculated risks, market-linked investments like equities offer a promising route to wealth creation over time. Amongst all asset classes, equities have historically delivered inflation-beating returns, making them a preferred choice for long-term investors. Alternatives like real estate and gold can also offer substantial returns, but factors such as low liquidity and transactional complexities often give equities an edge. Here are five high-return investment avenues to consider: Direct equity
Buying stocks directly on exchanges like BSE or NSE lets investors participate in corporate growth. Diversification across sectors and market caps is crucial to mitigate risks.
However, high volatility and the potential for significant capital loss demand thorough research. Initial public offerings (IPOs)
IPOs allow investors to purchase shares during a company’s debut on the stock market. After listing, these shares trade in the secondary market.
However, IPO allotment is uncertain, and listing prices can be unpredictable due to market dynamics. Mid- and small-cap equity funds
These funds focus on smaller companies with growth potential. SEBI mandates a minimum of 65% allocation to equities for such schemes.
However, higher market volatility and limited liquidity make these funds suitable for risk-tolerant investors. Equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS)
ELSS combines equity investments with tax-saving benefits, featuring a mandatory three-year lock-in period.
However, performance post-lock-in can vary, requiring periodic reviews. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending
This digital platform connects borrowers and investors, offering attractive interest rates.
However, loans are unsecured, increasing the chance of defaults. Navigating the world of investments is about aligning your financial goals with your risk appetite. Whether you choose equities, real estate, or innovative options like P2P lending, staying informed and diversifying your portfolio can help you turn risks into rewards.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Benchmark stock market indices fell sharply during Friday’s trading session, extending their weak run throughout the week. The sharp decline was driven by weak global cues, persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) selling, and a steep slide in information technology (IT) stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex ended 1,176.46 points lower at 78,041.59, while the NSE Nifty50 settled 364.20 points lower at 23,587.50. All broader market indices also fell as volatility spiked following the US Federal Reserve’s recent commentary on rate cuts. Renewed FII selling further weighed on sentiment, with this week’s outflows reaching Rs 12,229 crore. The Nifty IT index tumbled nearly 2.7% and emerged as the top loser among sectoral indices. Major IT stocks such as Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and TCS declined in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Other key sectoral indices like Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services also saw sharp losses. The top five losers on the Nifty50 were Tech Mahindra, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, M&M, and Trent. On the flip side, the top gainers included Dr Reddy’s, JSW Steel, ICICI Bank, Nestle India, and HDFC Life. Broader weakness in Asian markets, triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s downward revision of its 2025 interest rate-cut forecast, added to the pressure on domestic stocks. The Fed's decision dampened market sentiment, particularly impacting IT stocks, which have significant exposure to US clients. “The negative reaction to the Fed’s commentary is temporary,” said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “Quality large-cap stocks are likely to bounce back soon, offering a buying opportunity for retail investors.” While market volatility may persist in the near term due to global uncertainties and continued FII selling, experts believe a recovery led by large-cap stocks is possible in the coming sessions.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Must Watch

The BSE Sensex plummeted over 4,000 points across five consecutive sessions, while the NSE Nifty50 fell approximately 1,200 points, representing a nearly 5% loss within the week. The ongoing selloff has been fuelled by several factors, including hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve, aggressive selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), and concerns over high valuations in the Indian stock market. Adding to investor unease, sluggish corporate earnings growth has further dampened market sentiment, reducing hopes for a quick recovery. On December 20, the NSE Nifty dropped more than 400 points before closing at 23,587, down 1.5%. The BSE Sensex, which fell about 1,350 points intraday, ended the session 1,176 points lower at 78,042. Since its recent swing high on December 13, the Nifty has lost nearly 5% of its value.US FED'S HAWKISH SIGNALS  The US Federal Reserve implemented a 25 basis points rate cut this week, a move widely anticipated by the markets. However, its guidance for only two rate cuts in 2025 fell short of expectations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted persistent inflationary risks, revising the 2025 inflation forecast upward. This cautious outlook sent shockwaves through global markets, including India’s. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said, “Disappointment over slower-than-expected rate cuts by the Fed has affected global sentiment. This bearish view is amplified in India, where high valuations and low earnings growth are already concerns.”FII SELLING RESUMES Foreign institutional investors, who had been net buyers earlier this month, sold Rs 12,230 crore worth of Indian equities over the past four sessions. A strong US dollar, coupled with attractive US bond yields at around 4.52%, has diverted funds away from emerging markets. ""With weak earnings growth, FIIs have few incentives to invest in India for now,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit.CONCERNS OVER TECHNICAL LEVELS  The Nifty fell below its 200-day moving average (23,870) on Thursday, intensifying the selling pressure. On Friday, the breach of support at 23,850 opened the door for further downside, with analysts eyeing levels of 23,500.WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO?  While the ongoing correction has made select large-cap stocks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank more attractive, experts advise caution. The FMCG sector remains expensive, and broader sentiment is expected to stay subdued until February’s RBI policy meeting. Investors are urged to focus on quality stocks and wait for greater market stability.

With this scheme, taxpayers can clear pending tax liabilities by paying the disputed amount along with a specified additional percentage, while enjoying the waiver of interest and penalties. Designed to reduce litigation and streamline tax resolution, the Income Tax Department has issued new FAQs to clarify eligibility and procedures. Let’s have a closer look at some of these FAQs. Can a taxpayer file a declaration under the DTVSV (Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme), 2024 if their appeal was disposed of on merits or dismissed as withdrawn before filing the declaration, for the purposes of the scheme?
Yes, such cases are eligible for settlement under the scheme, as the appeal was pending on 22nd July 2024. The disputed tax will be calculated as if the appeal had not yet been disposed of on that date. Is a case eligible for settlement if a taxpayer has filed a declaration in Form-I, and the appeal is disposed of by the concerned authority after the declaration?
Yes, this case is also eligible for settlement. If the time limit for filing an appeal expired before July 22, 2024, but an appeal with an application for condonation of delay was filed after this date, can the taxpayer opt for the scheme in this case?
No, the appeal must be pending as of July 22, 2024, for a taxpayer to be eligible for the scheme. Therefore, such cases will not be eligible. If an appeal and an application for condonation of delay were both filed before July 22, 2024, and the appeal was admitted after the condonation of delay before filing the declaration under the scheme, can the taxpayer opt for the scheme?
Yes, the taxpayer can opt for settlement under the scheme in such cases. Is an appeal filed against intimation under section 143(1) of the Act and pending as of July 22, 2024, eligible for the DTVSV Scheme 2024?
Yes, any appeal filed against intimation under section 143(1) of the Act and pending as of July 22, 2024, is eligible for settlement under the scheme. Are cases with pending review petitions before the High Courts or Supreme Court eligible for settlement under the DTVSV Scheme 2024?
No, the pendency of a review petition does not equate to the pendency of an appeal before the High Courts, and therefore, it does not count as an appeal pending for the purposes of the scheme. Can the DTVSV Scheme 2024 be availed in cases where proceedings are pending before the Income Tax Settlement Commission (ITSC) or where a writ has been filed against an order of the ITSC?
No, the scheme cannot be availed in these cases. The Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme 2024 offers a unique opportunity for taxpayers to settle their pending income tax disputes in a streamlined manner, helping to reduce litigation and providing financial relief. By addressing key questions about eligibility, the Income Tax Department has provided much-needed clarity. However, taxpayers should carefully assess their individual circumstances and stay informed about the specific requirements to make the most of this valuable scheme. With the right guidance, this initiative could pave the way for quicker, stress-free resolutions of tax disputes.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

A wide range of proposals, from essential services to luxury items, are under discussion, some of which could significantly impact consumers and businesses.LUXURY ITEMS UNDER SPOTLIGHT Luxury items are under the spotlight, with a proposal to increase GST on high-end products. Wristwatches priced above Rs 25,000 and shoes costing over Rs 15,000 per pair may soon attract a 28% GST, up from the current 18%. Additionally, changes in the tax structure for readymade garments have been proposed. Garments priced below â‚¹1,500 are expected to remain at 5%, while those priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 10,000 may see a jump to 18%. Premium garments above Rs 10,000 could face a steep 28% tax. These changes aim to rationalise rates and align taxation with the pricing structure of luxury goods.FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS In a move to ease costs for food delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato, the GST rate may be reduced from 18% with input tax credit (ITC) to a simpler 5% without ITC. This could lower delivery charges, benefiting end consumers. The measure also seeks to address the disparity in tax burdens between dining in and ordering food.GST ON INSURANCE PLATFORMS The meeting has taken up proposals to reform GST on insurance premiums, especially to benefit senior citizens and essential health cover. The Group of Ministers (GoM) has recommended exempting health insurance plans with â‚¹5 lakh coverage, term life insurance, and certain senior citizen-focused policies from GST. Currently, health and life insurance premiums attract an 18% GST rate, while endowment and annuity plans face differential rates. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has underscored the need for exemptions, citing international practices where insurance products are largely tax-free. The proposed reforms could make health and term insurance more accessible, particularly for marginalized groups.AVIATION TURBINE FUEL UNDER GST The council is also considering bringing Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) under the GST regime. This longstanding demand from the aviation industry would allow airlines to claim input tax credit, potentially reducing operational costs. However, this proposal may face resistance from states due to revenue concerns. Meanwhile, a broad set of 148 items, including compact vehicles and pre-owned electric vehicles, may see tax increases. These items are proposed to move from the 12% to the 18% GST bracket, aligning with ongoing efforts to rationalise rates.OTHER POSSIBLE DELIBERATIONS The four-tier GST structure will remain unchanged, but discussions on introducing a 35% rate for sin goods, alongside extensions to the GST compensation cess regime, signal the council’s intent to fine-tune the tax system. While the council's decisions are expected to balance revenue generation with consumer relief, consensus remains critical to implementing these sweeping changes. The meeting's outcomes could reshape taxation across sectors, influencing consumer choices and industry practices in the coming months.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

One of the key items on the agenda is the proposal to reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on insurance premiums, a move that could bring relief to policyholders. A Group of Ministers (GoM) set up by the Council, led by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, has already made progress on this matter. In its meeting last month, the GoM recommended exempting term life insurance premiums from GST, a proposal that has garnered support from several states. Additionally, the GoM has suggested that premiums paid by senior citizens for health insurance should be exempt from the tax, which could benefit a significant portion of the population. There is also a proposal to exempt GST on health insurance premiums of up to Rs 5 lakh, paid by individuals who are not senior citizens. This move, if approved, would make health insurance more affordable for a broader section of the population, especially as medical costs continue to rise.WHAT ELSE IS ON THE AGENDA?  While these changes seem to have strong backing, the Council may defer decisions on other major tax reforms, such as a higher tax on so-called sin goods like tobacco and alcohol. States are still divided on the proposal to increase taxes on these products, and a final decision may take more time. The upcoming decision on insurance premiums is significant not only for policyholders but also for the broader insurance sector. A lower tax burden could encourage more people to opt for insurance, increasing the penetration of life and health coverage in India. As the GST Council continues to evaluate various options, the focus on insurance premiums reflects the government’s ongoing efforts to make essential services more affordable, especially for vulnerable groups like senior citizens. With most states in favor of tax reductions, a positive outcome for policyholders seems likely.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

During the 55th meeting held on Saturday, technical considerations led to the deferral, with the Group of Ministers (GoM) tasked to conduct further deliberations. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman chaired the meeting, which concluded that additional discussions were needed before finalising any changes. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, who leads the GoM on insurance, stated that more time is required to resolve outstanding issues, particularly regarding the taxation of group policies, individual policies, and senior citizens' plans. A subsequent GoM meeting is scheduled for January to finalise these discussions. In November, the GoM recommended certain reforms, including exempting premiums paid for term life insurance policies from GST. Similarly, health insurance premiums paid by senior citizens were proposed for exemption, alongside those up to Rs 5 lakh for non-senior citizens. However, premiums exceeding Rs 5 lakh will continue to be taxed at 18%. The delay reflects the need for further technical assessment, as there are varying opinions among states about these proposed changes. With most states supporting the notion of reducing the tax burden, a positive resolution remains a likely outcome, albeit requiring additional time for consensus.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

The GST Council in its 55th meeting also decided to clarify on taxability of popcorn, saying caramelised popcorn will continue to attract tax at the rate of 18 per cent. However, pre-packed and spiced popcorn will attract 12 per cent, while 5 per cent will be levied on unpacked and unlabelled ones. It has been decided to regularise the issues for the past on ""as is where is"" basis... ""It is a clarification being recommended by the GST Council to settle the disputes arising out of interpretation,"" an official statement said. The panel, headed by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising representatives of all states and UTs, deferred decisions on reducing tax rate on insurance products as also on levy of the tax on food delivery by app-based platforms. The panel cut the tax rate on fortified rice kernels used for public distribution to 5 per cent from 18 per cent, Sitharaman told reporters after the meeting of the Council here. The Council also decided that no GST will be payable on penal charges levied and collected by banks and NBFCs from borrowers for non-compliance with loan terms. The panel deferred a decision on reducing the rate of tax on insurance premium, pending comments of the sector regulator, she said. A group of ministers examining the issue had recommended exempting insurance premiums paid for term life insurance policies from GST and premium paid by senior citizens for health insurance cover. It had also suggested GST exemption on premium paid by individuals, other than senior citizens, for health insurance with coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh. Alongside, the GoM on rate rationalisation, which is looking at tweaking rates on 148 items, will be given more time to arrive at a decision. The finance minister said the council decided to raise the rate of tax to 18 per cent from 12 per cent on all used EV sales, just as in case of non-electric vehicles, and it will be applicable only on the value that represents margin - the difference between the purchase price and selling price (depreciated value if depreciation is claimed) - by businesses. Sale and purchase of used vehicles by individuals will continue to be exempt from GST. Without naming any state, she said the states wanted to continue to keep aviation turbine fuel (ATF), used in aircraft, out of the goods and services tax (GST). When the GST subsumed more than a dozen central and state levies into GST in July 2017, five products - crude oil, petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas - were kept out of its purview. The central government levies excise duty on them and states levy VAT. ""Every state clearly said that ATF should not come into GST... States did not feel comfortable"" to include ATF under the GST, she said. She said black pepper and raisins when supplied by an agriculturalist is not liable to GST payment. GoM on health insurance requires more work, she said, adding the same was the case with rate rationalisation GoM. ""No report (on rate rationalisation) has been finalised,"" she said. The GoM on GST compensation cess, under Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, has been given an extended deadline to submit its report. The earlier deadline was December 31, 2024. On small companies facing registration problems, she said a concept note has received in-principle approvals. This may require amendments to be made to the GST Acts to make it easier for small companies to register. The Council also decided to set up a Group of Ministers to mull over allowing states to levy cess under GST to overcome financial distress after natural calamities. Finance ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal would be part of the GoM. The Council decided to form the GoM after Andhra Pradesh sought Council's approval to levy 1 per cent cess to overcome financial distress post flood in the state. No decision was taken on levy of tax on delivery charges by quick commerce and food delivery platforms. ""This has been deferred,"" she said, adding the Fitment Committee will again review it and the issue being debated is if the tax should be equivalent to 5 per cent GST levied on food or more.Published By: Vivek Published On: Dec 21, 2024ALSO READ |  Paytm Money launches 'Pay Later' Margin Trading. 3 things to knowMust Watch

These decisions aim to streamline tax processes, provide relief in certain areas, and align taxation policies with emerging needs.WHAT’S GETTING CHEAPER? Several items and services will see a reduction in GST rates, offering financial relief: Fortified Rice Kernels (FRK): The GST rate on FRK has been reduced to 5% when supplied through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This move is targeted at ensuring affordable nutrition for economically weaker sections of society. Gene Therapy: In a step toward making advanced medical treatments more accessible, gene therapy has been fully exempted from GST. Food Preparations for Free Distribution: Inputs supplied for food distribution under government schemes for the economically weaker sections will now attract a concessional 5% GST rate. Systems for Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile (LRSAM) Assembly: The Council has exempted Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on systems, sub-systems, and tools used for LRSAM manufacturing, a move likely to benefit the defense sector. Inspection Equipment for IAEA: Imports of equipment and consumable samples for inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will now be exempt from IGST, supporting international regulatory compliance. Pepper and Raisins (Direct Sales): Pepper and raisins sold directly by agriculturists have been clarified as not liable to GST, ensuring relief for agricultural producers.WHAT’S GETTING COSTLIER? On the other hand, some items and services will see higher GST rates, increasing costs for consumers: Old and Used Vehicles (Including EVs): The GST rate has been increased from 12% to 18% on the sale of old and used vehicles, except for certain petrol and diesel variants. This change will impact the resale market for automobiles. Ready-to-Eat Popcorn: Pre-packaged and labelled ready-to-eat popcorn will now attract a 12% GST, while caramelised popcorn will be taxed at 18%. Non-pre-packaged and labelled popcorn with the character of “namkeens” will continue to attract 5% GST. Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (ACC) Blocks: ACC blocks containing more than 50% fly ash will now be taxed at 12%, affecting construction costs. Corporate Sponsorship Services: These services have been brought under the Forward Charge Mechanism, potentially increasing costs for corporate sponsors.OTHER POLICY UPDATES The Council also announced several updates aimed at clarifying existing policies and addressing long-standing ambiguities: Vouchers: Transactions involving vouchers have been clarified as neither a supply of goods nor services, making them exempt from GST. Penal Charges: Penalties collected by banks and NBFCs for non-compliance with loan terms will not attract GST, providing relief to borrowers. Definition of ‘Pre-Packaged and Labelled’: The definition has been updated to align with the Legal Metrology Act. It now covers commodities intended for retail sale, containing not more than 25 kg or 25 liters, and requiring mandatory labeling under the Act. These decisions are expected to have a varied impact across sectors, from healthcare and agriculture to automobiles and retail.  While some changes aim to reduce costs and boost affordability, others align with the government’s focus on revenue optimization and compliance.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Must Watch

Mirchandani had often spoken about his motivation to innovate in India’s FMCG sector, inspired by a lecture during business school. His plans included scaling Epigamia's revenue to Rs 250 crore by FY25 and increasing the brand’s presence in quick commerce channels. His death is among several recent losses in India’s startup ecosystem, including those of Pepperfry co-founder Ambareesh Murty and Good Capital’s Rohan Malhotra.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Dec 22, 2024ALSO READ |  Padma Shri awardee environmentalist Tulsi Gowda dies at 86 in Karnataka

This change, part of the benchmark index's planned rebalancing, will take effect on December 23, replacing steel major JSW Steel. The index reshuffle is expected to result in changes in fund flows. Brokerage firm Nuvama has estimated inflows of $513 million into Zomato due to its inclusion in the Sensex, while JSW Steel may see outflows of $252 million. This rebalancing underscores the evolving dynamics of the stock market as tech-focused companies like Zomato gain prominence. Zomato’s inclusion in the Sensex comes after an impressive performance in the past year. The company’s stock has surged nearly 43% over the last six months and approximately 126% over the past year, far outpacing the Sensex’s one-year return of 10.7%. In contrast, JSW Steel has delivered around 9% returns over the same period. Brokerage firm UBS attributed Zomato’s rally of nearly 150% over the past 18 months to its ability to improve unit economics and move closer to profitability, particularly in its quick commerce (qcom) segment. Zomato reported strong financial results for the July-September quarter, with a 69% year-on-year increase in consolidated revenue from operations, reaching Rs 4,799 crore. The company also recorded a five-fold jump in net profit to Rs 176 crore. The relaunch of its subscription program, Zomato Gold, earlier this year has played a key role in driving growth. The program has helped increase ordering frequency among the company’s top customers, contributing to its robust financial performance. As of December 21, Zomato’s market capitalisation stood at Rs 2.72 lakh crore, surpassing JSW Steel’s Rs 2.24 lakh crore. According to UBS, Zomato is trading at a forecasted FY27 EV/EBITDA (adjusted) of 39 times, which translates to an FY27 EV/Sales multiple of 6.3 times. These metrics highlight investor confidence in the company’s future growth potential. The rebalancing extends beyond the Sensex to the BSE 100 index, which will see the addition of six new stocks: Jio Financial Services, Suzlon Energy, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, Samvardhana Motherson International, and PB Fintech (Policybazaar). These companies will replace Ashok Leyland, P.I.

Unlike in the US, where brokerage fees are negligible and there are no transaction taxes, Indian traders face multiple layers of charges.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/5-reasons-why-options-trading-is-a-losing-game-for-retail-traders-2653990-2024-12-23,"India’s derivatives market has been witnessing unprecedented growth, with retail participation soaring from 5.1 million in FY22 to 9.6 million in FY24. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) recorded over 8.5 billion F&O contracts worth $1.1 trillion in April 2024 alone. However, beneath this surge lies a grim reality for retail investors. Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury, Professor of Financial Analytics at Great Lakes Institute of Management, cited a recent study conducted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to highlight the fact that “for most retail traders, options trading is a losing game”. It may be noted that the Sebi study revealed the stark odds faced by retail traders, with 93% incurring net losses between FY22 and FY24, collectively losing over Rs 1.8 lakh crore ($21.6 billion) in three years. “Despite their enthusiasm and growing numbers, structural and systemic challenges in India’s options market have made consistent profitability elusive for retail participants,” Chaudhury said. In this article, Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury highlights 5 major hurdles faced by retail investors.CRUSHING WEIGHT OF TRANSACTION COSTS One of the biggest challenges retail traders face in India is the prohibitively high transaction costs. Unlike in the US, where brokerage fees are negligible and there are no transaction taxes, Indian traders face multiple layers of charges: Securities Transaction Tax (STT): Levied at 0.125% of the premium on option sales, STT disproportionately affects small-scale, high-frequency trades. Brokerage Fees: Flat rates of Rs 20 per trade may seem minor but can represent a significant cost for low-value trades. Exchange Turnover Fees and GST: NSE/BSE turnover fees and an 18% GST on brokerage fees further inflate costs. For example, a Rs 100 premium option trade in India can incur Rs 37.67 (~4%) in transaction costs, compared to less than $1 (<1%) in the U.S. for a similar trade. Over three years, retail traders in India collectively spent Rs 50,000 crore ($6 billion) on transaction costs, creating an insurmountable break-even point for many.VOLATILITY AND LIMITED GAINS The Indian market’s inherent volatility adds another layer of complexity. While the Nifty Index’s average monthly return (2022–2024) was 1.2%, its standard deviation—a measure of risk—was two to three times that. This heightened variability makes both buying and selling index options risky propositions. Furthermore, options premiums plummet sharply just a few percentage points away from the current market price, leaving retail traders with minimal room for gains. In such a volatile environment, consistent profitability requires precise timing and advanced strategies, skills that most retail traders lack.KNOWLEDGE GAP A lack of understanding of options Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) and advanced trading strategies like spreads or straddles hampers retail traders' ability to manage risk effectively. Instead of treating options trading as a strategic investment, many—particularly the younger demographic—approach it as speculation. The Sebi study found that 43% of retail traders were under 30 years old in FY24, up from 31% in FY23. Many of these young traders are swayed by ""finfluencers,"" who often oversimplify options trading to sell courses, leaving inexperienced traders with unrealistic expectations.THE INSTITUTIONAL EDGE While retail traders struggle, institutional players thrive. Leveraging algorithmic trading systems, they execute high-frequency trades with precision, exploiting inefficiencies that retail traders cannot. In FY24 alone: Proprietary traders recorded gross trading profits of Rs 33,000 crore ($3.96 billion). Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) earned Rs 28,000 crore ($3.36 billion). A staggering 96–97% of these profits were attributed to algorithmic trading, highlighting the technological gap between retail and institutional players. Retail traders, lacking access to similar tools and data, are at a significant disadvantage.DEMOGRAPHIC DISADVANTAGE The Sebi report also highlighted that 75% of retail traders in the F&O segment had annual incomes below Rs 5 lakh ($6,000). For this demographic, trading beyond their financial capacity amplifies risks. Younger, inexperienced traders are particularly vulnerable, often enduring repeated losses in the hope of eventual success. Alarmingly, over 75% of losing traders persisted in trading despite consecutive losses, underscoring a dangerous cycle of overconfidence and lack of financial literacy.WHY RETAIL TRADERS RARELY WIN For retail traders, the odds of success are stacked against them due to: High Costs: Annual transaction costs per trader average Rs 26,000 ($310), significantly eroding potential profits. Time Decay (Theta): Options lose value as expiration nears, with over 70% expiring worthless. Wide Bid-Ask Spreads: These spreads further increase implicit trading costs. High Leverage Risks: While options provide leverage, they amplify losses, particularly in volatile markets. Lack of Education and Tools: Without sophisticated tools or a solid understanding of market dynamics, retail traders are at a perpetual disadvantage.WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE? Recognising these challenges, Sebi has proposed measures to curb speculative trading and protect retail participants, including: Increasing minimum contract sizes: To deter small-capital speculative trades. Regulating weekly expiries: To reduce high-frequency trading pressure. While these steps are commendable, Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury said robust investor education initiatives must complement these. “Retail traders need access to better tools, data, and training to navigate the complexities of options trading effectively,"" he said. ""Unless structural reforms are implemented to reduce costs and level the playing field, options trading will continue to be a losing game for most retail investors in India. For now, the allure of quick riches remains a dangerous illusion for the average trader,” he added.

UltraTech Cement plans to acquire 10,13,91,231 equity shares of India Cements, each valued at Rs 10. This represents a 32.72% stake in the company, held by its promoters, members of the promoter group, and another shareholder. In addition to the stake purchase, UltraTech Cement will make an open offer to acquire up to 8,05,73,273 equity shares from public shareholders. This open offer, which represents 26% of India Cements’ equity, is priced at Rs 390 per share. The offer price is a 15% premium over India Cements’ closing price of Rs 339 on Friday. The news sparked a rally in India Cements shares, which climbed 11% to reach Rs 376.30 during Monday’s trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). UltraTech Cement also saw a modest gain of 1.14%, with its shares trading at Rs 11,555 during the day. At the time the article was being written, India Cements shares were trading at Rs 368.50, up 8.65%.  The acquisition deal was first announced on July 28, 2024, with UltraTech Cement revealing plans to invest Rs 3,950 crore to acquire a significant stake in India Cements. UltraTech Cement had previously acquired a 23% stake in India Cements at Rs 268 per share. Market experts see this acquisition as a move that could lead to better price discipline in the cement industry. Consolidation in the sector is expected to improve profitability and enhance return ratios over the long term. For UltraTech Cement, the acquisition aligns with its growth strategy. The company aims to achieve a global production capacity of 200 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by FY2027. UltraTech Cement's management reiterated its goal of double-digit volume growth for the second half of FY2025. This growth is expected to be driven by government spending on infrastructure projects, consistent demand from urban housing, and increased rural demand following good monsoons. Analysts have also highlighted UltraTech's continued focus on efficiency improvement, which supports its expansion plans. UltraTech Cement's acquisition of India Cements, along with its planned acquisition of Kesoram, is expected to be completed by the end of FY2025. Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 23, 2024

Despite his immense wealth, the French billionaire has slipped to fifth place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $176 billion after losing $32 billion year-to-date.advertisementTHE RISE AND FALL OF A LUXURY MOGULArnault first claimed the title of the world’s richest person in August 2021, fuelled by soaring luxury goods sales in Asia. Since then, his ranking has fluctuated, regaining the top spot briefly in 2022, 2023, and again in May 2024. Arnault first claimed the title of the world’s richest person in August 2021, fuelled by soaring luxury goods sales in Asia. Since then, his ranking has fluctuated, regaining the top spot briefly in 2022, 2023, and again in May 2024. However, a significant downturn followed in September 2024, when LVMH shares dropped 20%, translating to a $54 billion loss due to declining revenues. The company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, attributed the revenue slump to geopolitical tensions affecting global markets. Arnault’s fall marks a stark contrast to the tech-dominated top billionaire list. He is the sole representative of the luxury goods industry in the top five, which is otherwise populated by tech tycoons like Elon Musk ($444 billion), Jeff Bezos ($244 billion), Mark Zuckerberg ($207 billion), and Larry Ellison ($190 billion). Even in the top 10, Warren Buffett, a non-tech mogul, is the only other exception.THE LEGACY OF LVMH Despite these setbacks, LVMH remains a powerhouse in the luxury market, with around 75 iconic brands spanning wines, spirits, fashion, leather goods, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, and jewellery. Some renowned names include Christian Dior, Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Hublot, Tiffany & Co., and Sephora. Even as geopolitical tensions and market challenges persist, Arnault’s empire continues to set the standard in luxury, proving that wealth, like luxury, often comes with its own ups and downs.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Trending Reel

Popcorn gets stuck in GST mazeThe GST Council's decision to impose different tax rates on salted, pre-packaged, and caramelised popcorn has faced criticism, with economists, industry experts, and former government officials arguing that the new tax structure adds complexity for consumers.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/popcorn-gst-salted-prepackaged-caramalised-faces-crticism-experts-heres-why-2654025-2024-12-23,"Popcorn, a timeless snack enjoyed at movie nights, parties, and as a casual treat, has recently found itself at the heart of a complicated tax debate that’s stirring confusion and frustration across the country. The GST Council’s decision to impose different tax rates on salted, pre-packaged, and caramelised popcorn has faced criticism, with economists, industry experts, and former government officials arguing that the new tax structure adds complexity for consumers while failing to make a significant contribution to the government’s coffers. The tax structure is as follows: 5% GST on salted popcorn, 12% on pre-packaged and labeled popcorn, and a hefty 18% on caramelised popcorn. At first glance, the distinction between these varieties seems straightforward, but critics are questioning the logic behind it, especially when the potential revenue impact appears to be negligible. Former Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian is among those who have raised concerns about the new tax rates. Subramanian, known for his outspoken views, pointed out that the revenue generated from this differentiation would be minimal and hardly worth the hassle it could cause to ordinary citizens. In a social media post on X, Subramanian explained, “Estimated popcorn sales in 2025 (estimated from GlobalData) = Rs 1700 crore. Assuming the entire amount is taxed at 18%, GST collection from popcorn = Rs 300 crore. Total GST collection (estimated 2025) = Rs 22,00,000 crore. Max revenue contribution of popcorn decision = 300/2200000 = 0.013%!” He went on to question, “What is the rationale for a decision that can max contribute 0.013% to revenue but inconvenience citizens?” The debate over the popcorn tax has since snowballed, with some prominent voices chiming in, criticising the move as both “silly and complex.” Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai was quick to weigh in, calling the new rates “silly and complex” and warning that they could lead to what he described as “tax terrorism.” Pai raised alarm over how such policies could affect ordinary citizens and called for a simplification of the GST system. “This is silly and complex. Will lead to tax terrorism. Citizens are becoming victims of bad policy which will make them hostages to rent-seeking officials and create disputes. GST needs to be simplified, not this,” Pai said. Arvind Subramanian, another former CFO, added his voice to the chorus of critics, calling the decision a “national tragedy” and arguing that it went against the very spirit of the Goods and Services Tax, which was originally designed to simplify taxation across the country. However, the finance ministry has clarified that the GST Council’s recommendation wasn’t introducing a new tax, but rather offering clarification to resolve disputes that had arisen from the interpretation of existing tax rates. Despite the clarification, the damage had already been done. What started as a seemingly harmless tweak to the tax structure has become a focal point for critics, highlighting the complexities of India’s taxation system. Social media has exploded with memes and jokes about how popcorn—of all things—has become a symbol of the country’s complicated GST framework. But beyond the memes and the public outrage, the popcorn tax sheds light on a far bigger issue: the struggle to maintain a tax system that is both simple and effective. While policymakers are pushing for clarity, the real question remains: will popcorn be the tipping point that forces a serious overhaul of India’s convoluted tax structure?Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 23, 2024

Ujjivan SFB went public in December 2019 with a $1.36 billion valuation, but has since dropped to $0.81 billion. Operational challenges, market corrections, and sector-specific headwinds have significantly eroded these valuations. Similarly, Powergrid Infrastructure Investment Trust and Chemplast Sanmar, which debuted with $1.28 billion and $1.14 billion market caps, respectively, now hover below the billion-dollar mark. Other names in this list include Juniper Hotels, TVS Supply Chain Solutions, and TN Mercantile Bank.IPO MARKET RESILIENCE AMID SETBACKS Despite these setbacks, the Indian IPO market has continued to thrive. This year alone, companies raised a record Rs 1.8 lakh crore through 317 IPOs, surpassing the Rs 1.3 lakh crore raised in CY21. The contribution of IPOs to market capitalisation increased to 2.9% in CY24 from 1.4% in CY23, although it still lags behind the highs of CY17 (3.7%) and CY21 (3.4%). E-commerce, telecom, and retail sectors have driven recent IPO success, reflecting India’s growing digital economy and consumer base. Meanwhile, cyclical sectors like capital goods and real estate have seen fluctuating participation due to market dynamics.THE DUALITY OF SUCCESS India’s IPO market showcases both immense potential and inherent risks. While the record fundraising highlights investor confidence, the struggles of once-billion-dollar IPOs remind us that market dynamics can quickly change fortunes. Investors must tread cautiously, balancing optimism with vigilance.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Must Watch

Report reveals truthPeople don't just put in money but trust when they buy insurance policies to cover for medical emergencies or motor accidents. A report by the Insurance Brokers Association of India reveals how many such claims have been accepted or rejected by insurance companies in 2022-23.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/irdai-report-indian-best-insurance-company-india-policies-medical-vehicle-claim-rejection-rate-data-2654475-2024-12-24,"People buy general insurance to cover for emergencies so that they do not have to make out-of-pocket hefty payments. They do not just put their money in, but trust while paying premiums. However, not all claims get approved. A recent report reveals that the claim-to-settlement ratio, which shows how many claims were honoured by insurers, in 2022-23 at 86%, which is down from the 87% in FY22. The detailed report by the Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI) from data presented by insurance companies reveals that claims repudiation ratio rose to 6% for general insurance, which includes coverage for motor, health, fire and marine cargo. This is the claim rejected by an insurance company as a proportion of the total claims made by its policy buyers. Public sector insurer New India Assurance has the lowest claims repudiation ratio of 0.2%. Other big private insurers with lower rates of claims rejection are HDFC Ergo, Future Generali, Aditya Birla Health and Shriram. Insurance watchdog IRDAI makes it mandatory for insurance companies to put out settlements and rejection data on their websites. The IBAI has collated the data from insurers and put it in a report, which could help people make informed choices about a company's track record while buying insurance policies. In the Policyholder's Handbook, the IBAI has classified the general insurers into four categories -- Public Sector General Insurers, Large Private Sector General Insurers, Other Private Sector Insurers, and Standalone Health Insurers. In the health insurance category too, New India Assurance came on top among the public insurers with a claim-settlement ratio of 95%. Aditya Birla Health, with a claim settlement ratio of 95%, was the best among standalone health insurers. Iffco Tokio and Bajaj Allianz were among the top large private sector general insurers with the best claims-to-settlement ratio of 90% or more, according to the IBAI handbook. What has to be remembered in the case of health insurance is that it is combined data for group (corporate) and individual policies. Claim-rejection rates are historically lower in the case of corporate policies. ""Irdai does not give data for individual and group claims separately. Why not? Who is it protecting,"" asked author-influencer Monika Halan. The real picture will emerge when separate claim-settlement data is available for individual health insurance policies. According to experts, incomplete or false disclosure, consciously or unconsciously, at the time of purchase of policies also contribute to rejection of claims.   In settling motor vehicle own-damage claims too, New India Assurance was the best public insurer with a claim-settlement ratio of 92%. Among large private sector insurers when it came to own-damage claim settlement, Royal Sundaram, Go Digit and SBI General came on top. Future Generali was the top among small insurers. The insurance coverage, be it life or general, is low in India but the tax on insurance premiums, at 18%, is high. In India, insurance penetration is at 30%, and low in comparison to developed countries, like the US, where it is over 90%. Though there is no social security net and government medical infrastructure is rickety, the high 18% GST on insurance premiums defies logic. Many users settle for a smaller cover due to high premiums, experts have told India Today Digital. Several reform measures are needed for the growth of the insurance industry and relief for people so that they can get better cover for themselves. Not just in terms of reduction of tax, there is a need for segregated data on claim-settlement ratios for individual and group policies for people to make an informed choice.Published By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

The stock also marked a fresh 52-week high, continuing its strong post-listing performance since debuting in November this year. The rally followed a bullish note from global brokerage JP Morgan, which initiated coverage on Sagility India with an 'overweight' rating and a target price of â‚¹54. This target implies a potential upside of 16% from the previous close. JP Morgan highlighted the company's robust fundamentals, citing an 18% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in adjusted earnings over FY24-27E, driven by increasing outsourcing in the U.S. healthcare sector. The brokerage noted that Sagility India benefits from deep domain expertise and solid client relationships, which are expected to boost revenue growth. Additionally, the company's strong structural EBIT margins, supported by a higher offshore mix, make it competitive among mid-cap peers. JP Morgan also underlined Sagility’s strategic position in the under-penetrated U.S. healthcare outsourcing market, which stands at just 22% penetration. The brokerage sees Sagility growing its market share by 15%, outperforming the broader healthcare outsourcing market growth rate of 9%. It added that Sagility's focus on non-discretionary operations spending provides a stable revenue profile compared to larger IT and BPO service providers. However, the note flagged key risks, including high client concentration, potential in-sourcing by top clients, regulatory changes in the U.S. healthcare sector, and aggressive adoption of generative AI that could disrupt the market. Sagility India debuted on the stock market with an issue price of Rs 30 per share. At its current level, the stock has surged over 63% from the IPO price, underscoring strong investor interest. The IPO itself saw robust demand, being subscribed 3.2 times, with retail investors leading the charge. Earlier, Jefferies Equity Research also initiated coverage on the company, citing its strong positioning as a leading U.S.-focused business process management firm specialising in healthcare services. Since listing on November 12, Sagility India shares have risen 59%, reflecting optimism over its growth prospects. Analysts tracking the stock have a 'buy' rating, with Bloomberg data indicating an average 12-month price target suggesting a further 13.7% upside.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

Investor confidence in the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) advancements and expectations of a new iPhone upgrade cycle have fuelled a 16% surge in its stock since November, adding $500 billion to its market capitalisation. Currently valued at $3.86 trillion, Apple’s market cap surpasses the combined worth of the leading stock indices of Germany and Switzerland. The strong rally reflects the growing optimism about Apple’s evolving AI strategy and its potential to reinvigorate product demand.advertisementAPPLE'S AI PUSHIn December, Apple began incorporating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its devices, part of its broader initiative to integrate generative AI into its app ecosystem—a strategy announced earlier in June. Analysts view this move as pivotal, particularly in addressing lackluster demand for the iPhone 16 series during the holiday season. In December, Apple began incorporating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its devices, part of its broader initiative to integrate generative AI into its app ecosystem—a strategy announced earlier in June. Analysts view this move as pivotal, particularly in addressing lackluster demand for the iPhone 16 series during the holiday season. Speaking to news agency Reuters, Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, attributed the market’s enthusiasm to Apple’s AI progress and the possibility of a “supercycle” of iPhone upgrades. Similarly, Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring forecasted a recovery in iPhone sales by 2025, driven by the expanded rollout of Apple’s AI features. Woodring reiterated Apple as Morgan Stanley’s top investment pick for the year ahead. Despite these advancements, Apple’s immediate revenue growth for the fiscal first quarter is projected to remain modest. Meanwhile, its price-to-earnings ratio has reached 33.5, the highest in nearly three years, eclipsing major tech competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia. This elevated valuation has sparked concerns over inflated stock prices, prompting Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to reduce its Apple holdings. Even with potential headwinds, such as the possibility of new tariffs on Chinese imports under the incoming U.S. administration, analysts remain optimistic. Past exemptions secured by Apple during prior tariff rounds provide hope for minimal disruptions.

At 11:53 am, shares of Tata Investment were up 11.51% to Rs 7,284 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The surge followed reports that Tata Capital is gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO) worth Rs 15,000 crore. The IPO will aim to comply with regulatory norms and is expected to be one of the largest public offerings in the Indian market. Law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and investment bank Kotak Mahindra Capital have reportedly been appointed as advisors for the proposed deal. In October, the RBI approved the merger of Tata Capital with Tata Motors Finance Limited (TMFL), creating India’s 12th-largest NBFC. This no-objection approval by the central bank sets the stage for Tata Capital’s public listing. Regulatory filings suggest that Tata Capital could list by September 2024, well ahead of the 2025 deadline. Tata Investment Corporation is one of the largest shareholders of Tata Sons, the holding company for Tata Capital. TICL’s close association with Tata Sons explains the strong investor interest in its shares, given the anticipated value unlock from the Tata Capital IPO. The Tata Group’s most recent IPO, Tata Technologies, delivered a stellar performance in the secondary market. Listed on November 30, 2023, Tata Technologies’ shares debuted with a 140% premium to their issue price of Rs 500. The IPO, entirely an offer for sale (OFS), was subscribed 69.43 times, reflecting robust investor appetite for Tata Group offerings. Tata Technologies was the first IPO from the group in nearly two decades, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) being the previous IPO in 2004. The Tata Capital IPO marks another milestone for the conglomerate, highlighting its commitment to enhancing transparency and unlocking value for investors. As preparations for the Tata Capital IPO advance, market participants remain optimistic about the potential impact on Tata Group entities. The rally in TICL shares underscores growing anticipation for what could be one of India’s most significant IPOs in recent years.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

Many believe the move aims to tap into the rapidly expanding sector to boost government revenue.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/18-percent-gst-on-used-cars-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-leave-you-paying-more-amit-malviya-2654625-2024-12-24,"The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council's decision to increase the GST rate on old and used vehicles to 18% has stirred discussions across the country. The revised rate, announced at the 55th GST Council meeting, applies to all old and used vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), sold by registered businesses. However, individuals who are not registered under GST remain unaffected by this change. The decision has sparked debates as it comes at a time when India’s used car market is poised for growth. Many believe the move aims to tap into the rapidly expanding sector to boost government revenue.FINANCE MINISTER'S CLARIFICATION SPARKS CONFUSION While the increase in GST aims to streamline tax rates across different types of vehicles, earlier clarification by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the issue left buyers and sellers unsure about how the new rates would affect them. The Finance Minister said that GST is calculated on the difference between the actual price and the resale price. ""It is on that margin, the value between purchased price and resale price. Bought it for Rs 12 lakh, selling it for Rs 9 lakh in the name of a second-hand used vehicle; on the margin only this 18% has been put,"" the Finance Minister said.  However, the explanation raised questions about how the margin would be determined and whether the increase in GST would ultimately lead to losses for sellers.WHY WAS 18% GST LEVIED ON SALE OF USED CARS Explaining the decision, Amit Malviya, In-charge of the BJP’s National Information & Technology Department, clarified that the 18% GST is calculated only on the margin earned by dealers—the difference between the sale price and purchase price of the vehicle—and not on the total value of the vehicle. “If the margin is negative, no GST is payable. This approach ensures that the tax reflects the value addition by the dealer, which is considered a service under the GST framework,” Malviya said on X. He further added that taxing the dealer’s margin is not new. “This method was also in place during the UPA era as ‘Service Tax’ and continued until 2017.” Previously, old and used petrol, LPG, or CNG vehicles with an engine capacity of 1200 cc or more, as well as diesel vehicles with engines of 1500 cc or more, were already subject to 18% GST since 2018. Similarly, old and used EVs were taxed at 12%. The latest move standardises the GST rate for all old and used vehicles, including EVs, at 18%.BOOMING USED CAR MARKET The timing of this decision aligns with the rapid growth of India’s used car market. According to the Indian Blue Book 2023 report by Das Welt Auto and Car&Bike, the used car market in India was valued at USD 31.33 billion in 2022-23 and is projected to grow to USD 70.48 billion by 2027-28. The report highlights that the market’s average growth rate, which was 6% between FY2017 and FY2022, is expected to jump to 16% between FY2023 and FY2028. Comparatively, the new car market is expected to grow at a much slower pace of 1% to 6% during the same period. Factors such as a growing middle class, higher disposable incomes, and an increasing demand for personal mobility have contributed to the sector’s rapid expansion. The GST increase is expected to impact businesses involved in the sale of old and used vehicles, particularly dealers who claim depreciation on purchased vehicles. While the tax will not affect individuals buying or selling vehicles privately, businesses will need to factor the higher rate into their pricing strategies.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

An article on the 'State of the Economy' in the December bulletin noted that the global economy continues to exhibit resilience with steady growth and moderating inflation. ""High frequency indicators (HFIs) for the third quarter of 2024-25 indicate that the Indian economy is recovering from the slowdown in momentum witnessed in Q2, driven by strong festival activity and a sustained upswing in rural demand,"" it said. The article further said the growth trajectory is poised to lift in the second half of 2024-25, driven mainly by resilient domestic private consumption demand. ""Supported by record level foodgrains production, rural demand, in particular, is gaining momentum. Sustained government spending on infrastructure is expected to further stimulate economic activity and investment,"" the authors said. Global headwinds, however, pose risks to the evolving outlook for growth and inflation, said the article authored by a team led by RBI Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra. India's GDP growth slowed to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent during the July-September period of the current fiscal year. The article said that from the expenditure side, the major factor contributing to the decline in the growth rate of the economy is fixed capital formation and from the production side, the main concern is manufacturing. ""Undermining both is inflation. The erosion of purchasing power due to repeated inflation shocks and persisting price pressures is starkly reflected in weakening sales growth of listed non-financial nongovernment corporations,"" it said. Their outlook on demand conditions also remains subdued as no let-up in the incidence of price shocks seems to be in sight; they will increasingly be inclined to pass on input costs to selling prices. Consequently, there is no robust capacity creation by investing in fixed assets. Instead, corporations are churning and utilising existing capacity to meet the inflation-dented consumer demand, the article said. ""The result is lacklustre private investment. The slowdown in consumer demand seems to be associated with slower corporate wage growth,"" it said. 'The authors further said another headwind emerging is the slowing rate of nominal GDP growth, which could hinder fiscal spending, including on capex, to achieve budgetary deficit and debt targets. The article also noted that as per the projections based on the in-house Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE), real GDP growth is likely to recover to 6.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent in Q3 and Q4 of 2024-25, respectively. Growth for 2025-26 is projected at 6.7 per cent while headline CPI inflation (retail) is projected to average 3.8 per cent in 2025-26. In the December monetary policy, the RBI had projected the GDP growth for 2024-25 at 6.6 per cent with Q3 at 6.8 per cent; and Q4 at 7.2 per cent. GDP growth for the April quarter of 2025-26 was projected at 6.9 per cent; and Q2 at 7.3 per cent.

A uniform GST rate of 18 per cent now applies to such sales, replacing the previous variable rates. Importantly, no new taxes have been introduced for these transactions. GST on the sale of old and used vehicles is applicable only to people or businesses registered for GST and engaged in the purchase and resale of such vehicles. Those not registered for GST are not required to pay the tax.advertisementGST CALCULATION ON USED VEHICLE SALESThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) on old and used vehicles is calculated solely on the seller's margin, not the entire sale price. The margin is determined as the difference between the sale price and the vehicle's depreciated or purchase value, according to guidelines issued by the GST Council. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) on old and used vehicles is calculated solely on the seller's margin, not the entire sale price. The margin is determined as the difference between the sale price and the vehicle's depreciated or purchase value, according to guidelines issued by the GST Council. For sellers who have claimed depreciation under Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, GST is applied only on the margin between the sale price and the depreciated value of the vehicle. In cases where the sale price is lower than the depreciated or purchase value, creating a negative margin, no GST is applicable.EXAMPLES OF GST CALCULATION Officials have outlined clear examples to demonstrate how GST is applied under different scenarios: - Negative margin with depreciation Purchase Price: Rs 20 lakhs
Depreciated Value: Rs 12 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 10 lakhs
Margin: Negative (Rs 10 lakhs - Rs 12 lakhs = -Rs 2 lakhs)
GST Payable: None.
When the sale price is lower than the depreciated value, no GST is payable. - Negative margin without depreciation Purchase Price: Rs 12 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 10 lakhs
Margin: Negative (Rs 10 lakhs - Rs 12 lakhs = -Rs 2 lakhs)
GST Payable: None.
Even when depreciation is not claimed, GST is not applicable on a negative margin. - Positive margin Purchase Price: Rs 20 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 22 lakhs
Margin: Rs 2 lakhs (Rs 22 lakhs - Rs 20 lakhs)
GST Payable: 18 per cent of Rs 2 lakhs = Rs 36,000.
GST is applied at a standard rate of 18 per cent when the margin is positive.  KEY TAKEAWAYS A standard 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies to the sale of used vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), simplifying the taxation process for such transactions. GST is payable only by sellers registered under GST laws, such as businesses involved in the purchase and resale of vehicles. Private sales between individuals are exempt from GST, ensuring that the tax burden applies only to commercial transactions. The tax is calculated solely on the seller's margin, defined as the difference between the selling price and the vehicle’s depreciated or purchase value. If the margin is negative — meaning the sale price is lower than the vehicle’s depreciated or purchase value — no GST is payable.Published By: Vadapalli Nithin KumarPublished On: Dec 25, 2024READ |  18% GST on used cars: Do you have to pay tax on selling your car?Must Watch

Economists push for cuts to help save moreEconomists argued that reducing the tax burden would increase disposable income, enabling citizens to save more and spend on essentials. This, in turn, could help revive demand in sectors impacted by weak consumption.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/budget-2025-income-tax-relief-economists-meet-pm-modi-high-inflation-money-save-low-gdp-2655173-2024-12-25,"Economists have urged the government to reduce income tax rates and introduce reforms to support savings and economic growth in the upcoming Union Budget 2025, reported The Economic Times. These suggestions were shared during a pre-budget interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where several prominent economists and experts discussed strategies for navigating economic challenges. One of the key recommendations was to lower income tax rates. Economists argued that reducing the tax burden would increase disposable income, enabling citizens to save more and spend on essentials. This, in turn, could help revive demand in sectors impacted by weak consumption. Suggestions also included rationalising customs tariffs and providing targeted benefits to vulnerable groups. Lower tax rates for lower-income groups, they noted, would directly impact household budgets, improve financial stability, and potentially lift overall consumption levels.ECONOMIC URGE TAX RELIEF WITH PM MODI During the meeting, the Prime Minister reportedly highlighted employment generation as a central focus for government policy. Economists emphasised the importance of improving data quality for better policy decisions and suggested targeted interventions to address weak consumption, inflation, and global uncertainties. The Prime Minister reiterated the government’s vision of a “Viksit Bharat” or a developed India by 2047. He stressed the need for transformative thinking to keep India on a sustainable growth path, particularly during periods of global economic volatility.WEAK CONSUMPTION AND INFLATION Economists said that India’s domestic consumption has struggled to match growth expectations. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.4% in the July-September quarter, its slowest pace in two years, falling short of the central bank’s 7% target for the period. Rising inflation remains a key concern. Inflation in November was above the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) medium-term target of 4%, putting pressure on household budgets. High prices have reduced disposable income and limited discretionary spending, which economists fear could lead to a demand slowdown. To manage inflation while sustaining growth, economists recommended measures such as direct benefit transfers, public expenditure in rural areas, and incentives for job creation outside the agricultural sector.INCOME TAX REFORMS IN THE PAST The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced significant changes to the income tax regime, offering relief to many taxpayers: Income tax slabs were relaxed for earnings up to Rs 10 lakh. The standard deduction for salaried and pensioners was increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Family pensioners saw their standard deduction rise from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. The employer’s NPS contribution deduction for private-sector employees was increased from 10% to 14%. Industry representatives, including major groups like CII, FICCI, and PHDCCI, have presented several recommendations for the upcoming Budget 2025. They called for comprehensive tax reforms, including the simplification of capital gains tax and streamlined compliance procedures. A reduction in TDS provisions and the establishment of a dedicated dispute resolution mechanism were also proposed. For GST, suggestions included the introduction of a simplified three-rate GST structure, referred to as GST 2.0, and the inclusion of all expenses in the input tax credit chain. Additionally, industry bodies urged for adjustments in direct taxes, such as reduced tax rates for partnership firms and LLPs, the removal of the dividend distribution tax, and relief for share buybacks by treating them as capital gains while allowing deductions for the cost of shares. Customs-related proposals included introducing a single certificate of origin for multiple bills of entry, simplifying the appeal process, and imposing zero customs duty on critical raw materials. These recommendations aim to simplify tax processes, reduce compliance burdens, and boost the ease of doing business in India.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Must Watch

This is against the global trend. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) report shows growth in premium collection in 2023-24. Insurance companies rejected 11% of all claims in FY24.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/insurance-policy-penetration-india-dipped-premium-collection-grew-irdai-report-claim-settlement-ratio-gst-rate-cut-2655158-2024-12-25,"The latest report by India's insurance industry watchdog has revealed that insurance penetration in the country, which was already low, has dipped further to 2.8% in the last financial year. This is in sharp contrast with the global trend. However, there was a 6% increase in premium collection by life insurance companies despite a dip in penetration. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) released its annual report this week which showed that India's insurance penetration dipped to 3.7% in 2023-24 as compared to 4% in 2022-23. ""The insurance penetration for the life insurance industry marginally declined from 3% in the previous year to 2.8% during 2023-24,"" the IRDAI report said. In the non-life or general insurance industry, the penetration remained at 1%, according to the report. Insurance penetration, a measure of the total amount of premiums paid in a year by the gross domestic product (GDP), shows the popularity of insurance products and the extent to which people are covered.   This dip is worrying as India is a country with already low insurance penetration when compared to developed countries or the global average. This is, in fact, the second successive year of dip in insurance penetration in India. Insurance penetration touched a high of 4.2% in 2021-22 on the back of the Covid pandemic. Globally, insurance penetration has gone up from 6.8% in 2022 to 7% in 2023.INSURANCE COMPANIES SETTLED 83% OF CLAIMS IN 2023-24 What has been the performance of Indian insurers in settling claims in FY24? Going by the IRDAI report, insurers settled about 83% of the total number of claims and rejected about 11% of them. The remaining about 6% were pending for settlement as on March 31, 2024. ""The life insurance industry paid total benefits of Rs 5.77 lakh crore in 2023-24, which constitutes 70.22% of the net premium,"" it said. General and health insurers settled 2.69 crore health insurance claims and paid Rs 83,493 crore towards settlement of health insurance claims. The average amount paid per claim was Rs 31,086.GROWTH IN PREMIUM COLLECTION FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES Though insurance penetration dipped in India, insurance density (per capita premium) grew to $95 in 2023-24 from $92 in 2022-23, according to the IRDAI report.  For the world, it stood at $889. The non-life insurance density increased from $22 to $25, while life insurance density remained stable at
$70, according to the IRDAI report. Despite the negative growth in penetration in India, insurance premium collection saw growth in 2023-24. ""The life insurance market in India has recorded consistent premium growth over the years. During 2023-24, the life insurance industry recorded a premium income of Rs 8.30 lakh crore, registering 6.06% growth,"" said the IRDAI report. Going by the trend, IRDAI expects health insurance premiums to grow by 3% in real terms in 2024.  ""With wages and healthcare expenses exceeding CPI
inflation, health insurance pricing is likely to remain elevated,"" the insurance regulator says.  Private-sector players clocked a growth of 15% in premiums in 2023-24 while public sector life insurers saw a growth of 0.23%.CUT GST RATE TO IMPROVE INSURANCE PENETRATION: PANEL The low penetration and a high 18% GST on insurance premiums has been a worry. A Standing Committee on Finance, headed by Jayant Sinha, recommended that the GST rate on insurance products, especially term and health, should be reduced. The high rate of GST results in a high premium burden, which acts as a deterrent to getting insurance policies, it said in its report, submitted in February. The committee noted there was a need to create mass awareness about the need and benefits of having insurance protection and diverse insurance products. However, in its December meeting, the GST Council postponed any call on reducing tax rates for life and health insurance premiums. There is no two ways about the fact that India needs to better its insurance penetration, which is low and dipping. For this, there needs to be a reduction in taxes and premium rates, and information about insurance products spread among the population.Published By: Yudhajit Published On: Dec 25, 2024Must Watch

The Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI) report also predicts that health insurance premiums are ""likely to remain elevated"" this year.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/health-insurance-claims-rejected-pending-irdai-report-premiums-to-remain-high-india-insurers-2655186-2024-12-26,"Insurance companies in India rejected 11% of all health insurance claims in 2023-24 with another 6% of claims still pending as of March 2024, according to the latest report of India's insurance regulator. The Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI) report also predicts that health insurance premiums are ""likely to remain elevated"" this year. The IRDAI report released this week gives a broader picture of the entire insurance industry, life and general.  The insurance penetration in India dipped in 2023-24 for a second consecutive year to 3.7%. It was 4% in the year-ago period, and at an all-time high of 4.2% in 2021-22 on the back of the Covid pandemic. The dip was contrary to the global trend. In non-life or general insurance, health insurance contributes close to half of global nonlife insurance premiums, according to the report.  Going by the trend, IRDAI expects health insurance premiums to grow by 3% in real terms in 2024.  ""With wages and healthcare expenses exceeding CPI inflation, health insurance pricing is likely to remain elevated,"" the insurance regulator says. Premium prices are important as just 10% of the total health insurance policies have been taken out by individuals. What was the claim-settlement ratio of insurance companies? This is important as it reveals the proportion of claims they have honoured against the total claims made. ""During 2023-24, insurers have settled about 83% of the total number of claims registered in their books,"" says IRDAI. The companies rejected 11% of the total claims while about 6% were pending for settlement as on March 31, 2024. It is important to note that the rejection and settlement data is combined for groups and individuals. This doesn't provide a clear picture as cases of rejection of group insurance, generally taken out by corporates, are close to zero. According to experts, incomplete or false disclosure, consciously or unconsciously, at the time of purchase of policies also contribute to rejection of claims. The average amount paid per claim was a little over Rs 31,000 in 2023-24. In the last financial year, the insurers settled 2.69 crore health insurance claims and paid a total of Rs 83,493 crore.  In terms of number of health insurance claims settled, a lion's share of 72% was through Third Party Agencies (TPAs).  In non-life insurance, earnings from the health insurance business was the largest segment with a contribution of 40.29% of the total premium. It has increased from 38.02% in 2022-23.  In 2023-24, insurance companies saw a growth of 20.32% in health insurance premium collection from the last fiscal, according to the report. The health insurance business is classified into three classes -- government sponsored, group and individual.  Of the total lives covered, about 45% each are in government-sponsored schemes and group policies, while just 10% are health insurance cover taken out by individuals. The insurance coverage, be it life or general, is low in India but the tax on insurance premiums, at 18%, is high. While insurance penetration dipped in India, globally, it went up from 6.8% in 2022 to 7% in 2023. Though there is no social security net and government medical infrastructure is rickety, the high 18% GST on insurance premiums defies logic. Many users settle for a smaller cover due to high premiums, experts have told India Today Digital. To get more Indians covered under health insurance so that they don't need to make hefty out-of-pocket payments, tax rates need to be reduced and premiums made affordable.Published By: Yudhajit Published On: Dec 26, 2024

This landmark initiative, utilising drone technology for surveying and demarcating properties in rural areas, aims to unlock the economic potential of villages and improve financial inclusion.advertisementTRANSFORMING RURAL ECONOMIES WITH PROPERTY CARDSLaunched in 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) scheme addresses the long-standing issue of unmapped rural properties in several states. The lack of clear land ownership records had previously denied rural residents access to institutional credit. Launched in 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) scheme addresses the long-standing issue of unmapped rural properties in several states. The lack of clear land ownership records had previously denied rural residents access to institutional credit. By issuing legally-backed property cards, the scheme enables property owners to secure loans, spurring economic activity in rural areas. So far, 317,000 villages—92% of the targeted 344,000—have been surveyed, with 136,000 villages already receiving property cards. On December 27, PM Modi is set to distribute five million additional property cards across India.BENEFITS AMID CHALLENGES Beyond financial inclusion, the SVAMITVA scheme has resolved disputes, empowered women through joint property ownership, and helped gram panchayats tackle encroachments. However, challenges persist, particularly in tribal areas where communal land ownership and family disputes complicate title claims. The parliamentary standing committee on Panchayati Raj has urged the government to address these issues within the legal framework. States like Jharkhand have resisted implementation, while Tamil Nadu, Bihar, and Odisha, having updated rural land records, opted out of the scheme. Despite hurdles, the ministry aims to complete the project by FY 2026.PAVING THE WAY FOR RURAL PROSPERITY By granting clear ownership of residential properties, the SVAMITVA scheme lays the foundation for rural economic growth.

The stock rose 4.72% to an intraday high of Rs 4848.40, compared to its previous close of Rs 4629.50. However, Mazagon Dock shares pared some gains to trade just 1.5% higher at Rs 4,698.85 on the BSE at 12:49 pm.

Speaking on Lenny’s Podcast, Benioff revealed how Jobs’ enigmatic guidance during a creative slump in his entrepreneurial journey led to the creation of Salesforce’s groundbreaking AppExchange.JOBS’ TRANSFORMATIVE CHALLENGE During their conversation, Jobs gave Benioff three directives that were as ambitious as they were cryptic. The first was a bold challenge: “Your company, it better get 10 times larger in 24 months, or it’s over.” He also advised securing a key client, like Avon, and concluded with a cryptic suggestion: “You better go build an application economy.” Perplexed by the last directive, Benioff sought clarification, but Jobs replied with characteristic mystique, “I don’t know, but you’re going to go figure it out.” For Benioff, the exchange felt like a Zen koan—a riddle meant to inspire deeper insight. Determined to unravel the puzzle, Benioff revisited his notes repeatedly until he identified the solution: creating an app store for business applications. This vision materialised in 2006 with the launch of Salesforce’s AppExchange, a platform that transformed the company’s ecosystem and enabled third-party developers to offer apps and services to Salesforce customers. Two years later, in 2008, Apple debuted its App Store, forever changing the mobile technology landscape and validating Jobs’ prescience. As a gesture of gratitude, Benioff gifted Apple the App Store trademark and the appstore.com domain, acknowledging Jobs' role in sparking his breakthrough.A LEGACY OF VISION AND MENTORSHIP Reflecting on his relationship with Jobs, Benioff expressed deep appreciation, stating, “I’m very grateful to have had that relationship. It dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.” This remarkable mentorship moment highlights the profound impact of visionary advice and reinforces the value of bold thinking in shaping the future of technology and innovation.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024

Activating your UAN is essential to access the EPFO’s wide range of online services. The UAN is a unique 12-digit number assigned to employees by EPFO, offering a convenient way to manage Provident Fund (PF) accounts. Once activated, employees can view and download their PF passbooks, file claims for withdrawals, advances, or transfers, and update personal information—all from the comfort of their homes. This eliminates the need for in-person visits to EPFO offices. To activate the UAN, employees need to follow these steps: Visit the EPFO Member Portal. Click on ‘Activate UAN’ under the ‘Important Links’ section. Provide the UAN, Aadhaar number, full name, date of birth, and Aadhaar-linked mobile number. Consent to Aadhaar OTP verification. Enter the OTP sent to the registered mobile number. Upon successful activation, a password will be sent to the registered mobile number, completing the process.ELI SCHEME: A BOOST FOR EMPLOYMENT AND JOB CREATION The ELI scheme, part of the Union Budget 2024-25, aims to stimulate job growth and incentivise both employers and employees.

The three components of the scheme include: Scheme A: Offers a one-month wage (up to Rs 15,000) for first-time employees. Scheme B: Incentivises job creation in the manufacturing sector with EPFO contribution benefits. Scheme C: Reimburses employers for their EPFO contributions for new hires.

The move, likely to be announced in the upcoming Budget 2025 on February 1, aims to boost consumption and address concerns over rising living costs amid a slowing economy, according to government sources cited in a Reuters report. If implemented, the measure could benefit millions, particularly urban taxpayers grappling with high expenses. Under the current regime introduced in 2020, incomes ranging from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 10.5 lakh are taxed at rates between 5% and 20%. In contrast, incomes exceeding Rs 10.5 lakh face a 30% tax rate. As of now, taxpayers can choose between two systems: the traditional structure, which provides exemptions for expenses like housing rentals and insurance, or the newer regime, which offers lower tax rates but eliminates most exemptions. The proposed cut is expected to encourage more individuals to adopt the simplified 2020 regime. Although the government has not finalised the size of any reductions, sources noted that the decision would likely be made closer to the budget date. The finance ministry has yet to comment on the proposal or its potential impact on revenue. One source suggested that reducing tax rates could offset revenue losses by increasing adoption of the streamlined tax system. The proposal comes as India navigates economic challenges, with GDP growth slowing to its weakest pace in seven quarters between July and September 2024. Rising food inflation is eroding household budgets, particularly in urban areas, and dampening demand for goods like vehicles, household items, and personal care products. The political implications of high taxes on the middle class, coupled with wage growth failing to keep up with inflation, have further intensified pressure on the government.

What it means for youThe Supreme Court has ruled that banks charging high credit card interest rates is lawful, placing responsibility on consumers to manage dues efficiently.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/banks-can-charge-over-30-percent-interest-on-credit-card-dues-says-supreme-court-what-it-means-for-you-2655722-2024-12-26,"The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of banks charging interest rates over 30% on credit card dues, overturning a 2008 decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This landmark judgment clarifies that such charges are not unfair trade practices but rather fall within the ambit of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) regulatory framework. The Supreme Court has ruled that banks can charge over 30% interest on credit card dues, overturning a 2008 decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) that had called such high rates unfair.advertisementWHY THE SUPREME COURT OVERRULED NCDRC’S VERDICTA bench of Justices Bela M. Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma observed that the NCDRC's earlier ruling, which deemed high credit card interest rates exploitative, lacked legal backing. The court stated that the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, grants banks the autonomy to set interest rates in line with RBI directives. A bench of Justices Bela M. Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma observed that the NCDRC's earlier ruling, which deemed high credit card interest rates exploitative, lacked legal backing. The court stated that the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, grants banks the autonomy to set interest rates in line with RBI directives. The bench further noted that credit card holders are well-informed about interest rates and penalties during the application process. Therefore, the terms of the agreement, mutually accepted by both parties, cannot be deemed unconscionable or unfair. Importantly, the court held that NCDRC had no jurisdiction to rewrite the terms of such contracts.HOW THIS DECISION IMPACTS CREDIT CARD USERS Transparency in credit card terms
Banks are obligated to disclose all terms, including interest rates, to credit card applicants. Customers are made aware of penalties for delayed payments and high-interest charges on unpaid dues. No relief for defaulting borrowers
Cardholders struggling with overdue payments may feel the pinch, as the ruling empowers banks to levy steep interest rates—sometimes exceeding 36%. This underscores the importance of timely payments to avoid financial strain. RBI's role remains intact
The court clarified that the RBI is the sole authority to regulate bank interest rates. There’s no evidence that banks violated RBI’s policies, reaffirming the central bank’s oversight.WHAT’S NEXT FOR CREDIT CARD USERS? While the judgment secures banks’ autonomy, it serves as a wake-up call for consumers to better manage their credit card spending. Avoiding interest accumulation and paying dues on time can mitigate the impact of high rates. This ruling highlights the balance between financial institution autonomy and consumer awareness. While banks gain legal backing for high interest rates, the onus lies on customers to remain financially disciplined and make informed decisions.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

This change, decided by the GST Council under Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, applies to old and used vehicles, including electric cars (EVs). Here's everything you need to know about this significant development.advertisementFAQS ON GST FOR USED CARSDo I have to pay GST when selling my used car to an individual?
No, GST is not applicable if you sell your car directly to another individual. Do I have to pay GST when selling my used car to an individual?
No, GST is not applicable if you sell your car directly to another individual. Will the GST hike increase used car prices?
If you purchase a car from an individual, the GST hike won’t affect the price. However, buying from dealers or platforms like OLX or CarDekho may lead to higher prices, as GST applies to the dealer’s margin. What is the GST on used EVs?
A standard 18% GST now applies to all used vehicles, including EVs and SUVs. How is GST calculated on used cars?
GST applies only to the margin—the difference between the selling price and depreciated value. For instance, if a car is bought for Rs 10 lakh and sold for Rs 15 lakh with a depreciated value of Rs 12 lakh, GST will be charged on the Rs 3 lakh margin. Who is most affected by this GST hike?
Dealers and platforms selling used cars are most impacted, as the higher tax reduces margins. Some businesses may absorb the cost, while others might pass it on to buyers.IMPACT OF THE GST HIKE For buyers: If you’re buying from an individual, prices remain unaffected. Purchases from dealers may cost more. For sellers: Individuals selling directly face no impact. For dealers: The hike increases costs, with startups and dealers in the used car market feeling the pinch. The GST rate hike on used cars aims to streamline tax slabs but brings mixed implications. While it may raise costs for businesses and buyers using platforms, it could reduce second-hand EV costs in some cases, providing a potential upside for green mobility enthusiasts.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

In an interview with news agency ANI, Adani shared his insight on the work-life balance and said, ""If you like what you do, you will have work-life balance."" However, he also emphasised that one must not impose their idea of work-life balance onto others.  ""Your work-life balance should not be imposed on me, and my work-life balance shouldn't be imposed on you. However, one must ensure they spend at least four hours with their families,"" the Adani Group Chairperson said. 
 
 On a lighter note, the industrialist said, ""For instance, if someone spends eight hours with family, their wife may run away,"" to which people around could be heard laughing.  ""The thing is, you should see how much time can you take out for family and if you are happy, and your family is happy with it, it should be fine,"" Adani concluded. The industrialist's remarks come at a time when the issue of extended work hours is a raging debate in India and there is chatter about work-life balance. Last year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy had sparked a big debate after he suggested that Indians should work 70 hours a week to help the nation progress. In November this year, he reiterated his remarks and said he didn't agree with the idea of ""work-life balance"". Narayana Murthy expressed disappointment over India’s transition from a six-day to a five-day work week in 1986. “I am sorry, I have not changed my view. I will take this with me to my grave,” he said. The thought was echoed by Daksh Gupta, an Indian-origin CEO who runs the artificial intelligence startup Greptile in San Francisco. He said that his company operates on an 84-hour workweek with “no work-life balance.”Published By: Poorva JoshiPublished On: Dec 26, 2024

These words resonate deeply today as the nation mourns the loss of its former Prime Minister and Finance Minister, who died at the age of 92 in New Delhi.  The former PM widely regarded as the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, played a pivotal role in transforming the country’s economy during a time of severe crisis. His tenure as Finance Minister in the early 1990s and later as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014 introduced policies that continue to influence India’s growth. Known for his humility and academic brilliance, Singh’s economic reforms and social welfare programmes remain his enduring legacy.INDIA’S 1991 ECONOMIC CRISIS

 



Manmohan Sigh was elected as Finance Minister in 1991.
 When Singh was appointed Finance Minister in 1991 by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, India was on the brink of an economic collapse. The foreign exchange reserves had dwindled to levels that could barely cover a few weeks of essential imports like oil and fertilisers. Inflation was rising, the fiscal deficit was widening, and India faced a balance of payments crisis. Adding to the challenge, the Soviet Union, a key trading partner, had collapsed, cutting off a major source of cheap oil and raw materials. The situation demanded urgent and bold action. Singh, with his deep understanding of economics, introduced a series of sweeping reforms to stabilise the economy and pave the way for long-term growth.THE 1991 ECONOMIC REFORMS Manmohan Singh’s reforms were centred around liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation, which fundamentally changed the Indian economy. Some of the key reforms were: Devaluation of the Rupee and trade liberalisation - In July 1991, the Reserve Bank of India pledged 46.91 tonnes of gold with the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan to raise $400 million, stabilising the immediate crisis. Singh then devalued the rupee to make Indian exports more competitive in global markets. He also reduced import tariffs and dismantled restrictions on foreign trade, allowing India to integrate with the global economy. Industrial policy reforms: Abolishing the Licence Raj - On July 24, 1991, Singh presented a new industrial policy that ended the ‘Licence Raj.’ Previously, industries required government approval for most operations, including expansion and production. The new policy deregulated nearly 80% of the industrial sector, reducing the number of industries reserved exclusively for the public sector from 17 to 8. This move encouraged private enterprises and foreign investment, fostering industrial growth and job creation. Banking and financial sector reforms - The financial sector underwent significant changes under his leadership. Following the Narasimham Committee’s recommendations, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) was reduced from 38.5% to 25%, and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was lowered from 25% to 10% over a few years. These measures allowed banks to lend more freely, supporting economic expansion. Licensing requirements for bank branches were eased, and interest rates were deregulated, creating a more competitive and efficient banking system. His reforms not only saved India from the brink of collapse but also laid the foundation for sustained economic growth. The policies attracted foreign investments, boosted exports, and created new industries. Millions of Indians were lifted out of poverty as job opportunities expanded. By dismantling socialist controls, India transitioned into a market-driven economy, setting the stage for its rise as one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.LEGACY AS PRIME MINISTER

 Singh’s contributions went beyond his tenure as Finance Minister. As Prime Minister, he championed initiatives that targeted India’s rural and underprivileged population, recognising that economic growth alone could not bridge the gap between urban and rural India. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) - Launched in 2005, this programme guaranteed 100 days of wage employment annually to rural households. It addressed poverty, underemployment, and rural distress, becoming a cornerstone of his government. Right to Information (RTI) and Right to Education (RTE) - Singh’s government introduced the RTI Act, empowering citizens with access to government information. The RTE Act aimed to provide free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14, ensuring education as a fundamental right. Manmohan Singh was not only a politician but also a distinguished economist. He held roles at the Reserve Bank of India, Planning Commission, and International Monetary Fund (IMF) before entering politics. His expertise earned him respect globally, with many recognising his efforts to integrate India into the global economy. His economic liberalisation policies transformed India into one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. He dismantled socialist regulations, attracting foreign investment and creating jobs. His legacy includes a modernised industrial sector, a strengthened banking system, and policies that uplifted millions from poverty. As India mourns his loss, history indeed remembers Dr Manmohan Singh kindly—as the architect of modern India’s economic journey and a leader whose policies continue to shape the nation’s future.

The listing comes after the company’s initial public offering (IPO) witnessed robust demand, with subscriptions exceeding 36 times the total shares on offer. The IPO, open between December 19 and December 24, aimed to raise Rs 550 crore, comprising a Rs 400 crore fresh issue and a Rs 150 crore Offer for Sale (OFS). The proceeds will be used to repay debts (Rs 160 crore), fund investments in its subsidiary, Sanathan Polycot Pvt. Ltd. (Rs 140 crore), and for general corporate purposes (Rs 100 crore). Investor interest was led by institutional buyers, with their portion subscribed 75.62 times, while non-institutional and retail investors subscribed 42.18 times and 8.84 times, respectively. The IPO drew bids worth over Rs 14,000 crore, a testament to the market’s enthusiasm. Sanathan Textiles operates in three verticals: polyester yarn products, cotton yarn products, and technical and industrial textile yarns. It caters to a diverse customer base, including multinational and local companies. The polyester yarn segment is its largest contributor, accounting for 76.8% of revenue in the first quarter of FY25. Financially, the company has faced a slight decline in performance. In FY24, Sanathan Textiles reported revenue of Rs 2,957 crore, down from Rs 3,329 crore in FY23. Its profit after tax (PAT) also dropped to Rs 134 crore from Rs 152.7 crore. Margins have narrowed slightly, with an EBITDA margin of 7.6% in FY24 compared to 7.8% in FY23. SHOULD YOU HOLD OR SELL? Analysts remain cautious despite the strong listing. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, noted the company's shrinking margins and declining profitability as concerns. While the IPO was reasonably priced, Nyati suggests investors consider booking profits given the attractive 31% listing gains. “Company made a quiet stock market debut, listing at a significant 31% premium over its issue price of Rs. 321. Those who took part in the initial public offering (IPO) may take listing gains profit,” Nyati said. With a focus on reducing debt and expanding its business verticals, Sanathan Textiles aims for steady growth. However, investors must weigh the company’s fundamentals against broader market conditions before deciding to hold or sell.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

The sharp drop surprised many investors, but the apparent plunge was due to the stock split, which adjusted the face value from Rs 10 to Rs 5 per share. Certain trading apps may be displaying the unadjusted previous closing price, leading to the perception of a 50% fall. Adjusted for the split, Mazagon Dock shares were trading 2.13% lower on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at 11:09 am. In the previous session, the stock registered gains as more people bought it before the stock split adjustment.  The stock split aligns with the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) guidelines on capital restructuring. According to the company, the move aims to enhance liquidity and encourage broader participation from retail investors. Mazagon Dock is a leading shipbuilder in India and specialises in constructing advanced vessels for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard. Since its inception, it has built 802 vessels, including warships, submarines, and commercial ships. It is on track to complete significant projects by December 2024, such as the 6th Scorpene submarine, the final 15B destroyer, and the first 17A frigate. The company also competes for additional defense projects, including three Scorpene submarines under Project 75I, in partnership with a German designer. It has outlined plans to double its capacity by acquiring 55 acres of land near its existing facilities, with a capex of Rs 5,000 crore spread over the next five years. Mazagon Dock maintains strong financial health, with Rs 4,000 crore in reserves earmarked for capacity expansion. The company has reduced dividend payouts to prioritize growth. Arihant Capital Markets highlighted that Mazagon Dock's profit margins are benefiting from cost efficiencies and timely project completions. Margins are expected to normalize between 12% and 15% in the long term. Despite minor delays, Mazagon Dock remains optimistic about its schedule, with its strategic expansion plans solidifying its position in the defense shipbuilding industry.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

The company announced that he succumbed to lymphoma on December 25. Born Osamu Matsuda on January 30, 1930, in Gero, Japan, Suzuki joined the automaker in 1958 after marrying into the founding family. Taking on his wife’s surname, he began a transformative journey that would see Suzuki Motor become a household name in small cars and motorcycles worldwide. Suzuki’s leadership, which spanned decades, included two terms as president, making him the longest-serving head of a global automaker. Under his guidance, Suzuki Motor formed strategic alliances with General Motors and Volkswagen, leveraging partnerships to expand its footprint across North America and Europe. His boldest move, however, was entering the Indian market in the 1980s. In 1982, Suzuki forged a joint venture with the Indian government, leading to the creation of Maruti Udyog. The partnership introduced the Maruti 800, a small car that became an instant hit and cemented Suzuki’s dominance in the Indian market. Today, Maruti Suzuki remains the largest carmaker in India, contributing significantly to the company’s global sales. Suzuki’s tenure was not without challenges. He faced a fuel-economy testing scandal in Japan, which led to his resignation as CEO in 2016. Yet, his commitment to the company’s resilience and growth remained unwavering. Even in his later years, Suzuki played an advisory role, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and market leadership in the automotive world. His contributions to the industry and his leadership in expanding Suzuki Motor’s global presence remain unparalleled.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

I suggest to this August House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea. Let the whole world hear it loud and clear,” said Dr Manmohan Singh during his first budget speech on July 24, 1991, as India embarked on its journey of economic liberalisation. And rightly so, since India has not looked back and scaled new heights to emerge as an economic powerhouse and ranks fifth globally in GDP for 2024.  The foundation for this growth was laid by Former Finance and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, known as the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, who died in Delhi at the age of 92, leaving behind a lasting legacy. His policies, introduced during a time of economic crisis in the early 1990s, reshaped India’s economy and transformed the Indian stock markets. Singh’s policies came at a time of deep financial distress for India, with foreign reserves nearly depleted and the country on the brink of economic collapse. The reforms he introduced were historic, dismantling decades of restrictive controls and opening the economy to global markets.TRANSFORMATIVE ECONOMIC REFORMS Manmohan Singh’s tenure as Finance Minister saw the implementation of bold measures that liberalised India’s economy. The most notable among them were the abolition of the Licence Raj, opening the economy to foreign investment, reducing import tariffs, and introducing fiscal discipline. ""Singh also led various institutional reforms, including the formation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) as the regulatory authority, which marked a critical step in ensuring transparency and accountability in the stock market,"" said Palka Arora Chopra. Director, Master Capital Services.  The reforms introduced back then laid the groundwork for the India we know today. They transformed India’s economic structure, making it more competitive and globally integrated. This also created a strong foundation for the Indian stock market to flourish.A REMARKABLE RISE IN THE STOCK MARKET The liberalisation measures had a direct and long-lasting impact on the Indian stock market. In 1991, the Sensex was trading at around 1,000 points. Today, it has surged past the 78,000 mark, delivering exponential returns to investors over three decades. ""As the nation pays homage to Manmohan Singh, the architect of liberalisation in India, investors must be acknowledging with gratitude the wealth created by the Indian stock market after the initiation of liberalisation in 1991. Sensex which was around 1000 in 1991 has multiplied about 780 times since then to trade above 78000 now delivering excellent returns to long-term investors. The market will continue to deliver superior returns to investors in the years to come since the India Growth Story, which liberalisation triggered, is very much intact,"" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.  ""Singh also took steps to strengthen Sebi in 1992, enhancing transparency and regulatory oversight, which in turn helped build trust among investors. By opening the market to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), he not only attracted essential capital but also positioned India as a key investment destination, laying the groundwork for sustained market growth,"" said Trivesh, COO Tradejini. ECONOMIC BOOM DURING HIS PRIME MINISTERIAL TENURE Manmohan Singh’s contributions were not limited to his tenure as Finance Minister. As Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014, he oversaw a period of robust economic growth, with GDP growing at an average of 6.9% annually. His government’s focus on infrastructure development, increased foreign investment, and policy stability further boosted investor confidence. ""India’s GDP growth averaged around 6.9% during Singh’s first term as India’s Prime Minister, underpinned by a boom in major sectors and increased infrastructure spending. The stock market soared as businesses expanded and foreign investors began to view India as an attractive destination. The period witnessed one of the strongest bull runs in Indian stock market history, driven by a combination of economic growth, structural reforms and rapid expansion,"" said Chopra.  The boom during this period saw increased participation from foreign institutional investors, significant growth in key sectors like IT, banking, and manufacturing, and the emergence of Indian companies as global players. ""Manmohan Singh's contribution to the Indian economy, particularly in terms of GDP growth, has been extraordinary. His financial expertise in particular was crucial in devaluing the Indian rupee, which helped stabilise our economy. To us, he will always be a leader whose policies prioritise social equity and inclusive development,"" said VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today Explained.  As the nation mourns the loss of one of its greatest economic architects, his words, “India is now wide awake. We shall prevail. We shall overcome,” continues to resonate.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/15-income-tax-changes-in-2024-what-you-need-to-know-for-filing-itr-in-2025-income-tax-rules-stmp-2656139-2024-12-27,"The year 2024 brought significant changes to income tax laws, altering how taxpayers will approach filing their Income Tax Returns (ITRs) in 2025. With the backdrop of general elections earlier in the year, the government introduced sweeping changes to income tax laws, many of which are already in effect for FY 2024-25. These reforms—ranging from revamped tax slabs to new rules for capital gains and TDS—promise to impact how you plan, save, and file your Income Tax Return (ITR) in 2025. Confused about how these changes affect you? Here’s a concise breakdown of the 10 most significant updates and their implications on your finances. Get ready to plan smarter and save better!REVISED INCOME TAX SLABS UNDER THE NEW REGIME The new tax regime has introduced revised income tax slabs designed to benefit individual taxpayers. Under the updated structure, income up to Rs 3,00,000 is exempt from tax, while earnings between Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000 are taxed at 5%. Income from Rs 7,00,001 to Rs 10,00,000 is taxed at 10%, and the next bracket, Rs 10,00,001 to Rs 12,00,000, is taxed at 15%. For earnings between Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000, the tax rate is 20%, and any income above Rs 15,00,000 is taxed at 30%. These changes offer taxpayers opting for the new regime the opportunity to save up to Rs 17,500 annually.INCREASED STANDARD DEDUCTION LIMIT For those under the new tax regime, the standard deduction limit has risen to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000. Family pensioners, too, see a hike to Rs 25,000 from Rs 15,000. The old tax regime retains the existing Rs 50,000 limit for salaried individuals and Rs 15,000 for family pensioners. This increase in deductions under the new regime effectively lowers taxable income, enhancing its appeal to a broader range of taxpayers.ENHANCED NPS DEDUCTION FOR EMPLOYERS’ CONTRIBUTION Under the new tax regime, individuals can now claim deductions of up to 14% of their basic salary for employer contributions to the National Pension System (NPS), up from 10%. However, contributions exceeding Rs 7.5 lakh across EPF, NPS, and superannuation funds remain taxable, ensuring balanced benefits within specified limits.SIMPLIFIED CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION Capital gains taxation has been simplified under the new framework. Short-term capital gains (STCG) on equity and equity-oriented funds are now taxed at 20%, up from 15%, while long-term capital gains (LTCG) on all assets are uniformly taxed at 12.5%. Equity and equity-oriented funds continue to enjoy an annual exemption of up to Rs 1.25 lakh. However, these changes simplify tax calculations but limit indexation benefits for certain assets.RATIONALISED TDS RATES To reduce complexity, TDS (tax deducted at source) rates have been rationalised for various payments, such as insurance commissions (2%), rent (2%), and e-commerce payments (0.1%). This rationalisation reduces upfront tax deductions, allowing taxpayers to retain more money initially.CLAIMING TDS AND TCS CREDIT AGAINST SALARY Salaried individuals can now adjust TDS or TCS (tax collected at source) deductions from other sources of income against TDS on their salary, easing cash flow concerns and ensuring higher monthly take-home pay.CHANGES IN TDS ON PROPERTY SALES For property sales exceeding Rs 50 lakh, TDS is now applicable on the entire sale value, irrespective of individual sellers’ shares, enhancing compliance and preventing TDS evasion.VIVAD SE VISHWAS SCHEME 2.0 The Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme 2.0 has been reintroduced to help resolve ongoing tax disputes amicably. This provides taxpayers with an opportunity to settle their cases efficiently, reducing uncertainties.AADHAAR MANDATORY FOR ITR AND PAN APPLICATIONS Starting October 2024, individuals will no longer be able to use their Aadhaar enrolment numbers for filing ITR or applying for PAN. Aadhaar itself will be mandatory for these processes. Now, those without Aadhaar will face difficulties in completing these tasks.REDUCED TIME LIMIT FOR OLD ITR REVISIONS The time limit for reopening old ITRs has been reduced to five years for cases involving income escaping assessments above Rs 50 lakh. This change aims to minimise prolonged litigation and provide greater certainty for taxpayers. The tax changes in 2024 aim to simplify processes, enhance compliance, and offer select benefits. Taxpayers should evaluate old versus new regimes and stay informed to optimise savings while meeting their obligations. The evolving tax landscape underscores the need for careful planning and timely action.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Trending Reel

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, remarked on the remarkable listing, stating, “Such a strong debut was expected, given the reasonable valuations and massive subscription across investor categories. For conservative investors, booking profits at this level is advisable. However, long-term investors could hold onto their shares, considering Mamata Machinery’s position in the automation and flexible packaging space.” Tapse highlighted the company’s robust customer relationships, global distribution network, and focus on after-sales service as key strengths, enabling it to capitalize on growth opportunities in the evolving packaging industry. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart Ltd, echoed similar sentiments, advising investors to partially book profits while keeping a stop loss at Rs 550.

The company has established itself as a trusted partner in the packaging industry, supported by its emphasis on innovation and customer satisfaction. With a massive subscription to its IPO and a stellar market debut, Mamata Machinery’s performance has validated investor confidence.

All you need to knowCentral government employees await a potential DA hike in January 2025, which could offer modest relief amid rising costs",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/will-dearness-allowance-da-rise-again-in-2025-check-details-how-it-is-calculated-all-you-need-to-know-2656247-2024-12-27,"As the new year approaches, central government employees eagerly await updates on the next dearness allowance (DA) revision. Scheduled for January 2025, this potential hike could bring welcome relief amid rising living costs. However, with the process hinging on the All-India Consumer Price Index (AICPI) numbers, the official announcement may face delays.HOW DA IS DETERMINED Dearness Allowance is revised biannually, reflecting the cost of living based on AICPI data. The Centre reviews the index for January-June and July-December periods, announcing revisions after evaluating the 12-month average AICPI. The DA percentage is based on a 12-month AICPI increase, concluding in June annually. Though revised biannually, announcements often lag. On October 16, 2024, the Union Cabinet approved a 3% DA hike to 53%, aiding over one crore employees and pensioners. Earlier, a 4% hike raised DA to 50% in January 2024, announced in March. The formula for calculating DA is straightforward. For general employees, DA Percentage = ((Average AICPI for the past 12 months - 115.76) / 115.76) x 100. Adjustments vary slightly for central public sector employees, but the basic principle remains consistent.EXPECTED DA HIKE IN JANUARY 2025 Projections suggest a further 3% increase in DA for January 2025, based on current AICPI trends. With the index reaching 144.5 in October 2024 and expected to rise further, the DA may climb to 56%. If approved, this will translate into significant financial benefits. For instance, an employee with a minimum salary of Rs18,000 would see an increase of Rs 540, while those earning the maximum salary of Rs 2,50,000 could gain Rs 7,500. Pensioners, too, stand to benefit, with hikes ranging from Rs 270 to Rs 3,750 depending on their pension.FUTURE PAY REFORMS While employee unions are pushing for the establishment of the 8th Pay Commission, the government has clarified there are no immediate plans. Minister of State Pankaj Chaudhary recently confirmed in Parliament that no proposals are under review, leaving employees and retirees uncertain about future reforms. The anticipated DA hike in 2025 offers much-needed financial relief, but the delay in establishing the 8th Pay Commission underscores the growing demands for a comprehensive overhaul of the pay structure.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

5a12d874-5463-4802-b778-c25de487bb77,Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu revives debate on 70-hour work weekZoho CEO Sridhar Vembu weighs in on the 70-hour work week debate initiated by Infosys founder Narayana Murthy. Here's his perspective.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/zoho-ceo-sridhar-vembu-revives-debate-on-70-hour-work-week-advocated-by-infosys-founder-narayana-murthy-2656318-2024-12-27,"Zoho’s CEO, Sridhar Vembu, has reignited the long-standing debate on the 70-hour work week, a notion first proposed by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. Vembu recently shared his thoughts in a detailed post on X. He wrote, ""The rationale behind the 70-hour work week is 'it is necessary for economic development' "".
 


 IS HARD WORK THE KEY TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS? Vembu referred to the work culture in East Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China, noting that their rapid economic development was driven by intense labour. However, he pointed out that these nations now face significant demographic challenges, with plummeting birth rates leading governments to incentivise families to have children. Vembu raised two critical questions: ""Is hard work necessary for economic development? Is the price of such development, in terms of a lonely old age for many, worth it"". He responded to the first question by acknowledging that only a small percentage of the population needs to push themselves hard for economic growth, suggesting that 2-5% of people can drive development while the rest enjoy a balanced work-life scenario. Regarding the second question, Vembu firmly stated that it’s not worth sacrificing personal well-being and demographic stability for the sake of economic success. THE DANGERS OF OVERWORK: A CAUTIONARY TALE Vembu expressed concern over India potentially mirroring China's economic success if it leads to a similar demographic decline. He warned against pushing India’s workforce to the same extreme work culture, stating the importance of balancing productivity with quality of life. ""I do believe we can develop without needing to work ourselves to demographic suicide,"" Vembu concluded. Narayana Murthy’s controversial advocacy for a 70-hour work week has sparked debates about the need for productivity boosts to compete globally. While some agreed with his call for more hours, others warned of burnout and its long-term effects on society. On the other hand, Vembu's stance offers a reminder that development doesn’t have to come at the cost of personal and societal well-being. Balancing economic growth with a healthy demographic future could be the way forward.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

Read this IndiaToday Exclusive. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/octafx-ferox-firm-run-by-russian-national-dupes-crores-from-indian-investors-pavel-prozorov-exclusive-2656797-2024-12-29,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet in the alleged Rs 800 crore Ponzi scheme scam orchestrated by a forex firm run by a Russian national named Pavel Prozorov.  In the last four to five years, OctaFX, a Forex trading platform, was visible everywhere on social media, from advertisements to sponsoring IPL teams. Very few, or say, no one knew that OctaFx was an elaborate long-term Ponzi scheme launched in India to dupe people of their hard-earned money.  The ED recently filed a second chargesheet against Octafx India, its operating company overseas, OctaMarkets, its founder Pavel Prozorov, OctaFX CEO, who handled India operations, Anna Rudaia, and nine other individuals accused apart from a total of 41 companies and entities. WHY IS IT AN ELABORATE PONZI SCHEME?  According to the exclusive details accessed by IndiaToday, the predicate offence, on the basis of which the ED started investigating, was an FIR filed at Shivajinagar police station in Pune in 2021, against two to three brokers and agents who had duped deaf and dumb persons with a promise of doubling their savings through forex trade at OctaFx in five months and triple it in eight months.  The investors lost huge sums in crores, following which an FIR was filed against the brokers, who are also called 'introducers' by OctaFX. With aggressive online and social media advertising promotions by hiring area-wise influencers and TV personalities, and even top Bollywood actors to promote the platform, they managed to lure numerous investors.  OctaFx employed a number of brokers who helped people invest in the platform. They were called introducers and were paid handsomely for luring people, with gifts like luxury cars, bikes, gold coins and gold bars.  The firm also organised events at 5-star hotels in Goa and invited agents and brokers and felicitated them with hefty bonus amounts and gifts at these events.  According to sources, the platform also offered to invest huge amounts of crores in cash from select customers and investors, mostly bigger introducers, whose online history showed that they had been regular. These cash amounts were collected by their agents and handed over to cash couriers and then deposited into multiple accounts of shell entities.  Once the amount invested swelled to huge proportions, the investors started losing money. Unsuspecting investors in tier-2 or tier-3 cities were mostly targeted with the help of so-called introducers where cash movement in business markets was huge.  However, the forex firm denies any wrongdoing and stresses on the companies' good track record. ""Since 2011, OctaFX has established a solid reputation in the financial industry, with hundreds of thousands of satisfied clients worldwide testifying to the quality and reliability of our services. We strongly refute any claims of money laundering, false promises of exorbitant returns, or engaging in practices that disadvantage traders,"" a spokesperson said.  ""Contrary to the allegations, we have never promised quick riches or guaranteed profits. Instead, we consistently emphasise that forex trading requires a knowledgeable and conscious approach. To support this approach, we provide comprehensive educational resources, which are publicly available on our website, YouTube channel, and the Octa app, to help clients make informed decisions,"" he added. Contrary to the company's claims, the recent investigations by the ED have revealed that forex trading platform OctaFx collected Rs 800 crores as proceeds of crime in just nine months of operations in India. However, the investigation is still ongoing to determine the precise amount of profit that OctaFx has earned from its operation in India. Further, the OctaFX platform frequently changed its login URLs and web addresses in a deliberate strategy to obscure fraudulent activities by investors.  ""Our team actively monitors the public activity of our partners and promptly addresses any misleading statements whenever and wherever they appear. Our partners are required, under the Introducing Broker Agreement, to provide fair and transparent information about the risks involved in forex trading. Whenever any infractions occur, we immediately take action, as with the case in Pune when unscrupulous IBs misrepresented our brand,"" the company further stressed.  During the investigation, OctaFx fully cooperated with authorities and provided all necessary information to assist in resolving the matter, it added. The platform is also accused of manipulating trade activities, resulting in substantial net losses for investors while diverting the defrauded funds into e-wallets and accounts of fictitious entities. Moreover, OctaFx utilised fintech workers to create mule accounts linked to shell companies and fake e-commerce websites. These entities were created to obtain payment gateway access, disguising investor funds as legitimate purchases, as per details exclusively accessed by IndiaToday.  The funds were then routed abroad under the pretext of fake imports and freight services. The platform has gained traction through aggressive promotions, including sponsoring an IPL team, and engaging various production agencies for influencer marketing. Payments to these production agencies were made as foreign inward remittances, through two Estonia-based companies. Both are related entities of OctaFx and controlled by Pavel Prozorov.MODUS OPERANDI  This Forex trading platform was widely promoted on social networking sites and followed referral-based incentive models for acquiring users to their platforms. The funds were collected from users, majorly through UPI/local bank transfers and channelised through dummy entities. These funds were credited to the bank accounts of various dummy entities and domestically transferred to other banks for the purpose of layering.  The multiple accounts of different Indian banks were being shown to investors/users on the OctaFx trading app for collecting funds in the guise of facilitating forex trading. The said accumulated funds, after defrauding these investors or users, were transferred to multiple e-wallet accounts or to bank accounts of dummy entities. The entire process of reflecting account numbers of dummy entities, managing the funds collected in these accounts and diversion of the same was managed and operated by the owners of OctaFx group entities.MONEY LAUNDERING WITH HELP OF DUMMY DIRECTORS, WHO WERE INDIAN NATIONALS, AND SHELL ENTITIES   The OctaFX India operations were run through multiple mule accounts where money was deposited from investors. These accounts belonged to some entities which had Indian directors who had been tutored by OctaFX officials to verify the Know Your Customer (KYC) details whenever needed. Further to legitimate the transactions, the funds from these accounts were transferred to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) registered funds.  To send this money or launder it overseas, they claimed an import order for the import of services and payments were done for the same when actually no such services were offered or taken and eventually the money would be laundered in crores outside the country to various tax havens or smaller European countries. ROLE OF OCTAFX GROUP FOUNDER PAVEL PROZOROV  Pavel Prozorov, Director of OctaFx India Pvt. Ltd. (now Tauga Pvt. Ltd.), is the mastermind behind OctaFx's global Forex and CFD trading operations. He orchestrated a network designed to conceal the origin of illicit funds and facilitate money laundering through shell companies.  Prozorov’s exploitation of regulatory loopholes and the establishment of dummy entities in India exemplify his calculated approach to financial deception. He utilised these entities to manipulate records, allowing funds to be transferred overseas without raising suspicion. Additionally, Prozorov directed substantial promotional campaigns targeting Indian investors, including celebrity endorsements and sponsorships, further embedding OctaFx in the market.  Prozorov's actions constituted careful layering, placement, and integration of laundered funds as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), misrepresenting their origins.  Despite multiple summons from the ED, Prozorov evaded compliance, indicating deliberate obstruction of legal processes. His direct involvement in establishing a complex web of entities and orchestrating financial flows under Section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), as he engaged in the concealment, possession, acquisition, and use of proceeds of crime. He is also liable for punishment under Section 4 of the PMLA for his role in facilitating large-scale financial fraud and evading regulatory oversight. ED has attached some palatial properties of Pavel in Spain worth Rs 41 crores through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).  However, OctaFx denied any role of Prozorov and refuted accusations of him being the 'masterming' of any fraud, saying it lacked credible evidence. ""We strongly reject these unfounded accusations and will take decisive action against any attempts to tarnish our reputation,"" it maintained.ROLE OF FORMER OCTAFX INDIA CEO ANNA RUDAIA  Anna Rudaia, also a Russian national and former CEO of OctaFx India Pvt. Ltd., was summoned last year and her statement was recorded once by the ED, but a day later, she didn't appear despite being summoned by the agency. A Look-Out Circular has already been issued in her name, but she managed to flee the country through illegal channels and has conveyed that she is presently outside India.  Rudaia played a crucial role in managing the Indian operations linked to illicit Forex trading and money laundering activities. Under her leadership, OctaFx organised events promoting unauthorised trading, violating regulatory frameworks mandated by the Reserive Bank of India (RBI) and SEBI.  Rudaia’s involvement included overseeing marketing strategies that attracted Indian investors and channelling illicit proceeds through complex layers to disguise their origins. Despite multiple summonses from the ED, she evaded compliance and fled India, indicative of her intent to escape accountability. After her departure, Rudaia continued to manage operations remotely and facilitated the formation of M/s APAC Stock Brokerage Operations Pvt. Ltd. to continue OctaFx’s activities under a different guise.  Rudaia's actions directly contributed to the laundering of proceeds of crime, fulfilling the requirements of Section 3 of the PMLA through the concealment, possession, acquisition, and use of illicit funds. Based on the evidence, Rudaia is implicated under Sections 3 and 4 of the PMLA for her active participation in promoting illegal Forex trading and laundering activities.ED CHARGESHEET AND ATTACHMENTS IN THE CASE  ED Mumbai had earlier filed a Prosecution Complaint (PC) against OctaFx and its associated entities under the provisions of the PMLA before the Special Court (PMLA), Mumbai on October 1 and a supplementary Prosecution Complaint on December 20. They took note of the prosecution complaint and supplementary prosecution complaint on December 24. The ED has conducted extensive search proceedings and has so far attached and seized assets worth approximately Rs 165 crore, including attachment of 19 immovable properties located in Spain. These properties are owned by the prime accused, Pavel Prozorov. ED officials said that further investigation in the alleged scam is underway.Published By: Vivek Published On: Dec 29, 2024Must Watch

The telecom operator has received a letter from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) regarding a waiver on bank guarantees. Additionally, Vodafone Group, a promoter entity, has settled Rs 11,650 crore of its outstanding dues, releasing pledged shares in Vodafone Idea. Vodafone Idea shares closed at Rs 7.49 on Friday, down 0.93%. The stock has fallen 56% so far in 2024.advertisementBANK GUARANTEE WAIVER Vodafone Idea informed the stock exchanges that the DoT, in a communication dated 27 December 2024, has waived the requirement for Financial Bank Guarantees (FBGs) for spectrum acquired in auctions held in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2021. However, this waiver is subject to certain terms and conditions. Before this decision, Vodafone Idea was required to provide bank guarantees worth Rs 24,800 crore for spectrum instalments. These guarantees had to be submitted 13 months before the instalments became due. According to Vodafone Idea, it will no longer need to provide bank guarantees for the auctions held in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2021. However, a one-time partial shortfall will remain for the 2015 auction, where the net present value (NPV) of all payments made so far is less than the pro-rated value of spectrum used. Vodafone Idea is currently discussing the final amount of this shortfall with the DoT.VODAFONE GROUP SETTLEMENT In a separate development, Vodafone Group has settled Rs 11,650 crore of outstanding dues secured against its shares in Vodafone Idea. These dues were owed by the group's Mauritius and India-based entities, with the pledge held by HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK). According to a regulatory filing, the settlement has resulted in the release of a pledge on 15.72 billion shares held by Vodafone Promoter Shareholders. This accounts for 22.56% of Vodafone Idea’s equity capital on a fully diluted basis.TARIFF HIKE AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Vodafone Idea recently implemented a tariff hike, which has slightly increased its average revenue per user (ARPU). However, revenue growth remains marginal. The company expects the impact of the tariff hike to reflect in its ARPU and revenue figures over the next two quarters. Geojit Financial Services noted that Vodafone Idea anticipates subscriber growth driven by the expansion of its 4G coverage and the rollout of 5G services in key regions starting from Q4FY25. Additionally, the telecom operator’s fundraising efforts through equity issuance or convertible securities are expected to support its expansion plans and help reduce debt.

JSW Energy stock: Brokerages are bullish on the shares of JSW Energy after the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, JSW Neo Energy signed a major deal.

O2 Power is a renewable energy platform set up by Swedish asset manager EQT Partners and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings. The acquisition, valued at Rs 12,468 crore ($1.47 billion) after adjusting for net current assets, has been positively received by market experts, who see it as a strong step towards enhancing JSW Energy’s renewable energy portfolio and boosting its future growth prospects. O2 Power is a big player in the renewable energy sector with a total capacity of 4,696 MW. Of this, 2,259 MW is expected to be operational by June 2025, while 1,463 MW is under construction. Additionally, 974 MW is in the pipeline, targeted for completion by June 2027. The assets are spread across seven resource-rich states in India and have a tariff of Rs 3.37 per kilowatt hour (KWh). The facilities have an average remaining life of 23 years, which adds long-term value to JSW Energy’s portfolio. This acquisition increases JSW Energy’s locked-in generation capacity by 23% to 24,708 MW, bringing the company closer to its target of reaching 25 GW capacity by FY27/28. Following the announcement, JSW Energy shares were trading at Rs 663.3, up 6% compared to the previous session’s closing price of Rs 629.85 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The company’s market capitalisation now stands at Rs 1.09 lakh crore. Over the last year, JSW Energy's stock has climbed by 53%, reflecting the company’s efforts to expand its renewable energy portfolio and strengthen its market position. Several brokerage firms have praised the acquisition and shared optimistic outlooks for JSW Energy. Global brokerage Investec highlighted the deal as a major step for JSW Energy, as it significantly enhances the company's renewable energy capabilities. Investec noted that the transaction includes approximately 2.4 GW of operational assets with an estimated run-rate EBITDA of Rs 1,500 crore. However, the brokerage retained a ""hold"" rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 675 per share. Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal reiterated its ""buy"" recommendation for JSW Energy, raising the target price to Rs 810 per share. It emphasised that acquiring 4.7 GW of high-quality renewable assets at a valuation of 7x EV/EBITDA is favourable, especially when compared to listed renewable energy companies that trade at nearly 15x EV/EBITDA. Motilal Oswal highlighted key positives from the deal:
O2 Power’s competitive interest cost of 8.8% aligns well with JSW Energy’s financial strategy.
O2 Power’s receivable days stand at 43, significantly lower than JSW Energy’s 68 days.
A majority (87%) of O2 Power’s portfolio is secured by utilities such as SECI, NTPC, and SJVN, while the remainder is backed by highly rated commercial and industrial issuers.
The portfolio is diversified across solar, wind, and niche renewable segments.

The company’s shares have gained significant ground since their IPO debut at Rs 31 last month, marking an impressive rise of over 80%. The ongoing rally has been driven by a combination of strong financial performance and growing investor interest in Sagility’s prospects within the healthcare outsourcing sector.WILL POSITIVE MOMENTUM CONTINUE?  Recent financial results have played a crucial role in driving the stock’s performance. The company reported a notable increase in consolidated net profit and revenue from operations, underlining its operational efficiency and ability to capitalise on emerging opportunities in the market. Sagility has strategically positioned itself to benefit from the rising demand for outsourcing services in the U.S. healthcare sector, a trend that analysts believe could sustain its growth trajectory.

With enhanced transparency, simplified processes, and increased flexibility, taxpayers now have more tools at their disposal to file returns accurately and efficiently. Whether it’s the revamped Form 26AS or the introduction of pre-filled ITRs, these updates are designed to make compliance less stressful. Let’s explore five key changes that are making tax filing easier than ever.ENHANCED TRANSPARENCY WITH FORM 26AS The revamped Form 26AS now offers taxpayers a detailed view of their tax transactions. It includes tax deductions, collections, payment details, demands, refunds, and specified financial transactions (SFTs). This transparency helps taxpayers monitor their financial activities, ensuring accurate income disclosure.PRE-FILLED ITRS FOR HASSLE-FREE FILING Pre-filled ITRs now ease the process by automatically populating data like salary income, bank interest, and dividends. This reduces manual effort, minimises errors, and makes tax filing more efficient for individuals.FILING FLEXIBILITY WITH UPDATED RETURNS Under Section 139(8A) of the Income-tax Act, taxpayers can file updated returns within two years of the relevant assessment year. This allows individuals to voluntarily correct mistakes or omissions by paying additional taxes. The e-verification scheme also streamlines reporting of unreported income.SIMPLIFIED PERSONAL TAX REGIME The alternative tax regime, introduced in 2020 and further refined in 2024, offers lower tax slabs for those who opt to forgo specific exemptions and incentives. This aims to make the tax structure more straightforward for individual taxpayers.EXPANDED SCOPE OF TDS AND TCS The tax base has widened with the inclusion of transactions like large cash withdrawals, luxury car purchases, foreign remittances, e-commerce sales, and virtual asset transfers under TDS (tax deducted at source) and TCS (tax collected at source). This ensures greater compliance and accountability. These reforms make tax compliance more seamless and transparent, empowering taxpayers with tools and options to stay on track with their filings while reducing complexities in the process.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

The decline comes after the company’s spectacular stock market debut last week, with analysts attributing the fall to profit booking by retail investors capitalising on the massive listing gains. On Friday, Mamata Machinery delivered a stellar debut on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), listing at a 147% premium to its IPO price of Rs 243. The stock opened at Rs 600 per share, giving the packaging machinery manufacturer a market valuation of Rs 1,476.47 crore. The listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) matched the same rate, reflecting robust investor demand. The company’s IPO, which aimed to raise Rs 179.39 crore, saw overwhelming interest during its three-day subscription period, closing with an impressive 194.95 times oversubscription. The price band for the issue was set between Rs 230 and Rs 243, with the minimum investment requirement at Rs 14,823 for 61 shares. Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, highlighted the strong debut, noting that such a performance was anticipated given the reasonable valuations and high subscription levels across all investor categories. “For conservative investors, booking profits at this level is advisable. However, long-term investors may consider holding onto their shares, given Mamata Machinery’s strong positioning in the automation and flexible packaging sector,” he added. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart Ltd, also recommended partial profit booking while setting a stop-loss at Rs 550. Nyati pointed to the company’s global presence, consistent revenue growth, and sound fundamentals as indicators of its long-term potential. Mamata Machinery, a leader in packaging solutions, specialises in manufacturing and exporting advanced machinery like plastic bag-making and pouch-making equipment. Its focus on innovation and strong customer relationships has established it as a trusted name in the industry. Despite today’s decline, Mamata Machinery’s strong fundamentals and global footprint suggest it remains an attractive option for long-term investors, provided they navigate short-term fluctuations carefully.

The last Union Budget did not make changes to the old tax regime but introduced modifications to the new tax regime to make it more appealing.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/budget-2025-last-major-income-tax-relief-economists-experts-standard-deduction-tax-rate-cut-2657244-2024-12-30,"The Union Budget 2025 is scheduled to be presented on February 1, 2025 as expectations are high among salaried individuals for income tax relief. Rising inflation and the increased cost of living have led to hopes that the government will announce measures to ease the financial burden on taxpayers. Economists have also called on the government to cut income tax rates and implement reforms to boost savings and economic growth in the Union Budget 2025, as per media reports. During a pre-budget meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, experts discussed ways to address economic challenges. A key suggestion was reducing income tax rates, as it could raise disposable income, encourage savings, and stimulate spending on essentials, potentially reviving demand in sectors hit by sluggish consumption. The last Union Budget did not make changes to the old tax regime but introduced modifications to the new tax regime to make it more appealing. Two income tax slabs were widened, and the standard deduction under the new regime was raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. The standard deduction is a fixed amount subtracted from taxable salary income, helping employees manage common work-related expenses. India first abolished the standard deduction in 2005, which previously allowed employees to deduct Rs 30,000 or 40% of their salary, depending on income levels. It was reinstated in Budget 2018 at Rs 40,000, then increased to Rs 50,000 in the interim Budget 2019. In the 2023 Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman expanded the scope of the standard deduction. Individual taxpayers in the new tax regime could claim Rs 50,000, while family pensioners could deduct up to Rs 15,000. Salaried individuals earning Rs 15.5 lakh or more received a tax benefit of Rs 52,500.PREVIOUS MAJOR INCOME TAX RELIEF Ajinkya Gunjan Mishra, Tax Partner at S&R Associates said, “The last significant income tax relief for individual taxpayers was announced in the Union Budget for the financial year 2020-21, which introduced a new and optional personal income tax regime.” This optional regime introduced lower tax rates but required taxpayers to forgo common exemptions and deductions, such as those under Sections 80C and 80D. Mishra explained that the primary goal was to simplify the tax system and provide relief to middle-income earners. Mishra added, “The introduction of reduced tax rates under the optional regime has particularly benefited middle-income taxpayers who do not claim deductions or exemptions.” He also noted that India’s income tax structure is moderate compared to global standards. For instance, India’s basic exemption limit of Rs 3.5 lakh is lower than Singapore’s Rs 6-7 lakh equivalent but higher than many European nations. Dipesh Jain, Partner at Economic Laws Practice, highlighted that the Finance Act 2024 brought additional relief for taxpayers. Jain said, “The new tax regime expanded the basic tax-free income slab limits, reduced tax rates at certain income levels, and increased the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000.” Another major change was the reduction in the long-term capital gains tax rate from 20% to 12.5%. However, Jain said, “This change may not always be beneficial due to the removal of the indexation clause, which in some cases increases the tax burden.” Both Mishra and Jain agreed that these tax changes have positively impacted disposable income and consumer spending. The simplified options under the new tax regime have increased liquidity for middle-class taxpayers, enhancing their purchasing power. India’s top marginal tax rate under the new tax regime is 39%, which is in line with global averages. For comparison, the UK has a top tax rate of 45%, while the US imposes up to 37%. Countries like Australia, Germany, and Japan also have top rates of around 45%. “To increase purchasing power and boost the economy, the government could consider rationalising effective tax rates along with other measures,"" said Jain.

Here is all you need to know. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/sensex-nifty-in-2025-whats-next-for-stock-markets-in-the-new-year-2657239-2024-12-30,"As the curtains close on 2024, Dalal Street reflects on a year of steady gains and record-breaking moments. The Sensex climbed 8.24% while the Nifty rose 8.84%, with both indices reaching historic peaks—Sensex touching 85,978 and Nifty scaling 26,277 on September 27. Despite the milestones, the journey wasn’t without hurdles. Now, as 2025 approaches, all eyes are on what’s next. Can Indian equities continue their upward climb, or will a mix of global and domestic hurdles create a rocky road ahead? Experts believe the year could bring fresh opportunities for investors, thanks to policy shifts, government spending, and innovation-driven growth across key sectors. ""Indian equities were buoyant amidst a challenging and eventful year with higher volatility. The markets were volatile with multiple global events, a slowdown in the Indian economy, tighter liquidity conditions and delayed government spending,"" notes Deepak Ramaraju, Senior Fund Manager at Shriram AMC. However, recent policy changes could set a positive tone for the coming year. Ramaraju points out that ""a recent cut in CRR is expected to ease the liquidity conditions followed by a pickup in government spending. These two factors are expected to improve overall consumption and pickup in industrial output."" The focus in 2025 will likely shift to several key sectors. According to Ramaraju, ""The stock market in 2025 is set to ride on strong economic growth and government efforts to boost infrastructure and digital innovation. Sectors like capital goods, technology, financial services, consumption, and healthcare are expected to shine, with emerging areas such as semiconductors, electronic and manufacturing, renewable energy and electric mobility grabbing more attention."" Government spending will play a crucial role in market movement. Capital expenditure until October 2024 stood at Rs 4,66,545 crores, representing only 42% of the budgeted Rs 11,11,111 crore for FY25. This slower pace of spending compared to the previous year suggests potential for increased activity in the latter half. Looking at global factors, Neeraj Chadawar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, identifies key areas to watch: ""The market will closely monitor the global developments around the following events: 1) Policies in the US government during the Trump presidency, 2) Trade policy, 3) Further rate cut by the US FED in 2025, and 4) The direction of Currency and Oil prices in 2025."" On the domestic front, Chadawar expects market volatility to continue, particularly in the first half of 2025. ""These events are expected to keep the Indian equity market volatile, and it could respond in either direction based on the developments. However, we expect the first half of 2025 to be more volatile. More concrete developments are expected in the second half."" The investment approach for 2025 might need to be more calculated. As Chadawar suggests, ""With current valuations offering limited scope for further expansion, an increase in corporate earnings will be the primary driver of the market returns moving forward. Hence, bottom-up stock picking with a focus on 'Growth at a Reasonable Price' and 'Quality' would be keys to generating satisfactory returns in the next one year."" While opportunities exist across sectors, investors might need to maintain a balanced approach, considering both the growth potential and associated risks in what promises to be an eventful year for stock markets.

Despite the rising popularity of mutual funds and equities, nearly 15% of household savings still find their way into FDs. However, the perceived safety of FDs comes with its share of risks and limitations that investors must consider before making decisions.advertisementTHE REALITY OF SAFETY AND RISKSThe Indian banking system is well-regulated, fostering confidence in the safety of bank FDs. However, regulatory protection is limited to Rs 5 lakh per person per bank under RBI guidelines. Deposits exceeding this limit are theoretically at risk. The Indian banking system is well-regulated, fostering confidence in the safety of bank FDs. However, regulatory protection is limited to Rs 5 lakh per person per bank under RBI guidelines. Deposits exceeding this limit are theoretically at risk. FDs with PSU banks are considered the safest, followed by private scheduled banks and small finance banks, which offer higher interest rates but carry greater risks. Instances like the moratoriums on Yes Bank and Global Trust Bank serve as cautionary tales. Similarly, corporate FDs demand careful scrutiny of credit ratings, reputation, and lock-in periods to avoid defaults.RETURNS THAT BARELY KEEP UP While FDs provide fixed interest rates, their real returns often fail to keep pace with inflation and taxes. For example, an 8% return on an FD for a high-income individual can shrink to a post-tax yield of 4.88%, which, when adjusted for 6% inflation, results in negative real returns. This scenario is even worse for ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Additionally, FDs lack the compounding advantage of equity mutual funds or stocks, where returns are taxed only upon realisation, allowing for wealth accumulation over time.CHOOSE WISELY FOR WEALTH CREATION  While FDs offer a safe harbour, their limited growth potential makes them unsuitable for long-term wealth creation. Investments in equity-oriented products, when held for 7–10 years, tend to mitigate risks and provide significantly higher returns. Safety, though important, should not come at the cost of wealth erosion. By understanding the hidden risks of FDs, investors can make informed choices, balancing security and growth for a financially prosperous future.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

Historically, January has often been a challenging month for equity markets, with the NSE Nifty 50 index recording losses in 13 out of the past 20 years. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/stock-market-in-january-2025-what-to-expect-investors-face-a-tough-start-sectors-to-watch-dalal-street-2657261-2024-12-30,"Stock markets have seen a downward trend in the latter part of December 2024 and Dalal Street's performance in January 2025 is under close watch as a series of major global and domestic events are expected to influence investor sentiment. Historically, January has often been a challenging month for equity markets, with the NSE Nifty 50 index recording losses in 13 out of the past 20 years. Since 2019, the index has experienced a losing streak in January for six consecutive years. Adding to the uncertainty, the swearing-in of Donald Trump as the US president on January 20 is anticipated to impact global markets. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve’s potential delay in rate cuts and India’s Union Budget, set to be announced on February 1, are key factors that could shape market dynamics.INVESTOR CAUTION AHEAD OF MAJOR EVENTS Market experts are advising caution for January 2025, given the confluence of global and domestic events. Jathin Kaithavalappil, Assistant Vice President at Choice Broking, said, “Domestic equity markets are expected to be cautious in Q1FY2025. The domestic Union Budget: fiscal measures to be released for the year on February 1, 2025, and the unemployment reports out of the US, as they almost always signal winds of changing trends in inflation in the USA. Finally, creeping inflation in our country in different areas will certainly be one of the issues.” G Chokkalingam, Founder of Equinomics Research, expects a weak start to 2025 for Indian markets. “A weak rupee, possible delay in aggressive rate cuts by the US Fed, and the forthcoming Budget would delay the return of FIIs’ investments in Indian equity,” he said. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) poured Rs 3,459 crore into equities in 2024 until December 26, but they offloaded over Rs 1.15 lakh crore worth of shares in October and November. This follows significant buying activity in 2023, during which FIIs invested Rs 1.71 lakh crore.2024: A MIXED YEAR FOR EQUITY MARKETS Despite heavy outflows by FIIs in the last quarter of 2024, the overall year was positive for the stock market. The NSE Nifty 50 gained nearly 10% year-to-date until December 27, 2024. Meanwhile, the Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 indices surged by 23% and 26%, respectively, during the same period. Ajay Garg, Director and CEO of SMC Global Securities, believes there is room for optimism in 2025. “Nifty 50 is expected to cross the 28,000 mark in 2025, but the growth may remain non-linear. The current market downturn, in turn, poses a good opportunity to pick some high-quality stocks at a lower price. Taking the ‘buy low sell high’ approach can provide fruitful returns in 2025,” he said.SECTORS TO WATCH IN 2025 Certain sectors are expected to drive market growth in 2025, particularly BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance), FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods), and infrastructure. BFSI: The sector saw its total income rise by 16% year-on-year in the July-September 2024 quarter. Garg noted, “BFSI will experience sharp growth in 2025 with improved asset quality, growth in loans, higher investment participation, and higher financial literacy.” FMCG: The sector faced challenges in 2024 due to lower consumer demand. However, Garg believes it could recover strongly in 2025. “The FMCG sector is one of the stable sectors that can revive with rising consumption, quick commerce push, and higher premiumisation,” he added. Infrastructure: This sector posted a 12.9% year-on-year growth in total income in the July-September 2024 quarter. Garg highlighted the role of government spending and public-private partnerships in driving the sector’s growth, along with improvements in logistics and housing development.

The share, which had closed at Rs 281.83 on Friday, opened at Rs 288.70 on Monday, reflecting strong investor interest. The significant rise in Greaves Cotton’s stock price is attributed to multiple factors, including developments in its subsidiary, Greaves Electric Mobility (GEML), and increased investor confidence. Greaves Electric Mobility, a subsidiary of Greaves Cotton, recently filed a draft prospectus for a Rs 1,000 crore Initial Public Offering (IPO). The public issue will include a fresh issue worth Rs 1,000 crore and an Offer for Sale (OFS) of up to 18.94 crore shares by existing promoters and shareholders.

This marks the first time Kedia has invested in the company, a move that has further enhanced market sentiment. His investment came shortly after the GEML IPO received approval, highlighting confidence in the company’s direction. Greaves Cotton has a current market capitalisation exceeding Rs 7,200 crore, with its shares doubling in value during 2024. The company is undergoing a significant transformation, moving from its traditional role as an engine manufacturer to becoming a provider of fuel-agnostic mobility solutions. This transition is supported by diversified revenue streams and a focus on electric and multi-fuel vehicles. In the second quarter of FY25, Greaves Cotton reported consolidated revenue of Rs 705 crore. Its retail arm, Greaves Retail, continues to lead in the three-wheeler motor and parts segment while also expanding into the electric three-wheeler category.  The company’s management has set a target to achieve Rs 15,000 crore in revenue by 2030. This goal is underpinned by its strategy to diversify revenue streams and focus on multi-fuel and electric mobility solutions, aligning with global trends in sustainable transportation.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 30, 2024

The government has taken steps to simplify taxation through the New Tax Regime, but concerns remain over the potential elimination of the old system, which offers extensive deductions and exemptions. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, addressing these concerns after Budget 2024, stated that no decision has been finalised, and any changes would follow a thorough evaluation.advertisementCOMPARING OLD AND NEW TAX REGIMESThe Old Tax Regime, a longstanding system, encourages savings through exemptions like those under Section 80TTB, especially benefiting senior citizens. Tax rates range from 5% to 30%, with various deductions available. The Old Tax Regime, a longstanding system, encourages savings through exemptions like those under Section 80TTB, especially benefiting senior citizens. Tax rates range from 5% to 30%, with various deductions available. In contrast, the New Tax Regime introduces lower tax rates (0% to 30%) but reduces exemptions, simplifying the filing process and catering to those in lower income brackets. Key changes in the New Tax Regime include raising the tax-free limit to Rs 3 lakh, introducing a 5% tax for incomes between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 7 lakh, and increasing the standard deduction for salaried employees to Rs 75,000. Additionally, employer contributions to the National Pension System (NPS) now enjoy enhanced tax benefits. These changes aim to save taxpayers up to Rs 17,500 annually under the New Tax Regime.WHAT'S NEXT? The progressive tax slabs under the revised New Tax Regime offer simplicity but come at the cost of fewer savings incentives. For instance, while the New Tax Regime benefits individuals in lower tax brackets, it lacks the robust exemptions that the Old Tax Regime provides. As the government continues its push for a streamlined tax system, the question remains: will the Old Tax Regime be scrapped entirely? While no final decision has been announced, taxpayers must evaluate which system aligns with their financial goals. The future of taxation lies in striking a balance between simplicity and incentivising savings, ensuring a fair and efficient framework for all.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Must Watch

Conviction to accumulate stocks will emerge only when macro indicators suggest recovery in growth and earnings.

Unimech Aerospace IPO has been commanding a good grey market premium and reached Rs 715 on December 29, 2024, but has since seen a gradual decline in the unofficial market.  The Grey Market Premium (GMP) for the Unimech Aerospace IPO was last reported at Rs 625 as of December 31, 2024, at 5:04 AM. Considering the IPO's price band of Rs 785, the anticipated listing price for Unimech Aerospace shares is estimated at Rs 1,410.

The recently-listed investment banking firm saw its stock rise to an intraday high of Rs 406.65 after opening at Rs 368.05. By 11 am, the shares were trading 3.60% higher at Rs 385.70, recovering some ground lost during Monday’s profit booking. Monday’s 8% drop followed a strong debut for Dam Capital on the stock market last week, where it gained significantly, drawing both retail and institutional interest. Analysts believe Tuesday’s uptick reflects renewed investor demand after the sharp pullback. Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President (Research) at Mehta Equities, highlighted that Dam Capital’s robust listing was driven by reasonable valuations and positive market sentiment. “Conservative investors should consider booking profits on higher-than-expected returns, but those with a long-term perspective and an appetite for volatility may hold onto their shares,” Tapse advised. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, praised Dam Capital for its strong growth in investment banking services, including equity capital markets, mergers and acquisitions, and private equity advisory. However, Nyati cautioned that the company’s valuation appears fully priced, recommending a stop-loss strategy at Rs 390 and partial profit booking. Despite the recent volatility, analysts remain optimistic about the company’s fundamentals. Dam Capital’s positioning in the growing investment banking sector and its ability to capitalise on market opportunities continue to make it an attractive choice for investors. However, experts suggest closely monitoring its long-term performance and broader market trends before making additional investments. The stock’s movement on Tuesday signals resilience as it continues to garner attention from investors. While short-term fluctuations may persist, Dam Capital’s strong market positioning and promising growth trajectory could sustain interest, particularly among those seeking exposure to the financial services sector.

As per a report by Moneycontrol Pitti intends to sell 50,37,21,910 shares at Rs 15.60 per unit, which is an 8.45% discount to the stock's previous closing price. This move follows his earlier stake sales in the company over the past few months.

Before this, in June 2023, he sold 6.25 crore shares at Rs 42.60 per share. The continuous stake reduction by the promoter has raised concerns among investors, contributing to the sharp decline in the stock price. The stock has fallen 16.56% in 2024 so far and has seen a 23.78% drop from its 2024 highs. Additionally, the stock turned ex-bonus in a 1:1 ratio on November 29, which has also impacted its trading pattern. Institutional investors are expected to participate in the fresh block deal.

For the September quarter, Easy Trip Planners reported a 45.16% drop in profit, posting Rs 25.87 crore compared to Rs 47.18 crore in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter showed a modest growth of 2.1%, reaching Rs 144.67 crore compared to Rs 141.69 crore in the previous year.

Many have revised target prices upward, with projections averaging around Rs 320.55, indicating confidence in the company’s growth trajectory.

Taxpayers must complete payments within 15 days of receiving Form-2 to avoid penalties. This streamlined approach reflects the government’s commitment to reducing litigation, fostering compliance, and promoting a dispute-free tax system. Chartered Accountant Himank Singla, partner, SBHS and Associates, while speaking to The Economic Times, stated that the extension encourages higher participation and aligns with the government’s objective to resolve disputes effectively.

Check all detailsUnion Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary recently revealed in Parliament that only 6.68% of India's population filed ITRs in the fiscal year 2023-24.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/itr-filing-deadline-extended-for-belated-revised-return-cbdt-new-date-income-tax-check-all-details-stmp-2657711-2024-12-31,"The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for resident individuals to file their belated or revised Income Tax Returns (ITR) for the Assessment Year (AY) 2024-25. The original deadline of December 31, 2024, has now been pushed to January 15, 2025. This extension gives taxpayers an additional two weeks to complete or revise their filings. The CBDT shared this update via an announcement on X, and said, “CBDT extends the last date for furnishing Belated/ Revised return of income for AY 2024-25 in the case of Resident Individuals from December 31, 2024 to January 15, 2025.” The change has been made using the board’s powers under section 119 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

 



ITR deadline extended
 This extension applies to two specific cases. Firstly, it benefits individuals who missed the initial deadline of July 31, 2024, to file their ITR and had until December 31 to file a belated return. Secondly, it allows taxpayers who need to make corrections to previously filed returns an extended window to submit their revised filings. Under current rules, taxpayers filing belated returns must pay a late fee. If the taxable income is below Rs 5 lakh, the fee is Rs 1,000. For those with taxable income above Rs 5 lakh, the late fee increases to Rs 5,000. Taxpayers often make errors or omissions when filing their ITR, such as missing income details or claiming incorrect deductions. A revised return allows individuals to rectify these mistakes. Filing a corrected ITR ensures compliance with tax regulations and can help avoid penalties or additional scrutiny. Despite repeated efforts to encourage tax compliance, a small portion of India’s population files income tax returns. Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary recently revealed in Parliament that only 6.68% of India’s population filed ITRs in the fiscal year 2023-24. “In FY 2023-24, the percentage of population that filed Income Tax Return is 6.68%. The total number of persons filing income tax returns is 8,09,03,315,” he informed the Rajya Sabha on December 17. The new deadline aims to provide relief to taxpayers who may have faced difficulties meeting the December 31 deadline. It also ensures that those needing to correct or update their returns have sufficient time to do so without unnecessary haste.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Trending Reel

Axis Securities is quite hopeful about India's growth in 2025. They say India's economy is doing better than other growing countries and should keep doing well. ""Nifty 50 EPS is projected to grow by 7.6% in FY25, with growth expected to accelerate to 13.7% in FY26 and 11% in FY27, reflecting a robust 14% CAGR over the FY23–27 period. This growth will be supported by the real estate cycle, private capex recovery, and strong
construction activity during this period. Risks include global macro uncertainties, inflation pressures, and potential earnings downgrades post-Q3,"" Axis Securities said.  However, they say investors should keep an eye on a few things in 2025: what happens in US government policies after Doanld Trump takes oath as President, any changes in trade rules between countries, whether the US central bank cuts interest rates, and how oil prices and currency rates move. In India, they suggest watching for the upcoming budget and possible interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India.

Following a volatile 2024 that saw significant gains in the first half before moderating, market experts anticipate single-digit returns in the coming year. The previous year’s journey was particularly noteworthy.

This performance is especially remarkable considering the substantial foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. As Tapse notes, Nifty achieved its ""ninth consecutive year of positive returns, despite FIIs selling shares worth Rs 3,03,000 crore.""CAUTION AND UNCERTAINTY REMAIN  The market sentiment entering 2025 remains cautious, with several global factors weighing on investor confidence. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, points to ongoing challenges: ""Markets are preparing to move into the New Year with caution since uncertainty is high and valuations are stretched. The high US bond yield and strong dollar will ensure that FIIs will continue to sell on every rise."" Several other analysts expect 2025 to be a year of modest returns, with geopolitical issues and US Federal Reserve decisions playing crucial roles in market direction. The change in US government, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and anticipated Fed rate cuts are contributing to market volatility.WHAT'S IN FOCUS?  The first half of 2025 could see muted earnings due to tepid demand, according to market experts. Analysts believe stock markets are likely to remain range-bound in the first half of the year, with recovery expected later in the year driven by underlying earnings growth. Vijayakumar highlighted the importance of corporate performance: ""Conviction to accumulate stocks will emerge only when macro indicators suggest recovery in growth and earnings. Watch out for the Q3 results starting from January 10 to identify companies reporting good numbers despite the growth slowdown."" Despite the cautious outlook, some analysts maintain optimistic targets. According to a Business Today report, Choice Broking's Jathin Kaithavalappil projects the Sensex to reach 90,000 and Nifty to hit 28,000 by year-end, citing India's strong domestic consumption and investment cycle. Meanwhile, Religare Broking's Ajit Mishra provides a more conservative estimate, with Nifty potentially reaching 26,000 by the end of 2025. As markets navigate through these challenging times, Tapse's closing remarks capture the sentiment perfectly: ""Sentiments are volatile, and caution is advised as we enter the new year.""Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

This surprising move caught the attention of millions of his followers and also caused a stir in the cryptocurrency market. 
 


 The memecoin KEKIUS, sharing its name with Musk’s new persona, surged over 500% in just a few hours, reigniting enthusiasm in the volatile world of memecoins.WHAT IS KEKIUS MAXIMUS? Kekius Maximus, which goes by the ticker, KEKIUS, is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency token that blends humour with decentralised finance (DeFi). KEKIUS is influenced by internet culture, particularly the Pepe the Frog meme and the Maximus character from Gladiator. According to CoinGecko, the token operates across multiple blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana, with a current market capitalisation of over $85 million. KEKIUS tokens are actively traded on both centralised and decentralised exchanges, with Gate.io being the most popular platform for transactions. The token’s highest recorded price was $0.09274 on December 31, 2024, while its lowest price of $0.0006923 was seen just 13 days earlier. The sudden surge in KEKIUS’s value is a testament to the power of social media and Musk’s unparalleled influence in the tech and crypto realms.THE MUSK EFFECT ON MEMECOINS Musk, a well-known fan of memes and cryptocurrency, further amplified the hype by resharing posts about his new identity. One such post joked about journalists addressing him as “Kekius Maximus,” to which Musk replied, “This will be priceless.” While he hasn’t clarified his reasons for adopting the new name, his tweets have once again demonstrated their market-moving potential.
 


 The surge in KEKIUS has also revived interest in other Kekius-themed memecoins, some of which have soared by over 200% within hours of launch. Experts believe this could signal the return of the 'memecoin season,' where humour and speculation drive unprecedented gains in the crypto market. Musk’s playful antics continue to blur the lines between internet culture and high-stakes financial markets, leaving everyone guessing what he’ll do next.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 109.12 points to settle at 78,139.01, while the Nifty50 edged down by 0.10 points, closing at 23,644.80. Among the sectoral indices, Nifty IT emerged as the top loser, declining by 1.44% by the end of the session. This downturn in IT stocks, which derive a substantial portion of their revenue from the US market, is attributed to the US Federal Reserve's recent indication of fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously anticipated. The stance has led to a rise in Treasury yields, diminishing the appeal of emerging markets like India for foreign institutional investors (FIIs). Consequently, FIIs have been net sellers for ten consecutive sessions, offloading shares worth approximately $2.8 billion. In terms of individual stock performance on the Nifty50, the top gainers included Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Kotak Mahindra Bank, Trent, and Coal India. Conversely, the leading losers were Adani Enterprises, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, and SBI Life Insurance. The mixed performance across broader market indices, coupled with rising volatility during the session, suggests a cautious investor sentiment as the year concludes. Market participants are now looking ahead to 2025, closely monitoring global economic indicators and policy decisions that could influence market dynamics in the coming year. Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares, said, ""Today's market action exhibited a V-shaped recovery, with a subdued opening followed by a sharp decline led by weakness in the Mid and Smallcap stocks. However, a strong recovery across sectors helped the Index close the session at 23,644.80."" ""A Spinning Top candlestick pattern appeared on the chart, suggesting indecisiveness but also raising the possibility of a positive divergence in the RSI, which could signal a change in momentum. In terms of technical levels, the immediate resistance is seen at 23,700, and a confirmation of trend reversal would see the next resistance level at 23,880. On the downside, 23,470 remains a key support level,"" he added.

""The near-term trend appears weak with the macro construct dominated by weak GDP and earnings growth. The headwinds from a strong dollar ( $ index is at 108.5%) and high U.S. bond yields will impact the market through more FII selling, at least in the early days of 2025. Even though FII selling is matched by DII buying, in this tug of war, in the near-term, sentiments are on the side of FIIs since valuations continue to be elevated and growth and earnings are yet to show signs of recovery,"" he added.  A trend reversal may happen if the Q3 corporate results indicate recovery in earnings. But an across the board sharp recovery appears unlikely. Positive cues can come from a growth-stimulating Budget followed by a rate cut by the MPC in February.

In addition to boosting energy production, the project is expected to generate employment for approximately 5,000 people, both directly and indirectly. It is also set to attract an investment of around Rs 10,000 crore to Bihar, marking a significant milestone in the state’s energy development plans. In August 2022, the Ministry of Power designated SJVN as the nodal agency for developing Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) in Bihar.

India's GDP growth slowed to 5.4% in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, marking an 18-month low. This was primarily due to weak consumption.",https://www.indiatoday.in/budget/story/budget-2025-expectations-nirmala-sitharaman-focus-on-boosting-consumption-slow-growth-high-inflation-2658158-2025-01-01,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman faces a challenging economic backdrop as she prepares to present Budget 2025-26 on February 1. With inflation driven by high food prices and a slowdown in economic growth, the government is under pressure to revive private consumption, which is critical for sustaining economic momentum. India’s GDP growth slowed to 5.4% in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, marking an 18-month low. This was primarily due to weak consumption. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also lowered its real GDP growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.6%, citing global uncertainties, volatile commodity prices, and fragmented economic conditions. Experts, including Deloitte, have highlighted the need for measures in the upcoming Budget to address these challenges. Boosting private consumption, particularly among the middle class, is seen as essential to prevent further delays in the recovery of the private investment cycle.MIDDLE-CLASS RELIEF & CONSUMPTION REVIVAL Anand Ramanathan, Partner and Leader for the Consumer Products and Retail sector at Deloitte India, said that India’s GDP growth is likely to moderate to 6.3% in FY25 due to fiscal consolidation and tighter global credit conditions. While core inflation stands at a manageable 4.8%, food inflation remains a concern at 5.1%. “The country’s current account deficit is projected at 1.9 per cent of GDP, supported by a 13 per cent rise in services exports, mainly IT services, which contribute $325 billion annually. This economic backdrop underscores the need for prudent fiscal policies that prioritise consumption revival, infrastructure development and innovation-driven growth,"" said Ramanathan.DELOITTE'S KEY EXPECTATION FROM BUDGET 2025 Deloitte has outlined three main expectations for Budget 2025 that could help boost private consumption and address economic concerns: Higher income tax exemptions - Deloitte suggests raising the basic income tax exemption limit under the old tax regime from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh. Additionally, it recommends increasing the standard deduction under the new regime from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. The consultancy firm estimates that this could increase disposable income for middle-income households by 5-7%, leading to a 6% rise in consumer spending on essential goods and a 0.7% boost to GDP. Lower GST rates on mass-consumption FMCG products - Deloitte recommends reducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on mass-consumption FMCG products, such as personal care items and packaged foods, from 18% to 12%. This move could result in an 8% increase in volume sales of these products, leading to higher tax collections and a 0.5% GDP growth. It would also make essential goods more affordable and support small-scale FMCG manufacturers. Targeted tax incentives for rural markets and innovation - To enhance rural demand, Deloitte proposes a Rs 10,000 crore FMCG Rural Growth Fund to improve distribution networks and offer tax rebates for affordable rural product lines. The firm also suggests a 150% weighted tax deduction on research and development (R&D) expenses for FMCG companies focusing on sustainable packaging and health-related products. Deloitte estimates that a 10% growth in rural FMCG sales could add Rs 50,000 crore in annual revenue for the industry.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Must Watch

Check details NPCI's decision allows WhatsApp Pay to serve over 500 million WhatsApp users in the country, a huge leap from earlier restrictions.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/whatsapp-pays-upi-services-to-cover-all-indian-users-check-details-npci-lifts-cap-2658208-2025-01-01,"WhatsApp Pay, the payment feature of the popular messaging platform, has been given the green light to extend its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) services to all its users in India. This major development comes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has lifted the cap on user onboarding for WhatsApp Pay. In a press release, NPCI announced, ""National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has removed the UPI user onboarding limit for WhatsApp Pay (Third Party App Provider), with immediate effect. With this development, WhatsApp Pay can now extend UPI services to its entire user base in India."" This decision allows WhatsApp Pay to serve over 500 million WhatsApp users in the country, a huge leap from earlier restrictions.  When WhatsApp Pay was introduced, NPCI imposed strict limits on the number of users it could onboard. This cautious approach was designed to ensure the payment service could handle the large-scale demands of India's digital payments ecosystem while maintaining security and performance standards. Initially, WhatsApp Pay was allowed to onboard only a small percentage of UPI users. The cap was gradually raised as NPCI monitored its performance and ensured compliance with the UPI framework. In November 2022, NPCI increased the cap for WhatsApp Pay to 100 million users. This phased rollout allowed WhatsApp Pay to fine-tune its operations and address any scalability or security concerns before reaching a wider audience. The decision to lift the cap comes after NPCI assessed that WhatsApp Pay has met all necessary operational, security, and compliance standards required for UPI payment services. By removing the limit, NPCI aims to enable broader access to digital payment platforms, which aligns with India’s push for a cashless economy. With this update, WhatsApp Pay will still need to comply with all existing UPI guidelines applicable to third-party app providers (TPAPs). This move is expected to reshape India’s UPI ecosystem. WhatsApp, with over 500 million users in the country, can now actively promote its payment feature to a much larger audience. This could challenge existing UPI leaders like PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm, which currently dominate the market. The decision to remove the onboarding limit coincides with NPCI's extension of the market cap deadline for UPI service providers. According to the earlier NPCI rule issued in 2021, no single UPI app was allowed to handle more than 30% of the total UPI transactions. However, NPCI has now extended the compliance deadline for this rule by two years, until 31 December 2026. This gives existing players like PhonePe and Google Pay, which currently exceed the 30% cap, more time to align with the guidelines.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 1, 2025

The latest numbers indicate a steady growth in GST revenues but reflect a slowdown in consumption and a rise in refunds issued during the month.

Central GST (CGST): Rs 32,836 crore

 GST revenues from domestic transactions, including the collection from services and goods sold within the country, grew 8.4% YoY to Rs 1.32 lakh crore. Meanwhile, tax revenues from imports increased by 4% YoY to Rs 44,268 crore. Refunds issued during December surged 31% compared to the same month last year, amounting to Rs 22,490 crore. After adjusting for these refunds, the net GST collection stood at Rs 1.54 lakh crore, up 3.3% YoY.COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS MONTHS November 2024: GST collections stood at Rs 1.82 lakh crore, reflecting an 8.5% YoY growth. October 2024: The mop-up reached Rs 1.87 lakh crore, marking a 9% YoY increase and the second-highest collection on record. April 2024: The highest-ever monthly GST collection was recorded at Rs 2.10 lakh crore. The steady increase in GST revenues over the year highlights improvements in compliance and economic activity. However, the drop in December’s month-on-month collection compared to November may reflect seasonal factors such as lower post-festive consumption.

Announced late on December 31, 2024, via the ITR e-filing portal, the department confirmed that eligible taxpayers would soon be able to file revised or belated ITRs through the ITR filing utility or online on the e-filing portal. This development follows an interim directive by the Bombay High Court, which extended the deadline for filing revised and belated ITRs for resident individuals to January 15, 2025. Backend updates to the online ITR forms are underway to facilitate these changes. Under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, eligible taxpayers can claim rebates of up to Rs 12,500 under the old tax regime and Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime.KEY UPDATE FOR ELIGIBLE TAXPAYERS On December 31, 2024, the department confirmed that it will soon enable the filing of revised or belated ITRs for eligible taxpayers on the e-filing ITR portal for Forms ITR-2 and ITR-3. These forms allow individuals to declare incomes such as Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG), which were earlier excluded from claiming the 87A rebate. This update addresses a significant issue where taxpayers filing ITRs after July 5, 2024, were barred from claiming the rebate due to changes in the e-filing utility. Many of these taxpayers subsequently received notices, sparking widespread concern amongst professionals and individuals alike.BOMBAY HIGH COURT'S INTERVENTION The Bombay High Court, in an interim order dated December 20, 2024, emphasised that taxpayers eligible for the rebate should not face procedural hurdles. The court directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to extend the deadline for filing revised or belated ITRs, ensuring compliance with statutory rights. While the final judgment is awaited on January 9, 2025, tax professionals have lauded this move as a significant step toward aligning procedural efficiency with legislative intent. This decision not only safeguards taxpayers' rights but also highlights the importance of timely updates to tax systems. As the revised utilities roll out, taxpayers are advised to file accurately within the extended deadline to avoid complications.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Trending Reel

The sharp drop comes after the company disclosed a significant capital reduction proposal involving Urban Infrastructure Holdings Private Limited (UIHPL), in which it holds a 32% equity stake. Jai Corp informed stock exchanges that UIHPL plans to convene an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to seek shareholder approval for the proposed capital reduction. The move is also subject to clearance from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and other regulatory bodies. Upon approval, Jai Corp is set to receive approximately Rs 364 crore from the reduction process. The announcement follows recent developments involving Dronagiri Infrastructure Private Limited (DIPL), a subsidiary of UIHPL. DIPL sold a 74% equity stake in Navi Mumbai IIA Private Limited for Rs 1,628.03 crore, with CIDCO retaining the remaining 26%. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) acquired this stake, finalizing the deal after CIDCO waived its rights of first refusal earlier in December. As part of the capital reduction process, UIHPL will receive a minimum of Rs 1,492.50 crore from DIPL, which may increase depending on interest earnings from surplus funds. Additionally, UIHPL expects Rs 682 crore from redeeming optionally fully convertible debentures in Vinamra Universal Traders Private Limited, bringing the total funds to a minimum of Rs 3,772 crore. UIHPL plans to reduce 99.76% of its share capital, including equity shares and fully compulsorily convertible preference shares, paying an aggregate of Rs 3,746.87 crore to its shareholders on a proportionate basis.

ef504571-029d-4a39-a711-9bb7d5d12c1d,Vodafone Idea likely to launch 5G broadband services in March: ReportVodafone Idea plans to introduce 5G with competitively priced plans that could be up to 15% cheaper at entry levels. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/vodafone-idea-5g-launch-in-march-report-pricing-war-ahead-reliance-jio-airtel-vi-share-price-stmp-2658560-2025-01-02,"Vodafone Idea is planning to launch its 5G mobile broadband services in March, reported The Economic Times. The company aims to make a mark in a market already dominated by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. The company plans to introduce 5G with competitively priced plans that could be up to 15% cheaper at entry levels, added the report. The move is expected to spark a pricing war among telecom operators. Vodafone Idea is likely to focus on India’s top 75 cities and 17 priority circles for the initial rollout. Industrial hubs, known for heavy data usage, are also on the radar. The telco’s strategy is aimed at winning back customers who have migrated to its competitors, which already have extensive 5G networks. “We are gearing up to launch 5G services and are committed to providing the best experience and price,” a Vodafone Idea spokesperson told the publication. The company added that it has sufficient and competitive 5G spectrum in its 17 key markets, which will help improve its 4G coverage and enable a swift 5G rollout. The anticipation of 5G launch helped Vodafone Idea’s shares gain marginally, which were trading at Rs 8.03, up 0.12%, at the time of writing.  Global brokerage Citi recently upgraded Vodafone Idea’s stock to a ‘buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 13, suggesting a potential upside of 64% from the current levels. The upgrade follows a critical bank guarantee waiver by the Department of Telecommunications, providing some relief to the debt-laden telecom operator. Vodafone Idea’s CEO Akshaya Moondra has hinted at keeping 5G base pricing lower than its competitors. During the company’s earnings call for the first quarter of FY25, he mentioned that a final decision on pricing would be made closer to the launch. This approach contrasts with the strategies of Jio and Airtel, which have increased the minimum threshold for 5G services by requiring users to upgrade to higher-value plans. To attract high-value 5G prepaid users, Vodafone Idea may also increase dealer commissions and promotional spending. As per Jefferies, the company spent Rs 3,583 crore (8.4% of sales) on dealer commissions in FY24, higher than Jio’s Rs 3,000 crore (3% of sales). Airtel was the largest spender, with Rs 6,000 crore (4% of sales) allocated for the same purpose.FUNDING AND ROLLOUT PLANS Backed by Rs 24,000 crore in equity funding, Vodafone Idea is expected to raise an additional Rs 25,000 crore in debt. The financial support comes after recent government relief measures, including waivers on bank guarantee requirements. The company has also finalised Rs 30,000 crore worth of contracts with global network vendors such as Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung to support its 4G expansion and 5G rollout. It plans to deploy around 75,000 5G base stations over three years, with several thousand new sites to be added by March 2025. “We’re excited to supercharge our network and add several thousand new sites by March 2025 for enhanced connectivity and roll out 5G to revolutionise the digital experience for Vi users,” said a Vodafone Idea spokesperson.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

For taxpayers looking to maximise their savings, now is the crucial time to make investments that will help claim tax exemptions for the fiscal year. However, the key to claiming these exemptions lies in making the investments before the financial year ends.advertisementKEY INVESTMENT OPTIONS FOR TAX EXEMPTION IN FY 2024-25To claim tax exemptions for FY 2024-25, the investments must be made in this current financial year, which concludes on March 31, 2025. When filing your income tax return (ITR) before July 31, 2025, you can benefit from various tax-saving options. To claim tax exemptions for FY 2024-25, the investments must be made in this current financial year, which concludes on March 31, 2025. When filing your income tax return (ITR) before July 31, 2025, you can benefit from various tax-saving options. Below are some of the most popular tax-saving instruments to consider: Section 80C (Max Rs 1.5 lakh): You can invest in instruments like the National Savings Certificate (NSC), Public Provident Fund (PPF), and Unit-linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) to claim a deduction under Section 80C. Section 80CCC (Max Rs 1.5 lakh): Contributions to life insurance-based pension plans also qualify for tax deductions under this section. Section 80CCD(1) (Max Rs 1.5 lakh): Taxpayers can invest in the National Pension Scheme (NPS) to claim deductions under Section 80CCD(1). Section 80D (Max Rs 25,000 for regular citizens, Rs 50,000 for senior citizens): Premiums paid for medical insurance for yourself, your spouse, parents, or children are eligible for tax deductions under Section 80D. Section 80CCD(1B) (Max Rs 50,000): For NPS contributors, this section allows an additional deduction on top of the one available under Section 80CCD(1).DON’T MISS OUT ON POTENTIAL SAVINGS While the new tax regime offers fewer exemptions, certain contributions, like those to the Agniveer Corpus Fund (Section 80CCH), are still eligible for deduction. However, most exemptions apply to the old tax regime, so if you're aiming to claim them, you must opt for the old system. As the end of the financial year approaches, now is the time to act. Make the right investments, maximise your tax deductions, and prepare for a smooth filing of your ITR before the July 31 deadline.

Thanks to the introduction of the Centralized Pension Payment System (CPPS), pensioners will now be able to collect their pension from any bank branch across India, even if they move to a different city or town. This change aims to provide greater flexibility and ease for retirees, making the process much more convenient.advertisementA REVOLUTIONARY SHIFTThe CPPS is part of the Employee Provident Fund Organization’s (EPFO) modernisation program and will be available under the Centralized IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01). The CPPS is part of the Employee Provident Fund Organization’s (EPFO) modernisation program and will be available under the Centralized IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01). It represents a national-level solution that leverages advanced IT and financial technology to make pension payments faster and more accessible to pensioners across India. The system allows pensioners to access their benefits without the need to transfer their Pension Payment Order (PPO) when relocating or changing banks. This is a significant step forward in modernising the pension disbursement process and will benefit over 78 lakh EPS pensioners. Union Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya praised the initiative, describing it as an important step in updating the EPFO. He stated that the new system would solve long-standing issues faced by pensioners and improve the overall efficiency of the EPFO.A FUTURE OF SEAMLESS PAYMENTS For pensioners, especially those who return to their hometowns post-retirement, this new system offers immense relief. They will no longer have to go through the hassle of transferring their PPOs or wait for pension delivery from a particular bank. In the future, the transition will move towards an Aadhaar-based Payment System (ABPS), further streamlining the process. As the CPPS rolls out, EPS pensioners can look forward to a more seamless and hassle-free experience, marking the beginning of a new chapter in pension disbursement across India.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 2, 2025

This decision means investors can continue to benefit from the current rates through the end of March 2025.advertisementCURRENT INTEREST RATES FOR POST OFFICE SCHEMESThe interest rates for the final quarter of FY 2024-25 have been confirmed as unchanged from the previous quarter, providing consistency for investors. The current rates for some popular small savings schemes are as follows: The interest rates for the final quarter of FY 2024-25 have been confirmed as unchanged from the previous quarter, providing consistency for investors.

The Sensex climbed 1.8% to end at 79,943.71, while the Nifty gained 1.9% to close at 24,188.65. Auto stocks led the rally following upbeat December sales data, with leading players like Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra reporting strong demand for SUVs and year-end discounts. IT stocks also advanced on optimistic brokerage views ahead of Q3 earnings. Satish Chandra Aluri of Lemonn Markets said, “Markets extended gains on improving risk appetite fuelled by Auto, IT, and Financials. Auto shares rallied after sales data allayed concerns over weakening demand, while IT benefited from positive revenue recovery expectations. Likely bargain hunting in quality stocks and anticipation of growth-oriented measures in the upcoming budget also boosted sentiment.” Financials contributed significantly, supported by strong deposit growth updates from banks. Santosh Meena of Swastika Investmart noted, “The market had been oversold for days, but auto sales beating expectations provided a much-needed trigger. Nifty not only crossed the 200-DMA but also surpassed the 50-DMA and 20-DMA, indicating a potential bullish reversal.” The broader market saw mixed action, with mid- and small-cap stocks underperforming the frontline indices. “Despite the strong movement in the Index, mid-caps and small-caps rose by only 1%. However, this could be an ideal time to accumulate value stocks with strong order books,” said VLA Ambala of Stock Market Today. On the technical front, analysts remain optimistic but cautious about a pullback. Aditya Gaggar of Progressive Shares commented, “The bulls dominated, helping Nifty break multiple resistance levels. While a pullback to test support at 24,000 is possible, the next leg of the rally could target 24,700-24,800.” As the markets gear up for Q3 earnings and the Union Budget, experts believe strong earnings delivery will be crucial for sustaining the rally.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

SHORT-TERM CHALLENGES FOR INDIASpeaking on the potential immediate challenges, Neelkanth Mishra outlined three critical fronts where Trump’s policies could impact India:Immigration policies: Mishra highlighted that Trump’s strong stance on immigration, particularly on H-1B visas, could disrupt the Indian IT sector, which heavily relies on these work permits to send professionals to the US.“We're already seeing that there is a lot of debate within the Republican establishment on what they mean by controlling immigration. Is it legal? Is it illegal? With H-1Bs, is it something bigger,” Mishra said. Trade tariffs: On the trade front, Trump’s threat of imposing reciprocal tariffs could significantly hit India’s exports. “The second front is, of course, trade, where he has threatened tariffs on everyone, including India, on the reciprocal tariffs. If that was to happen, it'd have a direct seven to eight billion dollar impact on our exports,” Mishra added.However, he suggested that these threats might serve as a starting point for negotiations rather than immediate actions.FII outflow: Mishra expressed concerns about the ripple effects of Trump’s likely extension of the 2017 tax cuts, which could worsen the US fiscal deficit and raise bond yields.""We've already seen the 10-year bond yields in the US starting to spike. And what that means is that the cost of capital for the rest of the world goes up,"" said the Chief Economist at Axis Bank. advertisementHe further added that emerging market equity investors are deserting India, which is a major concern. ""They're deserting all of emerging markets. In fact, the knee jerk reaction, the Pavlovian instinct for any emerging market investor and for right and understandable reasons is that when you're getting 5% yield on US government bonds, then why would you want to hold China, Brazil and India or other emerging market currencies,"" he said. Rupee at risk: Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist at Axis Bank also explained how the imposition of tariff could lead to unstable rupee and a currency war. “This would push up the global cost of capital, making borrowing more expensive for emerging markets like India,” he explained.

He said that as foreign equity investors retreat, India’s current account deficit will come under pressure, forcing the RBI to intervene more aggressively to stabilise the rupee.”These developments could also trigger a currency war, especially if China devalues the Chinese yuan (CNY) or renminbi (RMB) in response to US tariffs.advertisementA significant depreciation of the Chinese RMB could force the RBI to make tough decisions about the rupee, Mishra warned.MACROECONOMIC VOLATILITY LOOMSRathin Roy echoed Mishra’s concerns, adding that India’s limited role in global exports means that domestic fiscal policies will have a larger impact on the economy than Trump’s tariffs.“India accounts for just 2% of global exports,” Roy explained. “The government’s undershooting of its fiscal plans could pose a far greater risk to the economy than US tariffs.”Roy also highlighted the importance of a calibrated monetary and exchange rate policy. “There’s a fear that the RBI is following a nationalist policy of keeping the rupee artificially strong,” he said. “In these volatile conditions, a well-communicated approach to rupee depreciation could help mitigate investor concerns.”He criticised the lack of clarity in India’s monetary policies and called for better coordination between the RBI and the finance ministry to navigate the expected turbulence.“With the RBI, there is a clear and pleasant lack of clarity on the logic underlying its monetary policy and exchange rate actions.  And the more clarity we get in and the more forward guidance we give on how we are going to implement a policy that we publicly state, I think the more secure we will be in the next year,” Roy advised.advertisementThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the status quo on key interest rates and kept repo rates unchanged for the 11th consecutive time as the central bank’s focus remained on containing inflation.

In a post on X, Pai urged the government to prioritise middle-class taxpayers who are grappling with rising costs, inflation, and stagnant incomes. His wishlist for the upcoming Budget aims to ease financial burdens and stimulate economic activity.
 



 


advertisementPROPOSED TAX REFORMS Pai highlighted the sharp increase in individual tax collections, which rose from Rs 4.87 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs 10.45 lakh crore in FY24—a 114% jump in three years. He proposed new tax slabs with no tax for income up to Rs 5 lakh, 10% for Rs 5-10 lakh, 20% for Rs 10-20 lakh, and 30% for income above Rs 20 lakh. Pai highlighted the sharp increase in individual tax collections, which rose from Rs 4.87 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs 10.45 lakh crore in FY24—a 114% jump in three years. He proposed new tax slabs with no tax for income up to Rs 5 lakh, 10% for Rs 5-10 lakh, 20% for Rs 10-20 lakh, and 30% for income above Rs 20 lakh. He suggested removing most deductions, except under Sections 80D (health insurance) and 80G (charitable donations), and introducing these slabs as an optional scheme to replace the current complex structure. For senior citizens, Pai recommended taxing income above Rs 7.5 lakh for those over 60 and Rs 10 lakh for those over 70. He also advocated exempting individuals earning up to Rs 5 lakh from filing income tax returns unless they are claiming refunds.ADDRESSING TAX DISPUTES AND HOUSING LOAN CONCERNS Pai raised concerns over rising tax disputes, with pending amounts exceeding Rs 12.5 lakh crore. He urged the government to declare 2025-26 as the ‘Year of Tax Dispute Resolution’ and streamline processes within the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Additionally, he emphasised the need for housing loan reforms, as only 1.2 crore taxpayers benefit from deductions due to limited home loan uptake.RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS Calling for an end to ‘tax terrorism', Pai criticised the lack of relief for middle-class taxpayers, who shoulder the bulk of the tax burden. He highlighted that while over Rs 9 lakh crore in subsidies support the bottom 60% of the population, the middle class is often overlooked. Pai’s recommendations reflect the growing frustrations of India’s middle class, urging the government to deliver meaningful reforms. With economic pressures mounting, these measures could offer much-needed relief and restore confidence amongst taxpayers.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

Industry bodies, including the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), have shared their recommendations with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, advocating tax reforms to boost the ease of doing business and reduce complexity. Amongst the key proposals is streamlining the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) regimes to provide relief to businesses and taxpayers alike.advertisementSIMPLIFYING TDS-TCS RATESFICCI has proposed reducing the numerous TDS/TCS rates to a simplified two- or three-tier system, a move expected to minimise confusion and disputes over tax classifications. FICCI has proposed reducing the numerous TDS/TCS rates to a simplified two- or three-tier system, a move expected to minimise confusion and disputes over tax classifications. This would also improve compliance and reduce administrative burdens. A Deloitte survey found strong support amongst taxpayers for simpler Individual Tax Returns (ITRs), straightforward incentive calculations, and a unified TDS framework based on a ""one rate, one section"" principle. Additionally, the Income-Tax Policy Survey suggested eliminating Form 16A, as TDS details are already available in recipients' Form 26AS and Annual Information Statements (AIS). Such measures could significantly ease compliance and streamline processes for businesses and individuals.TDS-TCS REFORMS SO FAR In Budget 2024, some steps were taken toward simplifying the tax structure. The TDS rate on rents exceeding Rs 50,000 was reduced from 5% to 2%, and buyers of properties above Rs 50 lakh were required to deduct TDS only on the amount exceeding the threshold, regardless of the number of sellers involved. Recent changes also allow parents to claim TCS collected from a minor child’s income, making the process more family-friendly. From October 2024, employers will be required to factor in TDS/TCS deducted on non-salary income when calculating tax deductions on salaries, reducing double taxation. Updates to the TDS software, implemented in December 2024, now ensure accurate TDS calculations for Q4 of FY 2024-25.A STEP TOWARD TAXPAYER CONFIDENCE With the 2025 Budget on the horizon, stakeholders hope for bolder reforms to simplify the tax regime further. Streamlining TDS-TCS processes could enhance compliance, ease financial stress, and boost confidence amongst taxpayers, paving the way for a fairer and more efficient system.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch

A recent report highlighted that the Gujarat State GST department has intensified its focus on business-to-consumer (B2C) sectors, aiming to close tax compliance gaps. Industries such as ice-cream parlours, salons, coaching classes, and mobile phone dealers are under the scanner for potential tax evasion and non-compliance. Recent raids across Gujarat exposed tax evasion worth Rs 20 crore, reported The Times of India. Officials revealed that while many registered traders underreport income, a large number of unregistered businesses exceed the GST registration threshold without complying. This raises an important question: can unregistered small businesses receive GST notices? Under the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017, GST authorities are empowered to scrutinise, audit, and assess businesses regardless of their registration status. Supreme Kothari, Partner at Economic Laws Practice, states: “GST laws allow authorities to issue notices to unregistered businesses whose turnover exceeds the prescribed threshold. Sections 65 and 67 enable audits, inspections, and searches.” The annual turnover threshold for GST registration is Rs 40 lakh for businesses supplying goods and Rs 20 lakh for service providers. Businesses below these limits are exempt, but exceeding them triggers registration and compliance requirements. The department employs several methods to monitor unregistered dealers, including analyzing e-way bills, tracking transactions in personal accounts, and identifying income discrepancies. SR Patnaik, Partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, explains: “While issuing notices to small businesses is legally valid, enforcement may depend on socio-economic and political factors.” GST compliance can be challenging for small businesses that lack organized operations. Record-keeping, filing returns, and hiring professionals can be resource-intensive. However, registered businesses gain access to input tax credits, reducing overall costs over time. Umesh Goel, Partner at Ved Jain & Associates, suggests: “Small businesses can leverage schemes like the composition scheme, which simplifies compliance processes.” Experts recommend that small businesses monitor their turnover, maintain accurate records, and register promptly once thresholds are crossed. Proactive compliance is essential, as the GST department can cross-reference bank transactions and other data sources to detect non-compliance. As the tax net expands, awareness and adherence to GST regulations are critical for small businesses. With proper guidance and compliance, businesses can benefit from a structured tax framework while avoiding penalties and scrutiny.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

As markets open today, several companies such as Zee, DMart, IRFC, ITC, Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp are expected to grab attention due to key updates. Zee Entertainment Enterprises is under focus after Sebi dismissed settlement applications filed by the company and its Managing Director, Punit Goenka.

Domestic sales were down 22% year-on-year, which could weigh on the stock.

This medication is used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients, and this development is expected to enhance Biocon’s global footprint.

Discussions regarding his exit have reportedly taken place with investors amid the company’s ongoing financial struggles. The Bengaluru-based quick commerce platform has faced a challenging period over the last 12–18 months, marked by cash flow issues and difficulties in raising fresh funds. These challenges come as rivals like Zomato’s Blinkit, Swiggy’s Instamart, and Zepto continue to grow rapidly, and the entry of e-commerce giants such as Flipkart, Amazon, further intensifying competition in the quick commerce sector.  According to sources cited in the report, Biswas has expressed interest in moving on from Dunzo, though a consensus among stakeholders is yet to be reached. Some investors are reportedly open to the idea, considering the company’s current state. “There have been talks from him (Kabeer) about moving on from Dunzo, and a consensus needs to be reached. Some investors have not opposed the idea given the state of affairs at the firm,” said a person familiar with the matter. “There have been talks from him (Kabeer) about moving on from Dunzo, and a consensus needs to be reached. Some investors have not opposed the idea given the state of affairs at the firm” one person familiar with the matter said as quoted in the report. Another source mentioned in the report said that discussions around what happens to Biswas’s remaining stake in the company are ongoing. However, Reliance Retail, which holds a 25.8% stake in Dunzo, has not yet approved the proposal but continues to engage in discussions. Dunzo, once a pioneer in hyperlocal deliveries, has raised over $450 million in funding, including debt. Its most significant investment came from Reliance Retail in January 2022, when the conglomerate invested Rs 200 crore as part of a Rs 240 crore funding round. At the time, Reliance’s backing was seen as a strong endorsement of both Dunzo and the quick commerce sector. Google, another key investor, owns just under 20% of the company. Despite these investments, Dunzo has faced a severe cash crunch since 2023. The company has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs and salary delays as it scaled back operations significantly. While Dunzo managed to secure debt financing to keep its daily operations afloat, creditors have since taken the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) over unpaid dues. “They are facilitating some courier delivery services, but nothing much is left there anymore,” said one of the sources cited in the report. The situation has also prompted former Dunzo executives to explore new ventures in the quick commerce space, as the company’s dominance in the sector diminishes. The future of Biswas’s role at Dunzo, along with the direction the company will take, is now largely dependent on Reliance Retail’s decision. While neither Reliance Retail nor Biswas has confirmed the developments, the report suggests that some shareholders, who have already written off their investments in Dunzo, are willing to allow Biswas to move on.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 3, 2025

Morgan Stanley retained its bearish view, pointing out that the growth rate is below DMart’s historical 20% top-line growth. However, the brokerage acknowledged that standalone Q3 revenue was 1% higher than its expectations. The growth was attributed to a 12% increase in store count, while the implied same-store sales growth (SSSG) was around 5.5%, exceeding its estimate of 4%. Morgan Stanley reiterated a target price of Rs 3,702 per share, indicating a modest upside of 4%. Macquarie echoed concerns about competitive pressures from the quick commerce sector, which it believes are weighing on DMart’s growth. The brokerage also noted that Q3 typically sees an improvement in gross margins due to a better product mix. While DMart’s addition of 10 stores during the quarter was in line with estimates, Macquarie continues to adopt a cautious stance. On the other hand, Hong Kong-based CLSA remains optimistic about Avenue Supermarts’ performance. The brokerage has maintained its “outperform” rating, with a target price of Rs 5,360 per share, suggesting a 50% upside. CLSA highlighted that DMart’s standalone revenue exceeded its expectations and reiterated confidence in the company’s strategy of focusing on private labels. These in-house brands are seen as a key factor in countering competition and boosting profitability. In Q2FY25, Avenue Supermarts reported a net profit of Rs 659.6 crore, a 5.8% increase compared to Rs 623.6 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter rose 14.4% year-on-year to Rs 14,444.5 crore, up from Rs 12,624.4 crore.

While much attention is often directed towards the salaried class, senior citizens face unique financial challenges that demand attention. With rising medical expenses and inflation eating into their savings, targeted tax benefits and simplified processes could significantly ease their burden. Here are five potential measures that could make a meaningful difference for senior citizens.advertisementEASIER TAX FILING PROCESSES Senior citizens aged 75 and above currently enjoy exemptions from filing income-tax returns if their income comes solely from pensions and interest from specific banks. Lowering the age threshold for this exemption and introducing simplified tax return forms for those with diverse income sources would reduce compliance complexities.INCREASED TAX EXEMPTION LIMITS The basic exemption limit for senior citizens has remained unchanged for some time. Increasing these limits under the newer tax regime could provide significant relief and encourage more seniors to adopt the simplified tax framework, ensuring better financial security.ADJUSTED TDS THRESHOLDS Banks and financial institutions deduct tax at source on interest income above a certain limit. Aligning this threshold with basic exemption limits would help reduce unnecessary deductions and the need for filing refunds, easing the financial strain on seniors.ENHANCED SAVINGS SCHEME BENEFITS Interest earned from senior citizens’ savings schemes and post-office savings accounts forms a critical part of their income. Increasing tax exemptions on these sources would directly alleviate financial stress, providing much-needed relief to this demographic.BETTER DEDUCTIONS FOR MEDICAL COSTS Healthcare expenses form a significant portion of senior citizens’ spending. By enhancing deductions for health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses, the Budget could address this concern, ensuring seniors have access to necessary medical care without undue financial strain. The Union Budget 2025 offers a crucial opportunity to address senior citizens’ financial needs. By introducing higher exemptions, streamlined compliance processes, and targeted tax benefits, the government can provide much-needed relief to ensure a secure and dignified life for India’s elderly population.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Trending Reel

The stock, which plunged 20% in the previous session, fell another 16% to touch an intraday low of Rs 207.60 before recovering slightly to trade 8% lower at Rs 228.10 around 12 pm. The steep decline in Jai Corp’s share price over two sessions stems from a significant capital reduction proposal involving Urban Infrastructure Holdings Private Limited (UIHPL), where Jai Corp holds a 32% equity stake. On Thursday, the company informed stock exchanges that UIHPL plans to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to seek shareholder approval for the proposed capital reduction. The move is subject to clearance from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and other regulatory bodies. Once approved, Jai Corp is expected to receive approximately Rs 364 crore from the process. The announcement follows a recent transaction involving Dronagiri Infrastructure Private Limited (DIPL), a subsidiary of UIHPL. DIPL sold a 74% equity stake in Navi Mumbai IIA Private Limited to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) for Rs 1,628.03 crore, with the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) retaining a 26% stake. This deal materialised after CIDCO waived its rights of first refusal earlier in December. As part of the capital reduction process, UIHPL is set to receive at least Rs 1,492.50 crore from DIPL, a figure that may increase with interest earnings on surplus funds. Additionally, UIHPL anticipates Rs 682 crore from redeeming optionally fully convertible debentures in Vinamra Universal Traders Private Limited, bringing the total funds to a minimum of Rs 3,772 crore. UIHPL plans to reduce 99.76% of its share capital, comprising equity and fully compulsorily convertible preference shares, distributing Rs 3,746.87 crore proportionately among its shareholders. This restructuring has raised investor concerns, leading to heightened selling pressure on Jai Corp shares, which have plunged nearly 27% in just three trading sessions.

Filing income tax returns, regardless of liability, helps create a documented financial history. This record becomes invaluable when applying for loans or credit products in the future.SET CLEAR INVESTMENT GOALS Every investment should have a defined objective. Whether it’s buying a car, saving for a home, or building a retirement corpus, align your investments with your targets. Opt for instruments that offer both tax benefits and potential returns to maximise value.STAY PROACTIVE IN TAX PLANNING Avoid the last-minute scramble by starting your tax planning early in the financial year. This approach gives you ample time to explore suitable options and make informed decisions. Timely filing of income tax returns is equally important to avoid penalties and ensure compliance. Tax-saving is more than a compliance exercise; it’s an opportunity to secure your financial future.

Here are three key factors contributing to today’s decline:IT AND FINANCIAL STOCKS DIP After rallying strongly in the previous session, IT and financial stocks faced significant profit booking in early trade on Friday. Market experts attributed the dip to investor caution ahead of the corporate earnings season, which typically brings heightened market fluctuations. The Nifty IT index plunged nearly 2%, making it the biggest loser among sectoral indices. Similarly, the Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services indices fell by almost 1% each, dragging down the broader market. This retreat followed a robust performance in the previous session, where the Nifty IT and Nifty Financial indices rose by 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Aditya Gaggar, Director at Progressive Shares, had forecasted a pullback in IT stocks and the benchmarks following the sharp rally, cautioning investors against over-optimism.DECLINE IN HDFC BANK, ICICI BANK AND TCS  Declines in heavyweight stocks exacerbated the fall in major indices. Shares of HDFC Bank, Infosys, TCS, and ICICI Bank all fell by over 1% during the session. Other notable losers included Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp, and Cipla. These large-cap stocks, which hold significant weight in the indices, were critical in dragging down the market, indicating a broader sell-off among blue-chip companies.Q3 EARNINGS ANXIETY Growing concerns over the upcoming Q3 corporate earnings season further dampened investor sentiment. Following a weak performance in the second quarter, analysts had highlighted that the Q3 results could set the tone for the market in the coming months. Although there is optimism that the Q3 earnings may show improvement, concerns persist that an earnings slowdown could extend for another couple of quarters. Analysts also pointed out that the trajectory of the stock market will likely hinge on announcements in the Union Budget 2025. A potential increase in government capital expenditure could drive new orders for companies, bolstering their earnings and improving stock performance over time. Today’s market decline underscores the heightened uncertainty and cautious sentiment among investors. As the corporate earnings season approaches and the Union Budget draws nearer, market participants will be closely watching for signs of stability and growth. For now, volatility continues to dominate the Indian stock market.

Tata Motors market capitalisation stood at Rs 2,93,201.60 crore. Despite today’s rise, the stock is below its 52-week high of Rs 1,179.05, recorded on July 30, 2024. Over the past five trading sessions, Tata Motors has gained more than 6%. However, the stock has seen a decline of 18.36% in the last six months. In the long term, Tata Motors has delivered an impressive return of 316.91% over the last five years.  The rise in Tata Motors’ share price on Friday marked its fourth consecutive session of gains. This momentum was partly influenced by global brokerage firm CLSA, which added Tata Motors to its India focus portfolio. CLSA noted that the stock’s 35% drop from its peak has already factored in potential risks, including a slowdown in the commercial vehicle segment and challenges in its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) portfolio.BROKERAGE VIEWS Several brokerages have shared their views on Tata Motors, reflecting a mix of optimism and cautiousness. Nomura India: The brokerage has set a target price of Rs 990, suggesting a positive outlook for the stock. DAM Capital: It maintains a ‘buy’ call with a target price of Rs 870. The firm expects JLR’s volumes to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% between FY2025 and FY2027. However, DAM Capital’s bear case scenario targets a lower price of Rs 675, indicating a potential correction of 9% from Thursday’s closing price. Sharekhan: The firm has a bullish price target of Rs 1,099, citing expectations of continued improvement in JLR, passenger vehicle (PV), and commercial vehicle (CV) businesses, along with reduced automotive debt. Sharekhan noted that the stock trades at a P/E multiple of 12.2x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.3x for its FY2027 estimates. LKP Securities: The brokerage considers Tata Motors a ‘value buy’ at current levels. It has a price target of Rs 970, citing recovery in domestic CV demand and the impact of recent product launches. LKP also highlighted the stock’s correction of approximately 40% from its 52-week high, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

With a slowing GDP and rising inflation, all eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to deliver bold strategies that will address these challenges and steer the country towards sustainable growth. The upcoming Budget is crucial, not just for long-term economic development, but for immediate relief to struggling sectors. Here's a look at the five key expectations from Budget 2025.advertisementTAX RELIEF FOR INDIVIDUALS A significant expectation is income tax relief to boost disposable income. Proposals include raising the exemption limit for individuals, which would encourage higher consumption and stimulate economic activity. Such a measure could provide immediate relief to the middle class, particularly as inflation and living costs continue to rise.REDUCTION IN EXCISE DUTY ON FUEL Despite global crude prices dropping, fuel prices have not decreased due to high excise duties. Industry experts believe that lowering these duties could alleviate inflationary pressures, increase disposable income, and improve consumption, particularly in lower-income households. This could significantly reduce the financial burden on the public.SUPPORT FOR EMPLOYMENT-INTENSIVE SECTORS To address unemployment, there’s a push to focus on employment-heavy industries such as garments, footwear, tourism, and MSMEs. By stimulating growth in these sectors, the government could generate jobs, boost domestic production, and position India as a stronger player in global markets.BOOSTING RURAL CONSUMPTION AND FOOD SECURITY With rural areas showing signs of recovery, boosting rural consumption remains a priority. Proposals include increasing daily wages under employment schemes, enhancing direct benefit transfers, and offering consumption vouchers for low-income families to increase purchasing power and demand in rural markets.ADDRESSING DUMPING BY CHINA China’s practice of dumping excess goods in the global market has hurt Indian industries. Industry bodies are calling for protective measures to safeguard domestic businesses from unfair competition, ensuring that local industries can thrive without external distortions. With India eagerly awaiting Budget 2025, these proposed measures have the potential to boost economic growth, ease inflation, and create jobs. Bold interventions in key areas could help India overcome its current economic challenges and pave the way for a more prosperous future.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

The rally can be attributed to global policy measures aimed at economic revival, which investors believe could boost fuel demand and enhance earnings for upstream oil companies. Oil India’s stock climbed 4.88% to Rs 486.15 on the BSE at 12:33 pm, while ONGC’s shares advanced 4.67% to Rs 257.50. The surge in ONGC’s share price was further supported by a report from Jefferies, which set a target price of Rs 375, arguing that the recent 30% correction in ONGC’s stock price over the past three months appears excessive. The report highlighted that recent regulatory developments could drive profitability improvements. Despite the recent rally, upstream companies are expected to post subdued operating profits in Q3 due to a decline in net crude realisations. According to YES Securities, ONGC’s oil production may fall 4.7% year-on-year (YoY) in Q3, though gas production is likely to remain flat. Similarly, Oil India’s oil production is expected to be flat YoY, while gas production could see a marginal increase of 0.5% YoY. For the December quarter, YES Securities projects a net crude oil realisation of $73.2 per barrel for ONGC and $73.7 per barrel for Oil India. It also anticipates APM gas realisation at $6.5 per mmBtu for both companies. ONGC’s gas volumes are expected to remain flat YoY but rise 1.2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), while Oil India’s gas volumes may grow 0.5% YoY and 3.4% QoQ. However, the outlook for the current quarter appears brighter. Brent crude futures edged up 22 cents to $76.15 per barrel, marking their highest close since late October. Similarly, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 25 cents to $73.38 per barrel, hitting a two-month high. YES Securities noted that the oil and gas sector’s core performance in Q3FY25 could be mixed, with oil marketing companies and refiners potentially benefitting from stronger gross refining margins and improved marketing profits.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 3, 2025

The stock declined 4.44% to trade at Rs 547 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at Rs 1:40 pm after hitting an intraday low of Rs 548. In an exchange filing, the company noted, “Pursuant to Regulation 42 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rules made thereunder, the Company has fixed Friday, January 03, 2025, as the ‘Record Date’ for determining the eligibility of Shareholders entitled for issuance of Bonus Equity Shares in the proportion of 1 (One) Equity Share for every 2 (Two) existing Equity Shares."" The sharp 36% drop shown on some trading apps likely stems from a recalibration of the stock price post-bonus issue. This adjustment accounts for the increased number of outstanding shares while keeping the company’s overall market capitalisation unchanged. Such price corrections are standard following bonus issues and do not signal any fundamental shift in the company’s financial position. The record date is crucial as it determines which shareholders qualify for the bonus shares. To be eligible, investors must own the stock at least one day before the ex-date since trades settle on a T+1 basis. Shares bought on the ex-date do not qualify for dividends, splits, or bonus issues. This marks the company’s third bonus share issuance in recent years. KPI Green Energy issued bonus shares in a 1:2 ratio in 2024 and a 1:1 ratio in 2023, according to Trendlyne.

Taxpayers are eagerly awaiting potential changes to ease their financial burden, especially as inflation has raised the cost of living. The government is expected to focus on boosting consumption, given the low GDP for the second quarter, which could lead to tax relief measures aimed at increasing disposable income for salaried taxpayers. The new tax regime is expected to take centre stage in the budget, with reforms designed to make it a more attractive alternative to the traditional tax structure.POSSIBLE REFORMS IN THE NEW TAX REGIME The upcoming budget could include several changes to the new tax regime to simplify compliance and reduce the tax burden for individual taxpayers. According to tax experts, one significant proposal is raising the income exemption threshold from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh or higher. There is also speculation about increasing the standard deduction for salaried individuals from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Tushar Kumar, an advocate at the Supreme Court of India, said, “The government might rationalise income tax slabs or reduce tax rates for middle-income earners. This would boost disposable income and encourage economic activity. Introducing deductions for contributions to the National Pension Scheme (NPS) or interest on housing loans could incentivise taxpayers further."" Additionally, family-centric tax reliefs, such as deductions for educational expenses or medical insurance premiums, might be introduced. The government is also considering recalibrating concessional tax rates for income brackets between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 15 lakh. This could provide significant relief to middle-income taxpayers and encourage more people to switch to the new regime. Although the focus is on modernising the new tax regime, the old tax structure is unlikely to be overlooked. Many taxpayers still prefer the traditional system due to its established deductions and exemptions. Experts suggest that the government could increase the Section 80C deduction limit from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh and raise the ceiling on housing loan interest deductions under Section 24(b) from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. Additional changes might include higher deductions under Section 80D for medical insurance premiums and more relief for individuals with dependents who have disabilities under Section 80DD. These measures would ensure that the old tax regime remains a viable option for those who benefit from its provisions. Some experts believe the new tax regime is unlikely to introduce many additional deductions, as it aims to keep taxation straightforward. Sudhir Kaushik, Co-Founder and CEO of Taxspanner, said, “The focus is on offering straightforward taxation with reduced rates. Taxpayers who prioritise deductions for savings or expenses may prefer the old tax regime.” Others are optimistic about provisions that could benefit specific sectors. Kunal Savani, Partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said, “While the new tax regime offers broader slabs, it comes with restrictive deductions by default. However, we can expect welcoming provisions, especially for the real estate segment, which is growing significantly. This could include an increase in home loan deductions and a rationalisation of House Rent Allowance (HRA).”Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) classifies these as prepaid instruments, and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has clarified their treatment under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework. Here’s a breakdown of how GST applies to vouchers, along with insights for businesses.advertisementPREPAID VOUCHERS: TREATED AS ‘MONEY’Prepaid vouchers, including gift cards and digital wallets, are considered ‘money’ under the GST framework. Prepaid vouchers, including gift cards and digital wallets, are considered ‘money’ under the GST framework. Transactions involving these instruments are not treated as the supply of goods or services. Instead, they are viewed as a method of payment, similar to cash, and therefore, exempt from GST.NON-PREPAID VOUCHERS: ACTIONABLE CLAIMS Non-prepaid vouchers, which allow holders to redeem specific goods or services, are classified as ‘actionable claims.’ These transactions are also excluded from GST since they do not involve the supply of goods or services.GST ON VOUCHER TRANSACTIONS While the vouchers themselves are not subject to GST, the goods or services redeemed using them may attract GST. For instance, if a customer uses a Rs 10,000 voucher to purchase goods, GST applies to the purchased items, not the voucher.VOUCHER DISTRIBUTION MODELS AND GST Principal-to-Principal Basis:
Distributors buying vouchers at discounted rates and reselling them are not subject to GST since these transactions do not qualify as the supply of goods or services. Commission/Fee Basis:
Distributors working on behalf of issuers and earning commissions for marketing or support services must pay GST on their service fees.UNUSED VOUCHERS AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES If vouchers expire unused, no supply of goods or services occurs, exempting them from GST. However, distributors offering additional services like advertising or customer support to voucher issuers must pay GST on their service fees. The CBIC's clarifications simplify voucher taxation but require businesses to understand their specific scenarios. While vouchers themselves don’t trigger GST, commissions and related services do. Upcoming amendments to the GST framework may provide further clarity, ensuring businesses remain compliant and avoid ambiguities.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Trending Reel

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently met with representatives from the financial sector to deliberate on tax incentives for fixed deposits (FDs), amongst other investment tools. Here's a closer look at the discussions and proposals shaping this narrative.advertisementTAX RELIEF FOR FIXED DEPOSITSRepresentatives from banks and capital markets proposed treating FD interest as distinct from regular income tax or linking it to long-term capital gains tax. Representatives from banks and capital markets proposed treating FD interest as distinct from regular income tax or linking it to long-term capital gains tax. Such measures could make FDs more attractive, addressing declining deposit growth and encouraging middle-class savings. Currently, FD interest is taxed as regular income, which may deter potential investors.BOLSTERING CAPITAL MARKETS Radhika Gupta, CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund, emphasised the need for greater efficiency and inclusivity in capital markets. She proposed incentives for long-term savings through bonds and equity investments, aligning with the government's broader goals of financial inclusion.TAXATION AND COMPLIANCE FOR FDs Interest earned on FDs is categorised as ""Income from Other Sources"" under the Income Tax Act and taxed according to individual tax slabs. To simplify tax compliance, individuals should gather essential documents like interest certificates and Form 26AS. Submitting Form 15G or 15H at the start of the financial year can help eligible individuals and senior citizens avoid Tax Deducted at Source (TDS).MUTUAL FUNDS: A GROWING CONTENDER While FDs remain a staple for household savings, their dominance is waning. Nearly 15% of household savings still flow into FDs, but mutual funds and equities are gaining ground. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has highlighted the shift towards these avenues, urging banks to innovate and bridge the gap between credit and deposit growth. Budget 2025 presents an opportunity to balance traditional and modern savings instruments. By introducing tax incentives for FDs and enhancing capital market inclusivity, the government can bolster middle-class savings while addressing broader economic goals. A reimagined framework for savings could provide the much-needed impetus for both individuals and the financial sector.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

The new rule, the company said, will initially be applicable only in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut. ""We are committed to upholding safe and responsible hospitality practices. While respecting personal freedoms, we must also collaborate with local communities and law enforcement to ensure a harmonious operating environment,"" Pawas Sharma, Region Head, OYO North India said.  The updated guidelines, which will immediately affect OYO's partner hotels in Meerut, require all married couples to provide valid proof of relationship during check-in, including for online bookings.  The company also stated that unmarried couples may be denied accommodation, with discretion granted to hotel partners to decline bookings based on local social norms. The move, according to OYO, is part of a broader initiative to address community feedback and reshape its image as a safe and trusted accommodation provider for families, businessmen, students, religious pilgrims, and solo travellers. OYO's decision followed repeated appeals from civil society groups, particularly in Meerut, urging stricter regulations against stays by unmarried couples. Similar petitions have emerged from residents in other cities, prompting the firm to pilot the policy in Meerut and considering expanding it to other locations based on feedback. Alongside the revised policy, OYO has introduced several nationwide initiatives, including hosting joint seminars with the police and hotel partners on safe hospitality practices, blacklisting hotels found engaging in activities deemed immoral and taking action against unauthorised establishments misusing OYO branding.

Check unclaimed deposits via UDGAM portalRBI (Reerve Bank of India) launched the Unclaimed Deposits – Gateway to Access Information (UDGAM) portal in August 2023. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/what-are-unclaimed-deposits-bank-owe-you-money-check-via-udgam-portal-rbi-2660211-2025-01-06,"We’ve all had that delightful moment when we find a Rs 500 note tucked away in an old jacket or a forgotten pair of jeans. It feels like an unexpected bonus, doesn’t it? Now, imagine if that forgotten money wasn’t just a few hundred rupees, but potentially thousands or even lakhs lying idle in a bank account. That’s exactly what unclaimed deposits are – your money, sitting unnoticed. Unclaimed deposits amounting to a staggering Rs 78,213 crore are lying idle in various banks across the country as of March 2024, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). These funds, transferred to the Depositors' Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF), earn a simple interest of only 3% per annum, reducing the potential returns for depositors. To address this issue and make it easier for individuals to access their unclaimed funds, the RBI launched the Unclaimed Deposits – Gateway to Access Information (UDGAM) portal in August 2023. The platform helps users track and consolidate unclaimed deposits across different banks in one place.WHAT ARE UNCLAIMED DEPOSITS? Unclaimed deposits are funds lying in bank accounts that have been inactive for a long period. Here’s how this happens: Dormant accounts: Savings or current accounts become inactive if there is no activity for two years. Similarly, fixed and recurring deposits are considered dormant if not claimed within two years after maturity. Unclaimed deposits: If these accounts remain untouched for another eight years, the money is transferred to the DEAF, making them unclaimed deposits. These deposits often occur due to forgotten accounts, unclaimed fixed deposits, or the account holder's demise without proper succession planning.HOW UDGAM PORTAL HELPS The UDGAM portal is a one-stop platform developed by the RBI in collaboration with Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt Ltd (ReBIT), Indian Financial Technology & Allied Services (IFTAS), and participating banks. It simplifies the process of finding unclaimed deposits across multiple banks. Currently, 30 banks are part of the portal, representing 90% of the total unclaimed deposits in terms of value. Banks already on the platform include State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, South Indian Bank, Central Bank of India, Dhanlaxmi Bank, DBS Bank India, and CitiBank N.A. The remaining banks were added in phases, with full integration completed by October 15, 2023.HOW TO REGISTER ON THE UDGAM PORTAL To search for unclaimed deposits, users need to register on the UDGAM portal by following these steps: Visit the UDGAM Portal: Access the official website. Register an account: Enter your mobile number, name, password, and CAPTCHA code. Submit the details. An OTP will be sent to your mobile number for verification. Log In: Use your mobile number and password to log in. Enter another OTP sent to your mobile number. Search for deposits: Provide details such as the account holder’s name and the bank name(s). Include at least one of these search criteria: PAN, Voter ID, Driving Licence Number, Passport Number, or Date of Birth. Click ""Search"" to view your unclaimed deposits. The RBI launched UDGAM to tackle the growing trend of unclaimed deposits and ensure that rightful owners or their legal heirs can reclaim their money. Public awareness campaigns are being conducted to encourage people to check and claim their funds through this portal. Once you find unclaimed deposits through UDGAM, you can approach the respective bank to either reactivate the dormant account or claim the funds. The process may require submitting documents such as ID proof, proof of account ownership, and, in some cases, succession certificates.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

45cce80d-836f-424c-a398-7acb938704bc,Explained: Why ITC share price fell by 6% todayA special pre-open session was conducted on the stock exchanges between 9:00 AM and 9:45 AM to determine ITC Hotels' share price.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/itc-share-price-hotel-business-demerger-special-pre-opening-session-key-details-review-stmp-2660219-2025-01-06,"ITC share price saw a sharp drop of nearly 6% in Monday's early trading, hitting a low of Rs 455. The fall occurred during the price discovery process for ITC Hotels, the soon-to-be-listed demerged hotels business of ITC. A special pre-open session was conducted on the stock exchanges between 9:00 AM and 9:45 AM to determine ITC Hotels' share price. Following this, normal trading in ITC shares resumed at 10:00 AM. Eligible ITC shareholders will receive one ITC Hotels share for every 10 ITC shares they hold. During the pre-open session, ITC shares settled at Rs 455 on the BSE and Rs 455.60 on the NSE, compared to the previous closing prices of Rs 482 and Rs 481.60, respectively. The difference between ITC's closing price on Friday (January 3) and its price during the special session determines the value of ITC Hotels' shares. Based on this, ITC Hotels' share price was discovered at Rs 27 per share on the BSE and Rs 26 per share on the NSE. ITC Hotels will officially list on the stock exchanges in February 2024. Until then, it will appear as a dummy ticker on market indices, with no trading activity allowed. Once listed, the stock will trade independently, and ITC Hotels will be removed from NSE and BSE indices based on its last traded price. However, if the stock hits circuit limits on listing, its exclusion will be delayed.PRICE ESTIMATES FOR ITC HOTELS Market analysts predict that ITC Hotels' share price will likely be in the range of Rs 150 to Rs 175 per share after full trading begins. Systematix, a financial research firm, estimates the stock's value at Rs 150 per share, applying a 25-times EV/EBITDA multiple for FY26 earnings. It notes that ITC Hotels is India’s second-largest hotel chain, operating 140 properties across the country. Systematix also highlights the financials of ITC Hotels. The business accounts for 4% of ITC’s total revenues, 3% of its EBIT, and 10% of its capital employed. Post-demerger, ITC’s return on capital employed (ROCE) is expected to improve from 40% to 43%. ITC Hotels will begin operations as a standalone company with Rs 1,500 crore in cash and no debt. It plans to invest 8-10% of its annual sales in renovations, ongoing projects, and new developments. ITC will continue to hold a 40% stake in ITC Hotels, while the remaining 60% will be distributed among ITC’s shareholders. Analysts have a neutral to positive outlook on ITC shares post-demerger, as the separation allows the conglomerate to focus on its core businesses, including FMCG and tobacco. According to Nuvama’s FMCG research team, the adjustment in ITC’s stock price due to the demerger is expected to be Rs 18 per share. This aligns with market participants’ views that ITC Hotels’ initial trading price will be in the Rs 150-175 range.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

The proposals aim to capitalise on India’s demographic dividend and strengthen its employment ecosystem.NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT POLICY CII recommends a comprehensive National Employment Policy to integrate existing employment schemes from various ministries and states. This policy would streamline efforts and centralise data through a single employment portal, the National Career Service (NCS).advertisementDATA-DRIVEN EMPLOYMENT INSIGHTS To improve job creation strategies, CII suggests developing a Universal Labour Information Management System (ULIMS) under NCS. This system would provide insights into job opportunities, skills demand, and training programs, aligning them with market needs.INCENTIVES FOR HIRING CII proposes replacing section 80JJAA with a new tax provision to encourage businesses to hire. Employers could avail deductions for new employees, capped at Rs 1 lakh per month for the first three years, fostering job creation.BOOSTING LABOUR-INTENSIVE SECTORS Focused support for employment-heavy sectors like construction, textiles, and tourism is crucial. Synchronising tariff structures, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), and employment-linked schemes can enhance exports and job opportunities.EMPOWERING RURAL YOUTH A rural internship program for college graduates could strengthen government initiatives in rural areas, utilising young talent to address workforce gaps.INCREASING FEMALE WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION CII emphasises the need for dormitories funded by CSR, crèches in industrial clusters, and formalisation of the care economy. These initiatives, coupled with gender-sensitive employment policies, aim to economically empower women.TAPPING GLOBAL JOB MARKETS CII advocates for an International Mobility Authority under the Ministry of External Affairs to facilitate overseas job opportunities for Indian youth. Programs focusing on global skillsets, cultural training, and foreign languages would enhance employability abroad. CII’s recommendations aim to create a dynamic employment landscape, fostering inclusivity and productivity. If implemented, these measures could unlock India’s potential as a global economic powerhouse.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Tune InMust Watch

With rising living costs and limited disposable income, expectations from the government are higher than ever. Will this budget bring much-needed relief to ease their financial burdens?TAX RELIEF: THE BIGGEST EXPECTATION One of the foremost demands of the middle class is a reduction in tax liabilities. Simplified tax structures and higher exemptions could go a long way in improving disposable incomes. The salaried class also hopes for increased standard deductions to address rising costs, including healthcare and education expenses.AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INTEREST RELIEF The dream of owning a home remains a challenge for many middle-class families due to high property prices and loan interest rates. Measures like subsidies on housing loans or incentives for first-time homebuyers could make this dream more achievable.CUSHIONING THE IMPACT OF INFLATION Inflation has consistently chipped away at middle-class incomes. Budget 2025 could offer relief through subsidies on essential commodities or measures to stabilise fuel and utility prices. A more robust mechanism to control inflation could significantly ease monthly financial pressures.EMPOWERING THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES While tax relief is vital, long-term financial stability stems from consistent income growth. Policies aimed at boosting job creation, skill development, and upskilling initiatives would empower the middle class to adapt to a rapidly changing economy.RETIREMENT, HEALTHCARE, AND WELFARE PRIORITIES Past budgets have seen incremental changes, but a significant overhaul remains elusive. This year, taxpayers are keen to see whether longstanding demands for more comprehensive reforms will be addressed. Provisions supporting retirement planning, healthcare expenses, and family welfare are high on the wish list.FOCUS ON WORK-LIFE DYNAMICS There’s also hope for policies that cater to the evolving work environment, such as deductions for remote work expenses or incentives for skill development. The salaried class looks forward to tax provisions that align with contemporary needs, fostering both personal and professional growth. Will Budget 2025 meet these expectations or fall short?

Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted, “The market is likely to be influenced by the negative factors impacting FII flows and some positive domestic factors which can support the market.”WEAK GLOBAL CUES Global economic conditions remain unfavourable, with a high dollar index at 109 and the 10-year US bond yield at 4.62%. Dr. Vijayakumar explained, “The FIIs are likely to continue selling till the yields decline and the dollar stabilises.” These global challenges are weighing heavily on Indian markets.SECTORAL SELL-OFFSectoral indices on the Nifty were deep in the red, with Nifty PSU Bank falling 3.63%. Nifty Metal and Realty also saw sharp declines, dropping 2.98% and 2.77%, respectively. Broader indices, including Nifty Smallcap100, took a heavy hit as selling pressure mounted across the board.WEAK Q3 BUSINESS UPDATES Concerns over weak business updates from key sectors, particularly banking and FMCG, have further dampened sentiment. Chowdhury noted, “Markets have been under pressure primarily due to weak business updates by companies, especially banks and some FMCG stocks.”FPI SELLING AND RISING DOLLAR 
Persistent FPI selling and a strengthening dollar have exacerbated the market downturn. Manish Jain, Director at Mirae Asset Capital Markets, highlighted the challenges: “The government’s capex spending remains elusive, while depreciation of the Rupee has intensified, and a revival in consumption is still not evident. The market is waiting for strong positive triggers which are still missing.”VIRUS SCARE Last but not least, the discovery of two HMPV cases in Bengaluru sparked panic among investors. Although the virus is not expected to have the same impact as Covid-19, it led to a knee-jerk reaction in the markets. Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at StoxBox, remarked, “Market sentiment may have turned a little sour due to initial HMPV cases found in India, but its impact may be limited as the fatality seems to be lower compared to the Covid virus.” With corporate earnings, the upcoming budget, and global trade policies on the horizon, market volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term.

His untimely death was confirmed by the company in an official statement. ""It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Mr. Amit Banerji, our Founder, Chairman, and CEO. His impact on the company, its people and the industry will be lasting, and he will be profoundly missed by his family, friends and partners,"" the statement read. Banerji, aged 44, was a seasoned professional with vast experience in the technology and real estate sectors. Before founding Table Space in 2017, he worked at Accenture for over 13 years, leaving as its managing director of corporate real estate in India. He co-founded Table Space alongside Karan Chopra, with a vision to provide innovative and flexible workspace solutions. Under Banerji's leadership, Table Space grew rapidly, with Banerji playing a pivotal role in business planning, negotiations, and asset management. The company, aiming for a valuation of $2.5 billion in its upcoming IPO, raised around $330 million in several funding rounds, including a significant commitment from Hillhouse Capital. As of FY24, Table Space reported a 35% increase in revenue, with a notable rise in both occupancy rates and leasable areas. Despite this significant growth, the company will undoubtedly feel the impact of Banerji's loss as it moves forward with plans for its IPO. Banerji’s untimely death joins a tragic trend of premature losses in the entrepreneurial world, with Rohan Malhotra, co-founder of Good Capital, passing away at 44 last year, Ambareesh Murty, co-founder of Pepperfry, at 51 in 2023, and Rohan Mirchandani, co-founder of Epigamia, who also died of a heart attack last month.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

According to the new policy, OYO has empowered its partner hotels to decide whether to accept or decline bookings from couples based on their judgement, aligning with local social sensibilities. Known for being couple-friendly, even for unmarried couples, OYO has been working over the past few months to rebrand itself as a more family-oriented platform. In an exclusive chat with India Today Digital, OYO founder Ritesh Agarwal discussed the brand’s image transformation and the need to shift its focus. During the promotions of Shark Tank India 4, where Agarwal returns as one of the sharks (investors), the entrepreneur addressed OYO's branding, which has been largely associated with couple stays — something he described as a 'social media-created perspective.' He also highlighted their recent advertisement, which aimed to challenge this perception and promoted its partner hotels to be better suited for families. Agarwal shared that, according to their data, most of OYO’s bookings have always come from families or business travellers. ""It’s been quite interesting because, based on our data, a significant portion of our business — almost 70-80% — comes from families or business travellers. However, there is a social media perception, mainly fuelled by certain memes, which has created a new context. We appreciate this because that (couple stays) has been a challenge for our society too,"" Agarwal told India Today Digital.  The founder also discussed OYO’s branding evolution to a more premium image, particularly after recognising the potential of religious tourism. ""We launched 80 hotels in Ayodhya and have partners in Varanasi, Rameshwaram, Ajmer, and other religious destinations across the country, all of which are growing rapidly. As our brands grew, we realised the value of confronting the branding challenge head-on. Rather than whispering about the assumptions created by memes, we wanted to address them directly. The reality is different, and I believe brands should be bold. If there are misconceptions, they should not hesitate to communicate openly with customers. You need to convey the message and help them understand. Only then can both parties benefit,"" the OYO founder said.  Agarwal further shared that the new branding strategy had proven successful, with the company seeing the highest app downloads, repeat rates, and hotel openings in the last three years. ""We really got a lot of love,"" he said. When asked if the memes on social media ever caused him embarrassment or made him feel bad about how his company was perceived, Agarwal responded, ""Not at all. OYO is a highly respected brand in the corporate world, and we've won several 'Best Corporate' awards. The platform is used by families in central India, from Orissa to Uttar Pradesh, and they don’t have that perception at all. The whole thing has been a social media phenomenon, mainly in urban cities. Even when we released the new ad, it was targeted specifically at urban cities. We didn’t even air it on TV; it was just a digital message. This issue is primarily a big-city problem, but it’s rapidly changing thanks to our company-managed hotels."" Shark Tank India 4 starts streaming today on SonyLIV. In addition to Ritesh Agarwal, the other sharks on the show include Anupam Mittal (Shaadi.com), Aman Gupta (boAt), Namita Thapar (Emcure), Peyush Bansal (Lenskart), Vineeta Singh (Sugar), Azhar Iqubal (Inshorts), Varun Dua (ACKO), Kunal Bahl (Snapdeal), and Viraj Bahl (Veeba).Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

Aimed at enhancing efficiency, accessibility, and user experience, this new software is set to transform the way employees manage their retirement savings.ENHANCED FEATURES AND ACCESSIBILITY Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya revealed that EPFO 3.0 will bring a host of features aimed at streamlining the EPF processes. One of the standout features of the new system will be a more user-friendly website interface, making it easier for members to navigate and manage their accounts. The system will offer a level of efficiency similar to that of banking systems in India, allowing employees to access their retirement funds seamlessly.ATM CARD FOR EPF MEMBERS One of the most anticipated features of EPFO 3.0 is the introduction of ATM cards for EPF members. Once the system is launched, employees will be able to withdraw their EPF savings directly from ATMs, enhancing accessibility and allowing them to address financial emergencies more conveniently. The first phase of website and system upgrades is expected to be completed by the end of January 2025.PENSION SCHEME FLEXIBILITY AND WITHDRAWAL GUIDELINES In addition to ATM withdrawals, the EPFO is exploring changes to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS), offering employees the flexibility to adjust their contribution levels. The current system mandates a 12% contribution from both the employee and employer, but with the proposed change, employees may have the option to contribute more or less, based on their preferences.A NEW ERA FOR EPF MEMBERS With these exciting changes on the horizon, EPFO 3.0 is poised to make managing retirement savings more convenient and efficient than ever before. The expected improvements will not only benefit employees but will also help address unforeseen financial needs, marking a new era in India’s retirement savings ecosystem. As 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on the implementation of these revolutionary changes.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

The company last implemented pay hikes in November 2023. Typically, scheduled earlier in the year, this delay in wage hikes signals broader challenges in the global demand environment, particularly for discretionary IT services. The ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty has left IT companies grappling with subdued discretionary spending, delayed client budgets, and rising cost pressures.advertisementINDUSTRY-WIDE COST MANAGEMENT Infosys is not the only IT giant adopting such measures. Rivals such as HCLTech, LTIMindtree, and L&T Tech Services also chose to skip salary increments during the second quarter to curb expenses and maintain profitability, added the report.  As part of its phased approach, Infosys had earlier announced plans to implement wage hikes partially in January and fully by April, as confirmed by Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka during the company’s Q2 earnings call.EARNINGS UNCERTAINTY In Q2FY25, Infosys reported a 2.2% quarter-on-quarter rise in net profit, reaching Rs 6,506 crore. While this represented modest growth, it fell short of market expectations. Margins saw a slight improvement of 10 basis points, aided by reduced onsite costs, better utilisation rates, and enhanced operational efficiencies. Despite these gains, analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services anticipated margin pressures in the December quarter due to seasonal furloughs and fewer working days. However, cost-saving initiatives like subcontractor optimisation, pricing improvements, and Infosys’ margin improvement plan, Project Maximus, may help offset these challenges.STAGNANT JOB MARKET The delayed salary hikes are unlikely to trigger significant attrition, analysts noted, given the stagnant job market in the IT sector, said analysts quoted in the moneycontrol.com report. Selective salary increments for top performers, especially those in high-demand areas like artificial intelligence, continue within certain delivery teams. For many employees, retaining their positions is seen as a bonus in the current economic climate. As Infosys and its peers navigate these turbulent times, cost management remains a key priority to sustain profitability while adapting to evolving global market conditions.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Trending Reel

Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart said that the Indian equity markets are witnessing a sharp decline today, with both Nifty and Bank Nifty slipping below their 200-day moving averages (DMA). ""The sell-off can be attributed to a rise in foreign institutional investor (FII) selling and concerns surrounding the upcoming Q3 earnings season. Additionally, fears related to the new HMPV virus have added to the bearish sentiment, triggering fresh rounds of selling after the recent counter-trend pullback rally,"" he added.  The overall market structure appears weak; however, there remains a glimmer of hope for the bulls. One key factor is the lack of consistent follow-through in either direction, suggesting a degree of indecision. Furthermore, both Nifty and Bank Nifty are currently trading near their crucial support levels of 23,500 and 49,700, respectively, which could provide some respite to the bulls. Stock markets bled today, but some stocks still managed to gain.  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise emerged as the top gainer, rising 1.94%, followed by Tata Consumer Products which advanced 1.12%. Titan Company gained 0.72%, while HCL Technologies added a modest 0.10%, and ICICI Bank edged up by 0.08%. Tata Steel faced the steepest decline of 4.60% on Nifty50, followed by Trent Limited which fell 4.35%. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited dropped 3.68%, while NTPC Limited declined 3.63%, and Adani Enterprises Limited decreased by 3.61%. ""We can expect Nifty to gain support between 23,470 and 23,200 and notice resistance between 23,650 and 23,720 in the next intraday session. Notably, the overall sentiment will remain bearish, and we could expect the price to test the 22,900 level. In this situation, I suggest adopting a sell-on-rise approach while short-term and mid-term investors should continue to hedge their positions,"" said VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today.  Market volatility spiked significantly, as reflected in the India VIX, which surged 15.58%. The broader markets faced severe selling pressure, with Nifty Smallcap100 taking a bigger hit, plunging 3.20%, while Nifty Midcap100 declined sharply by 2.70%. In a brutal sell-off today, all sectoral indices on the Nifty plunged into the red, with no sectors managing to escape the bloodbath. Nifty PSU Bank took the hardest hit plummeting 4.00%. Nifty Metal crashed 3.14%, closely followed by Nifty Realty which tumbled 3.16%. The banking sector faced severe pressure with Nifty while Nifty Bank fell 2.09% and Nifty Private Bank dropped 2.11%. Energy stocks weren't spared either, as Nifty Oil & Gas sank 2.89%. Nifty Media declined sharply by 2.71%, while Nifty Financial Services Ex-Bank fell 2.75%.

By January 15, 2025, taxpayers must disclose any overseas financial accounts, income, and assets as part of their tax filing process for the Assessment Year 2024-25.SOURCES OF FOREIGN ACCOUNT INFORMATION To ensure compliance, the Indian government and its law enforcement agencies gather detailed information on financial accounts held by Indian residents abroad through two key international frameworks: FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and CRS (Common Reporting Standard). These sources allow the Indian Income Tax Department to monitor the global income of taxpayers and track those who may not be fully transparent in their disclosures.UNDERSTANDING FATCA AND CRS FATCA is a US law that compels foreign financial institutions to report accounts held by U.S. taxpayers to the IRS. On the other hand, CRS is an initiative by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), requiring global financial institutions to disclose foreign-held financial account information to the relevant tax authorities. Both frameworks play a crucial role in promoting global tax transparency and preventing tax evasion.DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIAN TAXPAYERS Under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, residents must report their foreign assets and income in their ITRs. To ensure proper reporting, foreign assets must be declared using Schedule FA, while income from abroad is reported via Schedule FSI. Additionally, taxpayers can claim tax relief for taxes paid abroad through Schedule TR.EXTENDED ITR FILING DEADLINE The Income Tax Department has extended the deadline for filing belated and revised ITRs for fiscal year 2023-24 from December 31, 2024, to January 15, 2025. This extension allows taxpayers with foreign assets or income to update their filings, ensuring full compliance with Indian tax laws before the final date. As the deadline draws near, it’s crucial for taxpayers with foreign assets and income to ensure they meet the reporting requirements. Failing to disclose foreign assets or income can result in penalties and legal consequences. The government’s push for transparency through FATCA and CRS will continue to shape the tax landscape, making it imperative for taxpayers to be vigilant about their obligations.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Must Watch

The week began with heavy selling pressure, dragging all sectoral indices into the red. Concerns over the HMPV virus and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pulling out funds triggered a massive sell-off, leaving the Sensex and Nifty both over 1.5% lower. The S&P BSE Sensex plunged 1,258.12 points to close at 77,964.99, while the NSE Nifty50 dropped 388.70 points to end at 23,616.05. Nifty PSU Bank bore the brunt, plummeting by 4%, marking its worst performance since June 2024. Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty followed with losses of 3.14% and 3.16%, respectively. Broader market indices also suffered sharp declines. Nifty Smallcap100 plunged 3.20%, while Nifty Midcap100 fell by 2.70%. Meanwhile, the India VIX, a measure of market volatility, spiked 15.58%, reflecting investor anxiety. The market fall marked one of the steepest single-day declines in recent months. REASON FOR MARKET CRASH  ""The sell-off was largely attributed to continued foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows and confirmation of HMPV cases in India coincided with reports of a virus outbreak in China, leading to heightened investor caution,"" said Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza. Analysts also pointed to other factors that contributed to the market crash. Among these were weak business updates from key sectors, particularly banks and FMCG companies, and concerns over tightening liquidity in the banking sector. ""The main concern of the market pressure has been the firms' poor business updates, particularly those from banks and FMCG stocks. The banking sector is currently navigating a landscape of tightening liquidity and slowing deposit growth. A stronger dollar and ongoing FPI selling have made the market decline worse. The strength of the US dollar and rising bond yields created a challenging environment for emerging markets,"" said CA Jashan Arora, Director, Master Trust Group.WHAT TO EXPECT TODAY Market volatility is expected to persist on Tuesday, fuelled by ongoing concerns over the HMPV virus, upcoming corporate earnings reports, and macroeconomic factors such as the Union Budget and global trade policy shifts. Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research at Religare Broking Ltd, highlighted the challenges ahead and said, ""The pullback in the Nifty index, coupled with a spike in volatility (India VIX), has disrupted the recovery trend, signalling potential challenges ahead. The banking sector's recent underperformance, combined with weakness in the midcap and smallcap segments, has intensified the bearish sentiment."" He further added that the pharma and healthcare sectors are expected to maintain their resilience, while other sectors may continue to face downward pressure.  ""We can expect Nifty to gain support between 23,470 and 23,200 and notice resistance between 23,650 and 23,720 in the next intraday session. Notably, the overall sentiment will remain bearish, and we could expect the price to test the 22,900 level.

Most other broader market indices, including small and midcaps, also registered gains. Despite today’s recovery in early trade, there are visible signs of volatility on Dalal Street due to a slew of factors such as FII selling, strengthening dollar, Q3 results and a few other factors. Additionally, the first GDP advance estimates for FY25 will be released today and economists have indicated that growth could slow down to a four-year low. Given the uncertainty on Dalal Street, experts have offered some insights on what factors are triggering volatility and how retail traders can navigate this turbulent phase. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said, “Nifty's Monday decline was driven by persistent selling from FIIs, who offloaded Rs 2,575 crore worth of shares, pushing the index below its 200-DMA at 23,907.” “Key catalysts for heightened volatility include FIIs selling Rs 7,078.30 crore of Indian equities in January, a record-low Rupee at 85.85, a spike in oil prices to $74.75 per barrel, and elevated US Treasury yields,” he added. “As the market awaits US NFP data and TCS's Q3 results, Nifty's direction remains uncertain amidst global and domestic pressures,” he noted, indicating that investors should remain cautious for the time being. Meanwhile, Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said the 1.6% cut in Nifty yesterday appears to be an “overreaction to the HMPV virus concerns”. “FII selling of Rs 2,575 crore was overwhelmed by the DII buying of Rs 5,750 crore.

The firm raised its rating on Biocon to 'underperform' and increased its target price by 43% to Rs 400, citing positive developments around the regulatory approval of the company’s manufacturing facility in Bengaluru. The new target price suggests an upside potential of approximately 12% from Monday’s closing price. At 10:45 am, Biocon shares were trading 7.22% higher at Rs 384.50 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).advertisementBIG FDA BOOST  The key trigger for the rally was the US Food and Drug Administration’s (US FDA) approval of Biocon’s biologics unit in Bengaluru, which received a “Voluntary Action Indicated” (VAI) status. The VAI classification signals that while minor issues were noted during the inspection, they do not require further regulatory actions. The development clears the path for Biocon to continue its operations without any disruptions. Investors now turn their focus to the regulatory approval process for Biocon’s Malaysia manufacturing unit, which remains a critical factor for the company’s growth outlook.BIOSIMILAR STELARA BOOST In addition to the Bengaluru unit approval, Jefferies highlighted Biocon’s recent milestone in securing US FDA approval for its biosimilar version of Janssen’s Stelara, a top-selling drug used to treat autoimmune disorders. Biocon plans to launch the biosimilar, branded as Yesintek, in February 2025. Stelara generated $7 billion in US sales in 2023, and Biocon aims to tap into this lucrative market. While competition in the biosimilar space is intense, with five other FDA-approved versions expected to launch in FY25, Jefferies sees strong growth potential for Biocon’s biologics business. Analysts believe the Stelara biosimilar approval significantly enhances Biocon’s revenue and profitability visibility. With these developments, Biocon can capitalise on regulatory clearances and expand its biologics portfolio, driving investor confidence and fuelling the stock’s upward momentum.

Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking Ltd, shared insights on the situation.  The sudden drop in key indices on Monday has disrupted the recovery trend in Indian markets. Analysts warn that rising volatility (India VIX) and sectoral weaknesses may lead to more selling pressure in the coming days. Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking Ltd, shared insights on the situation.  ""The Nifty index's pullback on Monday, coupled with a rise in volatility, has disrupted the recovery trend, signalling potential challenges ahead. Weakness in the banking sector, along with declines in midcap and smallcap stocks, has amplified bearish sentiment. On the other hand, the pharma and healthcare sectors are expected to demonstrate resilience, while other sectors may remain under pressure. Traders are advised to realign their positions accordingly. Key levels to watch include support at 23,250 in Nifty and resistance in the 23,950-24,250 zone,"" said Mishra. FACTORS BEHIND MARKET VOLATILITY Several factors have contributed to the current market volatility: Disappointing quarterly updates: A few large-cap companies, particularly in the banking sector, have shared weaker-than-expected Q3 updates ahead of the results season. HMPV spooks investors: Increasing cases of the HMPV virus in India have added to investor worries. Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) outflows: FIIs have been consistent net sellers in Indian equities, offloading shares worth Rs 7,078 crore in December 2024. ""Market sentiment has been dampened by a few disappointing quarterly updates, particularly from the banking sector, ahead of the earnings season, coupled with concerns over rising HMPV virus cases in India. Additionally, persistent foreign fund outflows are adding to the pressure. We believe that only strong earnings results can shift the market tone toward a sustained recovery; otherwise, the corrective trend is likely to persist, interspersed with occasional intermediate bounces,"" added Mishra. Amid the volatile backdrop, some stocks are showing clear trends, providing opportunities for both traders and investors. Below are specific stock recommendations from Dr Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research at Religare Broking, detailing potential moves based on current market conditions:Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) Analysis: The stock recently failed to sustain gains after breaking out in December and has now formed a bearish flag pattern. Recommendation: Sell January Futures at the current market price of Rs 1,054, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,087. Target: Rs 1,000 to Rs 980.Godrej Consumer Products (GODREJCP) Analysis: Godrej Consumer has shown resilience, rebounding strongly from the Rs 1,080-1,100 range. This indicates potential gains in the short to medium term. Recommendation: Buy in the price range of Rs 1,130-1,140, with a stop-loss below Rs 1,112. Target: Rs 1,190 to Rs 1,210.Cummins India (CUMMINSIND) Analysis: The stock recently broke below its critical support level of Rs 3,260, indicating a bearish trend. Recommendation: Sell January Futures at the current market price of Rs 3,180, with a stop-loss at Rs 3,240. Target: Rs 3,100. According to Singh, the market is likely to remain volatile until clear signals emerge from Q3 earnings reports. He said, ""Given the current market weakness, we anticipate heightened volatility in the coming days. However, amid this uncertainty, select stocks could present opportunities for gains.""

The sharp rally came despite the company reporting a consolidated net loss of Rs 3.59 crore in Q2 FY25, compared to a profit of Rs 5.23 crore in Q2 FY24.  At around 1:45 pm, shares of the company were trading 11.47% higher at Rs 622.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Investors appeared optimistic as Mobikwik’s Q2 FY25 loss narrowed from Rs 6.62 crore in the previous quarter, signalling improving financial health. The company attributed the loss to ongoing investments in its business aimed at driving future growth.WHY MOBIKWIK SHARES ARE ON THE RISE?  Mobikwik’s revenue from operations saw a significant jump, rising 42.86% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 290.65 crore from Rs 203.45 crore in Q2 FY24. The fintech company also reported a 267.3% YoY growth in Payments GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), driven by the rapid expansion of its payments business. The company’s EBITDA for the quarter stood at Rs 6.8 crore, which it attributed to improvements in contribution margin and optimized costs. This marked a positive development, as the business appears to be balancing growth initiatives with financial discipline. Mobikwik, a 15-year-old Gurugram-based fintech, has been a pioneer in digital payment innovations. Its latest product, Pocket UPI, allows users to make UPI transactions through their Mobikwik wallet instead of directly linking to a bank account, offering a seamless payment experience. The upbeat revenue growth and strong GMV expansion likely reassured investors about the company’s long-term potential, overshadowing the reported loss.

Rising inflation and increasing living costs have amplified the demand for measures that could ease financial strain. Taxpayers are hopeful for adjustments that would enhance their disposable income and support economic growth. The government is likely to focus on spurring consumption, particularly in light of the sluggish GDP growth reported for the second quarter. Industry experts expect measures aimed at reducing the tax burden on salaried and middle-class individuals, which could, in turn, drive household savings and consumption. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has recommended lowering marginal tax rates for individuals earning up to Rs 20 lakh annually, noting that such a move could stimulate a positive consumption cycle, foster growth, and boost tax revenue.WILL NEW INCOME TAX REGIME GET SWEETER?  The upcoming budget may focus on the new income tax regime yet again to increase its appeal compared to the old tax regime. Proposals under consideration include raising the income exemption threshold from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh or higher and increasing the standard deduction for salaried individuals from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Additional family-oriented tax benefits, such as deductions for educational expenses and medical insurance premiums, are also being speculated. There’s discussion around revising concessional tax rates for income brackets between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 15 lakh, potentially offering significant relief to middle-income taxpayers and encouraging a shift toward the New Tax Regime.END OF THE ROAD FOR OLD TAX REGIME?  While the new tax regime may get more benefits, there has been chatter around the possibility of the old tax regime facing the axe. However, the old tax regime still remains popular for its established deductions and exemptions.  Experts have suggested raising the Section 80C deduction limit from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh and increasing the housing loan interest deduction under Section 24(b) from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. Higher deductions under Sections 80D and 80DD for medical insurance and disabled dependents are also on the table. CII President Sanjiv Puri has called for reducing personal income tax rates for individuals earning up to Rs 20 lakh annually to stimulate consumption and economic growth. Similarly, Supreme Court advocate Tushar Kumar suggested rationalising tax slabs and introducing new deductions to boost disposable income. Former Infosys CFO TV Mohandas Pai highlighted the need for tax reforms to address inflation and rising living costs, while FICCI Vice President Vijay Sankar and PHDCCI President Hemant Jain highlighted the importance of supporting the middle class to boost consumer demand and alleviate inflationary pressures.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 7, 2025

The delay in updating the ITR processing software has left many eligible taxpayers struggling to claim their rightful rebates, with the January 15, 2025, deadline for filing revised or belated returns fast approaching.advertisementITR UPDATES AND SECTION 87A REBATE ISSUES The updated ITR forms were expected to resolve earlier glitches preventing taxpayers from claiming the Section 87A rebate on short-term capital gains (STCG) income. However, while the e-filing utility now accepts the claims, the processing software still rejects them due to outdated logic last revised on July 5, 2024. The updated ITR forms were expected to resolve earlier glitches preventing taxpayers from claiming the Section 87A rebate on short-term capital gains (STCG) income. However, while the e-filing utility now accepts the claims, the processing software still rejects them due to outdated logic last revised on July 5, 2024. Under Section 87A, eligible taxpayers can claim rebates of up to Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime or Rs 12,500 under the old regime. Chartered accountants have reported that the JSON schema, which governs ITR processing, has not been updated. This oversight means taxpayers filing revised ITRs will still face rejection if they claim the rebate on STCG income. Chartered Accountant Himank Singla, while speaking to The Economic Times, explained, “The ITR forms were updated for belated and revised filings, but the underlying processing logic remains unchanged. Filing a revised return now serves no purpose as the rebate claim will still be denied.” Many tax professionals recommend waiting for the Bombay High Court’s hearing on January 9, 2025, for clarity. The court had earlier directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to extend the deadline and update utilities to accommodate the rebate claims. With just days left before the revised ITR filing deadline, taxpayers face uncertainty and higher liabilities due to outdated processing systems. Clear communication and swift updates from the Income Tax Department are urgently needed to address these challenges and provide relief to eligible taxpayers.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Trending Reel

Zomato shares have declined over 9% in the past 5 trading sessions and over 14% in a month. At around 12:05 pm, shares of the company were trading 4.38% lower at Rs 253.05. The shares of the company fell after foreign brokerage Jefferies downgraded the stock from ""buy"" to ""hold."" The brokerage also reduced its target price for the food delivery giant by 18% to Rs 275, down from Rs 335, reflecting concerns over intensified competition in the quick commerce segment. The revised target price aligns closely with Zomato’s Monday closing of Rs 264.6, marking a 13% decline from its recent high of Rs 304.IS ZOMATO’S DREAM MARKET RALLY OVER? Jefferies cited heightened competition from Swiggy’s Instamart, Zepto, and Amazon as potential headwinds for Blinkit, Zomato’s quick commerce arm, which could impact profitability. Despite Zomato’s impressive 2024 rally—with shares doubling in value—Jefferies expects 2025 to be a year of consolidation. It revised its EBITDA estimates for FY26-27 downward by 12-15%, halving Blinkit’s valuation multiple to six times. Jefferies also trimmed its FY26-27 EPS forecasts by 20-21%, pointing to possible risks from aggressive discounting and competition. Meanwhile, Bernstein retained an ""outperform"" rating on Zomato, setting a target price of Rs 335. The firm lauded Zomato’s leadership in food delivery and quick commerce, highlighting its strong user acquisition strategy and expanding addressable market through initiatives like Dine Out. Bernstein anticipates quick commerce growth of 75-100% year-over-year, positioning Zomato as a major beneficiary. Elara Securities also highlighted Blinkit’s industry-leading position due to higher average order values, larger assortments, and competitive take rates. It noted that Blinkit has scaled operations to 45-50 cities, targeting 1,000 stores by the end of FY25. Anand Rathi offered a more balanced view, suggesting that multiple players can coexist in the quick commerce segment. The firm initiated coverage on Zomato and Swiggy with ""buy"" ratings and set 12-month target prices of Rs 385 and Rs 705, respectively. It highlighted Zomato’s market leadership but acknowledged Swiggy’s aggressive expansion plans, including its 10-minute food delivery service, Bolt. With competition intensifying in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, Zomato and its rivals are exploring new markets to drive growth. While analysts have varying views, all agree that Zomato faces the challenge of maintaining its position amid rising competition.

The surge came after the company announced it had received a key licence from the Indian government to manufacture advanced light machine guns. In a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Paras Defence said, ""We are pleased to inform you that M/s. Paras Defence and Space Technologies Ltd has been granted a licence under the Arms Act, 1959. This licence authorises the company to manufacture MK-46 and MK-48 Belt-fed Light Machine Gun (LMG) – Modernised Enhanced and Redefined LMG – with a proposed annual capacity of 6,000 numbers each."" This development is seen as a major step forward for the company in expanding its presence in India’s defence manufacturing sector and resulted in heavy trading on Paras Defence's stock today.

With the government's continued focus on simplifying the tax system, the upcoming budget could bring further modifications to make this framework even more appealing.EVOLUTION OF THE NEW TAX REGIME: A TIMELINE The new tax regime, introduced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Budget 2020, was designed to simplify the taxation process by reducing tax rates and eliminating most exemptions and deductions. This alternative tax structure offered six taxable slabs, with the promise of lower tax rates for those willing to forgo traditional tax benefits. Initial Structure: Budget 2020 In the 2020 Budget, Sitharaman unveiled a tax system with six slabs. For example, an individual earning Rs 15 lakh annually would now pay Rs 1.95 lakh in taxes, compared to Rs 2.73 lakh under the old regime. The key takeaway was that taxpayers could still choose between the old and new tax structures. Modifications in Budget 2021-2023 While the new tax regime remained mostly unchanged in the 2021 and 2022 budgets, Budget 2023 brought significant updates. The new tax regime became the default option on the ITR e-filing portal. Taxpayers can still opt for the old tax regime, but they must specify their choice before submitting their returns. Key changes included: A tax exemption for individuals earning up to Rs 7 lakh annually. A reduction in the number of tax slabs from six to five. An increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. The introduction of a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried individuals. Budget 2024: A boost for salaried employees In Budget 2024, Sitharaman introduced further modifications, particularly benefiting salaried employees and pensioners. The standard deduction was raised to Rs 75,000, and private-sector employees became eligible for a deduction of up to 14% of their basic salary for investments in the National Pension System (NPS). The Budget 2025 outlook As the Budget 2025 is set to address the financial concerns of the middle class, taxpayers expect more favourable changes to the new tax regime. With increased participation and evolving benefits, it seems that this system will continue to be a focal point for future tax reforms. With each passing year, the new tax regime evolves to provide more relief to taxpayers. As the budget draws closer, one can expect these changes to not only make compliance easier but also offer significant savings to the taxpayer.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Tune InMust Watch

According to two sources mentioned in the report, the hikes range from 1% to 4%, depending on performance. ""Salary increases have been rolled out for employees at the junior levels—E0, E1, and E2. The average hike is between 1% and 2%, while top performers have received raises of around 3% to 4%,"" a source was quoted as per the report. However, another source noted that these hikes are below earlier expectations. ""We were expecting an average increase of about 7%, with the best performers getting increments between 12% and 15%,"" they explained. The salary adjustments have been implemented for the third quarter, covering the period from October to December 2024. Letters detailing the new salary structures were sent to eligible employees in the last week of December. Junior employees at HCLTech, categorised under the E0, E1, and E2 levels, typically have experience of up to 10 years. Employees in mid- and senior-level roles, categorised as E3 and above, have not received any salary increases so far. HCLTech has not yet announced anything on salary hikes for junior employees and India Today Digital was not able to verify this. The company is scheduled to announce its financial results for the third quarter on 13 January 2025. The technology services industry, valued at $254 billion, is facing a challenging environment. Companies are dealing with slower client spending, which has made cost management a priority. These factors have led to delays in salary increases and bonuses across the sector. Recently, Infosys, a major competitor, announced 90% performance bonuses for the second quarter ending September. However, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are reported to have delayed their annual salary hikes for the fiscal year 2025. These increases are now expected to be announced in the last quarter, between January and March 2025. The decision to implement salary hikes is expected to affect profit margins for HCLTech and other companies in the October–December quarter. According to industry reports, firms like Wipro, LTIMindtree, and L&T Technology Services (LTTS) are likely to experience margin pressure due to similar wage increases. On the other hand, companies that have delayed salary hikes, such as Infosys and TCS, may see stable or improved margins for the same period. The third-quarter earnings season will begin with TCS releasing its results on 9 January, followed by Infosys on 16 January. Wipro and Tech Mahindra are scheduled to announce their results on 17 January.

This annual ritual helps reduce TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on salaries. If you're unsure about the process or whether it applies to you, here's a clear breakdown.WHO NEEDS TO SUBMIT PROOFS? Employees opting for the old tax regime must submit proof of eligible investments and expenses to claim deductions and exemptions. These include House Rent Allowance (HRA), Section 80C investments, health insurance premiums, home loan interest, and more. On the other hand, employees under the new tax regime are exempt from this requirement as most deductions are unavailable in this regime.KEY DEDUCTIONS UNDER THE OLD TAX REGIME HRA exemption: Submit rent receipts and agreements. For annual rent exceeding Rs 1 lakh, your landlord’s PAN is mandatory. Section 80C deductions: Investments like PPF, ELSS, and NPS, or expenses such as school fees and housing loan repayments, can reduce taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh. Health insurance (Section 80D): Claim up to Rs 1 lakh for premiums paid for self and parents. Home loan interest (Section 24B): Deduction up to Rs 2 lakh is allowed for interest paid on a home loan.TDS ON SALARY: HOW IT WORKS Employers calculate total tax liability based on your income and declared investments. If proofs aren’t submitted on time, they deduct full tax without accounting for deductions. However, you can still claim these while filing your ITR, though this might invite scrutiny and delay refunds.SWITCHING TAX REGIMES Employees can switch between tax regimes during ITR filing. Ensure timely filing (by July 31, 2025, for FY 2024-25) to claim the old regime and maintain all documents for verification. Submitting tax-saving proofs on time not only reduces TDS but also streamlines your tax compliance. While the new tax regime simplifies filing, the old regime remains advantageous for those with significant investments and expenses. Act early, submit proofs, and make the most of your hard-earned money!Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Must Watch

""Real GDP has been estimated to grow by 6.4% in FY 2024-25 as compared to the growth rate of 8.2% in Provisional Estimate (PE) of GDP for FY 2023-24. Nominal GDP has witnessed a growth rate of 9.7% in FY 2024-25 over the growth rate of 9.6% in FY 2023-24,"" said the NSO data.  It may be noted that the projection is even lower than the recent Reserve Bank estimate of 6.6% for the current fiscal year ending March 2025. The advance estimate, which plays a crucial role in Budget calculations, follows the July-September quarter shocker of 5.4% GDP growth. This surprising figure prompted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to revise its growth forecast for the current fiscal year to 6.6%, down from the earlier 7.2%. Real GDP at constant prices is estimated to rise to Rs 184.88 lakh crore in FY25, from Rs 173.82 lakh crore in FY24. Nominal GDP at current prices is projected to grow by 9.7%, reaching Rs 324.11 lakh crore, compared to Rs 295.36 lakh crore last year.
 


Real Gross Value Added (GVA) is expected to grow at 6.4%, a deceleration from 7.2% in FY24.Despite the slowdown, key sectors show promise. Agriculture and allied activities are forecast to grow by 3.8%, up from 1.4% in FY24. The construction sector is projected to expand by 8.6%, while financial, real estate, and professional services are expected to grow by 7.3%.Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), a key indicator of household spending, is anticipated to grow by 7.3% in FY25, compared to 4.0% in FY24. Meanwhile, Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) is estimated to rebound with a growth rate of 4.1%, up from 2.5% last fiscal.These estimates highlight that while growth will decelerate, some sectors are likely to remain resilient, offering hope for continued economic activity even amid slower overall growth.Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Jan 7, 2025

MCLR, introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2016, replaced the base rate system to make lending rates more dynamic. It represents the minimum rate below which banks cannot lend. Changes in MCLR directly affect loan EMIs, making them higher or lower depending on rate revisions. Borrowers under older regimes like the base rate or Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR), implemented before 2016, remain unaffected by MCLR changes unless they switch to the new system. Currently, HDFC Bank's Benchmark PLR stands at 17.95%, while the base rate is 9.45%, effective since September 2024.OTHER LENDING AND DEPOSIT RATES HDFC Bank has also revised its interest rates on bulk fixed deposits of Rs 3 crore to less than Rs 5 crore. Post-revision, FDs offer 4.75% to 7.40% for the general public and up to 7.90% for senior citizens, depending on the tenor. With this rate cut, HDFC Bank provides some financial relief to borrowers navigating fluctuating interest rates. Whether you're planning to take a loan or invest in fixed deposits, staying informed about these changes ensures smarter financial decisions.

These measures are expected to increase disposable incomes, spurring consumption in urban areas where most taxpayers reside. Sources indicate that the government is eyeing tweaks to the new income tax regime, introduced in FY 2020-21, which has attracted over 70% of taxpayers due to its simplified structure and regular enhancements.advertisementPROPOSED CHANGES IN TAX STRUCTURECurrently, under the new regime, income up to Rs 3 lakh is tax-free, while earnings between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 6 lakh are taxed at 5%, Rs 6-9 lakh at 10%, Rs 9–12 lakh at 15%, Rs 12–15 lakh at 20%, and above Rs 15 lakh at 30%. A standard deduction of Rs 75,000 ensures that incomes up to Rs 7.75 lakh are tax-free. Currently, under the new regime, income up to Rs 3 lakh is tax-free, while earnings between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 6 lakh are taxed at 5%, Rs 6-9 lakh at 10%, Rs 9–12 lakh at 15%, Rs 12–15 lakh at 20%, and above Rs 15 lakh at 30%. A standard deduction of Rs 75,000 ensures that incomes up to Rs 7.75 lakh are tax-free. Reports suggest that the basic exemption limit might increase from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh, with corresponding adjustments to other slabs. For example, the 5% slab may cover incomes from Rs 4 lakh to Rs 7 lakh, making the tax regime more beneficial for earners up to Rs 14 lakh.BOOSTING SPENDING POWER AMID INFLATION The government’s focus appears to be on easing the burden on individuals earning Rs 13–14 lakh annually, especially in urban areas, where inflation has eroded purchasing power, according to sources. The changes aim to provide relief to urban taxpayers, who face rising inflation and form the bulk of the consumption-driven economy. Experts believe that revising tax slabs by raising thresholds by Rs 1 lakh each could significantly lower tax burdens, encouraging higher spending. Sudhir Kapadia, EY India Tax & Regulatory Services partner, while speaking to Financial Express, stated, “Majority of income taxpayers live in urban areas where most of the consumption also takes place. Given that inflation is hurting people in the lower income strata, each IT slabs can be raised by 1 lakh each.” He added, “To boost consumption, especially in urban areas (where the majority of income taxpayers reside), expanding slabs at lower and middle-income levels, that is, up to 20% tax bracket should be considered.”RISING TAX REVENUES SUPPORT REFORMS With personal income tax collections rising 25% to Rs 7.41 lakh crore during April-November FY25, the government is in a strong position to implement these reforms. Unlike corporate taxes, personal tax receipts have consistently surpassed targets, providing fiscal space for relief measures. The anticipated changes could be a game-changer, delivering much-needed relief to taxpayers while stimulating economic activity.

Kamath wrote on X, “Ahmedabad and Mumbai account for 80% of equity delivery trades. Let that sink in. Essentially, the real money is with Gujjus.” He added,“Gujarat accounts for just 8% of the total registered investors, and the share has been falling.”
 


 According to Kamath's analysis, Mumbai contributed 64.28% of equity trade deliveries in November 2024, while Ahmedabad added another 17.53%. These figures underscore the dominance of these two cities in the financial landscape, largely driven by the Gujarati community’s financial prowess.GUJARATIS: THE FINANCIAL POWERHOUSES Kamath’s tweet acknowledged the Gujarati community’s deep-rooted business acumen, calling them the custodians of ""real money"" in the stock market. Interestingly, Gujarat, despite its outsized influence in equity trades, represents only 8% of India's total registered investors—a share that has been declining. Kamath also highlighted Gujarat’s significant participation in IPOs, which accounted for nearly 40% of all IPO activity last year.CITY-WISE TURNOVER INSIGHTS Expanding on city-wise turnover in the cash segments of BSE and NSE, Kamath noted that Ahmedabad leads, followed by Bengaluru, Vadodara, Bhubaneswar, and Chennai. Maharashtra, however, retains the top spot for the highest number of registered investors, with 1.48 crore as of December 2023. Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the second-largest state in this metric, overtaking Gujarat, with 89.47 lakh registered investors compared to Gujarat’s 76.68 lakh.REACTIONS SPARK INTEREST Kamath’s observations sparked engaging reactions. Kunal Shah, founder of CRED, responded with the iconic phrase 'Risk hai to Ishq hai' from Scam 1992, referencing Gujaratis’ bold and calculated risk-taking nature.
 


 CoinDCX playfully noted the entrepreneurial spirit of Gujarati kids, saying while children elsewhere learn A for Apple, B for Ball, and C for Cat, Gujarati kids grow up with A for Absolute Return, B for Blue Chip Tokens, C for Call Option, and D for Dalal Street.

As the stock experienced heavy trading activity, the exchanges sought clarification from the company regarding the price movement. At around 10 am, Spandana Sphoorty shares were trading at Rs 461.40 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), marking a remarkable 35% gain in just two days. By 12:56 pm, the stock had risen 14.62% to Rs 459, signalling strong investor interest. Today's surge came after the stock's 20% upper circuit hit in the previous session, which also saw high trading volumes, the highest in the last 10 weeks. The upswing in the stock price began after well-known chartist Sushil Kedia from Kedianomics predicted that the stock, then priced just over Rs 300, could deliver six-fold returns in the future, potentially reaching levels of Rs 1,800. Kedia told CNBC Awaaz that while he doesn’t recommend immediate action, he is watching for an ideal “buy” signal. Meanwhile, Osho Krishan, Senior Research Analyst at Angel One told Business Today about the positive development in the stock, noting the large volume-backed 35% surge this week. He suggested that aggressive traders could consider accumulating the stock, with immediate resistance levels around Rs 550-600 and support near Rs 400. The stock's sharp rise follows a challenging period for Spandana Sphoorty, which had faced pressure due to a deterioration in its microfinance asset quality and profitability. The company reported a significant increase in its gross stage 3 (GS3) loans, from 1.7% in Q4 FY24 to 5.3% in Q2 FY25, reflecting the ongoing challenges in its business operations.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the budget on February 1, 2025, with the middle class hoping for an increase in the tax-free income threshold, amongst other proposals.RSS-BACKED BMS PUSHES FOR BOLD REFORMS The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has called for substantial changes during pre-budget discussions. The organisation proposed raising the tax-free income limit to Rs 10 lakh while retaining current exemptions. Additionally, the BMS urged the government to constitute the 8th Pay Commission and exempt pensioners from income tax on pensions. Other key demands include extending the MGNREGA program to provide 200 workdays per family annually, implementing a stimulus package for agriculture and allied industries, and expediting GST refunds. The BMS also stressed the need for a comprehensive manufacturing strategy to reduce dependence on Chinese imports.FOCUS ON PENSION AND WORKER WELFARE The BMS has advocated increasing the minimum pension for EPS-95 beneficiaries from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000, with a future target of 50% of the government’s minimum wages, linked to the Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA). They also suggested expanding the Ayushman Bharat scheme to EPS-95 pensioners and introducing universal old-age pensions. Recommendations to improve worker welfare include extending gratuity calculations to 30 days per year, funding industrial boards like the beedi and contract labour boards, and prioritising the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) over the New Pension Scheme (NPS). With the Union Budget just weeks away, the middle class and worker groups are eagerly anticipating the government’s response to these bold proposals. If adopted, these measures could offer substantial financial relief and bolster India’s economic framework. Whether Budget 2025 will meet these expectations is yet to be seen.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Tune InMust Watch

The S&P BSE Sensex fell 553.10 points to 77,646.01 at 1:11 pm, while the NSE Nifty50 fell 163.05 points to trade at 23,544.85. Multiple factors were behind today’s nervousness on Dalal Street, including weaker growth estimates for FY25, worries over Q3 corporate earnings and the likelihood of fewer US rate cuts.advertisementQ3 CORPORATE EARNINGSOne of the key triggers behind today’s decline is nervousness among investors over the outcome of Q3 corporate earnings. Early trends suggest that the earnings season will be subdued and it has already started hurting investor sentiments. One of the key triggers behind today’s decline is nervousness among investors over the outcome of Q3 corporate earnings. Early trends suggest that the earnings season will be subdued and it has already started hurting investor sentiments. It is worth noting that recent quarterly updates from companies including Dabur India  and Hero MotoCorp  did not give the market hope that corporate profit growth in the December quarter would be any better than the previous quarter, which was the worst in four years. Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at Wealthmills Securities, told news agency Reuters that the business updates from companies have heightened worries of earnings moderation, which is “weighing on sentiment and triggering a drop in domestic equities ahead of the results season”.FEWER US RATE CUTS LIKELY Another reason behind today’s decline was a sharp tumble in technology and financial stocks, which fell after US data signalled at a stable economy and labour market, diminishing prospects of future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The Nifty IT index was down 0.5% during the session; Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services indices also fell sharply during the session and pulled down the benchmark indices. It was only due to heavyweight stock Reliance, which rose 2%, that the losses were limited on Dalal Street.GDP GROWTH ESTIMATE SLIPS A day ago, the first advance estimates released by the government indicated that GDP growth in FY25 may slow down sharply to 6.4%, marking a 4-year low. The growth estimate for FY25 is also sharply lower than FY24’s 8.2%. This may have led to some nervousness on Dalal Street. However, analysts said that it may not be a major trigger behind today’s weakness. Trivesh D, COO at Tradejini, said, “Markets often anticipate economic data, reacting to expected changes before the official figures are out. The forecasted GDP slowdown is not new information for investors; thus, the impact on equity markets might have already been absorbed.” “If not entirely, only minor movements may follow, unless there’s a further downward revision in growth expectations,” he added.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

The report noted that power output increased by 5.8% year-on-year to 1,824.13 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh). The deceleration was especially pronounced in the second half of the year, where power generation rose by only 2.3%, compared to a 9.6% rise in the first half. The slower growth aligns with the country’s economic performance, which saw its slowest expansion in nearly two years during the July-September quarter. December brought little relief, with India’s manufacturing sector posting its weakest monthly growth for the year due to subdued demand. However, analysts anticipate a rebound in 2025, driven by rising industrial production and higher residential electricity use during adverse weather conditions. “Electricity demand picked up in December with colder weather boosting heating system usage,” Sooraj Narayan, head of Asia-Pacific power modeling at Wood Mackenzie, told the news agency. “We expect a demand growth rate of 6% to 7% in 2025, supported by increased industrial activity.” Renewable energy contributed 12.1% of India’s total power generation in 2024, helping to reduce the share of coal to 74.4% from 75% in 2023. This marked the first drop in coal’s share in three years. Despite this progress, renewable growth slowed, with solar output rising just 18.4%, the lowest rate since India’s 2015 climate commitments. Wind power output also declined for the first time since 2020. Hydropower output recovered, rising 4% after a sharp 13.7% drop in 2023, but its overall share fell to 8.6%. Meanwhile, natural gas-fired power, which rose 17.3% last year, is expected to decline in 2025 due to higher projected gas prices, according to Energy Aspects senior LNG analyst Kesher Sumeet.With inputs from ReutersPublished By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

It may be noted that both the benchmark indices fell about 0.8% during the session, but pared losses in the last few hours. One of the biggest reasons for the volatility was recent business updates from companies, which have suggested that profit growth is unlikely to be any better. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Slowing economic growth projections and caution ahead of Q3 numbers added volatility in the market.” “However, the market witnessed a recovery from the day’s low owing to an accumulation of beaten-down blue-chip stocks and in expectation of government reforms in the upcoming budget to lift the tepid economy,” Nair added. “The near-term sentiment is likely to be subdued due to the rise in US bond yield and fear of fewer rate cuts by the Fed."" Meanwhile, Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, ""The Nifty index is trading within a range of 23,500 to 24,200. In Wednesday's session, it formed a hammer candlestick on the daily chart, closing near its 200-day EMA, thereby strengthening the 23,500 support level."" ""A decisive move will require the index to close below 23,500, which could lead to heightened selling pressure, or sustain above 24,000 to pave the way for a potential rally toward 24,500. Monitoring these crucial levels is essential to identify the next trend in the index,"" he added.

Victims are receiving fraudulent messages claiming that their PAN card details must be updated to avoid account blockage. These deceptive messages often contain suspicious links, which direct users to scammers looking to steal sensitive information. The Press Information Bureau (PIB) has stepped in to clarify the situation, labelling the message as fake. In an official post on X, PIB warned, ""Claim: The customer's India Post Payments bank account will be blocked within 24 hours if their PAN card is not updated. This claim is #Fake.""
 


 The government’s fact-check team highlighted that India Post will never send such messages, urging the public to be cautious and avoid clicking on any links.HOW THE SCAM WORKS Phishing is an online scam where cybercriminals impersonate trusted organisations to steal sensitive data like passwords, account numbers, or PINs. In this case, scammers prey on fear, sending messages that threaten account blockage unless PAN details are updated immediately. These messages might seem authentic, but they are part of a larger scam designed to deceive and exploit victims.PROTECT YOURSELF FROM PHISHING SCAMS IPPB has also shared important safety tips to help customers protect themselves. The bank encourages individuals to regularly update their passwords, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and be wary of fake customer care numbers. They also advise customers to closely monitor their bank accounts for any unauthorised activity. Additionally, users should exercise caution when using public Wi-Fi and always verify the authenticity of communications from financial institutions. As digital banking evolves, scammers are finding new ways to trick users. To stay safe, it’s crucial to stay informed and practice smart online security. When in doubt, always double-check the source and never share your personal or bank details through unsecured platforms. As scams become more sophisticated, it is crucial for users to stay informed and exercise vigilance. By following these simple steps, you can protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly common online frauds.

Shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) climbed over 2% on Wednesday, following a bullish note from foreign brokerage firm Jefferies. The firm reiterated its 'BUY' rating on the heavyweight stock, setting a target price of Rs 1,690, indicating a potential upside of over 30% from current levels. At 3:26 pm on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), RIL shares were trading 1.81% higher at Rs 1,263.30. If Jefferies’ target is achieved, it would translate to an impressive 33% upside. The rally marks a positive shift for Reliance, which underperformed the Nifty50 index by 15% in 2024, which is the first calendar year in nine years to see negative returns. According to Jefferies, concerns over medium-term growth in Reliance’s retail business and weaker earnings in FY25 weighed on the stock. However, the brokerage now expects mid-teens growth in the retail segment, a potential listing of Reliance Jio, and improved profitability in its Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) business by FY26. It forecasts a 14% growth in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) for FY26, with all segments contributing to this recovery. Jefferies also highlighted that RIL’s current valuations are the cheapest since March 2020, presenting a strong buying opportunity. Another global brokerage, Bernstein, maintained its 'Outperform' rating with a target price of â‚¹1,520, implying a 25% upside. Bernstein projects that 2025 will be a recovery year, driven by a 12% increase in Reliance Jio’s Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), even without tariff hikes. The retail segment is expected to revert to double-digit EBITDA growth, while refining margins are likely to improve. Out of 39 analysts covering RIL, 33 have a 'Buy' rating, three recommend 'Hold,' and three suggest 'Sell.' Mirae Asset Securities has the highest price target of â‚¹1,950, which signals a potential upside of 57%. RIL’s stock has corrected 22% from its 52-week high, making its valuations attractive for investors seeking long-term growth. Jefferies expects FY26 to see robust growth across segments, aided by Jio’s potential listing and improved O2C profitability. Meanwhile, Bernstein foresees a boost from higher telecom revenues and a rebound in refining margins. With two major brokerages expressing confidence in RIL’s recovery prospects, the stock could offer significant returns.

The app, which is currently available in select Bengaluru neighbourhoods, is aimed at urban consumers who prioritise speed and convenience when it comes to food delivery. The SNACC app offers a menu that includes breakfast options, light meals, and a variety of beverages, perfect for those seeking a fast, hassle-free dining experience. The app can be downloaded on both Android and iOS platforms, signaling Swiggy’s foray into the ultra-fast food delivery space, a market segment that's growing rapidly. This launch marks a shift from Swiggy's traditional model, where innovations were integrated into its main app, which has grown increasingly cluttered and difficult to navigate. By creating SNACC as a standalone platform, the company aims to streamline the delivery process for those looking for quick bites without the distractions of larger food orders. SNACC expands on Swiggy’s existing success with its rapid delivery arm, Bolt, which promises 15-minute deliveries by partnering with restaurants that can meet strict delivery time requirements. Unlike Bolt, however, SNACC operates from a centralised hub stocked with ready-to-serve products, enabling even faster and more reliable service. With this move, Swiggy is entering a competitive arena, where rivals like Zepto Cafe and Blinkit Bistro are already making waves in the rapid food delivery market. These platforms have capitalised on the increasing demand for quick, convenient food options, especially among India’s millennials and Gen Z consumers. India’s rapid food delivery market has seen significant growth, driven by changing consumer preferences and the widespread adoption of digital services.

Is Indian economy losing steam?While a slowdown in the ongoing financial year was anticipated, the steep downward revision in GDP growth for FY25 has taken many by surprise. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/indias-fy25-gdp-may-hit-a-4-year-low-whats-dragging-economic-growth-2661602-2025-01-08,"India’s economic growth is expected to slow sharply to 6.4% in FY25, according to the first advance estimates released by the government. The  projection marks a considerable drop from the 8.2% growth achieved in FY24 and represents the slowest pace of expansion in four years. The estimate is also lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) revised annual growth forecast of 6.6%, raising concerns across sectors. While a slowdown in the ongoing financial year was anticipated, the steep downward revision has taken many by surprise. So, what factors are driving this deceleration in GDP growth?advertisementSECTORAL GROWTH MODERATIONDr. Manoranjan Sharma, Chief Economist at Infomerics Ratings, explained, “India’s GDP is expected to grow by 6.4% in FY25 over 7.2% in FY24. This slowest growth rate since the pandemic manifests moderation across key sectors and constitutes a significant drop from the 8.2% growth in FY24.”While agriculture is poised for a noticeable improvement with a growth projection of 3.8% compared to 1.4% last year, other key sectors are forecast to slow. Manufacturing growth is projected to fall to 5.3% from 9.9%, while mining is expected to grow at 2.9% compared to 7.1%.Similarly, the construction sector is set to grow at 8.6%, down from 9.9%, and electricity growth is estimated at 6.8%, lower than the previous year’s 7.5%.The top contributors to GDP, such as manufacturing, trade and hotels, and financial services and real estate, are all expected to witness slower growth in FY25. Urban consumption has also been hit hard, with inflation eroding the purchasing power of the urban poor.“Decelerating GDP growth, together with persistent inflation, would make the RBI’s task of managing the growth-inflation trade-off odious,” added Dr. Sharma.CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES Dr. Manoranjan Sharma, Chief Economist at Infomerics Ratings, explained, “India’s GDP is expected to grow by 6.4% in FY25 over 7.2% in FY24.

The industry will have to quickly adapt to changing tastes,” he noted. Singh pointed out that subdued sales in the FMCG and auto sectors are not merely a result of low incomes. “The entry of brands like MG Hector and KIA in 2018 and the surge in Parle-G sales during COVID indicate that poor sales stem more from shifting preferences than income constraints,” he said. These shifts in consumer behaviour underline a broader transition in India’s consumption landscape, which may weigh on GDP growth in the short term but could offer opportunities for industries willing to adapt quickly. “The country is undergoing a change in preferences, and the industry will soon incorporate these changes, leading to more robust GDP growth,” Singh added.IMPACT ON STOCK MARKETS AND BROADER ECONOMY Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd, highlighted the potential market impact of the revised GDP forecast. “India’s GDP growth projection of 6.4% for FY25 could temper investor sentiment, as lower growth expectations might lead to reduced corporate earnings forecasts, prompting portfolio adjustments,” he said. Sectors closely tied to economic growth, particularly manufacturing, may see notable declines. However, Mishra suggested that “effective government fiscal measures or potential interest rate cuts by the RBI could offer some relief.” A sustained slowdown in GDP growth could also affect foreign institutional investor (FII) sentiment. Mishra noted, “Slower economic growth often raises concerns about corporate profitability and market stability. If FIIs identify more favourable opportunities elsewhere, they may reduce their exposure to Indian equities.” That said, India’s long-term appeal remains intact due to its demographic advantage, strong consumption trends, and resilient financial markets. External factors such as global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions will also play a role in shaping FII behaviour. Nominal GDP is expected to grow by 9.7% in FY25, slightly higher than the 9.6% seen in FY24. However, the broader economic outlook will rely heavily on the government’s fiscal policies and the RBI’s approach to managing inflation and growth.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

This new regulation aims to provide a more accurate reflection of borrowers' financial activities, enhancing credit score precision and streamlining financial assessments.TIMELY UPDATES FOR BETTER CREDIT SCORES Under the older system, credit bureaus relied on monthly updates from lenders, leading to delays in capturing borrowers' repayment behaviour. For instance, timely payments or loan closures often went unrecognised until the next update, potentially impacting borrowers' credit scores and limiting their access to favourable loan terms. The new 15-day cycle ensures faster updates, allowing borrowers’ financial activities to be reflected in real-time, thereby improving their chances of securing better credit opportunities.IMPROVED CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT The bi-monthly update system benefits lenders by offering more current credit data. This enables them to assess credit risk accurately, identify potential defaulters sooner, and reward responsible borrowers promptly. With up-to-date information, lenders can make well-informed decisions when evaluating loan applications, fostering responsible borrowing habits and reducing default rates.KEY BENEFITS OF THE NEW REGULATION Timely updates: Borrowers' credit histories will now reflect their financial activities more quickly, benefiting those with consistent repayment habits. Enhanced credit access: Accurate credit scores allow responsible borrowers to access loans faster and on better terms. Consumer empowerment: Real-time updates offer borrowers greater insight into their financial health, promoting informed decision-making. Lender confidence: Frequent updates improve risk management, providing a clearer picture of borrowers' financial behaviour. With the new bi-monthly updates, borrowers gain from quicker acknowledgement of their financial behaviours, while lenders benefit from improved risk assessment tools. This regulatory change not only strengthens trust in India's lending system but also empowers consumers and promotes a more equitable financial environment.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch

According to a Bloomberg report, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to unveil a comprehensive overhaul of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a move that has been in the works for several months.advertisementKEY FOCUS: SIMPLIFYING TAX FILINGThe proposed reforms, which may be open for public consultation by mid-January, are designed to streamline the income tax return (ITR) filing process. The proposed reforms, which may be open for public consultation by mid-January, are designed to streamline the income tax return (ITR) filing process. The initiative includes simplifying tax computation structures with formulas, unifying the definitions of the assessment year and financial year, and introducing tabular formats for taxpayer clarity. While the changes aim to make tax compliance easier, the government has indicated that tax rates and policies will remain unchanged. The demand for a simpler tax regime has grown, especially with tax disputes ballooning to Rs 10.5 lakh crore by the fiscal year ending March 2023. The proposed changes aim to address these disputes and provide clarity to taxpayers, reducing litigation and improving compliance.STEPS TOWARD REFORM In her July 2024 Budget speech, Sitharaman highlighted the government’s commitment to simplifying taxation. Measures like the introduction of exemption-free tax regimes for corporations and individuals have already garnered positive feedback, with 58% of corporate tax revenue in 2022-23 coming from the simplified regime. Similarly, over two-thirds of taxpayers have adopted the new system. The Income Tax Department has also received over 6,500 suggestions from stakeholders, reflecting widespread public engagement in shaping the reforms.A MORE TRANSPARENT TAX REGIME As India prepares for Budget 2025, these reforms signal a step toward a more transparent and taxpayer-friendly system. By reducing complexity and fostering clarity, the government aims to create a tax framework that promotes trust and compliance. With these anticipated changes, taxpayers can look forward to a smoother filing experience and fewer disputes.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Scheduled for presentation on January 31, a day before the budget, the Economic Survey provides essential insights into India’s economic health and sets the stage for the government’s fiscal plans.WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC SURVEY? The Economic Survey is a comprehensive review of India’s economic performance over the past fiscal year. It covers critical sectors such as agriculture, industry, and services, along with key economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, employment rates, fiscal deficit, and more. The document, prepared by the Department of Economic Affairs under the supervision of the Chief Economic Advisor, V Anantha Nageswaran, includes policy recommendations to address economic challenges and promote growth. The survey is divided into two main sections: Part A reviews the country’s economic status, focusing on current fiscal trends, while Part B addresses socio-economic issues like education, poverty, climate change, and social security. Projections for GDP, inflation, forex reserves, and trade deficits are also included. The theme of this year’s Economic Survey is expected to focus on deregulation, which will likely influence the upcoming budget discussions.WHY IS THE ECONOMIC SURVEY IMPORTANT? The Economic Survey plays a pivotal role in shaping the Union Budget by offering a clear and unbiased assessment of the economy. It aids policymakers in making informed decisions and helps stakeholders such as investors and businesses with key economic data for strategic planning. The survey is not only a pre-budget tool but also an important benchmark for evaluating economic progress and setting future growth targets.HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND CONTINUED RELEVANCE Historically, the Economic Survey was presented alongside the Union Budget, but since 1964, it has been released a day before the budget. This document continues to be essential in guiding India’s economic policy and providing transparency to the nation’s financial landscape. As we await the Union Budget 2025, the Economic Survey offers valuable foresight, shaping not just the budget but the economic roadmap for the year ahead.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Jan 8, 2025Must Watch
