Check detailsWhile a low credit score may present challenges, using strategies like reduced DTI, and showing income stability, etc. can help secure a personal loan and improve your credit for the future.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/can-you-get-a-personal-loan-with-low-credit-score-follow-these-tips-check-details-2652396-2024-12-19,"Getting a personal loan with a low credit score might seem challenging, but it’s not impossible. While most lenders prefer a credit score of 750 or above, individuals with lower scores can still secure a loan by strengthening their case in other ways.HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR OBTAINING A PERSONAL LOAN WITH A LOW CREDIT SCORE Bring in a guarantor or co-applicant
Personal loans are unsecured, meaning no collateral is required. If your credit score is below the lender’s threshold, consider involving a guarantor or co-applicant with a stable income and good credit score. This boosts your credibility and enhances your chances of approval. Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio (DTI) Your DTI ratio shows how much of your income goes toward loan repayments. If your credit score is low, keep your DTI low to show strong repayment capacity. Prove income stability
Highlight recent salary hikes or additional income sources to reassure lenders of your repayment capacity. Sharing these details can help convince them of your financial stability. Opt for a smaller loan amount
Applying for a smaller loan amount reduces the lender’s risk and increases your chances of approval. Discuss with the bank if a reduced amount aligns with your needs and eligibility. Explore secured credit options
If traditional loans seem out of reach, consider taking a secured credit card against a fixed deposit. This not only meets your credit needs but also helps build your credit score over time.WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT SCORE Make timely payments on EMIs and credit card bills. Maintain a low credit utilisation ratio. Retain old credit cards for their positive impact on your credit history. Avoid multiple credit applications simultaneously, as it signals credit-hungry behaviour. While a low credit score can be a hurdle, it’s not a deal-breaker. By leveraging strategies like involving a guarantor, reducing DTI, or showcasing income stability, you can secure a personal loan. Additionally, focus on improving your credit score to access better financial opportunities in the future. Stay proactive, and don't let a low score hold you back from reaching your financial goals!Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

This comes after reports that the coffee chain is pushing back plans for some new Starbucks store openings until later in its existing schedule. In a stock exchange filing, the company said, “This is with reference to the news article titled - “Starbucks to Exit India Due to High Costs, Bad Taste, and Mounting Losses”. The Company would like to state that the information in the said article is baseless.” According to a separate report earlier this week by news agency Reuters, fewer customers are walking into cafes, which has coerced Starbucks to recalibrate its plan to open more stores.  Tata Consumer CEO Sunil D'Souza told the news agency last week: “We will calibrate for the short term — maybe instead of opening 100, we will open 80 now, and next year we will open 120 instead of 100.” However, Starbucks is still focussed on its goal to open 1,000 stores by 2028. ""In India, good quality real estate with traffic... is a challenge,"" he said, contrasting that to the ""massive development of malls"" in China. Despite the challenges, Tata Consumer's CEO remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of their investment in coffee. In the last financial year, Starbucks reported a 12% increase in sales, reaching $143.6 million, however its net loss widened. The company's revenue in the first half of this year showed only a slight increase. According to data from business insights provider Tofler, Starbucks' revenue in the last financial year had more than doubled compared to four years ago.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

The Sensex ended 964.15 points lower at 79,218.05, while the Nifty50 settled 247.15 points lower at 23,951.70. All broader market indices finished in the red, mirroring the global market rout triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish rate stance. Sectoral indices faced intense selling pressure, with Nifty IT, Nifty Bank, and Nifty Financial Services logging steep losses. However, Nifty Pharma emerged as the session’s bright spot, gaining nearly 2% as investors sought refuge in defensive stocks amid the volatile market environment. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the market downturn to heightened concerns following the Fed's indication of prolonged higher interest rates. “The Indian market saw a widespread decline following a global sell-off driven by the US Fed’s hawkish stance on interest rates. Sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as banking and real estate, significantly bore the brunt.” Adding a note of relief, he highlighted the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) unexpected decision to keep its interest rate unchanged, which helped ease selling pressure. “Despite this, investor caution persisted amid ongoing FII selling, with a strategic shift towards defensive sectors like pharma as evidenced by their outperformance,” Nair added. As global cues remain uncertain, market participants are likely to keep a close watch on upcoming central bank announcements and inflation data to gauge future market direction.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

Mamata Machinery’s unlisted shares are trading at a premium of Rs 200 or 82.3% in the grey market as it continued to garner strong demand from investors after opening today. This sharp rise in GMP suggests that the market is optimistic about the company’s future prospects. Mamata Machinery, a leading manufacturer of packaging machines, seeks to raise Rs 179.39 crore from its offer for sale, with promoters selling up to 73.82 lakh equity shares at a face value of Rs 10 each. The price band for the IPO is set at Rs 230-243 per share, with a lot size of 61 shares. Retail investors will need a minimum of Rs 14,823 to apply for one lot, while the maximum bid will require Rs 1,92,699 for 134 lots. The subscription window will remain open until December 23, 2024, with shares expected to list on the BSE and NSE on December 27, 2024. Anand Rathi Research and Bajaj Broking have both recommended subscribing to the IPO. Analysts at Anand Rathi are confident about the company's future, citing its strong R&D investments, innovative leadership, and a healthy return on net worth of 27.4% for FY24. They believe the IPO is fairly priced relative to its peers, giving it a competitive edge. Bajaj Broking also supports the IPO from a long-term perspective. The company’s diversified revenue streams, particularly its presence across the polyester, cotton, and technical textile sectors, reduce its reliance on any single segment. Mamata Machinery’s solid financial health, consistent revenue growth, and focus on innovation and sustainability are expected to drive future growth. While Mamata Machinery’s IPO is generating strong interest, investors should consider its long-term growth potential and solid fundamentals when making a decision. The sharp rise in GMP reflects positive market sentiment, but as with any investment, careful evaluation is key.

In early trade, the S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 1,153.17 points to 79,029.03, while the Nifty also fell sharply over 200 points. At around 12:05 pm, Sensex was down 896.84 points to 79,288.13 and Nifty was trading 232.70 points lower at 23,966.25.  All the other broader market indices were also trading in negative territory. WHAT TRIGGERED THE MARKET BLOODBATH? The US Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate cut met market expectations but failed to comfort investors due to its cautious guidance. The Fed indicated only two more rate cuts in 2025, dashing hopes for a more aggressive easing cycle. This announcement triggered a Wall Street meltdown, with the Dow Jones plunging 1,123.03 points (2.6%) to 42,326.87. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also nosedived 3.6% and 3% respectively. Asian markets followed suit, with indices in Japan, China, and South Korea losing up to 1.2%. This was the key factor behind today's meltdown on Dalal Street. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital, said, ""The US Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25-point rate cut, coupled with signals of reduced future cuts, has led to a significant sell-off in global markets. This rate cut could make Indian assets less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to capital outflows."" In addition, the rupee also hit a record low today, further hurting market sentiments.  ""Additionally, the rupee's continued decline to new lows has further soured sentiment. A prolonged depreciation of the rupee could exacerbate the trade deficit and heighten inflationary pressures in the future,"" Aggarwal said. ""The higher import bill stemming from a weaker rupee adds to these concerns,"" he added.  Rising US bond yields and a stronger dollar also exacerbated concerns about capital outflows from emerging markets, including India. The dollar index surged to 108, while the US 10-year bond yield climbed to 4.5%. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out Rs 1,316.81 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday, adding pressure on the rupee, which risks further depreciation. Domestic investors stepped in, buying Rs 4,084.08 crore worth of shares, cushioning the market to some extent.WHAT NEXT?  Technical experts highlighted 23,900 on the Nifty as a crucial support level, aligning with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Analysts expect the index to stabilize between 23,800 and 23,900, with the Put-Call Ratio at 0.55 signaling an oversold market. Investor wealth eroded by Rs 6.57 lakh crore, shrinking the total market valuation to Rs 446.03 lakh crore from Rs 452.60 lakh crore the previous session, reflecting the day’s severe market carnage. ""The reduction in global growth and demand presents another challenge, with potential negative implications for pricing across key sectors. In the short term, heightened market volatility is expected,"" Aggarwal said.  He, however, highlighted that investors ""should avoid panic selling during these fluctuations and focus on fundamentally strong securities with minimal exposure to global factors"".

This decline comes after the US Federal Reserve cut key interest rates by 25 bps and signalled fewer rate cuts in 2025, putting additional strain on the currency, which has already been under pressure due to weak capital inflows and other economic challenges. The rupee dropped to 85.0650 against the US dollar in early trade, compared to 84.9525 on Wednesday. The pace of the rupee’s depreciation has accelerated recently, with the fall from Rs 84 to Rs 85 taking just two months. In contrast, the slide from Rs 83 to Rs 84 took 14 months, and it took 10 months for the rupee to weaken from Rs 82 to Rs 83. The rupee’s decline is not an isolated event, as other Asian currencies also weakened on Thursday. The Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indonesian rupiah all fell by 0.8%-1.2% during the day. The sell-off in Asian currencies followed the Federal Reserve’s latest policy guidance. The Fed’s ""dot plot,"" which outlines its rate expectations, now projects only two rate cuts in 2025, half of what was previously signalled in September. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments further added to the market’s caution. He said, ""From here, it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts.""WHAT'S DRIVING THE FALL  The rupee’s weakening has been driven by a combination of global and domestic factors. India’s economic growth slowed to a seven-quarter low in the July-September period, while the merchandise trade deficit has been widening. Capital inflows into the country have also remained subdued. Persistent strength in the US dollar has added to the rupee’s troubles. Expectations of robust US economic policies have kept the dollar strong, and the Fed’s latest guidance is expected to further boost the greenback’s value. India’s slowing economic growth has also led to speculation that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may need to cut rates soon, adding to downward pressure on the rupee. Akshay Kumar, Head of Global Markets at BNP Paribas India, noted, ""In the short term, we can expect upward pressure on USD/INR to remain."" The challenging environment for the rupee has prompted investors to raise their short positions on the currency to a two-year high, according to a recent Reuters poll. The rupee has already weakened by 2% so far this year, placing it in the middle of the performance pack among Asian currencies. Despite routine interventions by the Reserve Bank of India to stabilise the currency, analysts believe the rupee’s muted volatility of recent years may not continue in 2025.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/market-crash-dalal-street-bloodbath-3-reasons-behind-today-fall-us-fed-rate-cut-weak-rupee-2652125-2024-12-19,"The stock markets tanked in early trade on Thursday, mirroring losses in global markets, extending their losses for the fourth consecutive session. This drop followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points for the third time in a row. While the rate cut was anticipated, the Fed’s cautious outlook on further cuts disappointed investors, dampening hopes for a year-end rally. The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 1,153.17 points, or 1.44%, to 79,029.03, while the Nifty declined by 213.10 points, or 0.88%, to 23,985.75. This marked the fourth consecutive day of losses for the benchmark indices. Leading the slide, Wipro dropped 2.64% to Rs 304.35, making it the worst-performing stock on the Nifty. Other significant losers included Shriram Finance, Asian Paints, Hindalco, ONGC, Infosys, and Tata Steel, which all declined by more than 2%.GLOBAL SELL-OFF The US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates to the range of 4.25%-4.50% was in line with market expectations. However, the Fed’s guidance for only two more rate cuts in 2025—against market hopes for three or four—spooked investors. This triggered a sell-off in Wall Street, with the Dow Jones dropping 1,123.03 points (2.6%) to 42,326.87, the Nasdaq falling 716.37 points (3.6%) to 19,392.69, and the S&P 500 tumbling 178.45 points (3.0%) to 5,872.16. The cautious outlook also impacted Asian markets. Indices in Japan, China, and South Korea fell by up to 1.2%, and the sentiment carried over to Indian markets. Analysts suggest that the sharp correction may end hopes of a ""Santa rally"" in the final weeks of December.DOMESTIC CONCERNS Weak data on the domestic front added to the selling pressure. The rise in the US dollar and bond yields led to concerns about foreign outflows from Indian markets. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, reached 108. Meanwhile, the 10-year US bond yield increased to 4.5%. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers, pulling out Rs 1,316.81 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday. Analysts noted that a stronger dollar and higher bond yields typically lead to capital outflows from emerging markets, adding pressure on local currencies. The rupee is now at risk of further depreciation against the dollar, which could make Indian assets less attractive to global investors.KEY LEVELS Technical analysts highlighted critical support levels for the Nifty. Rajesh Bhosale from Angel One stated that 24,000 would act as a psychological level, while 23,900—aligned with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement—would serve as key support zones. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd, said that the Put-Call Ratio (PCR) of 0.55 indicates an oversold market. This suggests that Nifty might stabilise in the 23,800–23,900 range and trade sideways in the short term. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services explained that high market valuations require only a small trigger for a sharp correction. The Fed’s guidance, which indicated slower rate cuts in 2025, provided that trigger. Vijayakumar added that while the Fed chief’s comments about the US economy and labour market were positive, markets reacted negatively as expectations were not met. Nomura analysts had also predicted a hawkish Fed stance, expecting the pace of rate cuts to slow in the coming year. Their prediction materialised, with market sentiment turning cautious globally.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

At one point of time, the Sensex was down over 1,100 points in early trade but swiftly recovered to settle down below 900 points.  Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that when valuations are high the market needs only a trigger to correct sharply. ""This trigger was provided by the Fed guidance of fewer rate cuts in 2025, which went against market expectations. Even though the  rate cut of 25 bp was in tune with the market’s expectation, the indication of only two cuts of 25 bp each in 2025 against market expectation of three or even four cuts spooked the market resulting in a sharp sell-off in Wall Street. The Fed chief’s comments regarding the economy and the labour market are, in fact, positive, suggesting a resilient US economy. But always the market gets spooked when the reality falls short of expectations,"" he added.  India VIX, which measures market volatility, rose by 3.70%.The Nifty Midcap100 index fell 0.84%, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index declined 1.02%.  The dollar index rising above 108 and the 10-year bond yield spiking to 4.52 % are clearly negatives from the perspective of FII fund flows. But this is likely to be only temporary. ""Sharp cuts in the market today will provide opportunities for investors to buy. The broader market will be impacted less despite high valuations since the FII impact will be negligible in this segment. Therefore, there can be a sharp bounce back in growth stocks in this segment. Long-term investors, who can ignore short-term gyrations, should focus on fairly valued large-caps which will provide buying opportunities for investors who are prepared to wait,"" said Vijayakumar.

The Fed’s decision, along with its forecast of fewer rate cuts in 2025, rattled investors across the globe, leading to widespread sell-offs in equities. The US Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, bringing it to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. The move was widely anticipated; however, the Fed surprised markets by signalling a slower pace of rate cuts in the coming year. In its latest projections, the Fed halved the number of quarter-point cuts it expects in 2025, reducing them from four to just two. This unexpected shift has raised concerns that higher interest rates may persist longer than previously thought. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation has ""eased significantly"" but remains ""somewhat elevated"" compared to the central bank's target of 2%. Powell expressed optimism about the US economy, adding that the Fed is ""significantly closer"" to ending its current rate-cutting cycle.GLOBAL MARKET REACTIONS Wall Street reacted negatively to the Fed’s announcement, with all three major US indices—Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq—posting their biggest single-day losses in months. Yields on US Treasurys surged as investors adjusted to the prospect of prolonged higher interest rates. Asian markets followed suit, with major indices in the region also trading lower. Gift Nifty, an indicator for the Indian markets, was trading around 23,935—about 320 points below Nifty futures’ previous close—suggesting a gap-down opening for Indian equities.IMPACT ON SENSEX AND NIFTY The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to mirror global trends and open in the red. Market participants remain cautious about the broader implications of the Fed’s slower pace of easing, especially as inflation and global economic uncertainties persist. “Bullish sentiments took a hit after the Fed reduced its projections for rate cuts in 2025. While the 25 basis point rate cut was expected, the trimmed outlook for future cuts has upset market sentiment. Nifty’s 200-day moving average at 23,816 may come under pressure as the indices look poised for a negative opening,"" said Mehta Equities in its theme of the day for the markets. WHAT TO EXPECT Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd said that a sharp sell-off has been witnessed in global markets following a hawkish rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. ""Gift Nifty indicates a gap-down opening, continuing the three-day losing streak. The first major support to watch is the low of the December series at 23,923, with the 200-DMA around 23,800 serving as a critical support level. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) at 0.55 reflects an extremely oversold market, suggesting a possibility that Nifty could find support in the 23,923–23,800 zone and trade sideways. Overall, the market remains largely range-bound, with a focus on sector-specific and stock-specific movements,"" he added.  Investors in the Indian markets will be closely monitoring global cues, including the performance of US stock futures and Asian indices. The impact of the Fed’s decisions on foreign institutional investments (FIIs) in Indian equities will also be a key factor. While the Fed's move is seen as a step closer to ending its current rate-cutting cycle, its cautious approach has cast uncertainty over the pace of global economic recovery. Indian markets, like their global counterparts, will remain on edge as they navigate this evolving economic landscape. Dalal Street has faced a rough patch over the past few trading sessions. The benchmark indices, the S&P BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty50, extended their losses on Wednesday, leaving investors worried about their year-end performance. The Sensex dropped by 502.25 points to close at 80,182.20, while the Nifty50 declined by 137.15 points to settle at 24,198.85. Financial and banking heavyweights were among the major losers, dragging the indices down further. ""The Indian market is experiencing a breakdown in the early Santa Claus rally, with the impact being more pronounced in India compared to developed markets due to the rapid appreciation of the dollar. Market sentiment remains cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting and potential policy and tariff shifts from the incoming US administration,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

Disclose now to avoid Rs 10 lakh penaltyTaxpayers must disclose foreign income and assets by December 31, 2024, to avoid hefty penalties under the Income Tax and Black Money Acts.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/own-foreign-assets-or-income-disclose-in-itr-december-31-2024-to-avoid-rs-10-lakh-penalty-2651692-2024-12-18,"Failing to disclose foreign income and assets can land taxpayers in double trouble under both the Income Tax Act and the Black Money Act. To address widespread confusion, the Income Tax Department has released a detailed brochure on December 11, 2024, to help taxpayers navigate their disclosure obligations. With penalties and prosecution on the line, timely compliance is essential.advertisementWHO NEEDS TO REPORT AND WHAT TO DISCLOSE?All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
 The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES Taxpayers must declare foreign income and assets in the applicable ITR for the assessment year they were a resident in India. The deadlines are as follows: Original returns: File by July 31, 2024. Belated or revised returns: File by December 31, 2024. If a return has already been filed without these disclosures, taxpayers can revise their ITR using the correct form and schedules before the December deadline. Accurate documentation, such as acquisition details and income generated, is critical.CONSEQUENCES OF NON-DISCLOSURE Non-compliance can result in penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh if foreign assets exceed Rs 20 lakh (excluding immovable property). Further, prosecution under the Black Money Act could be initiated for false or incomplete disclosures. Late filers have until December 31, 2024, to submit belated or revised returns to avoid legal repercussions. Disclosing foreign income and assets not only ensures compliance with Indian tax laws but also avoids double taxation under international agreements. The Income Tax Department has simplified the process through a brochure that explains the steps to disclose and claim relief. Taxpayers should take this opportunity to file accurate returns and align with both the Income Tax Act and the Black Money Act. With heavy penalties and legal actions looming, timely disclosure isn’t just advisable—it’s indispensable for financial integrity.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch
