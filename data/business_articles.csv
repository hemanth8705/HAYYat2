Check detailsWhile a low credit score may present challenges, using strategies like reduced DTI, and showing income stability, etc. can help secure a personal loan and improve your credit for the future.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/can-you-get-a-personal-loan-with-low-credit-score-follow-these-tips-check-details-2652396-2024-12-19,"Getting a personal loan with a low credit score might seem challenging, but it’s not impossible. While most lenders prefer a credit score of 750 or above, individuals with lower scores can still secure a loan by strengthening their case in other ways.HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR OBTAINING A PERSONAL LOAN WITH A LOW CREDIT SCORE Bring in a guarantor or co-applicant
Personal loans are unsecured, meaning no collateral is required. If your credit score is below the lender’s threshold, consider involving a guarantor or co-applicant with a stable income and good credit score. This boosts your credibility and enhances your chances of approval. Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio (DTI) Your DTI ratio shows how much of your income goes toward loan repayments. If your credit score is low, keep your DTI low to show strong repayment capacity. Prove income stability
Highlight recent salary hikes or additional income sources to reassure lenders of your repayment capacity. Sharing these details can help convince them of your financial stability. Opt for a smaller loan amount
Applying for a smaller loan amount reduces the lender’s risk and increases your chances of approval. Discuss with the bank if a reduced amount aligns with your needs and eligibility. Explore secured credit options
If traditional loans seem out of reach, consider taking a secured credit card against a fixed deposit. This not only meets your credit needs but also helps build your credit score over time.WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT SCORE Make timely payments on EMIs and credit card bills. Maintain a low credit utilisation ratio. Retain old credit cards for their positive impact on your credit history. Avoid multiple credit applications simultaneously, as it signals credit-hungry behaviour. While a low credit score can be a hurdle, it’s not a deal-breaker. By leveraging strategies like involving a guarantor, reducing DTI, or showcasing income stability, you can secure a personal loan. Additionally, focus on improving your credit score to access better financial opportunities in the future. Stay proactive, and don't let a low score hold you back from reaching your financial goals!Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

This comes after reports that the coffee chain is pushing back plans for some new Starbucks store openings until later in its existing schedule. In a stock exchange filing, the company said, “This is with reference to the news article titled - “Starbucks to Exit India Due to High Costs, Bad Taste, and Mounting Losses”. The Company would like to state that the information in the said article is baseless.” According to a separate report earlier this week by news agency Reuters, fewer customers are walking into cafes, which has coerced Starbucks to recalibrate its plan to open more stores.  Tata Consumer CEO Sunil D'Souza told the news agency last week: “We will calibrate for the short term — maybe instead of opening 100, we will open 80 now, and next year we will open 120 instead of 100.” However, Starbucks is still focussed on its goal to open 1,000 stores by 2028. ""In India, good quality real estate with traffic... is a challenge,"" he said, contrasting that to the ""massive development of malls"" in China. Despite the challenges, Tata Consumer's CEO remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of their investment in coffee. In the last financial year, Starbucks reported a 12% increase in sales, reaching $143.6 million, however its net loss widened. The company's revenue in the first half of this year showed only a slight increase. According to data from business insights provider Tofler, Starbucks' revenue in the last financial year had more than doubled compared to four years ago.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

The Sensex ended 964.15 points lower at 79,218.05, while the Nifty50 settled 247.15 points lower at 23,951.70. All broader market indices finished in the red, mirroring the global market rout triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish rate stance. Sectoral indices faced intense selling pressure, with Nifty IT, Nifty Bank, and Nifty Financial Services logging steep losses. However, Nifty Pharma emerged as the session’s bright spot, gaining nearly 2% as investors sought refuge in defensive stocks amid the volatile market environment. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the market downturn to heightened concerns following the Fed's indication of prolonged higher interest rates. “The Indian market saw a widespread decline following a global sell-off driven by the US Fed’s hawkish stance on interest rates. Sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as banking and real estate, significantly bore the brunt.” Adding a note of relief, he highlighted the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) unexpected decision to keep its interest rate unchanged, which helped ease selling pressure. “Despite this, investor caution persisted amid ongoing FII selling, with a strategic shift towards defensive sectors like pharma as evidenced by their outperformance,” Nair added. As global cues remain uncertain, market participants are likely to keep a close watch on upcoming central bank announcements and inflation data to gauge future market direction.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

Mamata Machinery’s unlisted shares are trading at a premium of Rs 200 or 82.3% in the grey market as it continued to garner strong demand from investors after opening today. This sharp rise in GMP suggests that the market is optimistic about the company’s future prospects. Mamata Machinery, a leading manufacturer of packaging machines, seeks to raise Rs 179.39 crore from its offer for sale, with promoters selling up to 73.82 lakh equity shares at a face value of Rs 10 each. The price band for the IPO is set at Rs 230-243 per share, with a lot size of 61 shares. Retail investors will need a minimum of Rs 14,823 to apply for one lot, while the maximum bid will require Rs 1,92,699 for 134 lots. The subscription window will remain open until December 23, 2024, with shares expected to list on the BSE and NSE on December 27, 2024. Anand Rathi Research and Bajaj Broking have both recommended subscribing to the IPO. Analysts at Anand Rathi are confident about the company's future, citing its strong R&D investments, innovative leadership, and a healthy return on net worth of 27.4% for FY24. They believe the IPO is fairly priced relative to its peers, giving it a competitive edge. Bajaj Broking also supports the IPO from a long-term perspective. The company’s diversified revenue streams, particularly its presence across the polyester, cotton, and technical textile sectors, reduce its reliance on any single segment. Mamata Machinery’s solid financial health, consistent revenue growth, and focus on innovation and sustainability are expected to drive future growth. While Mamata Machinery’s IPO is generating strong interest, investors should consider its long-term growth potential and solid fundamentals when making a decision. The sharp rise in GMP reflects positive market sentiment, but as with any investment, careful evaluation is key.

In early trade, the S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 1,153.17 points to 79,029.03, while the Nifty also fell sharply over 200 points. At around 12:05 pm, Sensex was down 896.84 points to 79,288.13 and Nifty was trading 232.70 points lower at 23,966.25.  All the other broader market indices were also trading in negative territory. WHAT TRIGGERED THE MARKET BLOODBATH? The US Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate cut met market expectations but failed to comfort investors due to its cautious guidance. The Fed indicated only two more rate cuts in 2025, dashing hopes for a more aggressive easing cycle. This announcement triggered a Wall Street meltdown, with the Dow Jones plunging 1,123.03 points (2.6%) to 42,326.87. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also nosedived 3.6% and 3% respectively. Asian markets followed suit, with indices in Japan, China, and South Korea losing up to 1.2%. This was the key factor behind today's meltdown on Dalal Street. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital, said, ""The US Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25-point rate cut, coupled with signals of reduced future cuts, has led to a significant sell-off in global markets. This rate cut could make Indian assets less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to capital outflows."" In addition, the rupee also hit a record low today, further hurting market sentiments.  ""Additionally, the rupee's continued decline to new lows has further soured sentiment. A prolonged depreciation of the rupee could exacerbate the trade deficit and heighten inflationary pressures in the future,"" Aggarwal said. ""The higher import bill stemming from a weaker rupee adds to these concerns,"" he added.  Rising US bond yields and a stronger dollar also exacerbated concerns about capital outflows from emerging markets, including India. The dollar index surged to 108, while the US 10-year bond yield climbed to 4.5%. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out Rs 1,316.81 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday, adding pressure on the rupee, which risks further depreciation. Domestic investors stepped in, buying Rs 4,084.08 crore worth of shares, cushioning the market to some extent.WHAT NEXT?  Technical experts highlighted 23,900 on the Nifty as a crucial support level, aligning with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Analysts expect the index to stabilize between 23,800 and 23,900, with the Put-Call Ratio at 0.55 signaling an oversold market. Investor wealth eroded by Rs 6.57 lakh crore, shrinking the total market valuation to Rs 446.03 lakh crore from Rs 452.60 lakh crore the previous session, reflecting the day’s severe market carnage. ""The reduction in global growth and demand presents another challenge, with potential negative implications for pricing across key sectors. In the short term, heightened market volatility is expected,"" Aggarwal said.  He, however, highlighted that investors ""should avoid panic selling during these fluctuations and focus on fundamentally strong securities with minimal exposure to global factors"".

This decline comes after the US Federal Reserve cut key interest rates by 25 bps and signalled fewer rate cuts in 2025, putting additional strain on the currency, which has already been under pressure due to weak capital inflows and other economic challenges. The rupee dropped to 85.0650 against the US dollar in early trade, compared to 84.9525 on Wednesday. The pace of the rupee’s depreciation has accelerated recently, with the fall from Rs 84 to Rs 85 taking just two months. In contrast, the slide from Rs 83 to Rs 84 took 14 months, and it took 10 months for the rupee to weaken from Rs 82 to Rs 83. The rupee’s decline is not an isolated event, as other Asian currencies also weakened on Thursday. The Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indonesian rupiah all fell by 0.8%-1.2% during the day. The sell-off in Asian currencies followed the Federal Reserve’s latest policy guidance. The Fed’s ""dot plot,"" which outlines its rate expectations, now projects only two rate cuts in 2025, half of what was previously signalled in September. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments further added to the market’s caution. He said, ""From here, it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts.""WHAT'S DRIVING THE FALL  The rupee’s weakening has been driven by a combination of global and domestic factors. India’s economic growth slowed to a seven-quarter low in the July-September period, while the merchandise trade deficit has been widening. Capital inflows into the country have also remained subdued. Persistent strength in the US dollar has added to the rupee’s troubles. Expectations of robust US economic policies have kept the dollar strong, and the Fed’s latest guidance is expected to further boost the greenback’s value. India’s slowing economic growth has also led to speculation that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may need to cut rates soon, adding to downward pressure on the rupee. Akshay Kumar, Head of Global Markets at BNP Paribas India, noted, ""In the short term, we can expect upward pressure on USD/INR to remain."" The challenging environment for the rupee has prompted investors to raise their short positions on the currency to a two-year high, according to a recent Reuters poll. The rupee has already weakened by 2% so far this year, placing it in the middle of the performance pack among Asian currencies. Despite routine interventions by the Reserve Bank of India to stabilise the currency, analysts believe the rupee’s muted volatility of recent years may not continue in 2025.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/market-crash-dalal-street-bloodbath-3-reasons-behind-today-fall-us-fed-rate-cut-weak-rupee-2652125-2024-12-19,"The stock markets tanked in early trade on Thursday, mirroring losses in global markets, extending their losses for the fourth consecutive session. This drop followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points for the third time in a row. While the rate cut was anticipated, the Fed’s cautious outlook on further cuts disappointed investors, dampening hopes for a year-end rally. The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 1,153.17 points, or 1.44%, to 79,029.03, while the Nifty declined by 213.10 points, or 0.88%, to 23,985.75. This marked the fourth consecutive day of losses for the benchmark indices. Leading the slide, Wipro dropped 2.64% to Rs 304.35, making it the worst-performing stock on the Nifty. Other significant losers included Shriram Finance, Asian Paints, Hindalco, ONGC, Infosys, and Tata Steel, which all declined by more than 2%.GLOBAL SELL-OFF The US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates to the range of 4.25%-4.50% was in line with market expectations. However, the Fed’s guidance for only two more rate cuts in 2025—against market hopes for three or four—spooked investors. This triggered a sell-off in Wall Street, with the Dow Jones dropping 1,123.03 points (2.6%) to 42,326.87, the Nasdaq falling 716.37 points (3.6%) to 19,392.69, and the S&P 500 tumbling 178.45 points (3.0%) to 5,872.16. The cautious outlook also impacted Asian markets. Indices in Japan, China, and South Korea fell by up to 1.2%, and the sentiment carried over to Indian markets. Analysts suggest that the sharp correction may end hopes of a ""Santa rally"" in the final weeks of December.DOMESTIC CONCERNS Weak data on the domestic front added to the selling pressure. The rise in the US dollar and bond yields led to concerns about foreign outflows from Indian markets. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, reached 108. Meanwhile, the 10-year US bond yield increased to 4.5%. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers, pulling out Rs 1,316.81 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday. Analysts noted that a stronger dollar and higher bond yields typically lead to capital outflows from emerging markets, adding pressure on local currencies. The rupee is now at risk of further depreciation against the dollar, which could make Indian assets less attractive to global investors.KEY LEVELS Technical analysts highlighted critical support levels for the Nifty. Rajesh Bhosale from Angel One stated that 24,000 would act as a psychological level, while 23,900—aligned with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement—would serve as key support zones. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd, said that the Put-Call Ratio (PCR) of 0.55 indicates an oversold market. This suggests that Nifty might stabilise in the 23,800–23,900 range and trade sideways in the short term. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services explained that high market valuations require only a small trigger for a sharp correction. The Fed’s guidance, which indicated slower rate cuts in 2025, provided that trigger. Vijayakumar added that while the Fed chief’s comments about the US economy and labour market were positive, markets reacted negatively as expectations were not met. Nomura analysts had also predicted a hawkish Fed stance, expecting the pace of rate cuts to slow in the coming year. Their prediction materialised, with market sentiment turning cautious globally.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

At one point of time, the Sensex was down over 1,100 points in early trade but swiftly recovered to settle down below 900 points.  Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that when valuations are high the market needs only a trigger to correct sharply. ""This trigger was provided by the Fed guidance of fewer rate cuts in 2025, which went against market expectations. Even though the  rate cut of 25 bp was in tune with the market’s expectation, the indication of only two cuts of 25 bp each in 2025 against market expectation of three or even four cuts spooked the market resulting in a sharp sell-off in Wall Street. The Fed chief’s comments regarding the economy and the labour market are, in fact, positive, suggesting a resilient US economy. But always the market gets spooked when the reality falls short of expectations,"" he added.  India VIX, which measures market volatility, rose by 3.70%.The Nifty Midcap100 index fell 0.84%, while the Nifty Smallcap100 index declined 1.02%.  The dollar index rising above 108 and the 10-year bond yield spiking to 4.52 % are clearly negatives from the perspective of FII fund flows. But this is likely to be only temporary. ""Sharp cuts in the market today will provide opportunities for investors to buy. The broader market will be impacted less despite high valuations since the FII impact will be negligible in this segment. Therefore, there can be a sharp bounce back in growth stocks in this segment. Long-term investors, who can ignore short-term gyrations, should focus on fairly valued large-caps which will provide buying opportunities for investors who are prepared to wait,"" said Vijayakumar.

The Fed’s decision, along with its forecast of fewer rate cuts in 2025, rattled investors across the globe, leading to widespread sell-offs in equities. The US Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, bringing it to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. The move was widely anticipated; however, the Fed surprised markets by signalling a slower pace of rate cuts in the coming year. In its latest projections, the Fed halved the number of quarter-point cuts it expects in 2025, reducing them from four to just two. This unexpected shift has raised concerns that higher interest rates may persist longer than previously thought. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation has ""eased significantly"" but remains ""somewhat elevated"" compared to the central bank's target of 2%. Powell expressed optimism about the US economy, adding that the Fed is ""significantly closer"" to ending its current rate-cutting cycle.GLOBAL MARKET REACTIONS Wall Street reacted negatively to the Fed’s announcement, with all three major US indices—Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq—posting their biggest single-day losses in months. Yields on US Treasurys surged as investors adjusted to the prospect of prolonged higher interest rates. Asian markets followed suit, with major indices in the region also trading lower. Gift Nifty, an indicator for the Indian markets, was trading around 23,935—about 320 points below Nifty futures’ previous close—suggesting a gap-down opening for Indian equities.IMPACT ON SENSEX AND NIFTY The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to mirror global trends and open in the red. Market participants remain cautious about the broader implications of the Fed’s slower pace of easing, especially as inflation and global economic uncertainties persist. “Bullish sentiments took a hit after the Fed reduced its projections for rate cuts in 2025. While the 25 basis point rate cut was expected, the trimmed outlook for future cuts has upset market sentiment. Nifty’s 200-day moving average at 23,816 may come under pressure as the indices look poised for a negative opening,"" said Mehta Equities in its theme of the day for the markets. WHAT TO EXPECT Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd said that a sharp sell-off has been witnessed in global markets following a hawkish rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. ""Gift Nifty indicates a gap-down opening, continuing the three-day losing streak. The first major support to watch is the low of the December series at 23,923, with the 200-DMA around 23,800 serving as a critical support level. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) at 0.55 reflects an extremely oversold market, suggesting a possibility that Nifty could find support in the 23,923–23,800 zone and trade sideways. Overall, the market remains largely range-bound, with a focus on sector-specific and stock-specific movements,"" he added.  Investors in the Indian markets will be closely monitoring global cues, including the performance of US stock futures and Asian indices. The impact of the Fed’s decisions on foreign institutional investments (FIIs) in Indian equities will also be a key factor. While the Fed's move is seen as a step closer to ending its current rate-cutting cycle, its cautious approach has cast uncertainty over the pace of global economic recovery. Indian markets, like their global counterparts, will remain on edge as they navigate this evolving economic landscape. Dalal Street has faced a rough patch over the past few trading sessions. The benchmark indices, the S&P BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty50, extended their losses on Wednesday, leaving investors worried about their year-end performance. The Sensex dropped by 502.25 points to close at 80,182.20, while the Nifty50 declined by 137.15 points to settle at 24,198.85. Financial and banking heavyweights were among the major losers, dragging the indices down further. ""The Indian market is experiencing a breakdown in the early Santa Claus rally, with the impact being more pronounced in India compared to developed markets due to the rapid appreciation of the dollar. Market sentiment remains cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting and potential policy and tariff shifts from the incoming US administration,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 19, 2024

To address widespread confusion, the Income Tax Department has released a detailed brochure on December 11, 2024, to help taxpayers navigate their disclosure obligations. With penalties and prosecution on the line, timely compliance is essential.advertisementWHO NEEDS TO REPORT AND WHAT TO DISCLOSE?All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES All Indian residents with foreign income or assets must report them in their Income Tax Returns (ITR). This includes:
Foreign bank accounts, equity, debt interests, business interests, immovable property, and other assets.
Foreign income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and other earnings.
 The applicable schedules for reporting are Schedule FA (foreign assets), Schedule FSI (foreign income), and Schedule TR (tax relief). It must be noted that ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms cannot be used for these disclosures.STEPS FOR FILING AND DEADLINES Taxpayers must declare foreign income and assets in the applicable ITR for the assessment year they were a resident in India. The deadlines are as follows: Original returns: File by July 31, 2024. Belated or revised returns: File by December 31, 2024. If a return has already been filed without these disclosures, taxpayers can revise their ITR using the correct form and schedules before the December deadline. Accurate documentation, such as acquisition details and income generated, is critical.CONSEQUENCES OF NON-DISCLOSURE Non-compliance can result in penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh if foreign assets exceed Rs 20 lakh (excluding immovable property). Further, prosecution under the Black Money Act could be initiated for false or incomplete disclosures. Late filers have until December 31, 2024, to submit belated or revised returns to avoid legal repercussions. Disclosing foreign income and assets not only ensures compliance with Indian tax laws but also avoids double taxation under international agreements. The Income Tax Department has simplified the process through a brochure that explains the steps to disclose and claim relief. Taxpayers should take this opportunity to file accurate returns and align with both the Income Tax Act and the Black Money Act. With heavy penalties and legal actions looming, timely disclosure isn’t just advisable—it’s indispensable for financial integrity.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

At 10:28 am, the S&P BSE Sensex fell 274.86 points to 78,943.19, while the NSE Nifty50 dropped 67.90 points to 23,883.80. Broader market indices also traded in the red as volatility spiked, pressuring blue-chip stocks. Nifty50’s top losers included Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra, Ultratech Cement, M&M, and Shriram Finance. Meanwhile, Dr Reddy’s, Titan, NTPC, Hindalco, and Power Grid emerged as the session’s top gainers. Meanwhile, the rupee hit a fresh record low of 85.10 against the US dollar, raising concerns about potential foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “FII buying seen in early December is reversing, with this week’s selling reaching Rs 12,229 crore. This shift is impacting large-cap stocks, particularly in the financial sector.” He advised retail investors to adopt a contrarian strategy, noting, “Quality large-caps will likely bounce back soon.” He also highlighted the resilience of pharma stocks and projected strength in IT, citing positive results from Accenture and the growing profitability of generative AI services. The recent sell-off comes after the Fed’s 25-basis-point rate cut and a reduced forecast for interest rate reductions in 2025.

The rupee surpassed its previous low of 85.0850 reached on Thursday and settled at 85.10 by 10:00 am. Traders reported state-run banks offering dollars, likely on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which helped limit further depreciation. Despite the intervention, the rupee remained under pressure due to several domestic and global factors.WHAT'S BEHIND THE RUPEE'S DECLINE?  India's economic growth slowing to a seven-quarter low and a widened merchandise trade deficit have raised concerns among investors. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve’s projection of fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid sticky inflation has strengthened the US dollar, making emerging market currencies like the rupee more vulnerable. “Higher trade deficit along with slow growth figures puts the rupee on test with outflows from domestic equity markets. For USD/INR, positionally 84.70 now acts as a good base while the door remains open for 85.50 levels,"" Kunal Sodhani, Vice President at Shinhan Bank India, told news agency Reuters.  The dollar index hovered near a two-year high of 108.4 after stronger-than-expected US GDP growth and a sharp decline in weekly jobless claims boosted confidence in the US economy. Foreign investors also contributed to the rupee's woes, selling nearly $500 million worth of Indian stocks on Thursday. However, routine interventions by the RBI have kept the rupee’s volatility relatively lower than that of its Asian counterparts. Investors now await the US core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation data, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, due later on Friday, which could further influence currency markets.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Must Watch

Despite initial reservations about market timing and potential risks for customers, Kamath emphasised the growing demand and the business need to offer MTF. Sharing the news on X, Nithin Kamath said, “I don't know if it is a good time with the fall in the markets, but we are finally launching MTF, which allows you to buy stocks for delivery by borrowing money from us.” He added, “I haven't been sure about this product for a long time because of obvious reasons. Customers who trade for delivery tend to ignore the impact of the cost of borrowing, and there's always the risk of the trade going against them, which leads to a bigger loss.” Talking about the growth of MTF in the last few years, he said, ""But in the last 3 to 4 years, MTF has grown tremendously, with pretty much everyone offering it. Considering the number of customers asking us for the feature, it didn't make business sense for us to not offer it.""
 


WHAT IS MTF?The Margin Trading Facility (MTF) enables investors to trade with leverage, allowing them to buy stocks for delivery even if they don’t have the full amount upfront. Investors can borrow up to 80% of the stock's value, depending on the stock.In simpler words, through MTF, investors pay only a portion of the total stock value, with the broker funding the remainder as a loan. Interest is charged on the borrowed amount, making MTF a strategic yet cost-sensitive trading option.HOW DOES MTF WORK? The Margin Trading Facility (MTF) enables investors to trade with leverage, allowing them to buy stocks for delivery even if they don’t have the full amount upfront. Investors can borrow up to 80% of the stock's value, depending on the stock. In simpler words, through MTF, investors pay only a portion of the total stock value, with the broker funding the remainder as a loan. Interest is charged on the borrowed amount, making MTF a strategic yet cost-sensitive trading option.HOW DOES MTF WORK? MTF allows investors to purchase stocks for delivery with leverage, enabling them to trade even if they don’t have the full amount. Up to 80% of the stock value can be borrowed, subject to an interest rate of 0.04% per day (Rs. 40 per lakh). For example, if you want to buy shares worth Rs. 400 but have only Rs. 100, you can use MTF. Providing 25% of the total value as your initial investment, the broker funds the remaining Rs. 300, allowing you to purchase shares worth Rs. 400. The stocks must be pledged with the broker as per Sebi guidelines.WEIGHING THE REWARDS AND RISKS MTF can amplify your returns. If a stock you buy for Rs. 400 rises to Rs. 450, your profit of Rs. 50 translates to a 50% return on your Rs. 100 investment. However, if the price drops to Rs. 350, you lose Rs. 50, eroding 50% of your investment. While MTF offers the potential for higher gains, it also comes with increased risks due to leveraged trading and borrowing costs. The Margin Trading Facility can be a powerful tool for maximising limited funds, but it demands responsible usage. Stay informed, diversify your investments, monitor balances, and have a clear exit strategy to navigate risks effectively and unlock the full potential of this feature.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Higher returns often come with elevated risks, while safer options yield modest rewards. For those willing to embrace calculated risks, market-linked investments like equities offer a promising route to wealth creation over time. Amongst all asset classes, equities have historically delivered inflation-beating returns, making them a preferred choice for long-term investors. Alternatives like real estate and gold can also offer substantial returns, but factors such as low liquidity and transactional complexities often give equities an edge. Here are five high-return investment avenues to consider: Direct equity
Buying stocks directly on exchanges like BSE or NSE lets investors participate in corporate growth. Diversification across sectors and market caps is crucial to mitigate risks.
However, high volatility and the potential for significant capital loss demand thorough research. Initial public offerings (IPOs)
IPOs allow investors to purchase shares during a company’s debut on the stock market. After listing, these shares trade in the secondary market.
However, IPO allotment is uncertain, and listing prices can be unpredictable due to market dynamics. Mid- and small-cap equity funds
These funds focus on smaller companies with growth potential. SEBI mandates a minimum of 65% allocation to equities for such schemes.
However, higher market volatility and limited liquidity make these funds suitable for risk-tolerant investors. Equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS)
ELSS combines equity investments with tax-saving benefits, featuring a mandatory three-year lock-in period.
However, performance post-lock-in can vary, requiring periodic reviews. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending
This digital platform connects borrowers and investors, offering attractive interest rates.
However, loans are unsecured, increasing the chance of defaults. Navigating the world of investments is about aligning your financial goals with your risk appetite. Whether you choose equities, real estate, or innovative options like P2P lending, staying informed and diversifying your portfolio can help you turn risks into rewards.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Benchmark stock market indices fell sharply during Friday’s trading session, extending their weak run throughout the week. The sharp decline was driven by weak global cues, persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) selling, and a steep slide in information technology (IT) stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex ended 1,176.46 points lower at 78,041.59, while the NSE Nifty50 settled 364.20 points lower at 23,587.50. All broader market indices also fell as volatility spiked following the US Federal Reserve’s recent commentary on rate cuts. Renewed FII selling further weighed on sentiment, with this week’s outflows reaching Rs 12,229 crore. The Nifty IT index tumbled nearly 2.7% and emerged as the top loser among sectoral indices. Major IT stocks such as Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and TCS declined in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Other key sectoral indices like Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services also saw sharp losses. The top five losers on the Nifty50 were Tech Mahindra, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, M&M, and Trent. On the flip side, the top gainers included Dr Reddy’s, JSW Steel, ICICI Bank, Nestle India, and HDFC Life. Broader weakness in Asian markets, triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s downward revision of its 2025 interest rate-cut forecast, added to the pressure on domestic stocks. The Fed's decision dampened market sentiment, particularly impacting IT stocks, which have significant exposure to US clients. “The negative reaction to the Fed’s commentary is temporary,” said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “Quality large-cap stocks are likely to bounce back soon, offering a buying opportunity for retail investors.” While market volatility may persist in the near term due to global uncertainties and continued FII selling, experts believe a recovery led by large-cap stocks is possible in the coming sessions.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Must Watch

The BSE Sensex plummeted over 4,000 points across five consecutive sessions, while the NSE Nifty50 fell approximately 1,200 points, representing a nearly 5% loss within the week. The ongoing selloff has been fuelled by several factors, including hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve, aggressive selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), and concerns over high valuations in the Indian stock market. Adding to investor unease, sluggish corporate earnings growth has further dampened market sentiment, reducing hopes for a quick recovery. On December 20, the NSE Nifty dropped more than 400 points before closing at 23,587, down 1.5%. The BSE Sensex, which fell about 1,350 points intraday, ended the session 1,176 points lower at 78,042. Since its recent swing high on December 13, the Nifty has lost nearly 5% of its value.US FED'S HAWKISH SIGNALS  The US Federal Reserve implemented a 25 basis points rate cut this week, a move widely anticipated by the markets. However, its guidance for only two rate cuts in 2025 fell short of expectations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted persistent inflationary risks, revising the 2025 inflation forecast upward. This cautious outlook sent shockwaves through global markets, including India’s. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said, “Disappointment over slower-than-expected rate cuts by the Fed has affected global sentiment. This bearish view is amplified in India, where high valuations and low earnings growth are already concerns.”FII SELLING RESUMES Foreign institutional investors, who had been net buyers earlier this month, sold Rs 12,230 crore worth of Indian equities over the past four sessions. A strong US dollar, coupled with attractive US bond yields at around 4.52%, has diverted funds away from emerging markets. ""With weak earnings growth, FIIs have few incentives to invest in India for now,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit.CONCERNS OVER TECHNICAL LEVELS  The Nifty fell below its 200-day moving average (23,870) on Thursday, intensifying the selling pressure. On Friday, the breach of support at 23,850 opened the door for further downside, with analysts eyeing levels of 23,500.WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO?  While the ongoing correction has made select large-cap stocks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank more attractive, experts advise caution. The FMCG sector remains expensive, and broader sentiment is expected to stay subdued until February’s RBI policy meeting. Investors are urged to focus on quality stocks and wait for greater market stability.

With this scheme, taxpayers can clear pending tax liabilities by paying the disputed amount along with a specified additional percentage, while enjoying the waiver of interest and penalties. Designed to reduce litigation and streamline tax resolution, the Income Tax Department has issued new FAQs to clarify eligibility and procedures. Let’s have a closer look at some of these FAQs. Can a taxpayer file a declaration under the DTVSV (Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme), 2024 if their appeal was disposed of on merits or dismissed as withdrawn before filing the declaration, for the purposes of the scheme?
Yes, such cases are eligible for settlement under the scheme, as the appeal was pending on 22nd July 2024. The disputed tax will be calculated as if the appeal had not yet been disposed of on that date. Is a case eligible for settlement if a taxpayer has filed a declaration in Form-I, and the appeal is disposed of by the concerned authority after the declaration?
Yes, this case is also eligible for settlement. If the time limit for filing an appeal expired before July 22, 2024, but an appeal with an application for condonation of delay was filed after this date, can the taxpayer opt for the scheme in this case?
No, the appeal must be pending as of July 22, 2024, for a taxpayer to be eligible for the scheme. Therefore, such cases will not be eligible. If an appeal and an application for condonation of delay were both filed before July 22, 2024, and the appeal was admitted after the condonation of delay before filing the declaration under the scheme, can the taxpayer opt for the scheme?
Yes, the taxpayer can opt for settlement under the scheme in such cases. Is an appeal filed against intimation under section 143(1) of the Act and pending as of July 22, 2024, eligible for the DTVSV Scheme 2024?
Yes, any appeal filed against intimation under section 143(1) of the Act and pending as of July 22, 2024, is eligible for settlement under the scheme. Are cases with pending review petitions before the High Courts or Supreme Court eligible for settlement under the DTVSV Scheme 2024?
No, the pendency of a review petition does not equate to the pendency of an appeal before the High Courts, and therefore, it does not count as an appeal pending for the purposes of the scheme. Can the DTVSV Scheme 2024 be availed in cases where proceedings are pending before the Income Tax Settlement Commission (ITSC) or where a writ has been filed against an order of the ITSC?
No, the scheme cannot be availed in these cases. The Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme 2024 offers a unique opportunity for taxpayers to settle their pending income tax disputes in a streamlined manner, helping to reduce litigation and providing financial relief. By addressing key questions about eligibility, the Income Tax Department has provided much-needed clarity. However, taxpayers should carefully assess their individual circumstances and stay informed about the specific requirements to make the most of this valuable scheme. With the right guidance, this initiative could pave the way for quicker, stress-free resolutions of tax disputes.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

A wide range of proposals, from essential services to luxury items, are under discussion, some of which could significantly impact consumers and businesses.LUXURY ITEMS UNDER SPOTLIGHT Luxury items are under the spotlight, with a proposal to increase GST on high-end products. Wristwatches priced above Rs 25,000 and shoes costing over Rs 15,000 per pair may soon attract a 28% GST, up from the current 18%. Additionally, changes in the tax structure for readymade garments have been proposed. Garments priced below â‚¹1,500 are expected to remain at 5%, while those priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 10,000 may see a jump to 18%. Premium garments above Rs 10,000 could face a steep 28% tax. These changes aim to rationalise rates and align taxation with the pricing structure of luxury goods.FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS In a move to ease costs for food delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato, the GST rate may be reduced from 18% with input tax credit (ITC) to a simpler 5% without ITC. This could lower delivery charges, benefiting end consumers. The measure also seeks to address the disparity in tax burdens between dining in and ordering food.GST ON INSURANCE PLATFORMS The meeting has taken up proposals to reform GST on insurance premiums, especially to benefit senior citizens and essential health cover. The Group of Ministers (GoM) has recommended exempting health insurance plans with â‚¹5 lakh coverage, term life insurance, and certain senior citizen-focused policies from GST. Currently, health and life insurance premiums attract an 18% GST rate, while endowment and annuity plans face differential rates. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has underscored the need for exemptions, citing international practices where insurance products are largely tax-free. The proposed reforms could make health and term insurance more accessible, particularly for marginalized groups.AVIATION TURBINE FUEL UNDER GST The council is also considering bringing Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) under the GST regime. This longstanding demand from the aviation industry would allow airlines to claim input tax credit, potentially reducing operational costs. However, this proposal may face resistance from states due to revenue concerns. Meanwhile, a broad set of 148 items, including compact vehicles and pre-owned electric vehicles, may see tax increases. These items are proposed to move from the 12% to the 18% GST bracket, aligning with ongoing efforts to rationalise rates.OTHER POSSIBLE DELIBERATIONS The four-tier GST structure will remain unchanged, but discussions on introducing a 35% rate for sin goods, alongside extensions to the GST compensation cess regime, signal the council’s intent to fine-tune the tax system. While the council's decisions are expected to balance revenue generation with consumer relief, consensus remains critical to implementing these sweeping changes. The meeting's outcomes could reshape taxation across sectors, influencing consumer choices and industry practices in the coming months.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

One of the key items on the agenda is the proposal to reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on insurance premiums, a move that could bring relief to policyholders. A Group of Ministers (GoM) set up by the Council, led by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, has already made progress on this matter. In its meeting last month, the GoM recommended exempting term life insurance premiums from GST, a proposal that has garnered support from several states. Additionally, the GoM has suggested that premiums paid by senior citizens for health insurance should be exempt from the tax, which could benefit a significant portion of the population. There is also a proposal to exempt GST on health insurance premiums of up to Rs 5 lakh, paid by individuals who are not senior citizens. This move, if approved, would make health insurance more affordable for a broader section of the population, especially as medical costs continue to rise.WHAT ELSE IS ON THE AGENDA?  While these changes seem to have strong backing, the Council may defer decisions on other major tax reforms, such as a higher tax on so-called sin goods like tobacco and alcohol. States are still divided on the proposal to increase taxes on these products, and a final decision may take more time. The upcoming decision on insurance premiums is significant not only for policyholders but also for the broader insurance sector. A lower tax burden could encourage more people to opt for insurance, increasing the penetration of life and health coverage in India. As the GST Council continues to evaluate various options, the focus on insurance premiums reflects the government’s ongoing efforts to make essential services more affordable, especially for vulnerable groups like senior citizens. With most states in favor of tax reductions, a positive outcome for policyholders seems likely.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

During the 55th meeting held on Saturday, technical considerations led to the deferral, with the Group of Ministers (GoM) tasked to conduct further deliberations. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman chaired the meeting, which concluded that additional discussions were needed before finalising any changes. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, who leads the GoM on insurance, stated that more time is required to resolve outstanding issues, particularly regarding the taxation of group policies, individual policies, and senior citizens' plans. A subsequent GoM meeting is scheduled for January to finalise these discussions. In November, the GoM recommended certain reforms, including exempting premiums paid for term life insurance policies from GST. Similarly, health insurance premiums paid by senior citizens were proposed for exemption, alongside those up to Rs 5 lakh for non-senior citizens. However, premiums exceeding Rs 5 lakh will continue to be taxed at 18%. The delay reflects the need for further technical assessment, as there are varying opinions among states about these proposed changes. With most states supporting the notion of reducing the tax burden, a positive resolution remains a likely outcome, albeit requiring additional time for consensus.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Must Watch

The GST Council in its 55th meeting also decided to clarify on taxability of popcorn, saying caramelised popcorn will continue to attract tax at the rate of 18 per cent. However, pre-packed and spiced popcorn will attract 12 per cent, while 5 per cent will be levied on unpacked and unlabelled ones. It has been decided to regularise the issues for the past on ""as is where is"" basis... ""It is a clarification being recommended by the GST Council to settle the disputes arising out of interpretation,"" an official statement said. The panel, headed by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising representatives of all states and UTs, deferred decisions on reducing tax rate on insurance products as also on levy of the tax on food delivery by app-based platforms. The panel cut the tax rate on fortified rice kernels used for public distribution to 5 per cent from 18 per cent, Sitharaman told reporters after the meeting of the Council here. The Council also decided that no GST will be payable on penal charges levied and collected by banks and NBFCs from borrowers for non-compliance with loan terms. The panel deferred a decision on reducing the rate of tax on insurance premium, pending comments of the sector regulator, she said. A group of ministers examining the issue had recommended exempting insurance premiums paid for term life insurance policies from GST and premium paid by senior citizens for health insurance cover. It had also suggested GST exemption on premium paid by individuals, other than senior citizens, for health insurance with coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh. Alongside, the GoM on rate rationalisation, which is looking at tweaking rates on 148 items, will be given more time to arrive at a decision. The finance minister said the council decided to raise the rate of tax to 18 per cent from 12 per cent on all used EV sales, just as in case of non-electric vehicles, and it will be applicable only on the value that represents margin - the difference between the purchase price and selling price (depreciated value if depreciation is claimed) - by businesses. Sale and purchase of used vehicles by individuals will continue to be exempt from GST. Without naming any state, she said the states wanted to continue to keep aviation turbine fuel (ATF), used in aircraft, out of the goods and services tax (GST). When the GST subsumed more than a dozen central and state levies into GST in July 2017, five products - crude oil, petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas - were kept out of its purview. The central government levies excise duty on them and states levy VAT. ""Every state clearly said that ATF should not come into GST... States did not feel comfortable"" to include ATF under the GST, she said. She said black pepper and raisins when supplied by an agriculturalist is not liable to GST payment. GoM on health insurance requires more work, she said, adding the same was the case with rate rationalisation GoM. ""No report (on rate rationalisation) has been finalised,"" she said. The GoM on GST compensation cess, under Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, has been given an extended deadline to submit its report. The earlier deadline was December 31, 2024. On small companies facing registration problems, she said a concept note has received in-principle approvals. This may require amendments to be made to the GST Acts to make it easier for small companies to register. The Council also decided to set up a Group of Ministers to mull over allowing states to levy cess under GST to overcome financial distress after natural calamities. Finance ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal would be part of the GoM. The Council decided to form the GoM after Andhra Pradesh sought Council's approval to levy 1 per cent cess to overcome financial distress post flood in the state. No decision was taken on levy of tax on delivery charges by quick commerce and food delivery platforms. ""This has been deferred,"" she said, adding the Fitment Committee will again review it and the issue being debated is if the tax should be equivalent to 5 per cent GST levied on food or more.Published By: Vivek Published On: Dec 21, 2024ALSO READ |  Paytm Money launches 'Pay Later' Margin Trading. 3 things to knowMust Watch

These decisions aim to streamline tax processes, provide relief in certain areas, and align taxation policies with emerging needs.WHAT’S GETTING CHEAPER? Several items and services will see a reduction in GST rates, offering financial relief: Fortified Rice Kernels (FRK): The GST rate on FRK has been reduced to 5% when supplied through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This move is targeted at ensuring affordable nutrition for economically weaker sections of society. Gene Therapy: In a step toward making advanced medical treatments more accessible, gene therapy has been fully exempted from GST. Food Preparations for Free Distribution: Inputs supplied for food distribution under government schemes for the economically weaker sections will now attract a concessional 5% GST rate. Systems for Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile (LRSAM) Assembly: The Council has exempted Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on systems, sub-systems, and tools used for LRSAM manufacturing, a move likely to benefit the defense sector. Inspection Equipment for IAEA: Imports of equipment and consumable samples for inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will now be exempt from IGST, supporting international regulatory compliance. Pepper and Raisins (Direct Sales): Pepper and raisins sold directly by agriculturists have been clarified as not liable to GST, ensuring relief for agricultural producers.WHAT’S GETTING COSTLIER? On the other hand, some items and services will see higher GST rates, increasing costs for consumers: Old and Used Vehicles (Including EVs): The GST rate has been increased from 12% to 18% on the sale of old and used vehicles, except for certain petrol and diesel variants. This change will impact the resale market for automobiles. Ready-to-Eat Popcorn: Pre-packaged and labelled ready-to-eat popcorn will now attract a 12% GST, while caramelised popcorn will be taxed at 18%. Non-pre-packaged and labelled popcorn with the character of “namkeens” will continue to attract 5% GST. Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (ACC) Blocks: ACC blocks containing more than 50% fly ash will now be taxed at 12%, affecting construction costs. Corporate Sponsorship Services: These services have been brought under the Forward Charge Mechanism, potentially increasing costs for corporate sponsors.OTHER POLICY UPDATES The Council also announced several updates aimed at clarifying existing policies and addressing long-standing ambiguities: Vouchers: Transactions involving vouchers have been clarified as neither a supply of goods nor services, making them exempt from GST. Penal Charges: Penalties collected by banks and NBFCs for non-compliance with loan terms will not attract GST, providing relief to borrowers. Definition of ‘Pre-Packaged and Labelled’: The definition has been updated to align with the Legal Metrology Act. It now covers commodities intended for retail sale, containing not more than 25 kg or 25 liters, and requiring mandatory labeling under the Act. These decisions are expected to have a varied impact across sectors, from healthcare and agriculture to automobiles and retail.  While some changes aim to reduce costs and boost affordability, others align with the government’s focus on revenue optimization and compliance.Published By: Manisha PandeyPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Must Watch

Mirchandani had often spoken about his motivation to innovate in India’s FMCG sector, inspired by a lecture during business school. His plans included scaling Epigamia's revenue to Rs 250 crore by FY25 and increasing the brand’s presence in quick commerce channels. His death is among several recent losses in India’s startup ecosystem, including those of Pepperfry co-founder Ambareesh Murty and Good Capital’s Rohan Malhotra.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Dec 22, 2024ALSO READ |  Padma Shri awardee environmentalist Tulsi Gowda dies at 86 in Karnataka

This change, part of the benchmark index's planned rebalancing, will take effect on December 23, replacing steel major JSW Steel. The index reshuffle is expected to result in changes in fund flows. Brokerage firm Nuvama has estimated inflows of $513 million into Zomato due to its inclusion in the Sensex, while JSW Steel may see outflows of $252 million. This rebalancing underscores the evolving dynamics of the stock market as tech-focused companies like Zomato gain prominence. Zomato’s inclusion in the Sensex comes after an impressive performance in the past year. The company’s stock has surged nearly 43% over the last six months and approximately 126% over the past year, far outpacing the Sensex’s one-year return of 10.7%. In contrast, JSW Steel has delivered around 9% returns over the same period. Brokerage firm UBS attributed Zomato’s rally of nearly 150% over the past 18 months to its ability to improve unit economics and move closer to profitability, particularly in its quick commerce (qcom) segment. Zomato reported strong financial results for the July-September quarter, with a 69% year-on-year increase in consolidated revenue from operations, reaching Rs 4,799 crore. The company also recorded a five-fold jump in net profit to Rs 176 crore. The relaunch of its subscription program, Zomato Gold, earlier this year has played a key role in driving growth. The program has helped increase ordering frequency among the company’s top customers, contributing to its robust financial performance. As of December 21, Zomato’s market capitalisation stood at Rs 2.72 lakh crore, surpassing JSW Steel’s Rs 2.24 lakh crore. According to UBS, Zomato is trading at a forecasted FY27 EV/EBITDA (adjusted) of 39 times, which translates to an FY27 EV/Sales multiple of 6.3 times. These metrics highlight investor confidence in the company’s future growth potential. The rebalancing extends beyond the Sensex to the BSE 100 index, which will see the addition of six new stocks: Jio Financial Services, Suzlon Energy, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, Samvardhana Motherson International, and PB Fintech (Policybazaar). These companies will replace Ashok Leyland, P.I.

Unlike in the US, where brokerage fees are negligible and there are no transaction taxes, Indian traders face multiple layers of charges.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/5-reasons-why-options-trading-is-a-losing-game-for-retail-traders-2653990-2024-12-23,"India’s derivatives market has been witnessing unprecedented growth, with retail participation soaring from 5.1 million in FY22 to 9.6 million in FY24. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) recorded over 8.5 billion F&O contracts worth $1.1 trillion in April 2024 alone. However, beneath this surge lies a grim reality for retail investors. Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury, Professor of Financial Analytics at Great Lakes Institute of Management, cited a recent study conducted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to highlight the fact that “for most retail traders, options trading is a losing game”. It may be noted that the Sebi study revealed the stark odds faced by retail traders, with 93% incurring net losses between FY22 and FY24, collectively losing over Rs 1.8 lakh crore ($21.6 billion) in three years. “Despite their enthusiasm and growing numbers, structural and systemic challenges in India’s options market have made consistent profitability elusive for retail participants,” Chaudhury said. In this article, Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury highlights 5 major hurdles faced by retail investors.CRUSHING WEIGHT OF TRANSACTION COSTS One of the biggest challenges retail traders face in India is the prohibitively high transaction costs. Unlike in the US, where brokerage fees are negligible and there are no transaction taxes, Indian traders face multiple layers of charges: Securities Transaction Tax (STT): Levied at 0.125% of the premium on option sales, STT disproportionately affects small-scale, high-frequency trades. Brokerage Fees: Flat rates of Rs 20 per trade may seem minor but can represent a significant cost for low-value trades. Exchange Turnover Fees and GST: NSE/BSE turnover fees and an 18% GST on brokerage fees further inflate costs. For example, a Rs 100 premium option trade in India can incur Rs 37.67 (~4%) in transaction costs, compared to less than $1 (<1%) in the U.S. for a similar trade. Over three years, retail traders in India collectively spent Rs 50,000 crore ($6 billion) on transaction costs, creating an insurmountable break-even point for many.VOLATILITY AND LIMITED GAINS The Indian market’s inherent volatility adds another layer of complexity. While the Nifty Index’s average monthly return (2022–2024) was 1.2%, its standard deviation—a measure of risk—was two to three times that. This heightened variability makes both buying and selling index options risky propositions. Furthermore, options premiums plummet sharply just a few percentage points away from the current market price, leaving retail traders with minimal room for gains. In such a volatile environment, consistent profitability requires precise timing and advanced strategies, skills that most retail traders lack.KNOWLEDGE GAP A lack of understanding of options Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) and advanced trading strategies like spreads or straddles hampers retail traders' ability to manage risk effectively. Instead of treating options trading as a strategic investment, many—particularly the younger demographic—approach it as speculation. The Sebi study found that 43% of retail traders were under 30 years old in FY24, up from 31% in FY23. Many of these young traders are swayed by ""finfluencers,"" who often oversimplify options trading to sell courses, leaving inexperienced traders with unrealistic expectations.THE INSTITUTIONAL EDGE While retail traders struggle, institutional players thrive. Leveraging algorithmic trading systems, they execute high-frequency trades with precision, exploiting inefficiencies that retail traders cannot. In FY24 alone: Proprietary traders recorded gross trading profits of Rs 33,000 crore ($3.96 billion). Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) earned Rs 28,000 crore ($3.36 billion). A staggering 96–97% of these profits were attributed to algorithmic trading, highlighting the technological gap between retail and institutional players. Retail traders, lacking access to similar tools and data, are at a significant disadvantage.DEMOGRAPHIC DISADVANTAGE The Sebi report also highlighted that 75% of retail traders in the F&O segment had annual incomes below Rs 5 lakh ($6,000). For this demographic, trading beyond their financial capacity amplifies risks. Younger, inexperienced traders are particularly vulnerable, often enduring repeated losses in the hope of eventual success. Alarmingly, over 75% of losing traders persisted in trading despite consecutive losses, underscoring a dangerous cycle of overconfidence and lack of financial literacy.WHY RETAIL TRADERS RARELY WIN For retail traders, the odds of success are stacked against them due to: High Costs: Annual transaction costs per trader average Rs 26,000 ($310), significantly eroding potential profits. Time Decay (Theta): Options lose value as expiration nears, with over 70% expiring worthless. Wide Bid-Ask Spreads: These spreads further increase implicit trading costs. High Leverage Risks: While options provide leverage, they amplify losses, particularly in volatile markets. Lack of Education and Tools: Without sophisticated tools or a solid understanding of market dynamics, retail traders are at a perpetual disadvantage.WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE? Recognising these challenges, Sebi has proposed measures to curb speculative trading and protect retail participants, including: Increasing minimum contract sizes: To deter small-capital speculative trades. Regulating weekly expiries: To reduce high-frequency trading pressure. While these steps are commendable, Dr. Jayatu Sen Chaudhury said robust investor education initiatives must complement these. “Retail traders need access to better tools, data, and training to navigate the complexities of options trading effectively,"" he said. ""Unless structural reforms are implemented to reduce costs and level the playing field, options trading will continue to be a losing game for most retail investors in India. For now, the allure of quick riches remains a dangerous illusion for the average trader,” he added.

UltraTech Cement plans to acquire 10,13,91,231 equity shares of India Cements, each valued at Rs 10. This represents a 32.72% stake in the company, held by its promoters, members of the promoter group, and another shareholder. In addition to the stake purchase, UltraTech Cement will make an open offer to acquire up to 8,05,73,273 equity shares from public shareholders. This open offer, which represents 26% of India Cements’ equity, is priced at Rs 390 per share. The offer price is a 15% premium over India Cements’ closing price of Rs 339 on Friday. The news sparked a rally in India Cements shares, which climbed 11% to reach Rs 376.30 during Monday’s trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). UltraTech Cement also saw a modest gain of 1.14%, with its shares trading at Rs 11,555 during the day. At the time the article was being written, India Cements shares were trading at Rs 368.50, up 8.65%.  The acquisition deal was first announced on July 28, 2024, with UltraTech Cement revealing plans to invest Rs 3,950 crore to acquire a significant stake in India Cements. UltraTech Cement had previously acquired a 23% stake in India Cements at Rs 268 per share. Market experts see this acquisition as a move that could lead to better price discipline in the cement industry. Consolidation in the sector is expected to improve profitability and enhance return ratios over the long term. For UltraTech Cement, the acquisition aligns with its growth strategy. The company aims to achieve a global production capacity of 200 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by FY2027. UltraTech Cement's management reiterated its goal of double-digit volume growth for the second half of FY2025. This growth is expected to be driven by government spending on infrastructure projects, consistent demand from urban housing, and increased rural demand following good monsoons. Analysts have also highlighted UltraTech's continued focus on efficiency improvement, which supports its expansion plans. UltraTech Cement's acquisition of India Cements, along with its planned acquisition of Kesoram, is expected to be completed by the end of FY2025. Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 23, 2024

Despite his immense wealth, the French billionaire has slipped to fifth place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $176 billion after losing $32 billion year-to-date.advertisementTHE RISE AND FALL OF A LUXURY MOGULArnault first claimed the title of the world’s richest person in August 2021, fuelled by soaring luxury goods sales in Asia. Since then, his ranking has fluctuated, regaining the top spot briefly in 2022, 2023, and again in May 2024. Arnault first claimed the title of the world’s richest person in August 2021, fuelled by soaring luxury goods sales in Asia. Since then, his ranking has fluctuated, regaining the top spot briefly in 2022, 2023, and again in May 2024. However, a significant downturn followed in September 2024, when LVMH shares dropped 20%, translating to a $54 billion loss due to declining revenues. The company’s Chief Financial Officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, attributed the revenue slump to geopolitical tensions affecting global markets. Arnault’s fall marks a stark contrast to the tech-dominated top billionaire list. He is the sole representative of the luxury goods industry in the top five, which is otherwise populated by tech tycoons like Elon Musk ($444 billion), Jeff Bezos ($244 billion), Mark Zuckerberg ($207 billion), and Larry Ellison ($190 billion). Even in the top 10, Warren Buffett, a non-tech mogul, is the only other exception.THE LEGACY OF LVMH Despite these setbacks, LVMH remains a powerhouse in the luxury market, with around 75 iconic brands spanning wines, spirits, fashion, leather goods, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, and jewellery. Some renowned names include Christian Dior, Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Hublot, Tiffany & Co., and Sephora. Even as geopolitical tensions and market challenges persist, Arnault’s empire continues to set the standard in luxury, proving that wealth, like luxury, often comes with its own ups and downs.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Trending Reel

Popcorn gets stuck in GST mazeThe GST Council's decision to impose different tax rates on salted, pre-packaged, and caramelised popcorn has faced criticism, with economists, industry experts, and former government officials arguing that the new tax structure adds complexity for consumers.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/popcorn-gst-salted-prepackaged-caramalised-faces-crticism-experts-heres-why-2654025-2024-12-23,"Popcorn, a timeless snack enjoyed at movie nights, parties, and as a casual treat, has recently found itself at the heart of a complicated tax debate that’s stirring confusion and frustration across the country. The GST Council’s decision to impose different tax rates on salted, pre-packaged, and caramelised popcorn has faced criticism, with economists, industry experts, and former government officials arguing that the new tax structure adds complexity for consumers while failing to make a significant contribution to the government’s coffers. The tax structure is as follows: 5% GST on salted popcorn, 12% on pre-packaged and labeled popcorn, and a hefty 18% on caramelised popcorn. At first glance, the distinction between these varieties seems straightforward, but critics are questioning the logic behind it, especially when the potential revenue impact appears to be negligible. Former Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian is among those who have raised concerns about the new tax rates. Subramanian, known for his outspoken views, pointed out that the revenue generated from this differentiation would be minimal and hardly worth the hassle it could cause to ordinary citizens. In a social media post on X, Subramanian explained, “Estimated popcorn sales in 2025 (estimated from GlobalData) = Rs 1700 crore. Assuming the entire amount is taxed at 18%, GST collection from popcorn = Rs 300 crore. Total GST collection (estimated 2025) = Rs 22,00,000 crore. Max revenue contribution of popcorn decision = 300/2200000 = 0.013%!” He went on to question, “What is the rationale for a decision that can max contribute 0.013% to revenue but inconvenience citizens?” The debate over the popcorn tax has since snowballed, with some prominent voices chiming in, criticising the move as both “silly and complex.” Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai was quick to weigh in, calling the new rates “silly and complex” and warning that they could lead to what he described as “tax terrorism.” Pai raised alarm over how such policies could affect ordinary citizens and called for a simplification of the GST system. “This is silly and complex. Will lead to tax terrorism. Citizens are becoming victims of bad policy which will make them hostages to rent-seeking officials and create disputes. GST needs to be simplified, not this,” Pai said. Arvind Subramanian, another former CFO, added his voice to the chorus of critics, calling the decision a “national tragedy” and arguing that it went against the very spirit of the Goods and Services Tax, which was originally designed to simplify taxation across the country. However, the finance ministry has clarified that the GST Council’s recommendation wasn’t introducing a new tax, but rather offering clarification to resolve disputes that had arisen from the interpretation of existing tax rates. Despite the clarification, the damage had already been done. What started as a seemingly harmless tweak to the tax structure has become a focal point for critics, highlighting the complexities of India’s taxation system. Social media has exploded with memes and jokes about how popcorn—of all things—has become a symbol of the country’s complicated GST framework. But beyond the memes and the public outrage, the popcorn tax sheds light on a far bigger issue: the struggle to maintain a tax system that is both simple and effective. While policymakers are pushing for clarity, the real question remains: will popcorn be the tipping point that forces a serious overhaul of India’s convoluted tax structure?Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 23, 2024

Ujjivan SFB went public in December 2019 with a $1.36 billion valuation, but has since dropped to $0.81 billion. Operational challenges, market corrections, and sector-specific headwinds have significantly eroded these valuations. Similarly, Powergrid Infrastructure Investment Trust and Chemplast Sanmar, which debuted with $1.28 billion and $1.14 billion market caps, respectively, now hover below the billion-dollar mark. Other names in this list include Juniper Hotels, TVS Supply Chain Solutions, and TN Mercantile Bank.IPO MARKET RESILIENCE AMID SETBACKS Despite these setbacks, the Indian IPO market has continued to thrive. This year alone, companies raised a record Rs 1.8 lakh crore through 317 IPOs, surpassing the Rs 1.3 lakh crore raised in CY21. The contribution of IPOs to market capitalisation increased to 2.9% in CY24 from 1.4% in CY23, although it still lags behind the highs of CY17 (3.7%) and CY21 (3.4%). E-commerce, telecom, and retail sectors have driven recent IPO success, reflecting India’s growing digital economy and consumer base. Meanwhile, cyclical sectors like capital goods and real estate have seen fluctuating participation due to market dynamics.THE DUALITY OF SUCCESS India’s IPO market showcases both immense potential and inherent risks. While the record fundraising highlights investor confidence, the struggles of once-billion-dollar IPOs remind us that market dynamics can quickly change fortunes. Investors must tread cautiously, balancing optimism with vigilance.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Must Watch

Report reveals truthPeople don't just put in money but trust when they buy insurance policies to cover for medical emergencies or motor accidents. A report by the Insurance Brokers Association of India reveals how many such claims have been accepted or rejected by insurance companies in 2022-23.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/irdai-report-indian-best-insurance-company-india-policies-medical-vehicle-claim-rejection-rate-data-2654475-2024-12-24,"People buy general insurance to cover for emergencies so that they do not have to make out-of-pocket hefty payments. They do not just put their money in, but trust while paying premiums. However, not all claims get approved. A recent report reveals that the claim-to-settlement ratio, which shows how many claims were honoured by insurers, in 2022-23 at 86%, which is down from the 87% in FY22. The detailed report by the Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI) from data presented by insurance companies reveals that claims repudiation ratio rose to 6% for general insurance, which includes coverage for motor, health, fire and marine cargo. This is the claim rejected by an insurance company as a proportion of the total claims made by its policy buyers. Public sector insurer New India Assurance has the lowest claims repudiation ratio of 0.2%. Other big private insurers with lower rates of claims rejection are HDFC Ergo, Future Generali, Aditya Birla Health and Shriram. Insurance watchdog IRDAI makes it mandatory for insurance companies to put out settlements and rejection data on their websites. The IBAI has collated the data from insurers and put it in a report, which could help people make informed choices about a company's track record while buying insurance policies. In the Policyholder's Handbook, the IBAI has classified the general insurers into four categories -- Public Sector General Insurers, Large Private Sector General Insurers, Other Private Sector Insurers, and Standalone Health Insurers. In the health insurance category too, New India Assurance came on top among the public insurers with a claim-settlement ratio of 95%. Aditya Birla Health, with a claim settlement ratio of 95%, was the best among standalone health insurers. Iffco Tokio and Bajaj Allianz were among the top large private sector general insurers with the best claims-to-settlement ratio of 90% or more, according to the IBAI handbook. What has to be remembered in the case of health insurance is that it is combined data for group (corporate) and individual policies. Claim-rejection rates are historically lower in the case of corporate policies. ""Irdai does not give data for individual and group claims separately. Why not? Who is it protecting,"" asked author-influencer Monika Halan. The real picture will emerge when separate claim-settlement data is available for individual health insurance policies. According to experts, incomplete or false disclosure, consciously or unconsciously, at the time of purchase of policies also contribute to rejection of claims.   In settling motor vehicle own-damage claims too, New India Assurance was the best public insurer with a claim-settlement ratio of 92%. Among large private sector insurers when it came to own-damage claim settlement, Royal Sundaram, Go Digit and SBI General came on top. Future Generali was the top among small insurers. The insurance coverage, be it life or general, is low in India but the tax on insurance premiums, at 18%, is high. In India, insurance penetration is at 30%, and low in comparison to developed countries, like the US, where it is over 90%. Though there is no social security net and government medical infrastructure is rickety, the high 18% GST on insurance premiums defies logic. Many users settle for a smaller cover due to high premiums, experts have told India Today Digital. Several reform measures are needed for the growth of the insurance industry and relief for people so that they can get better cover for themselves. Not just in terms of reduction of tax, there is a need for segregated data on claim-settlement ratios for individual and group policies for people to make an informed choice.Published By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

The stock also marked a fresh 52-week high, continuing its strong post-listing performance since debuting in November this year. The rally followed a bullish note from global brokerage JP Morgan, which initiated coverage on Sagility India with an 'overweight' rating and a target price of â‚¹54. This target implies a potential upside of 16% from the previous close. JP Morgan highlighted the company's robust fundamentals, citing an 18% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in adjusted earnings over FY24-27E, driven by increasing outsourcing in the U.S. healthcare sector. The brokerage noted that Sagility India benefits from deep domain expertise and solid client relationships, which are expected to boost revenue growth. Additionally, the company's strong structural EBIT margins, supported by a higher offshore mix, make it competitive among mid-cap peers. JP Morgan also underlined Sagility’s strategic position in the under-penetrated U.S. healthcare outsourcing market, which stands at just 22% penetration. The brokerage sees Sagility growing its market share by 15%, outperforming the broader healthcare outsourcing market growth rate of 9%. It added that Sagility's focus on non-discretionary operations spending provides a stable revenue profile compared to larger IT and BPO service providers. However, the note flagged key risks, including high client concentration, potential in-sourcing by top clients, regulatory changes in the U.S. healthcare sector, and aggressive adoption of generative AI that could disrupt the market. Sagility India debuted on the stock market with an issue price of Rs 30 per share. At its current level, the stock has surged over 63% from the IPO price, underscoring strong investor interest. The IPO itself saw robust demand, being subscribed 3.2 times, with retail investors leading the charge. Earlier, Jefferies Equity Research also initiated coverage on the company, citing its strong positioning as a leading U.S.-focused business process management firm specialising in healthcare services. Since listing on November 12, Sagility India shares have risen 59%, reflecting optimism over its growth prospects. Analysts tracking the stock have a 'buy' rating, with Bloomberg data indicating an average 12-month price target suggesting a further 13.7% upside.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

Investor confidence in the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) advancements and expectations of a new iPhone upgrade cycle have fuelled a 16% surge in its stock since November, adding $500 billion to its market capitalisation. Currently valued at $3.86 trillion, Apple’s market cap surpasses the combined worth of the leading stock indices of Germany and Switzerland. The strong rally reflects the growing optimism about Apple’s evolving AI strategy and its potential to reinvigorate product demand.advertisementAPPLE'S AI PUSHIn December, Apple began incorporating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its devices, part of its broader initiative to integrate generative AI into its app ecosystem—a strategy announced earlier in June. Analysts view this move as pivotal, particularly in addressing lackluster demand for the iPhone 16 series during the holiday season. In December, Apple began incorporating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its devices, part of its broader initiative to integrate generative AI into its app ecosystem—a strategy announced earlier in June. Analysts view this move as pivotal, particularly in addressing lackluster demand for the iPhone 16 series during the holiday season. Speaking to news agency Reuters, Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, attributed the market’s enthusiasm to Apple’s AI progress and the possibility of a “supercycle” of iPhone upgrades. Similarly, Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring forecasted a recovery in iPhone sales by 2025, driven by the expanded rollout of Apple’s AI features. Woodring reiterated Apple as Morgan Stanley’s top investment pick for the year ahead. Despite these advancements, Apple’s immediate revenue growth for the fiscal first quarter is projected to remain modest. Meanwhile, its price-to-earnings ratio has reached 33.5, the highest in nearly three years, eclipsing major tech competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia. This elevated valuation has sparked concerns over inflated stock prices, prompting Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to reduce its Apple holdings. Even with potential headwinds, such as the possibility of new tariffs on Chinese imports under the incoming U.S. administration, analysts remain optimistic. Past exemptions secured by Apple during prior tariff rounds provide hope for minimal disruptions.

At 11:53 am, shares of Tata Investment were up 11.51% to Rs 7,284 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The surge followed reports that Tata Capital is gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO) worth Rs 15,000 crore. The IPO will aim to comply with regulatory norms and is expected to be one of the largest public offerings in the Indian market. Law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and investment bank Kotak Mahindra Capital have reportedly been appointed as advisors for the proposed deal. In October, the RBI approved the merger of Tata Capital with Tata Motors Finance Limited (TMFL), creating India’s 12th-largest NBFC. This no-objection approval by the central bank sets the stage for Tata Capital’s public listing. Regulatory filings suggest that Tata Capital could list by September 2024, well ahead of the 2025 deadline. Tata Investment Corporation is one of the largest shareholders of Tata Sons, the holding company for Tata Capital. TICL’s close association with Tata Sons explains the strong investor interest in its shares, given the anticipated value unlock from the Tata Capital IPO. The Tata Group’s most recent IPO, Tata Technologies, delivered a stellar performance in the secondary market. Listed on November 30, 2023, Tata Technologies’ shares debuted with a 140% premium to their issue price of Rs 500. The IPO, entirely an offer for sale (OFS), was subscribed 69.43 times, reflecting robust investor appetite for Tata Group offerings. Tata Technologies was the first IPO from the group in nearly two decades, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) being the previous IPO in 2004. The Tata Capital IPO marks another milestone for the conglomerate, highlighting its commitment to enhancing transparency and unlocking value for investors. As preparations for the Tata Capital IPO advance, market participants remain optimistic about the potential impact on Tata Group entities. The rally in TICL shares underscores growing anticipation for what could be one of India’s most significant IPOs in recent years.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

Many believe the move aims to tap into the rapidly expanding sector to boost government revenue.,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/18-percent-gst-on-used-cars-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-leave-you-paying-more-amit-malviya-2654625-2024-12-24,"The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council's decision to increase the GST rate on old and used vehicles to 18% has stirred discussions across the country. The revised rate, announced at the 55th GST Council meeting, applies to all old and used vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), sold by registered businesses. However, individuals who are not registered under GST remain unaffected by this change. The decision has sparked debates as it comes at a time when India’s used car market is poised for growth. Many believe the move aims to tap into the rapidly expanding sector to boost government revenue.FINANCE MINISTER'S CLARIFICATION SPARKS CONFUSION While the increase in GST aims to streamline tax rates across different types of vehicles, earlier clarification by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the issue left buyers and sellers unsure about how the new rates would affect them. The Finance Minister said that GST is calculated on the difference between the actual price and the resale price. ""It is on that margin, the value between purchased price and resale price. Bought it for Rs 12 lakh, selling it for Rs 9 lakh in the name of a second-hand used vehicle; on the margin only this 18% has been put,"" the Finance Minister said.  However, the explanation raised questions about how the margin would be determined and whether the increase in GST would ultimately lead to losses for sellers.WHY WAS 18% GST LEVIED ON SALE OF USED CARS Explaining the decision, Amit Malviya, In-charge of the BJP’s National Information & Technology Department, clarified that the 18% GST is calculated only on the margin earned by dealers—the difference between the sale price and purchase price of the vehicle—and not on the total value of the vehicle. “If the margin is negative, no GST is payable. This approach ensures that the tax reflects the value addition by the dealer, which is considered a service under the GST framework,” Malviya said on X. He further added that taxing the dealer’s margin is not new. “This method was also in place during the UPA era as ‘Service Tax’ and continued until 2017.” Previously, old and used petrol, LPG, or CNG vehicles with an engine capacity of 1200 cc or more, as well as diesel vehicles with engines of 1500 cc or more, were already subject to 18% GST since 2018. Similarly, old and used EVs were taxed at 12%. The latest move standardises the GST rate for all old and used vehicles, including EVs, at 18%.BOOMING USED CAR MARKET The timing of this decision aligns with the rapid growth of India’s used car market. According to the Indian Blue Book 2023 report by Das Welt Auto and Car&Bike, the used car market in India was valued at USD 31.33 billion in 2022-23 and is projected to grow to USD 70.48 billion by 2027-28. The report highlights that the market’s average growth rate, which was 6% between FY2017 and FY2022, is expected to jump to 16% between FY2023 and FY2028. Comparatively, the new car market is expected to grow at a much slower pace of 1% to 6% during the same period. Factors such as a growing middle class, higher disposable incomes, and an increasing demand for personal mobility have contributed to the sector’s rapid expansion. The GST increase is expected to impact businesses involved in the sale of old and used vehicles, particularly dealers who claim depreciation on purchased vehicles. While the tax will not affect individuals buying or selling vehicles privately, businesses will need to factor the higher rate into their pricing strategies.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

An article on the 'State of the Economy' in the December bulletin noted that the global economy continues to exhibit resilience with steady growth and moderating inflation. ""High frequency indicators (HFIs) for the third quarter of 2024-25 indicate that the Indian economy is recovering from the slowdown in momentum witnessed in Q2, driven by strong festival activity and a sustained upswing in rural demand,"" it said. The article further said the growth trajectory is poised to lift in the second half of 2024-25, driven mainly by resilient domestic private consumption demand. ""Supported by record level foodgrains production, rural demand, in particular, is gaining momentum. Sustained government spending on infrastructure is expected to further stimulate economic activity and investment,"" the authors said. Global headwinds, however, pose risks to the evolving outlook for growth and inflation, said the article authored by a team led by RBI Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra. India's GDP growth slowed to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent during the July-September period of the current fiscal year. The article said that from the expenditure side, the major factor contributing to the decline in the growth rate of the economy is fixed capital formation and from the production side, the main concern is manufacturing. ""Undermining both is inflation. The erosion of purchasing power due to repeated inflation shocks and persisting price pressures is starkly reflected in weakening sales growth of listed non-financial nongovernment corporations,"" it said. Their outlook on demand conditions also remains subdued as no let-up in the incidence of price shocks seems to be in sight; they will increasingly be inclined to pass on input costs to selling prices. Consequently, there is no robust capacity creation by investing in fixed assets. Instead, corporations are churning and utilising existing capacity to meet the inflation-dented consumer demand, the article said. ""The result is lacklustre private investment. The slowdown in consumer demand seems to be associated with slower corporate wage growth,"" it said. 'The authors further said another headwind emerging is the slowing rate of nominal GDP growth, which could hinder fiscal spending, including on capex, to achieve budgetary deficit and debt targets. The article also noted that as per the projections based on the in-house Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE), real GDP growth is likely to recover to 6.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent in Q3 and Q4 of 2024-25, respectively. Growth for 2025-26 is projected at 6.7 per cent while headline CPI inflation (retail) is projected to average 3.8 per cent in 2025-26. In the December monetary policy, the RBI had projected the GDP growth for 2024-25 at 6.6 per cent with Q3 at 6.8 per cent; and Q4 at 7.2 per cent. GDP growth for the April quarter of 2025-26 was projected at 6.9 per cent; and Q2 at 7.3 per cent.

A uniform GST rate of 18 per cent now applies to such sales, replacing the previous variable rates. Importantly, no new taxes have been introduced for these transactions. GST on the sale of old and used vehicles is applicable only to people or businesses registered for GST and engaged in the purchase and resale of such vehicles. Those not registered for GST are not required to pay the tax.advertisementGST CALCULATION ON USED VEHICLE SALESThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) on old and used vehicles is calculated solely on the seller's margin, not the entire sale price. The margin is determined as the difference between the sale price and the vehicle's depreciated or purchase value, according to guidelines issued by the GST Council. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) on old and used vehicles is calculated solely on the seller's margin, not the entire sale price. The margin is determined as the difference between the sale price and the vehicle's depreciated or purchase value, according to guidelines issued by the GST Council. For sellers who have claimed depreciation under Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, GST is applied only on the margin between the sale price and the depreciated value of the vehicle. In cases where the sale price is lower than the depreciated or purchase value, creating a negative margin, no GST is applicable.EXAMPLES OF GST CALCULATION Officials have outlined clear examples to demonstrate how GST is applied under different scenarios: - Negative margin with depreciation Purchase Price: Rs 20 lakhs
Depreciated Value: Rs 12 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 10 lakhs
Margin: Negative (Rs 10 lakhs - Rs 12 lakhs = -Rs 2 lakhs)
GST Payable: None.
When the sale price is lower than the depreciated value, no GST is payable. - Negative margin without depreciation Purchase Price: Rs 12 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 10 lakhs
Margin: Negative (Rs 10 lakhs - Rs 12 lakhs = -Rs 2 lakhs)
GST Payable: None.
Even when depreciation is not claimed, GST is not applicable on a negative margin. - Positive margin Purchase Price: Rs 20 lakhs
Selling Price: Rs 22 lakhs
Margin: Rs 2 lakhs (Rs 22 lakhs - Rs 20 lakhs)
GST Payable: 18 per cent of Rs 2 lakhs = Rs 36,000.
GST is applied at a standard rate of 18 per cent when the margin is positive.  KEY TAKEAWAYS A standard 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies to the sale of used vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), simplifying the taxation process for such transactions. GST is payable only by sellers registered under GST laws, such as businesses involved in the purchase and resale of vehicles. Private sales between individuals are exempt from GST, ensuring that the tax burden applies only to commercial transactions. The tax is calculated solely on the seller's margin, defined as the difference between the selling price and the vehicle’s depreciated or purchase value. If the margin is negative — meaning the sale price is lower than the vehicle’s depreciated or purchase value — no GST is payable.Published By: Vadapalli Nithin KumarPublished On: Dec 25, 2024READ |  18% GST on used cars: Do you have to pay tax on selling your car?Must Watch

Economists push for cuts to help save moreEconomists argued that reducing the tax burden would increase disposable income, enabling citizens to save more and spend on essentials. This, in turn, could help revive demand in sectors impacted by weak consumption.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/budget-2025-income-tax-relief-economists-meet-pm-modi-high-inflation-money-save-low-gdp-2655173-2024-12-25,"Economists have urged the government to reduce income tax rates and introduce reforms to support savings and economic growth in the upcoming Union Budget 2025, reported The Economic Times. These suggestions were shared during a pre-budget interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where several prominent economists and experts discussed strategies for navigating economic challenges. One of the key recommendations was to lower income tax rates. Economists argued that reducing the tax burden would increase disposable income, enabling citizens to save more and spend on essentials. This, in turn, could help revive demand in sectors impacted by weak consumption. Suggestions also included rationalising customs tariffs and providing targeted benefits to vulnerable groups. Lower tax rates for lower-income groups, they noted, would directly impact household budgets, improve financial stability, and potentially lift overall consumption levels.ECONOMIC URGE TAX RELIEF WITH PM MODI During the meeting, the Prime Minister reportedly highlighted employment generation as a central focus for government policy. Economists emphasised the importance of improving data quality for better policy decisions and suggested targeted interventions to address weak consumption, inflation, and global uncertainties. The Prime Minister reiterated the government’s vision of a “Viksit Bharat” or a developed India by 2047. He stressed the need for transformative thinking to keep India on a sustainable growth path, particularly during periods of global economic volatility.WEAK CONSUMPTION AND INFLATION Economists said that India’s domestic consumption has struggled to match growth expectations. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.4% in the July-September quarter, its slowest pace in two years, falling short of the central bank’s 7% target for the period. Rising inflation remains a key concern. Inflation in November was above the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) medium-term target of 4%, putting pressure on household budgets. High prices have reduced disposable income and limited discretionary spending, which economists fear could lead to a demand slowdown. To manage inflation while sustaining growth, economists recommended measures such as direct benefit transfers, public expenditure in rural areas, and incentives for job creation outside the agricultural sector.INCOME TAX REFORMS IN THE PAST The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced significant changes to the income tax regime, offering relief to many taxpayers: Income tax slabs were relaxed for earnings up to Rs 10 lakh. The standard deduction for salaried and pensioners was increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Family pensioners saw their standard deduction rise from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. The employer’s NPS contribution deduction for private-sector employees was increased from 10% to 14%. Industry representatives, including major groups like CII, FICCI, and PHDCCI, have presented several recommendations for the upcoming Budget 2025. They called for comprehensive tax reforms, including the simplification of capital gains tax and streamlined compliance procedures. A reduction in TDS provisions and the establishment of a dedicated dispute resolution mechanism were also proposed. For GST, suggestions included the introduction of a simplified three-rate GST structure, referred to as GST 2.0, and the inclusion of all expenses in the input tax credit chain. Additionally, industry bodies urged for adjustments in direct taxes, such as reduced tax rates for partnership firms and LLPs, the removal of the dividend distribution tax, and relief for share buybacks by treating them as capital gains while allowing deductions for the cost of shares. Customs-related proposals included introducing a single certificate of origin for multiple bills of entry, simplifying the appeal process, and imposing zero customs duty on critical raw materials. These recommendations aim to simplify tax processes, reduce compliance burdens, and boost the ease of doing business in India.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Must Watch

This is against the global trend. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) report shows growth in premium collection in 2023-24. Insurance companies rejected 11% of all claims in FY24.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/insurance-policy-penetration-india-dipped-premium-collection-grew-irdai-report-claim-settlement-ratio-gst-rate-cut-2655158-2024-12-25,"The latest report by India's insurance industry watchdog has revealed that insurance penetration in the country, which was already low, has dipped further to 2.8% in the last financial year. This is in sharp contrast with the global trend. However, there was a 6% increase in premium collection by life insurance companies despite a dip in penetration. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) released its annual report this week which showed that India's insurance penetration dipped to 3.7% in 2023-24 as compared to 4% in 2022-23. ""The insurance penetration for the life insurance industry marginally declined from 3% in the previous year to 2.8% during 2023-24,"" the IRDAI report said. In the non-life or general insurance industry, the penetration remained at 1%, according to the report. Insurance penetration, a measure of the total amount of premiums paid in a year by the gross domestic product (GDP), shows the popularity of insurance products and the extent to which people are covered.   This dip is worrying as India is a country with already low insurance penetration when compared to developed countries or the global average. This is, in fact, the second successive year of dip in insurance penetration in India. Insurance penetration touched a high of 4.2% in 2021-22 on the back of the Covid pandemic. Globally, insurance penetration has gone up from 6.8% in 2022 to 7% in 2023.INSURANCE COMPANIES SETTLED 83% OF CLAIMS IN 2023-24 What has been the performance of Indian insurers in settling claims in FY24? Going by the IRDAI report, insurers settled about 83% of the total number of claims and rejected about 11% of them. The remaining about 6% were pending for settlement as on March 31, 2024. ""The life insurance industry paid total benefits of Rs 5.77 lakh crore in 2023-24, which constitutes 70.22% of the net premium,"" it said. General and health insurers settled 2.69 crore health insurance claims and paid Rs 83,493 crore towards settlement of health insurance claims. The average amount paid per claim was Rs 31,086.GROWTH IN PREMIUM COLLECTION FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES Though insurance penetration dipped in India, insurance density (per capita premium) grew to $95 in 2023-24 from $92 in 2022-23, according to the IRDAI report.  For the world, it stood at $889. The non-life insurance density increased from $22 to $25, while life insurance density remained stable at
$70, according to the IRDAI report. Despite the negative growth in penetration in India, insurance premium collection saw growth in 2023-24. ""The life insurance market in India has recorded consistent premium growth over the years. During 2023-24, the life insurance industry recorded a premium income of Rs 8.30 lakh crore, registering 6.06% growth,"" said the IRDAI report. Going by the trend, IRDAI expects health insurance premiums to grow by 3% in real terms in 2024.  ""With wages and healthcare expenses exceeding CPI
inflation, health insurance pricing is likely to remain elevated,"" the insurance regulator says.  Private-sector players clocked a growth of 15% in premiums in 2023-24 while public sector life insurers saw a growth of 0.23%.CUT GST RATE TO IMPROVE INSURANCE PENETRATION: PANEL The low penetration and a high 18% GST on insurance premiums has been a worry. A Standing Committee on Finance, headed by Jayant Sinha, recommended that the GST rate on insurance products, especially term and health, should be reduced. The high rate of GST results in a high premium burden, which acts as a deterrent to getting insurance policies, it said in its report, submitted in February. The committee noted there was a need to create mass awareness about the need and benefits of having insurance protection and diverse insurance products. However, in its December meeting, the GST Council postponed any call on reducing tax rates for life and health insurance premiums. There is no two ways about the fact that India needs to better its insurance penetration, which is low and dipping. For this, there needs to be a reduction in taxes and premium rates, and information about insurance products spread among the population.Published By: Yudhajit Published On: Dec 25, 2024Must Watch

The Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI) report also predicts that health insurance premiums are ""likely to remain elevated"" this year.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/health-insurance-claims-rejected-pending-irdai-report-premiums-to-remain-high-india-insurers-2655186-2024-12-26,"Insurance companies in India rejected 11% of all health insurance claims in 2023-24 with another 6% of claims still pending as of March 2024, according to the latest report of India's insurance regulator. The Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI) report also predicts that health insurance premiums are ""likely to remain elevated"" this year. The IRDAI report released this week gives a broader picture of the entire insurance industry, life and general.  The insurance penetration in India dipped in 2023-24 for a second consecutive year to 3.7%. It was 4% in the year-ago period, and at an all-time high of 4.2% in 2021-22 on the back of the Covid pandemic. The dip was contrary to the global trend. In non-life or general insurance, health insurance contributes close to half of global nonlife insurance premiums, according to the report.  Going by the trend, IRDAI expects health insurance premiums to grow by 3% in real terms in 2024.  ""With wages and healthcare expenses exceeding CPI inflation, health insurance pricing is likely to remain elevated,"" the insurance regulator says. Premium prices are important as just 10% of the total health insurance policies have been taken out by individuals. What was the claim-settlement ratio of insurance companies? This is important as it reveals the proportion of claims they have honoured against the total claims made. ""During 2023-24, insurers have settled about 83% of the total number of claims registered in their books,"" says IRDAI. The companies rejected 11% of the total claims while about 6% were pending for settlement as on March 31, 2024. It is important to note that the rejection and settlement data is combined for groups and individuals. This doesn't provide a clear picture as cases of rejection of group insurance, generally taken out by corporates, are close to zero. According to experts, incomplete or false disclosure, consciously or unconsciously, at the time of purchase of policies also contribute to rejection of claims. The average amount paid per claim was a little over Rs 31,000 in 2023-24. In the last financial year, the insurers settled 2.69 crore health insurance claims and paid a total of Rs 83,493 crore.  In terms of number of health insurance claims settled, a lion's share of 72% was through Third Party Agencies (TPAs).  In non-life insurance, earnings from the health insurance business was the largest segment with a contribution of 40.29% of the total premium. It has increased from 38.02% in 2022-23.  In 2023-24, insurance companies saw a growth of 20.32% in health insurance premium collection from the last fiscal, according to the report. The health insurance business is classified into three classes -- government sponsored, group and individual.  Of the total lives covered, about 45% each are in government-sponsored schemes and group policies, while just 10% are health insurance cover taken out by individuals. The insurance coverage, be it life or general, is low in India but the tax on insurance premiums, at 18%, is high. While insurance penetration dipped in India, globally, it went up from 6.8% in 2022 to 7% in 2023. Though there is no social security net and government medical infrastructure is rickety, the high 18% GST on insurance premiums defies logic. Many users settle for a smaller cover due to high premiums, experts have told India Today Digital. To get more Indians covered under health insurance so that they don't need to make hefty out-of-pocket payments, tax rates need to be reduced and premiums made affordable.Published By: Yudhajit Published On: Dec 26, 2024

This landmark initiative, utilising drone technology for surveying and demarcating properties in rural areas, aims to unlock the economic potential of villages and improve financial inclusion.advertisementTRANSFORMING RURAL ECONOMIES WITH PROPERTY CARDSLaunched in 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) scheme addresses the long-standing issue of unmapped rural properties in several states. The lack of clear land ownership records had previously denied rural residents access to institutional credit. Launched in 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) scheme addresses the long-standing issue of unmapped rural properties in several states. The lack of clear land ownership records had previously denied rural residents access to institutional credit. By issuing legally-backed property cards, the scheme enables property owners to secure loans, spurring economic activity in rural areas. So far, 317,000 villages—92% of the targeted 344,000—have been surveyed, with 136,000 villages already receiving property cards. On December 27, PM Modi is set to distribute five million additional property cards across India.BENEFITS AMID CHALLENGES Beyond financial inclusion, the SVAMITVA scheme has resolved disputes, empowered women through joint property ownership, and helped gram panchayats tackle encroachments. However, challenges persist, particularly in tribal areas where communal land ownership and family disputes complicate title claims. The parliamentary standing committee on Panchayati Raj has urged the government to address these issues within the legal framework. States like Jharkhand have resisted implementation, while Tamil Nadu, Bihar, and Odisha, having updated rural land records, opted out of the scheme. Despite hurdles, the ministry aims to complete the project by FY 2026.PAVING THE WAY FOR RURAL PROSPERITY By granting clear ownership of residential properties, the SVAMITVA scheme lays the foundation for rural economic growth.

The stock rose 4.72% to an intraday high of Rs 4848.40, compared to its previous close of Rs 4629.50. However, Mazagon Dock shares pared some gains to trade just 1.5% higher at Rs 4,698.85 on the BSE at 12:49 pm.

Speaking on Lenny’s Podcast, Benioff revealed how Jobs’ enigmatic guidance during a creative slump in his entrepreneurial journey led to the creation of Salesforce’s groundbreaking AppExchange.JOBS’ TRANSFORMATIVE CHALLENGE During their conversation, Jobs gave Benioff three directives that were as ambitious as they were cryptic. The first was a bold challenge: “Your company, it better get 10 times larger in 24 months, or it’s over.” He also advised securing a key client, like Avon, and concluded with a cryptic suggestion: “You better go build an application economy.” Perplexed by the last directive, Benioff sought clarification, but Jobs replied with characteristic mystique, “I don’t know, but you’re going to go figure it out.” For Benioff, the exchange felt like a Zen koan—a riddle meant to inspire deeper insight. Determined to unravel the puzzle, Benioff revisited his notes repeatedly until he identified the solution: creating an app store for business applications. This vision materialised in 2006 with the launch of Salesforce’s AppExchange, a platform that transformed the company’s ecosystem and enabled third-party developers to offer apps and services to Salesforce customers. Two years later, in 2008, Apple debuted its App Store, forever changing the mobile technology landscape and validating Jobs’ prescience. As a gesture of gratitude, Benioff gifted Apple the App Store trademark and the appstore.com domain, acknowledging Jobs' role in sparking his breakthrough.A LEGACY OF VISION AND MENTORSHIP Reflecting on his relationship with Jobs, Benioff expressed deep appreciation, stating, “I’m very grateful to have had that relationship. It dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.” This remarkable mentorship moment highlights the profound impact of visionary advice and reinforces the value of bold thinking in shaping the future of technology and innovation.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024

Activating your UAN is essential to access the EPFO’s wide range of online services. The UAN is a unique 12-digit number assigned to employees by EPFO, offering a convenient way to manage Provident Fund (PF) accounts. Once activated, employees can view and download their PF passbooks, file claims for withdrawals, advances, or transfers, and update personal information—all from the comfort of their homes. This eliminates the need for in-person visits to EPFO offices. To activate the UAN, employees need to follow these steps: Visit the EPFO Member Portal. Click on ‘Activate UAN’ under the ‘Important Links’ section. Provide the UAN, Aadhaar number, full name, date of birth, and Aadhaar-linked mobile number. Consent to Aadhaar OTP verification. Enter the OTP sent to the registered mobile number. Upon successful activation, a password will be sent to the registered mobile number, completing the process.ELI SCHEME: A BOOST FOR EMPLOYMENT AND JOB CREATION The ELI scheme, part of the Union Budget 2024-25, aims to stimulate job growth and incentivise both employers and employees.

The three components of the scheme include: Scheme A: Offers a one-month wage (up to Rs 15,000) for first-time employees. Scheme B: Incentivises job creation in the manufacturing sector with EPFO contribution benefits. Scheme C: Reimburses employers for their EPFO contributions for new hires.

The move, likely to be announced in the upcoming Budget 2025 on February 1, aims to boost consumption and address concerns over rising living costs amid a slowing economy, according to government sources cited in a Reuters report. If implemented, the measure could benefit millions, particularly urban taxpayers grappling with high expenses. Under the current regime introduced in 2020, incomes ranging from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 10.5 lakh are taxed at rates between 5% and 20%. In contrast, incomes exceeding Rs 10.5 lakh face a 30% tax rate. As of now, taxpayers can choose between two systems: the traditional structure, which provides exemptions for expenses like housing rentals and insurance, or the newer regime, which offers lower tax rates but eliminates most exemptions. The proposed cut is expected to encourage more individuals to adopt the simplified 2020 regime. Although the government has not finalised the size of any reductions, sources noted that the decision would likely be made closer to the budget date. The finance ministry has yet to comment on the proposal or its potential impact on revenue. One source suggested that reducing tax rates could offset revenue losses by increasing adoption of the streamlined tax system. The proposal comes as India navigates economic challenges, with GDP growth slowing to its weakest pace in seven quarters between July and September 2024. Rising food inflation is eroding household budgets, particularly in urban areas, and dampening demand for goods like vehicles, household items, and personal care products. The political implications of high taxes on the middle class, coupled with wage growth failing to keep up with inflation, have further intensified pressure on the government.

What it means for youThe Supreme Court has ruled that banks charging high credit card interest rates is lawful, placing responsibility on consumers to manage dues efficiently.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/banks-can-charge-over-30-percent-interest-on-credit-card-dues-says-supreme-court-what-it-means-for-you-2655722-2024-12-26,"The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of banks charging interest rates over 30% on credit card dues, overturning a 2008 decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This landmark judgment clarifies that such charges are not unfair trade practices but rather fall within the ambit of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) regulatory framework. The Supreme Court has ruled that banks can charge over 30% interest on credit card dues, overturning a 2008 decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) that had called such high rates unfair.advertisementWHY THE SUPREME COURT OVERRULED NCDRC’S VERDICTA bench of Justices Bela M. Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma observed that the NCDRC's earlier ruling, which deemed high credit card interest rates exploitative, lacked legal backing. The court stated that the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, grants banks the autonomy to set interest rates in line with RBI directives. A bench of Justices Bela M. Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma observed that the NCDRC's earlier ruling, which deemed high credit card interest rates exploitative, lacked legal backing. The court stated that the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, grants banks the autonomy to set interest rates in line with RBI directives. The bench further noted that credit card holders are well-informed about interest rates and penalties during the application process. Therefore, the terms of the agreement, mutually accepted by both parties, cannot be deemed unconscionable or unfair. Importantly, the court held that NCDRC had no jurisdiction to rewrite the terms of such contracts.HOW THIS DECISION IMPACTS CREDIT CARD USERS Transparency in credit card terms
Banks are obligated to disclose all terms, including interest rates, to credit card applicants. Customers are made aware of penalties for delayed payments and high-interest charges on unpaid dues. No relief for defaulting borrowers
Cardholders struggling with overdue payments may feel the pinch, as the ruling empowers banks to levy steep interest rates—sometimes exceeding 36%. This underscores the importance of timely payments to avoid financial strain. RBI's role remains intact
The court clarified that the RBI is the sole authority to regulate bank interest rates. There’s no evidence that banks violated RBI’s policies, reaffirming the central bank’s oversight.WHAT’S NEXT FOR CREDIT CARD USERS? While the judgment secures banks’ autonomy, it serves as a wake-up call for consumers to better manage their credit card spending. Avoiding interest accumulation and paying dues on time can mitigate the impact of high rates. This ruling highlights the balance between financial institution autonomy and consumer awareness. While banks gain legal backing for high interest rates, the onus lies on customers to remain financially disciplined and make informed decisions.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

This change, decided by the GST Council under Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, applies to old and used vehicles, including electric cars (EVs). Here's everything you need to know about this significant development.advertisementFAQS ON GST FOR USED CARSDo I have to pay GST when selling my used car to an individual?
No, GST is not applicable if you sell your car directly to another individual. Do I have to pay GST when selling my used car to an individual?
No, GST is not applicable if you sell your car directly to another individual. Will the GST hike increase used car prices?
If you purchase a car from an individual, the GST hike won’t affect the price. However, buying from dealers or platforms like OLX or CarDekho may lead to higher prices, as GST applies to the dealer’s margin. What is the GST on used EVs?
A standard 18% GST now applies to all used vehicles, including EVs and SUVs. How is GST calculated on used cars?
GST applies only to the margin—the difference between the selling price and depreciated value. For instance, if a car is bought for Rs 10 lakh and sold for Rs 15 lakh with a depreciated value of Rs 12 lakh, GST will be charged on the Rs 3 lakh margin. Who is most affected by this GST hike?
Dealers and platforms selling used cars are most impacted, as the higher tax reduces margins. Some businesses may absorb the cost, while others might pass it on to buyers.IMPACT OF THE GST HIKE For buyers: If you’re buying from an individual, prices remain unaffected. Purchases from dealers may cost more. For sellers: Individuals selling directly face no impact. For dealers: The hike increases costs, with startups and dealers in the used car market feeling the pinch. The GST rate hike on used cars aims to streamline tax slabs but brings mixed implications. While it may raise costs for businesses and buyers using platforms, it could reduce second-hand EV costs in some cases, providing a potential upside for green mobility enthusiasts.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

In an interview with news agency ANI, Adani shared his insight on the work-life balance and said, ""If you like what you do, you will have work-life balance."" However, he also emphasised that one must not impose their idea of work-life balance onto others.  ""Your work-life balance should not be imposed on me, and my work-life balance shouldn't be imposed on you. However, one must ensure they spend at least four hours with their families,"" the Adani Group Chairperson said. 
 
 On a lighter note, the industrialist said, ""For instance, if someone spends eight hours with family, their wife may run away,"" to which people around could be heard laughing.  ""The thing is, you should see how much time can you take out for family and if you are happy, and your family is happy with it, it should be fine,"" Adani concluded. The industrialist's remarks come at a time when the issue of extended work hours is a raging debate in India and there is chatter about work-life balance. Last year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy had sparked a big debate after he suggested that Indians should work 70 hours a week to help the nation progress. In November this year, he reiterated his remarks and said he didn't agree with the idea of ""work-life balance"". Narayana Murthy expressed disappointment over India’s transition from a six-day to a five-day work week in 1986. “I am sorry, I have not changed my view. I will take this with me to my grave,” he said. The thought was echoed by Daksh Gupta, an Indian-origin CEO who runs the artificial intelligence startup Greptile in San Francisco. He said that his company operates on an 84-hour workweek with “no work-life balance.”Published By: Poorva JoshiPublished On: Dec 26, 2024

These words resonate deeply today as the nation mourns the loss of its former Prime Minister and Finance Minister, who died at the age of 92 in New Delhi.  The former PM widely regarded as the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, played a pivotal role in transforming the country’s economy during a time of severe crisis. His tenure as Finance Minister in the early 1990s and later as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014 introduced policies that continue to influence India’s growth. Known for his humility and academic brilliance, Singh’s economic reforms and social welfare programmes remain his enduring legacy.INDIA’S 1991 ECONOMIC CRISIS

 



Manmohan Sigh was elected as Finance Minister in 1991.
 When Singh was appointed Finance Minister in 1991 by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, India was on the brink of an economic collapse. The foreign exchange reserves had dwindled to levels that could barely cover a few weeks of essential imports like oil and fertilisers. Inflation was rising, the fiscal deficit was widening, and India faced a balance of payments crisis. Adding to the challenge, the Soviet Union, a key trading partner, had collapsed, cutting off a major source of cheap oil and raw materials. The situation demanded urgent and bold action. Singh, with his deep understanding of economics, introduced a series of sweeping reforms to stabilise the economy and pave the way for long-term growth.THE 1991 ECONOMIC REFORMS Manmohan Singh’s reforms were centred around liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation, which fundamentally changed the Indian economy. Some of the key reforms were: Devaluation of the Rupee and trade liberalisation - In July 1991, the Reserve Bank of India pledged 46.91 tonnes of gold with the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan to raise $400 million, stabilising the immediate crisis. Singh then devalued the rupee to make Indian exports more competitive in global markets. He also reduced import tariffs and dismantled restrictions on foreign trade, allowing India to integrate with the global economy. Industrial policy reforms: Abolishing the Licence Raj - On July 24, 1991, Singh presented a new industrial policy that ended the ‘Licence Raj.’ Previously, industries required government approval for most operations, including expansion and production. The new policy deregulated nearly 80% of the industrial sector, reducing the number of industries reserved exclusively for the public sector from 17 to 8. This move encouraged private enterprises and foreign investment, fostering industrial growth and job creation. Banking and financial sector reforms - The financial sector underwent significant changes under his leadership. Following the Narasimham Committee’s recommendations, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) was reduced from 38.5% to 25%, and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was lowered from 25% to 10% over a few years. These measures allowed banks to lend more freely, supporting economic expansion. Licensing requirements for bank branches were eased, and interest rates were deregulated, creating a more competitive and efficient banking system. His reforms not only saved India from the brink of collapse but also laid the foundation for sustained economic growth. The policies attracted foreign investments, boosted exports, and created new industries. Millions of Indians were lifted out of poverty as job opportunities expanded. By dismantling socialist controls, India transitioned into a market-driven economy, setting the stage for its rise as one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.LEGACY AS PRIME MINISTER

 Singh’s contributions went beyond his tenure as Finance Minister. As Prime Minister, he championed initiatives that targeted India’s rural and underprivileged population, recognising that economic growth alone could not bridge the gap between urban and rural India. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) - Launched in 2005, this programme guaranteed 100 days of wage employment annually to rural households. It addressed poverty, underemployment, and rural distress, becoming a cornerstone of his government. Right to Information (RTI) and Right to Education (RTE) - Singh’s government introduced the RTI Act, empowering citizens with access to government information. The RTE Act aimed to provide free and compulsory education to children aged 6-14, ensuring education as a fundamental right. Manmohan Singh was not only a politician but also a distinguished economist. He held roles at the Reserve Bank of India, Planning Commission, and International Monetary Fund (IMF) before entering politics. His expertise earned him respect globally, with many recognising his efforts to integrate India into the global economy. His economic liberalisation policies transformed India into one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. He dismantled socialist regulations, attracting foreign investment and creating jobs. His legacy includes a modernised industrial sector, a strengthened banking system, and policies that uplifted millions from poverty. As India mourns his loss, history indeed remembers Dr Manmohan Singh kindly—as the architect of modern India’s economic journey and a leader whose policies continue to shape the nation’s future.

The listing comes after the company’s initial public offering (IPO) witnessed robust demand, with subscriptions exceeding 36 times the total shares on offer. The IPO, open between December 19 and December 24, aimed to raise Rs 550 crore, comprising a Rs 400 crore fresh issue and a Rs 150 crore Offer for Sale (OFS). The proceeds will be used to repay debts (Rs 160 crore), fund investments in its subsidiary, Sanathan Polycot Pvt. Ltd. (Rs 140 crore), and for general corporate purposes (Rs 100 crore). Investor interest was led by institutional buyers, with their portion subscribed 75.62 times, while non-institutional and retail investors subscribed 42.18 times and 8.84 times, respectively. The IPO drew bids worth over Rs 14,000 crore, a testament to the market’s enthusiasm. Sanathan Textiles operates in three verticals: polyester yarn products, cotton yarn products, and technical and industrial textile yarns. It caters to a diverse customer base, including multinational and local companies. The polyester yarn segment is its largest contributor, accounting for 76.8% of revenue in the first quarter of FY25. Financially, the company has faced a slight decline in performance. In FY24, Sanathan Textiles reported revenue of Rs 2,957 crore, down from Rs 3,329 crore in FY23. Its profit after tax (PAT) also dropped to Rs 134 crore from Rs 152.7 crore. Margins have narrowed slightly, with an EBITDA margin of 7.6% in FY24 compared to 7.8% in FY23. SHOULD YOU HOLD OR SELL? Analysts remain cautious despite the strong listing. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, noted the company's shrinking margins and declining profitability as concerns. While the IPO was reasonably priced, Nyati suggests investors consider booking profits given the attractive 31% listing gains. “Company made a quiet stock market debut, listing at a significant 31% premium over its issue price of Rs. 321. Those who took part in the initial public offering (IPO) may take listing gains profit,” Nyati said. With a focus on reducing debt and expanding its business verticals, Sanathan Textiles aims for steady growth. However, investors must weigh the company’s fundamentals against broader market conditions before deciding to hold or sell.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

The sharp drop surprised many investors, but the apparent plunge was due to the stock split, which adjusted the face value from Rs 10 to Rs 5 per share. Certain trading apps may be displaying the unadjusted previous closing price, leading to the perception of a 50% fall. Adjusted for the split, Mazagon Dock shares were trading 2.13% lower on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at 11:09 am. In the previous session, the stock registered gains as more people bought it before the stock split adjustment.  The stock split aligns with the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) guidelines on capital restructuring. According to the company, the move aims to enhance liquidity and encourage broader participation from retail investors. Mazagon Dock is a leading shipbuilder in India and specialises in constructing advanced vessels for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard. Since its inception, it has built 802 vessels, including warships, submarines, and commercial ships. It is on track to complete significant projects by December 2024, such as the 6th Scorpene submarine, the final 15B destroyer, and the first 17A frigate. The company also competes for additional defense projects, including three Scorpene submarines under Project 75I, in partnership with a German designer. It has outlined plans to double its capacity by acquiring 55 acres of land near its existing facilities, with a capex of Rs 5,000 crore spread over the next five years. Mazagon Dock maintains strong financial health, with Rs 4,000 crore in reserves earmarked for capacity expansion. The company has reduced dividend payouts to prioritize growth. Arihant Capital Markets highlighted that Mazagon Dock's profit margins are benefiting from cost efficiencies and timely project completions. Margins are expected to normalize between 12% and 15% in the long term. Despite minor delays, Mazagon Dock remains optimistic about its schedule, with its strategic expansion plans solidifying its position in the defense shipbuilding industry.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

The company announced that he succumbed to lymphoma on December 25. Born Osamu Matsuda on January 30, 1930, in Gero, Japan, Suzuki joined the automaker in 1958 after marrying into the founding family. Taking on his wife’s surname, he began a transformative journey that would see Suzuki Motor become a household name in small cars and motorcycles worldwide. Suzuki’s leadership, which spanned decades, included two terms as president, making him the longest-serving head of a global automaker. Under his guidance, Suzuki Motor formed strategic alliances with General Motors and Volkswagen, leveraging partnerships to expand its footprint across North America and Europe. His boldest move, however, was entering the Indian market in the 1980s. In 1982, Suzuki forged a joint venture with the Indian government, leading to the creation of Maruti Udyog. The partnership introduced the Maruti 800, a small car that became an instant hit and cemented Suzuki’s dominance in the Indian market. Today, Maruti Suzuki remains the largest carmaker in India, contributing significantly to the company’s global sales. Suzuki’s tenure was not without challenges. He faced a fuel-economy testing scandal in Japan, which led to his resignation as CEO in 2016. Yet, his commitment to the company’s resilience and growth remained unwavering. Even in his later years, Suzuki played an advisory role, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and market leadership in the automotive world. His contributions to the industry and his leadership in expanding Suzuki Motor’s global presence remain unparalleled.Published By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 27, 2024

I suggest to this August House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea. Let the whole world hear it loud and clear,” said Dr Manmohan Singh during his first budget speech on July 24, 1991, as India embarked on its journey of economic liberalisation. And rightly so, since India has not looked back and scaled new heights to emerge as an economic powerhouse and ranks fifth globally in GDP for 2024.  The foundation for this growth was laid by Former Finance and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, known as the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, who died in Delhi at the age of 92, leaving behind a lasting legacy. His policies, introduced during a time of economic crisis in the early 1990s, reshaped India’s economy and transformed the Indian stock markets. Singh’s policies came at a time of deep financial distress for India, with foreign reserves nearly depleted and the country on the brink of economic collapse. The reforms he introduced were historic, dismantling decades of restrictive controls and opening the economy to global markets.TRANSFORMATIVE ECONOMIC REFORMS Manmohan Singh’s tenure as Finance Minister saw the implementation of bold measures that liberalised India’s economy. The most notable among them were the abolition of the Licence Raj, opening the economy to foreign investment, reducing import tariffs, and introducing fiscal discipline. ""Singh also led various institutional reforms, including the formation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) as the regulatory authority, which marked a critical step in ensuring transparency and accountability in the stock market,"" said Palka Arora Chopra. Director, Master Capital Services.  The reforms introduced back then laid the groundwork for the India we know today. They transformed India’s economic structure, making it more competitive and globally integrated. This also created a strong foundation for the Indian stock market to flourish.A REMARKABLE RISE IN THE STOCK MARKET The liberalisation measures had a direct and long-lasting impact on the Indian stock market. In 1991, the Sensex was trading at around 1,000 points. Today, it has surged past the 78,000 mark, delivering exponential returns to investors over three decades. ""As the nation pays homage to Manmohan Singh, the architect of liberalisation in India, investors must be acknowledging with gratitude the wealth created by the Indian stock market after the initiation of liberalisation in 1991. Sensex which was around 1000 in 1991 has multiplied about 780 times since then to trade above 78000 now delivering excellent returns to long-term investors. The market will continue to deliver superior returns to investors in the years to come since the India Growth Story, which liberalisation triggered, is very much intact,"" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.  ""Singh also took steps to strengthen Sebi in 1992, enhancing transparency and regulatory oversight, which in turn helped build trust among investors. By opening the market to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), he not only attracted essential capital but also positioned India as a key investment destination, laying the groundwork for sustained market growth,"" said Trivesh, COO Tradejini. ECONOMIC BOOM DURING HIS PRIME MINISTERIAL TENURE Manmohan Singh’s contributions were not limited to his tenure as Finance Minister. As Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014, he oversaw a period of robust economic growth, with GDP growing at an average of 6.9% annually. His government’s focus on infrastructure development, increased foreign investment, and policy stability further boosted investor confidence. ""India’s GDP growth averaged around 6.9% during Singh’s first term as India’s Prime Minister, underpinned by a boom in major sectors and increased infrastructure spending. The stock market soared as businesses expanded and foreign investors began to view India as an attractive destination. The period witnessed one of the strongest bull runs in Indian stock market history, driven by a combination of economic growth, structural reforms and rapid expansion,"" said Chopra.  The boom during this period saw increased participation from foreign institutional investors, significant growth in key sectors like IT, banking, and manufacturing, and the emergence of Indian companies as global players. ""Manmohan Singh's contribution to the Indian economy, particularly in terms of GDP growth, has been extraordinary. His financial expertise in particular was crucial in devaluing the Indian rupee, which helped stabilise our economy. To us, he will always be a leader whose policies prioritise social equity and inclusive development,"" said VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today Explained.  As the nation mourns the loss of one of its greatest economic architects, his words, “India is now wide awake. We shall prevail. We shall overcome,” continues to resonate.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/15-income-tax-changes-in-2024-what-you-need-to-know-for-filing-itr-in-2025-income-tax-rules-stmp-2656139-2024-12-27,"The year 2024 brought significant changes to income tax laws, altering how taxpayers will approach filing their Income Tax Returns (ITRs) in 2025. With the backdrop of general elections earlier in the year, the government introduced sweeping changes to income tax laws, many of which are already in effect for FY 2024-25. These reforms—ranging from revamped tax slabs to new rules for capital gains and TDS—promise to impact how you plan, save, and file your Income Tax Return (ITR) in 2025. Confused about how these changes affect you? Here’s a concise breakdown of the 10 most significant updates and their implications on your finances. Get ready to plan smarter and save better!REVISED INCOME TAX SLABS UNDER THE NEW REGIME The new tax regime has introduced revised income tax slabs designed to benefit individual taxpayers. Under the updated structure, income up to Rs 3,00,000 is exempt from tax, while earnings between Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000 are taxed at 5%. Income from Rs 7,00,001 to Rs 10,00,000 is taxed at 10%, and the next bracket, Rs 10,00,001 to Rs 12,00,000, is taxed at 15%. For earnings between Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000, the tax rate is 20%, and any income above Rs 15,00,000 is taxed at 30%. These changes offer taxpayers opting for the new regime the opportunity to save up to Rs 17,500 annually.INCREASED STANDARD DEDUCTION LIMIT For those under the new tax regime, the standard deduction limit has risen to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000. Family pensioners, too, see a hike to Rs 25,000 from Rs 15,000. The old tax regime retains the existing Rs 50,000 limit for salaried individuals and Rs 15,000 for family pensioners. This increase in deductions under the new regime effectively lowers taxable income, enhancing its appeal to a broader range of taxpayers.ENHANCED NPS DEDUCTION FOR EMPLOYERS’ CONTRIBUTION Under the new tax regime, individuals can now claim deductions of up to 14% of their basic salary for employer contributions to the National Pension System (NPS), up from 10%. However, contributions exceeding Rs 7.5 lakh across EPF, NPS, and superannuation funds remain taxable, ensuring balanced benefits within specified limits.SIMPLIFIED CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION Capital gains taxation has been simplified under the new framework. Short-term capital gains (STCG) on equity and equity-oriented funds are now taxed at 20%, up from 15%, while long-term capital gains (LTCG) on all assets are uniformly taxed at 12.5%. Equity and equity-oriented funds continue to enjoy an annual exemption of up to Rs 1.25 lakh. However, these changes simplify tax calculations but limit indexation benefits for certain assets.RATIONALISED TDS RATES To reduce complexity, TDS (tax deducted at source) rates have been rationalised for various payments, such as insurance commissions (2%), rent (2%), and e-commerce payments (0.1%). This rationalisation reduces upfront tax deductions, allowing taxpayers to retain more money initially.CLAIMING TDS AND TCS CREDIT AGAINST SALARY Salaried individuals can now adjust TDS or TCS (tax collected at source) deductions from other sources of income against TDS on their salary, easing cash flow concerns and ensuring higher monthly take-home pay.CHANGES IN TDS ON PROPERTY SALES For property sales exceeding Rs 50 lakh, TDS is now applicable on the entire sale value, irrespective of individual sellers’ shares, enhancing compliance and preventing TDS evasion.VIVAD SE VISHWAS SCHEME 2.0 The Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme 2.0 has been reintroduced to help resolve ongoing tax disputes amicably. This provides taxpayers with an opportunity to settle their cases efficiently, reducing uncertainties.AADHAAR MANDATORY FOR ITR AND PAN APPLICATIONS Starting October 2024, individuals will no longer be able to use their Aadhaar enrolment numbers for filing ITR or applying for PAN. Aadhaar itself will be mandatory for these processes. Now, those without Aadhaar will face difficulties in completing these tasks.REDUCED TIME LIMIT FOR OLD ITR REVISIONS The time limit for reopening old ITRs has been reduced to five years for cases involving income escaping assessments above Rs 50 lakh. This change aims to minimise prolonged litigation and provide greater certainty for taxpayers. The tax changes in 2024 aim to simplify processes, enhance compliance, and offer select benefits. Taxpayers should evaluate old versus new regimes and stay informed to optimise savings while meeting their obligations. The evolving tax landscape underscores the need for careful planning and timely action.Published By: Jasmine anandPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Trending Reel
