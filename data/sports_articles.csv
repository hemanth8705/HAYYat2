Samson now appears to be in pole position to become India’s T20 opener following the dual retirements of Kohli and Sharma after the T20 World Cup victory earlier this year. His three centuries in four T20Is against Bangladesh and South Africa have firmly signaled his intent to secure that spot. ""Yeah, it has been. I had a decent relationship with Gautam Gambir right from a young age. My first IPL team was KKR. When I was 14, they picked me on their B team. At the age of 17, I made it to the KKR main side and that was when KKR won the Championship under Gautam Gambhir,"" Samson said in an interview with the former South African captain, AB de Villiers on YouTube.  Samson's association with Gambhir extended beyond the IPL. The wicketkeeper-batter recounted how Gambhir's words during their time in the Indian team's dressing room bolstered his confidence. ""When he came to the Indian team, in the dressing room he told me 'Sanju, I know what you have. You have something special. I am going to be back you no matter what'. He told me to walk in, go out there and express myself in every innings. That kind of communication from the coach, that gave me clarity and confidence.  The Kerala-born cricketer also spoke about the pressure of living up to Gambhir's faith, especially after a string of low scores. ""After few games of dismissals, you feel pressure because you have a guy who's backing you and you are not performing. I thought 'common Sanju, you need to show something and repay the faith the coach has in',"" Samson added. Samson's determination eventually paid off, and he has since become a vital player in India's cricketing ecosystem. Reflecting on his journey, he expressed gratitude for the turning points in his career. ""By God's grace, something special has happened. I want to continue scoring runs and win games for my country,"" he concluded.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Explained: What the new India-Pakistan ICC agreement means for world cricket

Ravichandran said he had come to terms with his son's decision but admitted that he wished Ashwin had continued playing for the senior national team. ""What was going on in his mind I don’t know.

However, the veteran off-spinner was dropped for the third Test in Brisbane and Ravindra Jadeja took his spot in the XI.

While the decision worked out well for both countries, here's how it affects the rest of the cricketing world.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/india-vs-pakistan-champions-trophy-nuetral-venues-explained-2652458-2024-12-19,"The International Cricket Council on December 19, Thursday, announced that India and Pakistan will play their matches in ICC tournaments at neutral venues till 2028. The deal was announced by the ICC during the confirmation of hybrid model for Champions Trophy 2025.  ICC announced that India will be playing their matches for the Champions Trophy 2025 on a neutral venue - likely UAE - and in return, Pakistan do not need to travel to India to play any world tournaments till 2028 - including the 2026 men's T20 World Cup.  While the Champions Trophy stand-off after India's refusal to travel across the border ended, the new agreement has given rise to fresh concerns.  The ICC released a statement confirming that ""India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue,"" as reported by India Today last week. This will mean that Pakistan will not travel to India for their matches during the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the T20 World Cup in 2026. The tournament, scheduled to begin on February 19 in Pakistan, faced uncertainty due to India's refusal to travel to the host nation. The ICC reiterated in its statement: ""This will apply to the upcoming ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 (hosted by Pakistan), set to be played in February and March 2025, as well as the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 (hosted by India) and the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 (hosted by India and Sri Lanka)."" The statement also announced that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been awarded the hosting rights for the ICC Women's T20 World Cup in 2028, where neutral venue arrangements will also apply.ICC Statement Key Pointers
Champions Trophy will be played in Pakistan, India matches at neutral venue
The 50-over tournament will be played in February-March in 2025
The hybrid model rule will apply for all ICC tournaments hosted by India and Pakistan in 2024-27 cycle
Pakistan will not travel to India for Women's World Cup in 2025 and T20 World Cup in 2026
Pakistan have been awarded the hosting rights for Women's T20 World Cup in 2028
As India Today reported, no compensation for Pakistan for losing a part of Champions Trophy hosting rights 
The schedule for ICC Champions Trophy will be confirmed soon
What Does This Mean for the Rest? While India and Pakistan play at the comfort of their neutral venues in the ICC tournaments, the major problems will be faced by the rest of the cricketing nations who would have to travel more than usual, if they are pitted against India and Pakistan.  Take the 2023 Asia Cup for example. the Asian Cricket Council tournament was co-hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka as India refused travel to Pakistan for the tournament. India were stationed in Sri Lanka with the other teams forced to travel to and fro between countries - playing in drastically different conditions. For example, Bangladesh started their tournament in Pallekele on Ausgust 31, flew out to Lahore to play Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the travelled back to Sri Lanka to play their final two matches - in a space of two weeks. The fate was more or less same for the other countries depending on how deep they went into the tournament. Former BCB operations chairman had spoken to the media where he had sounded helpless about the issue. ""After playing our first match in Kandy, we have to go to Lahore for the second. There is nothing to do, it was ACC's decision. To make the journey a bit more comfortable, the ACC will provide us with a chartered plane. All the teams who have matches in both countries will get the same,"" Jalal had said during the tournament. ""There is always a little discomfort when you have to travel so much. We all know that you have to go to the airport two hours before a flight and have to carry your luggage too. Then there is the issue of jet lag. The distance between Sri Lanka and Pakistan is very long. We have nothing we can do, everyone will playing like this and we have to be okay with ACC's decision,"" he had further added.   Now the question rises, is that fair for the other boards? Forget Asia Cup - a tournament of only 6 teams, the T20 World Cup 2026 is set to have 20 teams in total, out of which upto 12 different teams might end up playing India and Pakistan, in potentially two different countries.ICC Needs to Do Better India Today reported that all major stakeholder boards in international cricket were consulted when the ICC discussed the possibility of adopting a hybrid model. While the boards may not raise concerns regarding the Champions Trophy 2025, logistical challenges could pose significant issues for teams in larger tournaments in the future. If the hybrid model becomes more prevalent due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, the ICC would do well to establish a long-term solution to these challenges. Engaging with member boards before awarding hosting rights and finalising schedules well in advance could help mitigate potential disruptions, ensuring players, broadcasters, and fans face fewer inconveniences. Broadcasters, who are instrumental in bolstering the financial health of the sport, would also welcome such a proactive approach. It would spare them the uncertainty of waiting until the last minute to confirm venues and schedules. The Champions Trophy, expected to take place between February and March, still does not have official venues. Neither the boards nor the fans know where they will need to travel to watch their favourite cricketers in action. The ICC must recognise that its tournaments are global. For cricket to truly grow as a worldwide sport, these events must prioritise fan experience and seamless organisation. Otherwise, the aspiration of making cricket a genuinely global sport will remain a distant dream. With cricket set to feature in the 2028 Olympics, fostering a better global image for the sport has never been more crucial.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

Donnarumma’s face was bloodied after being struck by his opponent’s cleat in PSG’s 4-2 victory over Monaco on Wednesday. The Italy international was struck by Singo's studs in the 17th minute as the Monaco defender attempted to hurdle over the sliding goalkeeper after his shot was blocked. Instead, Singo's cleats struck Donnarumma, leaving him with multiple cuts and visible trauma below his right eye. Acknowledging the severity of the injury, Singo took to social media to express remorse. ""My gesture was obviously not intentional, but I was able to see afterwards that he had a significant injury to his face,"" he wrote in French and Italian. ""I wish you a good recovery."" Donnarumma required on-field treatment before being replaced by backup goalkeeper Matvey Safonov. PSG later confirmed the 24-year-old suffered ""a facial trauma with multiple wounds"" and would undergo further medical assessments. Photos of Donnarumma's injuries circulated widely, drawing attention to Singo's earlier yellow card. Despite calls for stricter punishment, officials deemed the collision unintentional, allowing Singo to remain in the game. PSG overcame the early loss of their star goalkeeper and a 2-1 deficit in the second half to secure the win. Gonçalo Ramos scored to level the match, and Ousmane Dembélé delivered a brace to ensure victory, extending PSG's unbeaten league run to 16 matches. ""The objective was achieved. It was a difficult match, we weren't up to par at all times, but they knew how to come back and take the lead,"" PSG manager Luis Enrique said post-match. ""I'm happy with the result."" The win gives PSG a commanding 10-point lead atop the Ligue 1 standings as they enter the Christmas break with 40 points. Olympique de Marseille and Monaco, both on 30 points, trail the league leaders, with Marseille holding a game in hand. While the result reinforces PSG's dominance, Donnarumma's condition remains a concern for the club as they prepare for the remainder of the season.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim on Rashford situation: I will handle itTrending Reel

Badrinath said Ashwin's unexpected decision left him shocked, adding that the off-spinner deserved to exit on a high. R Ashwin surprised many by retiring midway through the all-important Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Minutes after India drew the third Test in Brisbane, Ashwin announced his retirement during a press conference alongside captain Rohit Sharma at the Gabba. Rohit revealed that Ashwin had discussed his retirement plans at the start of the Australia tour and that he had convinced the off-spinner to play the second Test in Adelaide. When asked if Ashwin should have continued until the end of the series, Rohit defended the spinner's decision, emphasising that Ashwin had every right to choose when to step away. Also Read: R Ashwin, a student of the game and professor of spin, leaves an unmatched legacy Amid discussions surrounding the timing of Ashwin's retirement, S Badrinath defended the off-spinner, attributing the decision to the treatment he received over the years. ""I am shocked. I think, to be honest, he wasn't treated fairly. Rohit Sharma said he wanted to leave after the Perth Test match. He wanted to leave when Washington Sundar was played ahead of him. That tells you he was not happy,"" Badrinath told Star Sports Tamil. ""Honestly, I am saying something-it's a big thing for a cricketer from Tamil Nadu. There are many reasons for that. Players from a few other states get better chances. Despite all these odds, Ashwin went on to take more than 500 wickets and became a legend. ""Imagine what he must have gone through. I know he has faced quite a few things. On many occasions, efforts were made to sideline him. But every time, he has bounced back like a phoenix bird,"" he added.I FEEL BAD FOR ASHWIN: BADRINATH Badrinath argued that Ashwin deserved a grand farewell and suggested that players from other states might not have faced the same treatment. ""He can quit cricket, but this is not the way he should have gone out. It should have been a glorious exit. He deserved a glorious exit. It's not fair, it's not right. ""He has not been treated properly. I have closely followed his progress. Because he is from Tamil Nadu, he has faced this. If you ask me if it would have happened with a cricketer from any other state, I don't think so. ""I feel bad for Ashwin. This exit should not have been like this,"" Badrinath added. Notably, R Ashwin's father, in a television interview on Thursday, claimed that Ashwin was humiliated, which he suggested could have been one of the reasons for his sudden retirement. Ashwin, however, remained tight-lipped about the timing of his decision, maintaining that he had no regrets about his cricketing career. The off-spinner said he was already looking forward to representing the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL 2025. Ashwin departed Australia and returned to Chennai as early as Thursday. Meanwhile, the rest of the Indian team travelled from Brisbane to Melbourne, where the Boxing Day Test will be played from December 26.

Speculation around Rashford's tenure at Old Trafford has intensified, particularly after the player’s own comments about seeking a “new challenge” added fuel to the fire. The 27-year-old forward, a product of United’s academy since the age of seven, finds himself at a crossroads. His role under Amorim has been a subject of uncertainty, leading to doubts about his long-term stay at the club. During the pre-match press conference ahead of United's Carabao Cup clash against Tottenham Hotspur on December 20, Amorim refrained from providing detailed answers on Rashford’s situation, emphasising his intent to manage it internally. “It’s a hard situation to comment on...""If this was me, probably I would speak with the manager,"" Amorim said. “If I give a lot of importance to it, it will have big headlines in the papers and if I say it’s not a problem, then my standards are getting low. So I will deal with that, I understand that,” he added. Despite Manchester United’s morale-boosting 2-1 victory over rivals Manchester City on Sunday, Rashford’s absence from the squad, alongside teammate Alejandro Garnacho, sparked further questions. Amorim later clarified that the decision stemmed from his commitment to maintaining high standards within the team, but the omission has only heightened rumors of a potential sale. Rashford’s struggles to recapture his electrifying form from the 2022-23 season, where he scored 30 goals across all competitions, have not gone unnoticed. Under Amorim, who took charge last month, the England international has netted just three goals and has failed to make a significant impact. In United’s Europa League win against Viktoria Plzen, Rashford was substituted as early as the 56th minute, a decision that was met with boos from sections of the Old Trafford crowd. The mounting frustration among fans and the lack of clarity over Rashford’s future have contributed to an uneasy atmosphere. However, Amorim’s direct approach to the matter indicates a focus on resolving the situation without unnecessary public scrutiny. As Manchester United prepare for their Carabao Cup clash, the spotlight remains on Rashford’s next move. Whether the forward reignites his United career or embarks on a new chapter, Amorim’s handling of the scenario could prove pivotal in shaping the club’s immediate future.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  PSG's Donnarumma leaves field bloodied after boot to the face tackle vs Monaco

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/wouldnt-have-let-r-ashwin-retire-like-this-he-deserves-respect-kapil-dev-2652324-2024-12-19,"Former India skipper Kapil Dev was not happy that the star off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin retired from international cricket without getting a proper farewell. Earlier on Wednesday, Ashwin appeared alongside India's captain Rohit Sharma at the post-match press conference to make the announcement. Speculation about his retirement had intensified after Ashwin became visibly emotional and was embraced by Virat Kohli. ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar...Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there, I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,"" Kapil Dev said as quoted by ANI. Ashwin finishes his career with 537 wickets in 106 Test matches, placing him seventh on the all-time wicket-takers list, behind Anil Kumble's tally of 619 for India. His strike rate of 50.73 is the highest among the nine bowlers with over 500 wickets, while his bowling average of 24 ranks third. He achieved five or more wickets in a Test innings on 37 occasions, a number bettered only by Muttiah Muralitharan, who achieved it 67 times. Shane Warne also managed this feat on 37 occasions. Ashwin has also claimed ten or more wickets in a Test match eight times, the highest among Indian bowlers, alongside Kumble. Ashwin's remarkable success at home has contributed significantly to India's impressive record in home Tests over the past decade. He has played every home Test since his debut in 2011, spanning 65 matches. Of those 65 home Tests, India won 47; only Sachin Tendulkar has featured in more Test wins (52). Among all players, only Alastair Cook (89) played more home Tests than Ashwin without missing any. Among all-rounders, the previous highest was Tony Greig (31), and among bowlers, it was Dilip Doshi (21). The Tamil Nadu cricketer is the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket and the second-highest for India, trailing only the legendary Anil Kumble. Ashwin's tally of five-wicket hauls is second only to Sri Lankan great Muttiah Muralitharan. Kapil Dev, who led India to its maiden World Cup triumph in 1983, also highlighted the evolution of Indian cricket and the legacy left behind by players like Ashwin. ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead.

Ravichandran added that he had hoped his son would continue playing for the senior national team.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ashwin-retires-father-ravichandran-humilation-shock-decison-2652272-2024-12-19,"R Ashwin's father, Ravichandran, revealed that the off-spinner's retirement decision came as a surprise to many in their family, adding that he wanted his son to continue playing for the senior national team. Ravichandran alleged that his son was being humiliated, which he suggested could have been one of the reasons for Ashwin's sudden retirement from international cricket. While Ravichandran did not elaborate on the specifics of his allegation, it appears he was alluding to the lack of consistent opportunities for Ashwin in overseas Tests. Ashwin reitred from international cricket midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The off-spinner announced his decision, minutes after the third Test between India and Australia ended in Brisbane on Wednesday, December 18. Ashwin reached Chennai as early as Thursday morning.  ""I too came to know (about his retirement) in the last minute, actually,"" Ravichandran told News18.  ""Retiring is his wish and desire, I cannot interfere in that, but the way in which he gave that, there could be many reasons. Only Ashwin knows, maybe humiliation,"" he added.  When asked if the family was emotional when Ashwin dropped the bombshell on Wednesday, Ashwin's father said: ""No doubt about it (emotional moment for the family) because he was on the field for 14-15 years. The sudden change, retirement, gave us really kind of a shock. ""At the same time, we were expecting that also because humiliation was going on. How long he can just tolerate all those things? Probably, he would have decided on his own,"" he added.  Ashwin's father has been a pillar of support in the off-spinner's career. A fast bowler at club-level cricket, Ravichandran encouraged his son to take up the sport. Ashwin's father backed him when the Tamil Nadu cricketer made the switch from a batter to an off-spinner in a bid to break into the state's Ranji Trophy team as a teenager. MIXED EMOTIONS FOR ASHWIN'S FATHER Ravichandran said he had come to terms with his son's decision but admitted that he wished Ashwin had continued playing for the senior national team. ""What was going on in his mind I don’t know. He just announced. I too accepted it with full pleasure. I did not have any feeling at all for that. But the way he gave his retirement, one part I was very happy, another part not happy because he should have continued,"" he said.  Ashwin chose not to stay with the rest f the squad for the last two Tests of the crucial series. Melbourne will host the Boxing Day Test and Sydney will host the New Year's Test. Both the iconic venues offer more assistance to spin than other pitches Down Under.  Notably, legendary Sunil Gavaskar had criticised the timing of Ashwin's retirement and said Washington Sundar's emergence might have influenced the off-spinner's mid-series retirement.  India picked Sundar ahead of R Ashwin for the first Test of the series in Perth. Ashwin returned to play the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. However, the veteran off-spinner was dropped for the third Test in Brisbane and Ravindra Jadeja took his spot in the XI.  Ashwin has been consistently left out of the XI in overseas Tests, especially in England and Australia. Jadeja was preferred as the lone spinner in the XI because of his better ability with the bat.

Maharaj suffered a left abductor strain during the warm-up session ahead of the first ODI on December 17 and was unable to take the field. Subsequent scans confirmed the injury, sidelining him for the second and third ODIs scheduled for December 19 and December 22. Bjorn Fortuin has been named as Maharaj's replacement for the remaining games. This setback comes just a day after Maharaj was included in South Africa's Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against Pakistan. The Test series, starting on December 26 in Centurion, holds significant importance for South Africa as they aim to secure a spot in next year's World Test Championship (WTC) final. The Proteas currently sit atop the WTC standings with a PCT of 63.33 and need one more win to guarantee a top-two finish. Maharaj will now return to Durban for rehabilitation and will be monitored ahead of the Boxing Day Test. His role as the team’s primary specialist spinner is crucial, having recently delivered a match-winning performance against Sri Lanka in Gqeberha, where he took 5 for 76 to clinch victory. The injury adds to South Africa's growing list of unavailable bowlers. Key pacer Anrich Nortje is sidelined with a fractured toe, Gerald Coetzee and Lungi Ngidi are nursing groin and hip injuries, Nandre Burger is out for the summer due to a stress fracture, and all-rounder Wiaan Mulder is recovering from a finger injury sustained against Sri Lanka. In case Maharaj fails to recover in time for the Test series, options such as Dane Piedt, Senuran Muthusamy, Neil Brand, and Shaun von Berg may be considered. Tabraiz Shamsi, who last played first-class cricket in 2021, also presents a potential, though less likely, alternative. South Africa will look to make up for Maharaj's absence in the ODIs as they aim to continue their strong form against Pakistan. The Test series that follows will further test their depth and resilience as they chase a spot in the WTC final.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Not easy for Mohammed Siraj to support world-class Jasprit Bumrah: Brett Lee

Despite their best efforts, Lee believes the gap between Bumrah’s brilliance and the support acts is undeniable. Bumrah has been a standout player in this BGT series, already claiming 21 wickets across three Tests. His devastating spells have left the Australian batting lineup scrambling on Day 5 of the Brisbane Test, proving his mettle as one of the finest fast bowlers in modern cricket. Lee, speaking to Fox Cricket, noted that Bumrah’s consistency and ability to deliver under pressure make him a generational talent. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard “He is world class, Jasprit Bumrah. Unfortunately, they had no Mohammed Shami, but I think the backing of Mohammed Siraj—there has been a bit of conjecture around him—but I think he has bowled really well,"" Lee told Fox Sports. “In my opinion, they have an attack that has some good pace bowlers, but the reason why people say or think he is shouldering the whole load of the attack is that he is so good. He (Bumrah) is miles ahead of any other bowler, and that is no disrespect to the other bowlers going around, but that is how good he is,"" he added. In the second innings of the Brisbane Test, Bumrah etched his name in history by first equalling Kapil Dev's record of 51 wickets, and then taking a couple more to have the most wickets by an Indian bowler in Australia with his 53. His dismissal of Usman Khawaja on Day 5 not only levelled the record but also highlighted his knack for striking at crucial moments.

— BCCI (@BCCI) December 18, 2024 Bumrah's contributions were particularly critical in the first innings of the Gabba Test, where he took a six-wicket haul, almost single-handedly restricting Australia's scoring. While Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep managed to redeem themselves with notable spells in the second innings, it was Bumrah who consistently led the charge. His ability to extract bounce, pace, and movement on Australian tracks has made him a nightmare for opposition batters. The 31-year-old's performances in this series have solidified his reputation as India’s most reliable bowler. With an average below 11 and 20 wickets to his name so far, Bumrah has dominated the bowling charts. With his remarkable achievements, Bumrah continues to carry India’s pace attack, setting an unparalleled standard and proving why he remains an invaluable asset to Indian cricket.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  Watch: Emotional father kisses R Ashwin during hero's welcome at Chennai residence

The 33-year-old's injury woes continued as scans confirmed a right calf strain sustained during the warm-up on the morning of Day 2 of the Brisbane Test. While medical reports suggested the injury was a minor strain, it was enough to sideline Hazlewood for the remainder of the series. Speaking to 7NEWS, Hazlewood expressed his disappointment, saying, ""Just frustrating really. Ticked every box heading into the Test, I could understand if it was my side again, but it was just a random calf strain. Obviously, do a deep dive into it and see what we can come up with ... feels pretty random."" This setback adds to Hazlewood's recent history of injuries, which have seen him miss parts of four of the last six Australian home summers. Notably, the 2020/21 and 2023/24 seasons were the only exceptions where he managed to stay fit throughout. Reflecting on his injury record, Hazlewood said, ""I've had a history of sides and calves, they're probably the two things that have kept me out for the majority over the last four years. But yeah, I sort of just keep adding another layer to the defence, hopefully. Get back into the gym; I've ticked a lot of boxes over the last 12 months."" The fast bowler's primary frustration stems from the timing of his injuries. ""It's just the timing again. They are only little 2-3 week injuries, but missing big games is the frustrating thing,"" he lamented. Despite the disappointment, Hazlewood remains optimistic about returning to full fitness for Australia's two-Test tour of Sri Lanka, scheduled for late January and February. ""That's probably the goal, just take it as it comes over the next few weeks,"" he said. ""No rush to get anything in a hurry, it's just getting everything right. Probably take a few extra days here and there, ticking things off and getting everything right."" Hazlewood's absence adds to Australia's challenges in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a series already marked by intense competition and high stakes.

The former captain accompanied his family during the trip ahead of the fourth Test, starting December 26 in Melbourne.  Notably, Kohli and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah have been travelling separately with their families between cities in Australia. Kohli and Bumrah shared a chartered plane from Adelaide to Brisbane ahead of the third Test, which ended on Wednesday.  Virat Kohli has not been in the best of forms with the bat in the much-talked-about Test series. Kohli hit a hundred in the second innings of the series opener in Perth, but he hasn't lived up to the hype in the first three Tests. Kohli has managed just 126 runs in six innings at an average of 30. Barring the hundred, Kohli has scored 26 runs across five innings.  Kohli has been struggling to control his urge to poke at deliveries bowled wide outside the off-stump --  a plan that Australia have executed well to trouble the Indian batting star.  Kohli will look to return to his best in Melbourne. Team India need their star batter to step up and deliver in the evenly-contest Test series.  India managed to deny Australia a win at the Gabba in the third Test. Despite conceding a 185-run first innings lead, India avoided a defeat, thanks to the wet weather in Brisbane.

Reflecting on his journey in a heartfelt video shared by the BCCI, Ashwin admitted the difficulty of saying goodbye to international cricket. ""I don't know how to go about this. Honestly, it is easier to speak in the team huddle. Even though I'm not exhibiting it, it is truly a very emotional moment for me,"" he said. He recalled the transitions he witnessed during his debut Australian tour in 2011-12, when stalwarts like Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar bid farewell to the game. ""But trust me, everybody's time comes, and today was my time to leave,"" he added. Having represented India since November 2011, Ashwin said the last four to five years held special significance for him. ""I have enjoyed it, thoroughly enjoyed it, built some great relationships and friendships over the last four-five years notably. Every passing year, I've come to value these relationships even more,"" he said. Though stepping away from the international arena, Ashwin affirmed that the ""cricket nut"" in him would remain active.
