Samson now appears to be in pole position to become India’s T20 opener following the dual retirements of Kohli and Sharma after the T20 World Cup victory earlier this year. His three centuries in four T20Is against Bangladesh and South Africa have firmly signaled his intent to secure that spot. ""Yeah, it has been. I had a decent relationship with Gautam Gambir right from a young age. My first IPL team was KKR. When I was 14, they picked me on their B team. At the age of 17, I made it to the KKR main side and that was when KKR won the Championship under Gautam Gambhir,"" Samson said in an interview with the former South African captain, AB de Villiers on YouTube.  Samson's association with Gambhir extended beyond the IPL. The wicketkeeper-batter recounted how Gambhir's words during their time in the Indian team's dressing room bolstered his confidence. ""When he came to the Indian team, in the dressing room he told me 'Sanju, I know what you have. You have something special. I am going to be back you no matter what'. He told me to walk in, go out there and express myself in every innings. That kind of communication from the coach, that gave me clarity and confidence.  The Kerala-born cricketer also spoke about the pressure of living up to Gambhir's faith, especially after a string of low scores. ""After few games of dismissals, you feel pressure because you have a guy who's backing you and you are not performing. I thought 'common Sanju, you need to show something and repay the faith the coach has in',"" Samson added. Samson's determination eventually paid off, and he has since become a vital player in India's cricketing ecosystem. Reflecting on his journey, he expressed gratitude for the turning points in his career. ""By God's grace, something special has happened. I want to continue scoring runs and win games for my country,"" he concluded.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Explained: What the new India-Pakistan ICC agreement means for world cricket

Ravichandran said he had come to terms with his son's decision but admitted that he wished Ashwin had continued playing for the senior national team. ""What was going on in his mind I don’t know.

However, the veteran off-spinner was dropped for the third Test in Brisbane and Ravindra Jadeja took his spot in the XI.

While the decision worked out well for both countries, here's how it affects the rest of the cricketing world.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/india-vs-pakistan-champions-trophy-nuetral-venues-explained-2652458-2024-12-19,"The International Cricket Council on December 19, Thursday, announced that India and Pakistan will play their matches in ICC tournaments at neutral venues till 2028. The deal was announced by the ICC during the confirmation of hybrid model for Champions Trophy 2025.  ICC announced that India will be playing their matches for the Champions Trophy 2025 on a neutral venue - likely UAE - and in return, Pakistan do not need to travel to India to play any world tournaments till 2028 - including the 2026 men's T20 World Cup.  While the Champions Trophy stand-off after India's refusal to travel across the border ended, the new agreement has given rise to fresh concerns.  The ICC released a statement confirming that ""India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue,"" as reported by India Today last week. This will mean that Pakistan will not travel to India for their matches during the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the T20 World Cup in 2026. The tournament, scheduled to begin on February 19 in Pakistan, faced uncertainty due to India's refusal to travel to the host nation. The ICC reiterated in its statement: ""This will apply to the upcoming ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 (hosted by Pakistan), set to be played in February and March 2025, as well as the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 (hosted by India) and the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 (hosted by India and Sri Lanka)."" The statement also announced that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been awarded the hosting rights for the ICC Women's T20 World Cup in 2028, where neutral venue arrangements will also apply.ICC Statement Key Pointers
Champions Trophy will be played in Pakistan, India matches at neutral venue
The 50-over tournament will be played in February-March in 2025
The hybrid model rule will apply for all ICC tournaments hosted by India and Pakistan in 2024-27 cycle
Pakistan will not travel to India for Women's World Cup in 2025 and T20 World Cup in 2026
Pakistan have been awarded the hosting rights for Women's T20 World Cup in 2028
As India Today reported, no compensation for Pakistan for losing a part of Champions Trophy hosting rights 
The schedule for ICC Champions Trophy will be confirmed soon
What Does This Mean for the Rest? While India and Pakistan play at the comfort of their neutral venues in the ICC tournaments, the major problems will be faced by the rest of the cricketing nations who would have to travel more than usual, if they are pitted against India and Pakistan.  Take the 2023 Asia Cup for example. the Asian Cricket Council tournament was co-hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka as India refused travel to Pakistan for the tournament. India were stationed in Sri Lanka with the other teams forced to travel to and fro between countries - playing in drastically different conditions. For example, Bangladesh started their tournament in Pallekele on Ausgust 31, flew out to Lahore to play Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the travelled back to Sri Lanka to play their final two matches - in a space of two weeks. The fate was more or less same for the other countries depending on how deep they went into the tournament. Former BCB operations chairman had spoken to the media where he had sounded helpless about the issue. ""After playing our first match in Kandy, we have to go to Lahore for the second. There is nothing to do, it was ACC's decision. To make the journey a bit more comfortable, the ACC will provide us with a chartered plane. All the teams who have matches in both countries will get the same,"" Jalal had said during the tournament. ""There is always a little discomfort when you have to travel so much. We all know that you have to go to the airport two hours before a flight and have to carry your luggage too. Then there is the issue of jet lag. The distance between Sri Lanka and Pakistan is very long. We have nothing we can do, everyone will playing like this and we have to be okay with ACC's decision,"" he had further added.   Now the question rises, is that fair for the other boards? Forget Asia Cup - a tournament of only 6 teams, the T20 World Cup 2026 is set to have 20 teams in total, out of which upto 12 different teams might end up playing India and Pakistan, in potentially two different countries.ICC Needs to Do Better India Today reported that all major stakeholder boards in international cricket were consulted when the ICC discussed the possibility of adopting a hybrid model. While the boards may not raise concerns regarding the Champions Trophy 2025, logistical challenges could pose significant issues for teams in larger tournaments in the future. If the hybrid model becomes more prevalent due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, the ICC would do well to establish a long-term solution to these challenges. Engaging with member boards before awarding hosting rights and finalising schedules well in advance could help mitigate potential disruptions, ensuring players, broadcasters, and fans face fewer inconveniences. Broadcasters, who are instrumental in bolstering the financial health of the sport, would also welcome such a proactive approach. It would spare them the uncertainty of waiting until the last minute to confirm venues and schedules. The Champions Trophy, expected to take place between February and March, still does not have official venues. Neither the boards nor the fans know where they will need to travel to watch their favourite cricketers in action. The ICC must recognise that its tournaments are global. For cricket to truly grow as a worldwide sport, these events must prioritise fan experience and seamless organisation. Otherwise, the aspiration of making cricket a genuinely global sport will remain a distant dream. With cricket set to feature in the 2028 Olympics, fostering a better global image for the sport has never been more crucial.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

Donnarumma’s face was bloodied after being struck by his opponent’s cleat in PSG’s 4-2 victory over Monaco on Wednesday. The Italy international was struck by Singo's studs in the 17th minute as the Monaco defender attempted to hurdle over the sliding goalkeeper after his shot was blocked. Instead, Singo's cleats struck Donnarumma, leaving him with multiple cuts and visible trauma below his right eye. Acknowledging the severity of the injury, Singo took to social media to express remorse. ""My gesture was obviously not intentional, but I was able to see afterwards that he had a significant injury to his face,"" he wrote in French and Italian. ""I wish you a good recovery."" Donnarumma required on-field treatment before being replaced by backup goalkeeper Matvey Safonov. PSG later confirmed the 24-year-old suffered ""a facial trauma with multiple wounds"" and would undergo further medical assessments. Photos of Donnarumma's injuries circulated widely, drawing attention to Singo's earlier yellow card. Despite calls for stricter punishment, officials deemed the collision unintentional, allowing Singo to remain in the game. PSG overcame the early loss of their star goalkeeper and a 2-1 deficit in the second half to secure the win. Gonçalo Ramos scored to level the match, and Ousmane Dembélé delivered a brace to ensure victory, extending PSG's unbeaten league run to 16 matches. ""The objective was achieved. It was a difficult match, we weren't up to par at all times, but they knew how to come back and take the lead,"" PSG manager Luis Enrique said post-match. ""I'm happy with the result."" The win gives PSG a commanding 10-point lead atop the Ligue 1 standings as they enter the Christmas break with 40 points. Olympique de Marseille and Monaco, both on 30 points, trail the league leaders, with Marseille holding a game in hand. While the result reinforces PSG's dominance, Donnarumma's condition remains a concern for the club as they prepare for the remainder of the season.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim on Rashford situation: I will handle itTrending Reel

Badrinath said Ashwin's unexpected decision left him shocked, adding that the off-spinner deserved to exit on a high. R Ashwin surprised many by retiring midway through the all-important Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Minutes after India drew the third Test in Brisbane, Ashwin announced his retirement during a press conference alongside captain Rohit Sharma at the Gabba. Rohit revealed that Ashwin had discussed his retirement plans at the start of the Australia tour and that he had convinced the off-spinner to play the second Test in Adelaide. When asked if Ashwin should have continued until the end of the series, Rohit defended the spinner's decision, emphasising that Ashwin had every right to choose when to step away. Also Read: R Ashwin, a student of the game and professor of spin, leaves an unmatched legacy Amid discussions surrounding the timing of Ashwin's retirement, S Badrinath defended the off-spinner, attributing the decision to the treatment he received over the years. ""I am shocked. I think, to be honest, he wasn't treated fairly. Rohit Sharma said he wanted to leave after the Perth Test match. He wanted to leave when Washington Sundar was played ahead of him. That tells you he was not happy,"" Badrinath told Star Sports Tamil. ""Honestly, I am saying something-it's a big thing for a cricketer from Tamil Nadu. There are many reasons for that. Players from a few other states get better chances. Despite all these odds, Ashwin went on to take more than 500 wickets and became a legend. ""Imagine what he must have gone through. I know he has faced quite a few things. On many occasions, efforts were made to sideline him. But every time, he has bounced back like a phoenix bird,"" he added.I FEEL BAD FOR ASHWIN: BADRINATH Badrinath argued that Ashwin deserved a grand farewell and suggested that players from other states might not have faced the same treatment. ""He can quit cricket, but this is not the way he should have gone out. It should have been a glorious exit. He deserved a glorious exit. It's not fair, it's not right. ""He has not been treated properly. I have closely followed his progress. Because he is from Tamil Nadu, he has faced this. If you ask me if it would have happened with a cricketer from any other state, I don't think so. ""I feel bad for Ashwin. This exit should not have been like this,"" Badrinath added. Notably, R Ashwin's father, in a television interview on Thursday, claimed that Ashwin was humiliated, which he suggested could have been one of the reasons for his sudden retirement. Ashwin, however, remained tight-lipped about the timing of his decision, maintaining that he had no regrets about his cricketing career. The off-spinner said he was already looking forward to representing the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL 2025. Ashwin departed Australia and returned to Chennai as early as Thursday. Meanwhile, the rest of the Indian team travelled from Brisbane to Melbourne, where the Boxing Day Test will be played from December 26.

Speculation around Rashford's tenure at Old Trafford has intensified, particularly after the player’s own comments about seeking a “new challenge” added fuel to the fire. The 27-year-old forward, a product of United’s academy since the age of seven, finds himself at a crossroads. His role under Amorim has been a subject of uncertainty, leading to doubts about his long-term stay at the club. During the pre-match press conference ahead of United's Carabao Cup clash against Tottenham Hotspur on December 20, Amorim refrained from providing detailed answers on Rashford’s situation, emphasising his intent to manage it internally. “It’s a hard situation to comment on...""If this was me, probably I would speak with the manager,"" Amorim said. “If I give a lot of importance to it, it will have big headlines in the papers and if I say it’s not a problem, then my standards are getting low. So I will deal with that, I understand that,” he added. Despite Manchester United’s morale-boosting 2-1 victory over rivals Manchester City on Sunday, Rashford’s absence from the squad, alongside teammate Alejandro Garnacho, sparked further questions. Amorim later clarified that the decision stemmed from his commitment to maintaining high standards within the team, but the omission has only heightened rumors of a potential sale. Rashford’s struggles to recapture his electrifying form from the 2022-23 season, where he scored 30 goals across all competitions, have not gone unnoticed. Under Amorim, who took charge last month, the England international has netted just three goals and has failed to make a significant impact. In United’s Europa League win against Viktoria Plzen, Rashford was substituted as early as the 56th minute, a decision that was met with boos from sections of the Old Trafford crowd. The mounting frustration among fans and the lack of clarity over Rashford’s future have contributed to an uneasy atmosphere. However, Amorim’s direct approach to the matter indicates a focus on resolving the situation without unnecessary public scrutiny. As Manchester United prepare for their Carabao Cup clash, the spotlight remains on Rashford’s next move. Whether the forward reignites his United career or embarks on a new chapter, Amorim’s handling of the scenario could prove pivotal in shaping the club’s immediate future.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  PSG's Donnarumma leaves field bloodied after boot to the face tackle vs Monaco

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/wouldnt-have-let-r-ashwin-retire-like-this-he-deserves-respect-kapil-dev-2652324-2024-12-19,"Former India skipper Kapil Dev was not happy that the star off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin retired from international cricket without getting a proper farewell. Earlier on Wednesday, Ashwin appeared alongside India's captain Rohit Sharma at the post-match press conference to make the announcement. Speculation about his retirement had intensified after Ashwin became visibly emotional and was embraced by Virat Kohli. ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar...Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there, I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,"" Kapil Dev said as quoted by ANI. Ashwin finishes his career with 537 wickets in 106 Test matches, placing him seventh on the all-time wicket-takers list, behind Anil Kumble's tally of 619 for India. His strike rate of 50.73 is the highest among the nine bowlers with over 500 wickets, while his bowling average of 24 ranks third. He achieved five or more wickets in a Test innings on 37 occasions, a number bettered only by Muttiah Muralitharan, who achieved it 67 times. Shane Warne also managed this feat on 37 occasions. Ashwin has also claimed ten or more wickets in a Test match eight times, the highest among Indian bowlers, alongside Kumble. Ashwin's remarkable success at home has contributed significantly to India's impressive record in home Tests over the past decade. He has played every home Test since his debut in 2011, spanning 65 matches. Of those 65 home Tests, India won 47; only Sachin Tendulkar has featured in more Test wins (52). Among all players, only Alastair Cook (89) played more home Tests than Ashwin without missing any. Among all-rounders, the previous highest was Tony Greig (31), and among bowlers, it was Dilip Doshi (21). The Tamil Nadu cricketer is the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket and the second-highest for India, trailing only the legendary Anil Kumble. Ashwin's tally of five-wicket hauls is second only to Sri Lankan great Muttiah Muralitharan. Kapil Dev, who led India to its maiden World Cup triumph in 1983, also highlighted the evolution of Indian cricket and the legacy left behind by players like Ashwin. ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead.

Ravichandran added that he had hoped his son would continue playing for the senior national team.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ashwin-retires-father-ravichandran-humilation-shock-decison-2652272-2024-12-19,"R Ashwin's father, Ravichandran, revealed that the off-spinner's retirement decision came as a surprise to many in their family, adding that he wanted his son to continue playing for the senior national team. Ravichandran alleged that his son was being humiliated, which he suggested could have been one of the reasons for Ashwin's sudden retirement from international cricket. While Ravichandran did not elaborate on the specifics of his allegation, it appears he was alluding to the lack of consistent opportunities for Ashwin in overseas Tests. Ashwin reitred from international cricket midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The off-spinner announced his decision, minutes after the third Test between India and Australia ended in Brisbane on Wednesday, December 18. Ashwin reached Chennai as early as Thursday morning.  ""I too came to know (about his retirement) in the last minute, actually,"" Ravichandran told News18.  ""Retiring is his wish and desire, I cannot interfere in that, but the way in which he gave that, there could be many reasons. Only Ashwin knows, maybe humiliation,"" he added.  When asked if the family was emotional when Ashwin dropped the bombshell on Wednesday, Ashwin's father said: ""No doubt about it (emotional moment for the family) because he was on the field for 14-15 years. The sudden change, retirement, gave us really kind of a shock. ""At the same time, we were expecting that also because humiliation was going on. How long he can just tolerate all those things? Probably, he would have decided on his own,"" he added.  Ashwin's father has been a pillar of support in the off-spinner's career. A fast bowler at club-level cricket, Ravichandran encouraged his son to take up the sport. Ashwin's father backed him when the Tamil Nadu cricketer made the switch from a batter to an off-spinner in a bid to break into the state's Ranji Trophy team as a teenager. MIXED EMOTIONS FOR ASHWIN'S FATHER Ravichandran said he had come to terms with his son's decision but admitted that he wished Ashwin had continued playing for the senior national team. ""What was going on in his mind I don’t know. He just announced. I too accepted it with full pleasure. I did not have any feeling at all for that. But the way he gave his retirement, one part I was very happy, another part not happy because he should have continued,"" he said.  Ashwin chose not to stay with the rest f the squad for the last two Tests of the crucial series. Melbourne will host the Boxing Day Test and Sydney will host the New Year's Test. Both the iconic venues offer more assistance to spin than other pitches Down Under.  Notably, legendary Sunil Gavaskar had criticised the timing of Ashwin's retirement and said Washington Sundar's emergence might have influenced the off-spinner's mid-series retirement.  India picked Sundar ahead of R Ashwin for the first Test of the series in Perth. Ashwin returned to play the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. However, the veteran off-spinner was dropped for the third Test in Brisbane and Ravindra Jadeja took his spot in the XI.  Ashwin has been consistently left out of the XI in overseas Tests, especially in England and Australia. Jadeja was preferred as the lone spinner in the XI because of his better ability with the bat.

Maharaj suffered a left abductor strain during the warm-up session ahead of the first ODI on December 17 and was unable to take the field. Subsequent scans confirmed the injury, sidelining him for the second and third ODIs scheduled for December 19 and December 22. Bjorn Fortuin has been named as Maharaj's replacement for the remaining games. This setback comes just a day after Maharaj was included in South Africa's Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against Pakistan. The Test series, starting on December 26 in Centurion, holds significant importance for South Africa as they aim to secure a spot in next year's World Test Championship (WTC) final. The Proteas currently sit atop the WTC standings with a PCT of 63.33 and need one more win to guarantee a top-two finish. Maharaj will now return to Durban for rehabilitation and will be monitored ahead of the Boxing Day Test. His role as the team’s primary specialist spinner is crucial, having recently delivered a match-winning performance against Sri Lanka in Gqeberha, where he took 5 for 76 to clinch victory. The injury adds to South Africa's growing list of unavailable bowlers. Key pacer Anrich Nortje is sidelined with a fractured toe, Gerald Coetzee and Lungi Ngidi are nursing groin and hip injuries, Nandre Burger is out for the summer due to a stress fracture, and all-rounder Wiaan Mulder is recovering from a finger injury sustained against Sri Lanka. In case Maharaj fails to recover in time for the Test series, options such as Dane Piedt, Senuran Muthusamy, Neil Brand, and Shaun von Berg may be considered. Tabraiz Shamsi, who last played first-class cricket in 2021, also presents a potential, though less likely, alternative. South Africa will look to make up for Maharaj's absence in the ODIs as they aim to continue their strong form against Pakistan. The Test series that follows will further test their depth and resilience as they chase a spot in the WTC final.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Not easy for Mohammed Siraj to support world-class Jasprit Bumrah: Brett Lee

Despite their best efforts, Lee believes the gap between Bumrah’s brilliance and the support acts is undeniable. Bumrah has been a standout player in this BGT series, already claiming 21 wickets across three Tests. His devastating spells have left the Australian batting lineup scrambling on Day 5 of the Brisbane Test, proving his mettle as one of the finest fast bowlers in modern cricket. Lee, speaking to Fox Cricket, noted that Bumrah’s consistency and ability to deliver under pressure make him a generational talent. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard “He is world class, Jasprit Bumrah. Unfortunately, they had no Mohammed Shami, but I think the backing of Mohammed Siraj—there has been a bit of conjecture around him—but I think he has bowled really well,"" Lee told Fox Sports. “In my opinion, they have an attack that has some good pace bowlers, but the reason why people say or think he is shouldering the whole load of the attack is that he is so good. He (Bumrah) is miles ahead of any other bowler, and that is no disrespect to the other bowlers going around, but that is how good he is,"" he added. In the second innings of the Brisbane Test, Bumrah etched his name in history by first equalling Kapil Dev's record of 51 wickets, and then taking a couple more to have the most wickets by an Indian bowler in Australia with his 53. His dismissal of Usman Khawaja on Day 5 not only levelled the record but also highlighted his knack for striking at crucial moments.

— BCCI (@BCCI) December 18, 2024 Bumrah's contributions were particularly critical in the first innings of the Gabba Test, where he took a six-wicket haul, almost single-handedly restricting Australia's scoring. While Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep managed to redeem themselves with notable spells in the second innings, it was Bumrah who consistently led the charge. His ability to extract bounce, pace, and movement on Australian tracks has made him a nightmare for opposition batters. The 31-year-old's performances in this series have solidified his reputation as India’s most reliable bowler. With an average below 11 and 20 wickets to his name so far, Bumrah has dominated the bowling charts. With his remarkable achievements, Bumrah continues to carry India’s pace attack, setting an unparalleled standard and proving why he remains an invaluable asset to Indian cricket.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  Watch: Emotional father kisses R Ashwin during hero's welcome at Chennai residence

The 33-year-old's injury woes continued as scans confirmed a right calf strain sustained during the warm-up on the morning of Day 2 of the Brisbane Test. While medical reports suggested the injury was a minor strain, it was enough to sideline Hazlewood for the remainder of the series. Speaking to 7NEWS, Hazlewood expressed his disappointment, saying, ""Just frustrating really. Ticked every box heading into the Test, I could understand if it was my side again, but it was just a random calf strain. Obviously, do a deep dive into it and see what we can come up with ... feels pretty random."" This setback adds to Hazlewood's recent history of injuries, which have seen him miss parts of four of the last six Australian home summers. Notably, the 2020/21 and 2023/24 seasons were the only exceptions where he managed to stay fit throughout. Reflecting on his injury record, Hazlewood said, ""I've had a history of sides and calves, they're probably the two things that have kept me out for the majority over the last four years. But yeah, I sort of just keep adding another layer to the defence, hopefully. Get back into the gym; I've ticked a lot of boxes over the last 12 months."" The fast bowler's primary frustration stems from the timing of his injuries. ""It's just the timing again. They are only little 2-3 week injuries, but missing big games is the frustrating thing,"" he lamented. Despite the disappointment, Hazlewood remains optimistic about returning to full fitness for Australia's two-Test tour of Sri Lanka, scheduled for late January and February. ""That's probably the goal, just take it as it comes over the next few weeks,"" he said. ""No rush to get anything in a hurry, it's just getting everything right. Probably take a few extra days here and there, ticking things off and getting everything right."" Hazlewood's absence adds to Australia's challenges in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a series already marked by intense competition and high stakes.

The former captain accompanied his family during the trip ahead of the fourth Test, starting December 26 in Melbourne.  Notably, Kohli and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah have been travelling separately with their families between cities in Australia. Kohli and Bumrah shared a chartered plane from Adelaide to Brisbane ahead of the third Test, which ended on Wednesday.  Virat Kohli has not been in the best of forms with the bat in the much-talked-about Test series. Kohli hit a hundred in the second innings of the series opener in Perth, but he hasn't lived up to the hype in the first three Tests. Kohli has managed just 126 runs in six innings at an average of 30. Barring the hundred, Kohli has scored 26 runs across five innings.  Kohli has been struggling to control his urge to poke at deliveries bowled wide outside the off-stump --  a plan that Australia have executed well to trouble the Indian batting star.  Kohli will look to return to his best in Melbourne. Team India need their star batter to step up and deliver in the evenly-contest Test series.  India managed to deny Australia a win at the Gabba in the third Test. Despite conceding a 185-run first innings lead, India avoided a defeat, thanks to the wet weather in Brisbane.

— Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) December 19, 2024 It is a little known fact that Zakir Hussain loved cricket as a young kid and wanted to follow the passion of many Indians. Like many young boys, Zakir's early years were not solely dedicated to music. Growing up, he shared a love for cricket, often skipping his tabla practice to play ""gully cricket"" with his friends. But his father, the legendary Ustad Alla Rakha, recognised his son's potential and pushed him to hone his craft, even if it meant making difficult decisions. Zakir recalls a pivotal moment when his father, concerned that his son's budding cricket career might harm his ability to play the tabla, gave him an ultimatum. ""My father once got angry because I broke a finger while playing cricket. I was a keeper. He was so upset because he was worried if I would be able to play the tabla again or not,"" he said. This moment of concern from Ustad Alla Rakha marked a turning point in Zakir's life, steering him fully toward the tabla. Despite his early love for cricket, Zakir went on to make his mark as one of the greatest tabla players in history. Yet, he never strayed far from the world of cricket. Over the years, he formed a close bond with cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar, who became a dear friend. The two shared a unique connection, bonding over their mutual respect and admiration for each other's craft.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/who-is-liam-lawson-f1-driver-who-joins-max-verstappen-at-red-bull-2652561-2024-12-19,"New Zealand driver Liam Lawson will replace Sergio Perez as Max Verstappen's teammate at Red Bull Racing for the 2025 Formula 1 season, the team announced on Thursday. Perez's departure was confirmed the day before, and Lawson’s promotion from Red Bull's sister team, AlphaTauri, had long been anticipated. At just 22 years old, Lawson made his F1 debut in 2023, stepping in for the injured Daniel Ricciardo at the Dutch Grand Prix. He later returned for the final six races of the season after Ricciardo was dropped. Lawson expressed his excitement at the opportunity in a team statement:  ""To be announced as an Oracle Red Bull Racing driver is a lifelong dream for me. This is something I’ve wanted and worked towards since I was eight years old,"" Lawson said. ""It’s been an incredible journey so far. A huge thank you to everyone at VCARB (AlphaTauri) for their support. The last six races have been key in preparing me for this next step. I’m super excited to work alongside Max and learn from a world champion. I have no doubt I’ll gain a lot from his expertise, and I can’t wait to get started."" Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner praised Lawson’s abilities, describing him as ""a real racer, not afraid to mix it with the best and come out on top."" He also highlighted the team's history of promoting talent from within its junior program, mentioning how Lawson follows in the footsteps of champions like Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen himself.  ""Him racing alongside Max—a four-time champion and one of the greatest drivers F1 has ever seen—is certainly a daunting challenge,"" Horner added. ""But I’m confident Liam can rise to the occasion and deliver impressive results for us next year."" Red Bull has seen a series of teammates struggle to match Verstappen's pace since he joined the team in 2016. Perez, who joined in 2021, had a solid 2023 season, finishing second in the championship, though he was a distant 290 points behind Verstappen, who won a record 19 out of 22 races. This year, Perez's form has dramatically declined, finishing only eighth in the standings, while Verstappen claimed his fourth consecutive title. Before Perez, drivers like Alex Albon (now at Williams) and Pierre Gasly (now at Alpine) failed to match Verstappen’s performance, and Daniel Ricciardo, who partnered Verstappen from 2016 to 2018, ultimately left Red Bull for Renault after falling behind his teammate. With Lawson’s promotion, Red Bull will have an open seat at its sister team, AlphaTauri, which will be renamed Racing Bulls next season. French-Algerian driver Isack Hadjar, who finished as the runner-up in Formula 2 this season, is expected to fill the vacancy.WHO IS LIAM LAWSON? Liam Lawson is a promising New Zealand racing driver who has rapidly ascended through the ranks of motorsport to compete at the highest level in Formula 1. Born on February 11, 2002, in Hastings, New Zealand, and raised in Pukekohe, Lawson began his competitive racing career at the age of seven with karting. He was mentored by three-time New Zealand Grand Prix winner Ken Smith, which played a significant role in his early development. Lawson quickly made a name for himself in junior formulae, winning his first title in the NZ F1600 Championship in 2015 as a privateer. He continued to excel, finishing as the runner-up in the 2017 Australian F4, 2018 ADAC F4, and 2019 Euroformula Open championships. Lawson's breakthrough year was 2019, where he won the Toyota Racing Series in New Zealand with M2 Competition, securing the championship title just a day before his 17th birthday. He also made his debut in the FIA Formula 3 Championship with MP Motorsport and participated in the Euroformula Open with Motopark, where he finished second in the standings. In 2020, Lawson returned to the Toyota Racing Series, finishing second, and continued in FIA Formula 3 with Hitech Grand Prix, where he won three races and finished fifth in the standings. His progression to Formula 2 in 2021 saw him secure his maiden victory and two additional podiums, concluding the season in ninth place. He also debuted in the DTM with AF Corse, driving a Ferrari 488 GT3 Evo 2020, and narrowly missed the championship title by three points. Lawson's performance in Formula 2 improved significantly in 2022, driving for Carlin and finishing third in the standings with four wins and six other podium finishes. This success led to his Formula 1 debut during the first free practice sessions for the Belgian, Mexican, and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix, driving for AlphaTauri and Red Bull. In 2023, Lawson competed in the Super Formula Championship with Team Mugen, supported by Red Bull, and served as a test and reserve driver for both AlphaTauri and Red Bull Racing. He made his first F1 race appearances as a temporary replacement for Daniel Ricciardo at AlphaTauri, outperforming his teammate Yuki Tsunoda in several races and earning valuable points for the team. For the 2024 season, Lawson was announced as a permanent F1 driver for Visa Cash App RB following the Singapore Grand Prix, replacing Ricciardo. Despite his promising start, he has faced criticism from teammate Sergio Pérez regarding his aggressive driving style and attitude on and off the track. Pérez has suggested that Lawson needs to adopt a more humble and respectful approach to succeed in Formula 1. Lawson's career is marked by his ability to win on debut in various categories and his quick adaptation to new series. However, as he navigates the highly competitive world of Formula 1, he will need to balance his aggressive driving with the strategic and respectful approach that the sport demands.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  Formula 1: Sergio Perez and Red Bull part ways months after contract extensionTrending Reel

After the drawn third Test in Brisbane, Rohit Sharma sounded miffed after being persistently asked for an update on Shami’s availability. Sharma put the onus on NCA and said that the body should update the Indian team on Shami's condition. “I think it’s high time somebody from NCA talks about him, where he is rehabbing... Those guys are the ones who need to come up and give us some kind of update. I understand he’s playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well. We won’t take any risks unless we are 200% sure about his fitness,"" Rohit had said. Shami’s participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy is seen as a key step towards determining his availability for the upcoming international assignments, including the Champions Trophy.

On Thursday, India beat the West Indies in the deciding game to claim the series 2-1. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-india-vs-west-indies-womens-t20i-series-smriti-mandhana-drought-2652634-2024-12-19,"Smriti Mandhana opened up on how she motivated Team India to end their five-year-long wait to win a Women’s T20I series on home soil. Since September 2019, India could not secure a series win at home in five series on the trot. But on Thursday, December 19, the Women in Blue defeated Hayley Matthews’ West Indies by 60 runs to win the series 2-1. India Women vs West Indies Women, 3rd T20I Updates India started the series with a thumping 49-run win, but slumped to a nine-wicket defeat in the second game on Tuesday. In the decider, India recorded their highest team total of 217 for four after which they restricted the visitors to 157 for nine. “After the last match, I told the girls it has been five years that we have not won a T20I series. That does not reflect the team we are. I told them that today, we have an opportunity to do that and we just want to keep doing the right things,” Mandhana said in the post-match presentation ceremony.‘Raghvi was impressive’ Mandhana also had high praise for youngster Raghvi Bist, who scored an unbeaten 31 off 22 balls with two fours and a six. Mandhana, who made 77 runs and took down a number of T20I records, said that she was awestruck with Raghvi’s strokeplay. “The way Raghvi batted was impressive. She came in with lots of intent and hitting her fourth or fifth ball for six, I would not have been able to do that in my second match,” Mandhana said. Richa Ghosh was also at her very best after she smashed the joint-fastest fifty in Women’s T20Is off 18 balls, equalling Sophie Devine and Phoebe Litchfield’s record. “Richa's innings was also amazing, as it was the other day, but could not appreciate that unfortunately because of the result,” Mandhana added. After the T20Is, India are now set to face the West Indies in a three-match ODI series from December 22 onwards.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  India Women thrash West Indies in decider to win first home T20I series in five yearsTrending Reel

India won the decider courtesy of some sensational batting from the Indian unit. In the post match presentation, Ghosh credited stand-in captain Smriti Mandhana setting the stage for the Indian batters to fire. On Thursday, December 19, playing at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, Richa Ghosh hit the joint-fastest fifty in the women's T20Is. Richa went berserk against the Windies side and hit 3 fours and 5 sixes. Richa broke Smriti Mandhana's record to become the fastest half-centurion in WT20I by an Indian. Mandhana had held the record for nearly 5 years now. She had slammed her half-century in 24 balls against New Zealand in February 2019. India Women vs West Indies Women: 3rd T20I Highlights Richa's sensational innings combined with Mandhana's fireworks at the top meant that India registered the biggest total in the WT20Is. The Indian team scored 217 runs from their 20 overs, after losing 4 wickets. Smriti Mandhana started the assault at the top, with 77 off just 47 balls. After Mandhana got out, Jemimah Rodrigues (39 off 28), Raghvi Bist (31* off 22) and Richa Ghosh (54* off 21 balls) stole the show. India hit a total of 7 sixes, 5 of which came off Richa's bat. The explosive wicketkeeper-batter got out in the penultimate ball of the final over, trying to hit a six against Aaliyah Alleyne. After the match, Richa credited Mandhana for setting the stage for the rest of the Indian batters. ""We got a good start today. The way Mandhana played, I just continued to do that. I play in the same way in the nets. I like to hit the ball when it is in the slot. Feels good as all of us contributed to the team's victory. Happy with my contribution too,"" Richa said. IND W vs WI W: 3rd T20I Match Report Mandhana on the other hand hailed India's maiden T20I series victory at home in 5 years. She said that the team was aware of the record and want to push themselves to win the bilateral series. ""It's been five years we haven't won a T20I series in India. That was the chat earlier in the day. We had the chance to do it after 5 years. Need to keep doing the right things now. With the kind of batting line-up, we have some new youngsters. So need to take responsibility. More than timing the ball, I try to put my head into playing according to the situation. Liked the way Richa Ghosh batted. Girls stepped up today, they played with a lot of intent.

Speaking ahead of the Boxing Day Test match, Langer showered praise on Bumrah and said that the India seamer must be a nightmare to face for the batters. Bumrah has been in sensational touch in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy so far. The leader of the India pace attack has 21 wickets after 3 Test matches, 7 more than the next best Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. Bumrah's ability to seam and swing the new ball has come in handy for the Indians as they have gotten wickets on demand from the pacer. “I would hate to face him. He is like Wasim Akram. For me, he is a right-hand version of Wasim Akram, and every time I am asked the question ‘Who is the best bowler you have ever faced’, I say, Wasim Akram,"" Justin Langer told The Nightly on Thursday, December 19. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “They have got good pace and the great bowlers just hit the same spot every time, and they have got a good bouncer, so it makes them a bloody nightmare. He has got the ability to swing the ball both ways, his seam is literally picture perfect."" “If you present a perfect seam and it comes perfectly out of the fingers as it does with him, you get the double whammy, swing in the right conditions and if it hits the rope it can go either way. That’s what Akram used to do and was a nightmare to face,"" he added. “I would hate to face Bumrah. He’s a great competitor, he bowls good pace and he’s just awesome. I said at the start of the series, if Bumrah stays fit, it is going to be a really tough summer for the Australian batters, if he doesn’t, then I think Australia will win the series easily, and I still maintain that,"" Langer concluded.

A stellar batting display, led by the likes of Babar Azam, captain Mohammad Rizwan, and Kamran Ghulam, coupled with a sensational bowling spell by Shaheen Afridi, sealed Pakistan’s third consecutive ODI series win. Finding form after a long slump, Babar Azam got running alongside Mohammad Rizwan who anchored the innings with a 115-run partnership, showcasing some crucial grit in their approach. Followed by Kamran Ghulam’s explosive knock of 63 off just 32 balls provided the late surge, propelling Pakistan to a formidable total of 330 runs. The batting trio’s efforts left South Africa with a daunting chase, compounded by Afridi’s fiery 4/47 spell that dismantled the Proteas’ batting lineup. SA vs PAK, 2nd ODI: Highlights South Africa’s chase began with promise, reminiscent of their approach in Paarl, but faltered under pressure. The hosts struggled to build partnerships, relying heavily on skipper Heinrich Klaasen, who played a heroic knock of 97 off 74 balls. Klaasen’s innings stood out as the only consistent effort in an otherwise lacklustre batting display by the Proteas, who were bowled out for just 248. Afridi’s lethal pace and reverse swing proved decisive, as he claimed crucial wickets both at the top and during the death overs. His return to form bolstered Pakistan’s all-round performance, which has been their most complete display in ODIs over the past six weeks. The series victory provides Pakistan a significant morale boost ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, set to be held at their home. For the Proteas, the loss highlighted the need to address inconsistencies in their batting and rethink their aggressive approach. Rizwan-led Pakistan, rejuvenated after their T20I series loss to South Africa, now shift their focus to the final ODI in Sandton on December 22, aiming for a series whitewash. A clean sweep against a competitive side like South Africa would further solidify Pakistan’s growing momentum in international cricket.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Leave my dad alone: Ashwin reacts to father's controversial retirement statement

Known for his cricketing intellect and tactical acumen, Ashwin was a master in home conditions, orchestrating numerous match-winning performances. His remarkable form in 2016 saw him claim both the ICC Cricketer of the Year and ICC Test Cricketer of the Year awards, becoming only the third Indian to receive the prestigious Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy. Ashwin was more than just a bowler; his contributions with the bat added significant value. A reliable lower-order batter, he amassed 3503 Test runs, including five centuries. While Ashwin has bid farewell to international cricket, he remains committed to playing club cricket and the IPL. In the IPL 2025 mega auction, he was re-signed by Chennai Super Kings for Rs 9.25 crore, marking a homecoming to the franchise where he initially rose to prominence.

 The defining moment came when Kohli struck two stunning sixes off Haris Rauf's last two deliveries, reigniting India’s hopes. The equation boiled down to 16 off the final over, bowled by Mohammad Nawaz. Kohli continued his brilliance, running hard between the wickets and launching a six despite Pandya’s dismissal on the first ball. Drama peaked when a no-ball and subsequent free-hit brought India within two runs of victory with two balls to spare. It was Ashwin who showcased nerves of steel, calmly lifting the final delivery over the infield to seal a famous win, with Kohli unbeaten on 82 in what many called one of his greatest innings.The Emotional Connection Before Ashwin’s official announcement, an emotional embrace between Kohli and Ashwin in the Brisbane dugout had sparked speculation about the spinner’s retirement.

The abruptness of his decision has left fans and experts alike grappling with the void his departure creates. For a player of his stature, the goodbye felt all too quiet, almost unworthy of a cricketer who has done so much for Indian cricket. India’s most successful off-spinner deserved a grand farewell. He merited the roar of a packed stadium, a guard of honour, and the chance to weave his magic one last time on the field. Instead, his announcement came in a room full of reporters at the end of the third Test in Brisbane. There were no rousing tributes or emotional speeches to a stadium filled with adoring fans. Ashwin’s final words as an Indian cricketer were shared in the dressing room, amidst scattered teammates, a low-key farewell to a high-impact career. Also read: R Ashwin was not treated fairly, his sudden retirement a shock: Ex-CSK teammate The only solace is that Ashwin walked away on his terms. As skipper Rohit Sharma observed, the off-spinner saw the writing on the wall and decided there was no point in continuing if his services were no longer required. Still, one cannot help but wonder if the lack of a regular spot in the playing XI, despite his extraordinary record, weighed heavily on his decision.ASHWIN DESERVED A BETTER FAREWELL Ashwin’s father, Ravichandran, alleged that his son faced humiliation, which may have influenced his decision to retire during India’s ongoing tour of Australia. While he could not pinpoint a specific incident, it appears he was pointing fingers at how his son was repeatedly overlooked in overseas tours. World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev lamented the unceremonious nature of Ashwin’s departure, stressing the importance of a respectful send-off for such a legendary all-rounder. “The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar... Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there; I wouldn’t have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,” Kapil Dev said. Former chief selector MSK Prasad echoed similar sentiments, remarking, “While retirement decisions are personal, a legendary farewell would certainly have been a fitting tribute to his illustrious career. It would not only celebrate his achievements but also allow fans, teammates, and the cricketing fraternity to express their gratitude for his immense contributions. Regardless of when or how he chooses to step away, his legacy as one of India’s greatest cricketers is forever etched in history.” Ashwin’s retirement marks not just the end of a glittering career but also the conclusion of an intellectual journey that redefined the art of spin bowling. From his debut in 2011, Ashwin has constantly evolved. His off-breaks expanded into an arsenal of carrom balls, arm balls, and deceptive top-spinners. His genius lay in being both a bowler of the past and a visionary for the future. With 537 Test wickets—second only to Anil Kumble among Indians—his numbers speak for themselves, though his legacy extends far beyond statistics. While legends like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli are often hailed as India’s greatest match-winners in cricket history, Ravichandran Ashwin has quietly claimed a unique distinction—being the backbone of India’s dominance in home Tests. With a career spanning 15 years, Ashwin’s contributions to India’s Test victories, particularly in home conditions, are unparalleled. Of the 106 Tests he has played, India emerged victorious in 61—a feat surpassed only by Tendulkar (72) and Kohli (62) in terms of Test wins. Ashwin’s win percentage of 57.55% ranks as the sixth-highest among players who have participated in over 100 Tests, a remarkable accomplishment considering the stiff competition from icons like Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath, and Shane Warne, who thrived during Australia’s dominant era of the 1990s and early 2000s.CONSTANT NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF Despite his brilliance, Ashwin’s career was not without its challenges. He faced criticism for overanalysing situations and was often sidelined in overseas Tests. Ever since Ravindra Jadeja surpassed him as a Test batter, and conditions in England, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia favoured a fourth fast bowler over a spinner in the No.8 spot, Ashwin frequently found himself benched. Out of the 50 Tests India played in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) during his career, Ashwin featured in only 26. Even so, Ashwin persevered, proving time and again that he belonged amongst cricket’s elite. His partnership with Ravindra Jadeja became legendary, their combined efforts dismantling opposition teams on Indian pitches. Ashwin’s cerebral edge often made the decisive difference, though his artistry was sometimes overshadowed by the dominance of batting stars like Kohli, Sharma, and Pant. Ashwin’s retirement serves as a poignant reminder of how cricket often undervalues its thinkers. Even former India cricketer and women’s team coach WV Raman remarked, “If I am ever convinced about something, it is that intelligence is not always an advantage.” In a sport that glorifies instinct and aggression, deep thinkers like Ashwin are frequently underappreciated. Throughout his career, Ashwin battled not just challenging conditions and gritty batters but also the struggle to be taken seriously. Despite over 500 Test wickets, critics hesitated to place him amongst the game’s greatest. Perhaps, in time, as India searches for someone of his calibre, his contributions will be fully recognised. Every time, he went overseas, he needed to prove himself all over again. His numbers in Australia and England drastically improved after the 2014 tour Down Under. Yet, he was benched for the majority of overseas tours, even in his prime, as India picked Ravindra Jadeja as the lone spinner.  It is a cruel irony that the career of India’s greatest match-winner ends with four consecutive Test losses—three against New Zealand at home and the Adelaide Test in Australia. For someone as emotional as Ashwin, the timing of his retirement is intriguing. One might have expected him to play a farewell Test, savour the moment, and perhaps have his family present—though they were absent at the Gabba. However, Ashwin is not someone who would complain that he retired without a proper farewell. Perhaps, the spin maestro will celebrate that he played over 100 Tests for India, shedding tears of joy rather than sorrow. If his career didn’t have a perfect ending, it simply wasn’t meant to be.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Jasprit Bumrah is the right-handed Wasim Akram: Justin LangerMust Watch

Rishad Hossain was the standout performer with 3/20, executing a sharp run-out of Johnson Charles and dismissing Rovman Powell, Gudakesh Motie, and Alzarri Joseph. The hosts struggled to build partnerships, with Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran offering the only resistance. This sweep marked a significant turnaround for Bangladesh, coming after a 3-0 loss in the ODI series. The emphatic performances from Jaker Ali and Rishad Hossain signal promising prospects for the team as they build momentum for future challenges.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  R Ashwin responds to Virat Kohli's tribute, reveals poignant MCG message

28674c32-55d9-4384-9b56-28f9b97df423,"Australia drop Nathan McSweeney for Boxing Day Test, add teenage opener to squadBorder-Gavaskar Trophy: Australia named a 15-man squad for the last two tests against India on Friday. In a bold call, the Australian selectors dropped Nathan McSweeney and roped in 19-year-old Sam Konstas. Pacers Jhye Richardson and Sean Abbott also returned to the squad. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-squad-nathan-mcsweeney-dropped-sam-konstas-jhye-richardson-2652715-2024-12-20,"Australia dropped their latest Test debutant, Nathan McSweeney, after just the first three matches in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Australia announced a 15-member squad for the last two Tests of the series. The fourth Test, a Boxing Day blockbuster, starts December 26 in Melbourne. Teenager Sam Konstas has been added to the squad and he is likely to open the batting with Usman Khawaja at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  While the decision to drop 25-year-old Nathan McSweeney after just three Tests has divided opinions, Australia have added the attacking Sam Konstas in a bid to inject some firepower at the top of the order. McSweeney, who made his debut in Perth, had a tough time dealing with Jasprit Bumrah in the first three games.  Meanwhile, Australia have also recalled express pacer Jhye Richardson to the squad for the first time in three years. Along with him, pacer Sean Abbott and Tasmania all-rounder Beau Webster have been added to the squad, which is 15 members in size.  AUSTRALIA SQUAD FOR LAST 2 TESTS OF BGT 2024-25 Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.WHY WAS MCSWEENEY DROPPED?  25-year-old McSweeney was slotted into the opening spot in Perth despite him being a middle-order batter in domestic cricket. McSweeney struggled to get going and keep the scoreboard moving in the first three Tests of the series.  While Usman Khawaja, the senior opener, has also struggled, scoring with an average of just 12 and a top score of 21 so far in the series.  However, Australia have backed their senior opener and dropped the youngster, who is just three Test matches old. McSweeney has managed 72 runs in his first six innings, the lowest by an Australian opener in 50 years in the first six of their career in the longest format of the game.  Chief selector George Bailey explained the decision, backing McSweeney's ability to find success at the highest level, adding Sam Konstas' ability to score at a good pace worked in his favour.  ""We remain confident Nathan has the ability and temperament to succeed at Test level in the future,"" Bailey said. ""It was a difficult decision to leave him out,"" he added. BIG BACKING FOR SAM KONSTAS  Australia have rewarded 19-year-old Sam Konstas for some exciting performances in the ongoing season. Known for his aggressive approach, Konstas is expected to fill the void that David Warner left in the Australian Test team.  Konstas has been making significant waves in the 2024-25 cricket season with his impressive performances across formats.  The 19-year-0ld smashed 56 off just 37 balls for Sydney Thunder in their Big Bash League match on December 17 in Canberra against the Adelaide Strikers.  In the Sheffield Shield, playing for New South Wales, Konstas has scored two centuries and accumulated 369 runs across six innings, highlighting his form in first-class cricket. One of his most standout performances came in the practice match for the Prime Minister's XI against India, where he scored a blistering century. In this pink-ball match at Manuka Oval in Canberra, Konstas hit 107 runs off just 97 balls, including 14 fours and one six, showcasing his exceptional stroke play and ability to handle challenging conditions. Against India A, Konstas made a notable impact, scoring 92 runs in four innings, including a solid 73 off 128 balls in the second unofficial Test in October-November.  Meanwhile, the injury to Josh Hazlewood has forced Australia to bring back Sean Abbott and hand a recall to Jhye Richardson. Australia are looking to provide enough cover for their fast bowlers as the turnaround time between the fourth and the fifth Tests is just three days.  With injury concerns surrounding Mitchell Marsh, Australia also recalled exciting all-rounder Beau Webster. Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Trending Reel

In the auction that took place in Bengaluru, MI picked Maheshwari for Rs 20 lakhs. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-exclusive-interview-akshita-maheshwari-mumbai-indians-wpl-2025-deal-2652644-2024-12-20,"Khelo, kya fark padta hain kaun kya bol raha hain In India, where a layman is still getting accustomed to the concept of women’s cricket, playing the sport for a female athlete comes with its fair share of challenges. For Akshita Maheshwari, Mumbai Indians’ new recruit in the Women’s Premier League, it wasn’t any different. In Jaipur, the youngster was in a circle where cricket is still considered a male-dominated sport, but what was different was her family’s support. When she was in her teens, Akshita had to face rejections from academies that did not promote the women’s game, but they did not stop her from pursuing her dreams passionately. Once she found her way, she kept taking mini strides, rising through age group cricket and, in 2024, landed her maiden WPL deal with the 2023 champions. “I always used to play with my brothers in the terrace, but not that intensely as there were not many girls where my father bought a new house. I never liked staying at home, and preferred going out and playing. My father had to face questions in our colony about me playing with boys every time,” Akshita said in an exclusive interview with India Today.   Also Read: WPL 2025 Auction: Dottin, Simran, Kamalini earn big paycheques, Sneh Rana unsold “But he, my mother and brother supported me; they said, ‘khelo, kya fark padta hain kaun kya bol raha hain, aapko jo accha lagta hain wo karo (play, it doesn’t matter what people are saying, do what your heart says). Then I got to know that there are academies and I looked out for Neerja Modi Academy. “But they said that they don’t teach girls. It was five to six years ago. I went to the KL Saini Cricket Academy for running and I saw another girl training. I immediately called my father, after which I registered there, and it started from there,” Akshita said.The surreal moment With only 19 slots to be filled in the mini-auction, Akshita had to fight with 122 players who threw their hat in the ring. In the opening round and first accelerated round, her name did not pop up. But in the second accelerated round, the franchises shortlisted her, and it was MI, who roped her in at a base price of Rs 20 lakhs. Akshita was plying her trade with Rajasthan in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy when MI picked her.

— Mumbai Indians (@mipaltan) December 17, 2024 “I was in Haryana with my teammates, but wasn’t watching the auction as expectations can get the better of you. But I started watching and knew that my name was there. Then I heard Reema Malhotra di chanting my name ‘Akshita, Akshita’ and I was happy that they are aware of our performance and are tracking us. That increases your hope and expectations. I told my roommate that if my name comes up in the second round of the accelerated auction, well and good, if not, then I will try next year,” Akshita recalled. “Then I got to know that out of the list of 17 players, my name was there. When I was picked by MI, I was happy, but I found it hard to believe in the beginning. Once it happened, my family was very happy, and I started getting calls; it was surreal.”Unexpected things, big goals Interestingly, the WPL deal with MI wasn’t the beginning of Akshita’s association with Mumbai. The Women’s Under-23 One-Day Trophy earlier this year turned her career around. She finished as the second-highest wicket-taker with 23 wickets from eight games at an economy rate of 2.66. The 24-year-old took two hat-tricks and both of them came at venues in Mumbai. Akshita took a hat-trick against Mizoram at the Sachin Tendulkar Gymkhana in Kandivili, where she finished with stupendous figures of 6-4-6-4. Then, at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy at BKC, she took her second hat-trick when she demolished Odisha with figures of 10-1-36-3. On the back of her performance, Rajasthan went through to the quarters where they lost to Haryana by 15 runs. After bagging the WPL deal, Akshita raised her game and helped Rajasthan beat Meghalaya by five wickets in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy match with figures of 10-3-23-4.

 “They say Mumbai sapno ka sheher hain (city of dreams) and it was for me as we had matches at BKC and other venues. Sometimes, unexpected things help you achieve your goals. It was my last year in the U23 tournament and it gave me so much that I entered the WPL. And even more surprisingly, it was Mumbai who picked me and so, I have developed a strong connection with the city,” Akshita said. After honing her skills at the KL Saini Academy, Akshita moved to the GR Cricket Ground in Jaipur and trained under Ashwani Kherwa and Jagaimran Singh. The all-rounder said that it was the words of wisdom from her coaches that helped her move forward. “The spells were very important for me as, two years ago, I wasn’t able to break into the Rajasthan team. But then I got a chance and my coach, Ashwani (Kherwa) Sir, also supported me and gave me belief that I could do it.The learning and idols

 Even as Akshita is known for her fiery fast bowling, she is also someone who can play the big shots lower down the order. MI are known for going for quality all-rounders, including Nat Sciver-Brunt, Amelia Kerr and Hayley Matthews, with South Africa’s Nadine de Klerk being the newest addition to the team. Akshita is eager to rub shoulders with the world’s very best. “Basics are very important. The stronger our basics, the better we will get. I was a part of the Senior Women’s Challenger Trophy, and although I did not play, I got the confidence and learning. I carried that confidence into the One-Day Trophy, which showed in my bowling, batting and fielding. If I play alongside them, my cricket is bound to improve. I want to work on myself and learn as much as possible,” Akshita said. For Akshita, the Indian pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar are her idols. Bumrah is currently on the tour of Australia where he has shouldered the Indian bowling attack with wickets at regular intervals. Bumrah also won the Player of the Match award in the Perth Test. Similar to Bumrah, Akshita talked about building a reputation as someone reliable in the bowling department. “I didn’t watch a lot of cricket earlier. My father was fond of cricket, and so we watched men’s cricket on TV and not women’s cricket. I am a big fan of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah, they are my idols. They are of very high quality. I want to become like them that whenever my team needs a breakthrough, the captain will look up to Akshita to do that. This is how I want to build myself,” she said.Harmanpreet fandom and fastest Shabnim

 Harmanpreet Kaur has played several match-winning knocks for India across all three formats. Akshita sounded excited at the prospect of picking her brains and sharing the same change-room. “I have butterflies in my stomach. She is the captain of the Indian team and sharing the dressing room with an experienced player like her, attending team meetings, net sessions and bowling to her will help me a lot,” Akshita said. Akshita also wants to learn the tricks of the trade from former South African speedster Shabnim Ismail. Earlier this year, Shabnim recorded the fastest ball in women’s cricket when she clocked 132.1 kmph (82.08 miles per hour during the WPL match between MI and Delhi Capitals. “She has bowled the fastest delivery and I just want to see her. Once I see her, talk to her and take her experience, I will be able to apply them in my game. It’s not possible to learn everything overnight, it will take time. But the experience is going to help me get better,” Akshita signed off. In the inaugural edition, it was left-arm Saika Ishaque, who broke into the Indian team after her impressive performances for MI. Hence, there’s every chance for Akshita to make a mark in the upcoming WPL and give herself a chance to break into the Indian team. With the likes of Tejal Hasabnis, Saima Thakor, Priya Mishra and Raghvi Bist donning the national colours in the last two months, Akshita would know that a few decent performances for MI could just be the tonic her career needs for now.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  IND-W vs WI-W: How Smriti Mandhana inspired India to end 5-year drought at homeMust Watch

Tottenham took control early in the game, with Dominic Solanke netting twice and Dejan Kulusevski adding a third to put the hosts ahead 3-0 by the 54th minute. However, two critical mistakes by Spurs’ 36-year-old goalkeeper Fraser Forster dramatically shifted the momentum.

But moments later, under pressure from Zirkzee, he attempted a poor pass intercepted by Bruno Fernandes. Fernandes set up Zirkzee for a simple finish, making it 3-1. The drama heightened seven minutes later when Forster mishandled another backpass, allowing Amad Diallo to slide in and deflect his clearance into the net for 3-2. Diallo, who recently scored a decisive goal against Manchester City, came close to an equaliser with a long-range effort that rattled Forster further.

Australia recently announced their 15-member team for the final two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with Konstas coming in for Mcsweeny, who had only made his Test debut in this BGT series opener in Perth. McSweeney, who debuted in the ongoing series, was dropped after just three matches, a move that sparked mixed reactions amongst fans and former cricketers alike. However, Bailey emphasised that the decision was made to strengthen Australia’s top-order batting, which has struggled against India’s formidable pace attack, particularly Jasprit Bumrah, who has been in some record-breaking form down under. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""We remain confident Nathan has the ability and temperament to succeed at Test level in the future...It was a difficult decision to leave him out,"" Bailey told cricket.com.au on Mcsweeny. ""It has clearly been a challenge at the top of the order for batters throughout the series, and we want to provide the option of a different line-up for the next two matches... Sam gets a call-up to the Test squad for the first time. His style of batting offers a point of difference and we look forward to watching his game develop further,"" he added. Australia's batting unit took a concerning shape in the second innings of the Brisbane Test, where the lineup faltered despite a stellar first-innings performance. Travis Head had smashed 152 off 160 balls, and Steve Smith added a solid 101, but their collapse in the latter innings raised questions about the consistency of their opening pair in Mcsweeny and Usman Khawaja. McSweeney, who was shifted to the opener’s role despite being a middle-order batter in domestic cricket, struggled to adapt, scoring only 72 runs across six innings—a record low for an Australian opener in their first six innings in over five decades. Khawaja, the senior opener, has also faced challenges, averaging just 12 runs in the series with a top score of 21. However, the selectors chose to back Khawaja while dropping McSweeney, prioritising experience over youth.Can Konstas make chance count? The inclusion of Konstas reflects a bold decision aimed at revitalising the lineup. Konstas has been in stellar form during the 2024-25 domestic season, with his most notable performance coming in a pink-ball practice match against India for the Prime Minister's XI. He scored a blistering 107 off 97 balls at Manuka Oval, including 14 boundaries and a six, showcasing his ability to thrive under pressure and adapt to challenging conditions. Bailey expressed confidence in Konstas, highlighting his aggressive stroke play and versatility, which could provide the Australian batting order with much-needed stability and dynamism in the high-stakes Boxing Day Test set to begin on December 26 in Melbourne.AUSTRALIA SQUAD FOR LAST 2 TESTS OF BGT 2024-25 Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  R Ashwin retires: India's greatest match-winner deserved more respect

After months of anticipation, Konstas has finally received his Test call-up for the final two matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. It promises to be a baptism by fire for the young New South Wales cricketer, but the Australian cricket community is quietly confident that Konstas will thrive under pressure.   On Friday, December 20, Australia announced a 15-man squad for the last two Tests against India. With the series level at 1-1 after Australia were denied victory at the Gabba, the selectors have made some pivotal changes to the squad. In a major decision, they have dropped 25-year-old Nathan McSweeney after just three Test matches. McSweeney, who struggled against the Jasprit Bumrah-led pace attack, scored only 72 runs across six innings—the lowest tally for an Australian Test opener in their first six knocks since 1974.   Usman Khawaja fared no better. The 38-year-old managed just 63 runs in six innings but retained his place due to the invaluable experience he offers.   Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Australia appear to have learned a hard lesson. When McSweeney, primarily a middle-order batsman in domestic cricket, was added to the squad at the start of the series, doubts were raised about his ability to handle India’s high-quality attack. McSweeney struggled to keep the scoreboard moving, and Khawaja’s poor form exacerbated the fragility of Australia’s top order.WHO IS SAM KONSTAS By including Sam Konstas, Australia hope to inject aggressive intent at the top of the order. Konstas enters the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with an impressive record across formats.   In December 2024, Konstas made his debut for the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League. Opening alongside David Warner, he smashed a blistering 57 off 26 balls, marking the fastest half-century in Sydney Thunder’s history. His innings included eight boundaries and two sixes, playing a key role in the team’s victory over the Adelaide Strikers.   Konstas also featured for the Prime Minister’s XI in a pink-ball warm-up match against India at Manuka Oval. He scored an outstanding 107 off 97 balls, including 14 fours and a six, against a formidable Indian bowling attack featuring Mohammed Siraj and Ravindra Jadeja. This performance further solidified his reputation as a rising star in Australian cricket.   In October-November 2024, Konstas was selected for Australia A in their series against India A. In the second unofficial Test, he played a crucial role with an unbeaten 73 in the second innings, helping secure a victory for his team. 'LIKE CLARKE, WARNER AND SMITH'  With 736 runs across formats this summer, Konstas has drawn widespread acclaim from cricketing legends and commentators. Former England captain Michael Vaughan had championed his inclusion in the Test squad, describing him as ""fearless"" and ""unflappable.""   England’s World Cup-winning former coach and Sydney Thunder coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised Konstas’s attitude, comparing his confidence to that of David Warner, Steve Smith, and Michael Clarke.   “What I can say is Sam has a self-confidence you don’t see in very many. I’ve only seen it in a few over the years, and all of those players were outstanding Test players and international players, guys like Clarke and Haddin, Warner and Smith,” Bayliss had said, as quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald.   With 718 runs at an average of 42.23 in 11 first-class matches, Konstas has already shown immense promise. If he debuts in Melbourne, he will become only the third Australian cricketer in the last 40 years to make his Test debut as a teenager, following in the footsteps of Pat Cummins and Ashton Agar.

Known for his love of pop culture, Ashwin used a viral line from Thalapathy Vijay's recent blockbuster Tamil film, The Greatest of All Time, to wish his former teammate. Ashwin retired from international cricket on Wednesday, midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He concluded his career as one of the greatest off-spinners in history, taking 537 wickets in 106 Tests. Sundar had penned a heartfelt tribute to Ashwin, saying the senior cricketer has been inspiration and mentor.  Washington Sundar, 25, has been groomed to take over the off-spin responsibilities from Ashwin in red-ball cricket. ""Thupakkiya pudinga washiii! (Hold the gun, Washi)"" Ashwin said, adding: ""The 2 minutes you spoke that night in the get-together was the best."" For the uninitiated, Ashwin's comment referenced a popular line from Thalapathy Vijay, who symbolically passed the baton to rising Tamil film star Sivakarthikeyan, who played a cameo in the film. Vijay, who had announced that GOAT would be his penultimate film before entering politics, handed over the torch to Sivakarthikeyan, a promising commercial hero.

 Ashwin had been one of the pillars of the Test team, especially in home conditions, for over a decade. On the other hand, Sundar was recalled to the Test side for the first time in three years for a home series against New Zealand in October-November.  Sundar made the most of the opportunity, picking up 16 wickets in two Tests and finishing the series, which India lost 0-3, as the leading wicket-taker. Ashwin managed just 9 wickets from three Tests in a rare off-colour series at home.  Sundar was picked in the XI for the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth ahead of Ashwin as the team management hinted they were looking to move on from the veteran.

It remains to be seen if the young Tamil Nadu all-rounder will get a place in the XI in the last two Tests of the series.

Regretting the lack of a grand farewell, Kapil remarked, ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar... Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there-I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him off with a lot of respect and happiness."" Since the announcement of his retirement, Ashwin has been the recipient of heartfelt tributes from the cricketing fraternity. Icons such as Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Gautam Gambhir have all acknowledged the 38-year-old's immense contributions to Indian cricket. Ashwin leaves the game as one of India's greatest matchwinners, with 537 Test wickets—second only to Anil Kumble—and six centuries in the longest format. His record for the most Player of the Series awards in men's Test cricket (11) speaks volumes about his ability to influence games. Known for his innovative skills and cricketing intellect, Ashwin often delivered match-winning performances with both ball and bat. His memorable innings against Bangladesh in Chennai, where he scored a century under pressure, stands out as a testament to his all-round abilities. Ashwin was a vital member of India's triumphs in the 2011 ODI World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy. His stellar performances earned him the ICC Cricketer of the Year and ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year accolades in 2016.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Tune InRead More |  Australia selector explains 'very difficult decision' of dropping Nathan McSweeney

With South Africa currently leading the points table for the ongoing WTC cycle, Bavuma is determined to guide his side to the final, a prestigious milestone for the team and the country's cricketing history. South Africa hold the top position in the WTC standings with 63.33%, placing them within touching distance of securing a spot in the much-anticipated final. Their next challenge comes in the form of a two-match Test series against Pakistan, with the first match scheduled for December 26 at SuperSport Park in Centurion, followed by the New Year's Test at Newlands in Cape Town, starting January 3. Reflecting on the significance of this opportunity, Bavuma expressed the team's collective goal. ""The World Test Championship, it's a World Cup for the red-ball players,"" Bavuma said. ""We've obviously set our sights on seeing ourselves in that final."" The upcoming series against Pakistan is crucial, as a win in one of the two Tests would guarantee their place in the final. The competition for the top spots is fierce, with reigning champions Australia (58.89%) and two-time runners-up India (55.88%) trailing South Africa in the standings. After sweeping Sri Lanka 2-0 in their most recent series, South Africa’s chances of reaching the final look strong. Bavuma was optimistic, saying, ""We've given ourselves a very good opportunity to do so and we're quite close to that. We've played some good cricket as a team. We'd want to continue that. That championship means a lot as well to cricket around the world."" In addition to South Africa, other teams in contention for the final include Australia, India, and Sri Lanka, with Sri Lanka currently sitting in fifth place. As the WTC cycle heads into its final stages, Bavuma reflects on the essence of Test cricket. ""From a pure skill point of view, as players, we've always wanted to play Test cricket. You want to see yourself succeeding where things are tough, where you're tested for long periods,"" he said.

Despite United’s spirited late fightback, they were knocked out of the competition, raising questions about the decision to exclude one of their star players. Pre-match discussions were dominated by Rashford’s absence in United's loss to Tottenham on Friday, following recent comments where the 27-year-old forward expressed his desire for a “new challenge.” Amorim insisted the decision was not rooted in a strained relationship with the player but was based purely on training performance and tactical considerations. However, Rashford’s omission has added fuel to speculation about his uncertain future at the club. “I feel that I do the right thing for the team, so it’s never a mistake. We have to make a selection. Sometimes, like in the game, you feel that some of the guys go inside the pitch and change a little bit of the game. Sometimes it is like that,"" Amorim said post-match. “I think it was not a mistake because I feel I am always doing the best for the team in my way of seeing things,” he added. A product of Manchester United’s academy since the age of seven, Rashford is at a pivotal moment in his career. His role under Amorim has been inconsistent, leading to mounting doubts about his long-term prospects at Old Trafford. This comes despite United’s morale-boosting 2-1 victory over Manchester City in the Premier League just days earlier, where Rashford was also absent from the squad. Although Alejandro Garnacho, another young talent initially left out of the City clash, returned to feature against Tottenham, Rashford remained sidelined. This decision has further intensified rumours about potential exits, with Amorim reiterating that Rashford is ""still a Manchester United player."" Yet, the manager provided little clarity on when the forward might return to action. The timing of Rashford’s exclusion is particularly notable as United face a gruelling schedule with upcoming matches against Bournemouth, Wolves, Newcastle United, and Liverpool. Amorim acknowledged the challenges ahead and stressed the importance of squad harmony and performance-based selections. However, with Rashford’s absence casting a shadow over United’s recent performances, the pressure is mounting on both the player and the manager to resolve the uncertainty. As the season progresses, Rashford’s situation remains a talking point, and whether he can regain his place in the squad will significantly impact United’s fortunes in the coming weeks.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Argentina top FIFA men's football rankings for second straight year

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-prithvi-shaw-own-enemy-mumbai-cricket-on-vijay-hazare-snub-2652785-2024-12-20,"The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has dismissed Prithvi Shaw's dramatic outburst following his withdrawal from the Vijay Hazare Trophy squad, claiming that the volatile batter has repeatedly violated disciplinary guidelines and is ""his own enemy"". The official revealed that Shaw's fitness issues were so significant during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy that the team was ""forced to hide"" him on the field. ""The ball would pass near him, and he would barely make an effort to reach it,"" the official said, speaking anonymously to the news agency PTI. ""Even while batting, he struggled to reach the ball. His fitness, discipline, and attitude are lacking, and we cannot have different rules for different players."" The concerns extended beyond his on-field performance, as Shaw reportedly missed training sessions and frequently returned to the team hotel at odd hours. These behaviors have led to mounting frustration among senior team members, who have begun voicing their displeasure. Prithvi Shaw, excluded from the 16-member Vijay Hazare squad despite being part of Mumbai's title-winning Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy campaign, took to social media to express his disappointment. However, the MCA official dismissed the impact of such posts, emphasizing that the selectors' decisions would not be influenced by public sentiment. ""Social media posts will not sway the Mumbai selectors or the MCA. Shaw needs to focus on his game, not on gaining sympathy,"" the official remarked. Shaw's teammate and Mumbai captain Shreyas Iyer also addressed the issue, offering blunt advice following Mumbai's Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy victory. ""He needs to get his work ethics right. If he does, the sky's the limit for him,"" Iyer said. ""We can't babysit anyone. At the end of the day, it’s his responsibility to figure things out for himself."" Prithvi burst onto the cricket scene with a remarkable Test debut in 2018, scoring a century against the West Indies at just 18 years old. However, his career trajectory has since faltered. Shaw has played only four additional Tests, the last of which was in 2020. His ODI and T20I appearances have also been sparse, with no international white-ball games since 2021. Off-field controversies and inconsistent performances have overshadowed Shaw's talent. In October, he was dropped from Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy squad and assigned a fitness program at the MCA Academy, which he allegedly failed to follow diligently. Adding to the woes, Shaw went unsold at the IPL auction despite setting a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh. This marked another blow for the player once hailed Indian cricket’s next big star. The cricketing community has expressed disappointment at Prithvi Shaw’s inability to capitalise on his potential. ""No one is Shaw's enemy. He is his own enemy,"" the MCA official concluded, summarising the sentiment surrounding the player. For Shaw, the path to redemption lies in introspection, improved fitness, and a renewed commitment to his craft. Only then can he hope to revive his career and fulfil the promise he once showed.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  R Ashwin grateful for calls from Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev on retirement day

""Yes, after the Apex Council Meeting on Thursday, state units were sent a notification about the date of the SGM, which is January 12 at the BCCI headquarters,"" a state association president told PTI. Shah has already taken over as the youngest chairman of ICC on December 1 and Shelar, a seasoned BJP politician, has been sworn in as a cabinet minister in the recently-formed Maharashtra government. As per the Lodha Committee reforms accepted by the Supreme Court, one person can't hold two positions. Shah, who still had a year left in his BCCI tenure before the mandatory cooling-off period, relinquished his post as required. Shelar, who was a Maharashtra BJP president, had to quit the BCCI post as Lodha Reforms do not allow any minister or public servant to be an office-bearer.

This move sparked discussions amongst fans and analysts, adding another layer to the heated rivalry. The aftermath saw a surge in online trolling and banter between the fanbases, solidifying the fierce competition between the two teams. As the 2025 IPL season approaches, expectations are sky-high for another chapter in this storied rivalry.

The decision was made following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan, originally slated to host the tournament exclusively. The ICC announced that India would play its matches at a neutral venue, likely in the UAE. In exchange, Pakistan is exempt from travelling to India for ICC tournaments until 2028, including the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup. The ICC’s statement clarified: “India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue.” ""Pakistan is not losing money. In fact, in this arrangement, Pakistan hasn't even lost its face. No matter how much they might have talked against the Hybrid Model, they had ultimately agreed, but they have also not walked away empty-handed,"" Chopra said. ""It's now almost confirmed that it will be tit for tat. All matches till 2027 will be in the Hybrid Model. If India are not going to Pakistan, Pakistan will also not come to India and play against India. Pakistan will play their matches in a third country,"" he added. This arrangement also applies to the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the Women’s T20 World Cup in 2028, for which Pakistan has secured hosting rights. In his recent YouTube video, Chopra emphasised that this agreement does not harm the PCB financially or reputational-wise.Implications for Global Cricket While the arrangement appears to be a diplomatic solution to the India-Pakistan cricketing impasse, it creates logistical challenges for other cricketing nations. Teams drawn against India and Pakistan will have to navigate increased travel and play in varied conditions. A recent example of these logistical hurdles was the 2023 Asia Cup, co-hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan resulted in the team being stationed in Sri Lanka, forcing other teams to shuttle between the two countries. Players faced drastically different playing conditions, leading to criticism of the tournament’s structure. Uncertainty Ahead The Champions Trophy, set to be held between February and March 2025, still lacks finalised venues. Fans and boards alike remain in the dark about where matches will be played. This uncertainty may affect ticket sales, travel plans, and logistical arrangements for the event. While the hybrid model addresses political sensitivities, it raises significant concerns for global cricket operations. Teams, fans, and administrators will need to adapt to these complexities as they navigate an evolving cricketing landscape.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Australia selector explains 'very difficult decision' of dropping Nathan McSweeney

In his place, Australia brought in 19-year-old Sam Konstas, who has been garnering attention with his remarkable performances in the domestic season. McSweeney, 25, scored 72 runs across six innings in the first three Tests. While he struggled against the Jasprit Bumrah-led bowling attack, he showed considerable resilience during the twilight session on Day 1 of the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. His partnership with Marnus Labuschagne was pivotal in helping Australia post a strong first-innings total, which led to a 10-wicket victory in the match. Several fans and pundits expressed dissatisfaction with McSweeney's exclusion after just three Tests. Some even criticised Bailey for selecting McSweeney, who had been batting in the middle order in domestic cricket, as an opener and then failing to back him after three matches.  Senior batter Usman Khawaja has struggled, scoring just 63 runs in the series so far while Marnus Labuschagne has managed just 83 runs, but the axe fell on McSweeney.

We believed it doesn’t change too much wherever he’s coming in the order. It hasn’t quite worked out as you’d like it to, but it’s still very much the start of his career.” he added.  Sam Konstas, 19, is all set to open the batting alongside Usman Khawaja in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Konstas will become first teenager since Pat Cummins in 2011 to make his debut for the Australian men's Test team.  Konstas smashed 56 off just 37 balls for Sydney Thunder in their Big Bash League match on December 17 in Canberra against the Adelaide Strikers. In the Sheffield Shield, playing for New South Wales, Konstas has scored two centuries and accumulated 369 runs across six innings, highlighting his form in first-class cricket. One of his most standout performances came in the practice match for the Prime Minister's XI against India, where he scored a blistering century. In this pink-ball match at Manuka Oval in Canberra, Konstas hit 107 runs off just 97 balls, including 14 fours and one six, showcasing his exceptional stroke play and ability to handle challenging conditions.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Pakistan had also considered England and Dubai as potential venues. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi stated that other details, such as the timing of the draft and the venue specifics, would be shared later. Gwadar, a key hub of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, boasts one of the most beautiful and scenic cricket grounds in the country. However, due to recent attacks on security installations in the area, it has not hosted any cricket matches so far. Naqvi explained that the decision to select Gwadar aimed to bring the game closer to the people of Balochistan and inspire future generations. ""Gwadar, with its stunning coastline and strategic importance, represents the heart of Pakistan’s economic future. By hosting the PSL player draft here, we aim to highlight its cultural and economic significance while celebrating the unity cricket brings to our nation,"" Naqvi said. ""I look forward to welcoming all the franchises and relevant stakeholders to the beautiful city of Gwadar as we take an exciting step toward marking the start of the 10th edition of Pakistan's biggest sporting extravaganza,"" he added. The PCB has already announced the list of Pakistani players placed by their franchises in the platinum and other categories. However, the final list of foreign players available for the draft is yet to be released. This will be the first time the PSL, launched in 2016, clashes with the Indian Premier League (IPL), as it is scheduled to take place during the same window usually reserved for the IPL. The PCB and its franchises are making efforts to attract high-profile overseas players who went unsold in last month's IPL auction.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  U19 Women's T20 Asia Cup: Aayushi Shukla stars as India beat Sri Lanka to reach final

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ind-vs-aus-kl-rahul-opener-border-gavaskart-trophy-dinesh-karthk-2652987-2024-12-20,"Former India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik has urged the team management to give KL Rahul extended backing at the top of the batting order. Karthik stated that Rahul is often underappreciated, particularly for his contributions away from home in Test cricket, and added that the selectors should not have short memories. Karthik's comments come at a time when Rahul has re-established himself as the first-choice opening batter in Test cricket. The Karnataka batsman was initially picked in the 18-man squad for a middle-order role, but Rohit Sharma's absence in the series opener in Perth forced the management to play Rahul at the top. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal impressed at the top of the order, combining for a match-winning 201-run partnership in the second innings of the first Test in Perth. Rahul contributed with a gritty 77, playing a pivotal role in India's victory. Even after Rohit Sharma returned for the second Test in Adelaide, KL Rahul continued to open alongside Jaiswal. Rohit moved to No. 6 but has struggled in the lower middle order. Meanwhile, Rahul strengthened his reputation at the top with a match-saving 84 in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane. ""I believe, in KL Rahul, we have the opener that India needs. I hope they continue to back him. If, within the next year, there's a series where he has a couple of low scores, I hope people don’t have a short memory. We need to appreciate what he has done and what he is doing today. That matters a lot. People often forget that many Test cricketers are judged on what they do abroad. And Rahul has been as good as anyone who has played for the country over an extended period,"" Dinesh Karthik told Cricbuzz. ""People always complain about his consistency; I don't want to use that word. But he takes it upon himself. His average shows that. But he is far better than that. He is someone who is much, much better than that."" ""But, if you take any Indian team planning to tour abroad, he will be one of the first names on that list because you know exactly what you will get from him,"" he added. Rahul has been India's leading run-scorer in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, amassing 235 runs in six innings at an average of 47. Since the start of 2021, KL Rahul has scored 889 runs, including three centuries, at an average of 40.40 in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia).

The WPBL promises a competitive and inclusive spectacle in January-February next year. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/world-pickleball-league-gaurav-natekar-interview-2652892-2024-12-20,"Pickleball, one of the fastest-growing sports worldwide, is poised to make a significant splash in India with the inaugural edition of the World Pickleball League (WPBL). Combining the sport's rapid rise in popularity with top-tier global talent and an entertainment-packed format, the league is set to redefine sports engagement in the country. The WPBL, co-founded by former Indian tennis stars Gaurav Natekar and Arati Ponnappa Natekar, promises a competitive and inclusive spectacle while tapping into pickleball's growing community appeal. With the Cricket Club of India (CCI) hosting the league, it marks a historic moment -- the iconic venue's first non-cricket sporting event in over 15 years. Scheduled from January 24 to February 02, the league will bring together players from 14 countries, delivering a truly global pickleball showcase. For Gaurav Natekar, a seven-time national tennis champion and Arjuna Awardee, the transition to pickleball was natural, driven by the sport's accessibility and inclusive ethos. ""Pickleball is going to explode in India primarily for three reasons. First, it is very easy to play but tough to master. It requires very little space and significantly less infrastructure compared to building a badminton, squash, tennis, volleyball, or basketball court,"" he told India Today. ""The third reason is that it's age-agnostic. Forty per cent of the players in this sport are women. I mean, you know, my background of, you know, me and my wife, Arati, who's played tennis for India, my dad, my in-laws, and as a family, we could never really get down to playing one sport together. A couple of months back, 16 of us played pickleball together. The oldest was 66, and the youngest was 11. That's when it really hit me that this is a game for community and relationship building.""STAR-STUDDED LEAGUE WITH COMPETITIVE EDGE The WPBL recently concluded its player draft, selecting 48 players from a pool of 75 contracted athletes, representing 14 countries, including India, Spain, Japan, South Korea, and the UK. With franchises based in Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Delhi, each team comprises eight players, four men and four women, with a mandatory Indian player in every squad.

Addressing the competition in India's budding pickleball ecosystem, Natekar emphasised, ""I think there is competition in everything, right? One thing that playing sport at the highest level has taught me is that one has to focus on what one needs to do. So I'm very focused, me and Arati are both very focused on the next point in the next game. ""We believe in our ability and our capability. This is the first time, from what I am told, that there are two international-level players who've actually started a league. Otherwise, leagues are generally started by business houses. This is the first time that we are attempting to do a league of this scale.""COLD WAR BETWEEN TENNIS AND PICKLEBALL? Natekar also addressed the much-talked-about cold war between tennis and pickleball. The former tennis player acknowledged concerns raised by many, including Novak Djokovic, about pickleball eating into the tennis ecosystem. ""Tennis is my first love. Tennis has given me everything. And not only me, but even my wife, Arti Ponnappa, you know, we've got everything from tennis. I think having said that we are in the sports business. It's almost as if, you know, you're asking a cricketer, why are you getting into another sport, right? So it's not that I don't love tennis. Tennis has and will be my first love. While I think Novak's comment needs to be taken a little seriously because he obviously knows what he's saying. I don't know whether it is a huge threat to tennis. I think that there is a space for both sports to exist and coexist,"" the former tennis player said. All eyes are on the World Pickleball League.

Notably, McSweeney didn’t have a memorable start to his career has he could only score 72 runs from first three games. The 25-year-old was picked in the team on the back of some solid performances against India A and in the Sheffield Shield trophy. However, the Queensland-born batter failed to emulate his good show at the international level as he was tormented by Jasprit Bumrah.  Following his poor performances, McSweeney finds himself out of the team and has been replaced by Sam Konstas. His dropping hasn’t gone down well with Clarke who felt that he should’ve got a long run at the top of the order. ""Nathan McSweeney has been dropped. I can't believe that. No matter who they picked in that opening position, they had to give them the series. I think the selectors have got this wrong. We've got Usman Khawaja who is 38 years old, and he's made no runs. He's a senior player,"" Clarke said on the Beyond 23 Cricket podcast. Further speaking ahead, Clarke highlighted the ageing Australian batting line up and felt that the selectors also need to look at the future.What happens if Usman Khawaja retires in two Test matches?: Clarke ""We've got Marnus Labuschagne, who before the series was under pressure and has made one decent score. Steve Smith batted like a genius to make a hard-fought hundred, but he's also been under pressure. Everyone apart from McSweeney is over 30 years of age, some in their high 30s. What happens if Usman Khawaja retires in two Test matches? Does McSweeney then come back in, or does he go to the back of the queue? They've got to come out and say, ‘We made a mistake picking him,'"" he added. Meanwhile, Sam Konstas also starred in the recent tour matches against India A as he scored a match-winning unbeaten 73 in the second unofficial Test. The 19-year-old also boasts a good first class average of 42.23 and will be eager to continue his good form at the international level as well in the fourth Test beginning from 26th December in Melbourne.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  BCCI to hold Special General Meeting in January to elect Jay Shah's replacement

The match was part of a three-game series, played in Harare. The incident occurred in the fifth over of Zimbabwe's innings when Farooqi expressed frustration after his LBW appeal against Craig Ervine was turned down. The left-arm pacer made a gesture requesting a review, despite the match not having DRS (Decision Review System) available. This act breached Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which penalises players for “showing dissent at an umpire’s decision during an international match.” In addition to the fine, one demerit point has been added to Farooqi's disciplinary record. This marks his first offence within a 24-month period. The bowler admitted to the violation and accepted the penalty proposed by Match Referee Andy Pycroft.

Miandad stated that the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) mediation of the new agreement between India and Pakistan for world events represents a bigger victory for Pakistan than for their arch-rivals. On Thursday, 20 December, the ICC announced that next year's Champions Trophy would be held in a hybrid model—featuring three venues in Pakistan and a neutral venue to host India’s matches. The decision followed a protracted standoff after India refused to travel to Pakistan. Although Pakistan initially rejected the hybrid model, the ICC ensured that all stakeholders, including the BCCI and PCB, reached an agreement. Pakistan had previously suffered setbacks, including losing nine matches and the final, when they agreed to host last year’s Asia Cup using a hybrid model. The ICC also announced that matches between India and Pakistan in world events hosted by either country between 2025 and 2028 would be held at neutral venues. ""I think the PCB took the sensible approach and, instead of doing something rash and facing isolation from the ICC and other cricketing nations, opted for a solution where I believe the PCB has gained more than the BCCI,"" Miandad said, as quoted by the PTI news agency. ""Still, Pakistan is hosting a major event after a very long time, and we have sent a clear message that if you don’t come and play in our country, we will also not play in India,"" he added. The agreement means that Pakistan will not travel to India for their matches during the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the Men’s T20 World Cup in 2026. Meanwhile, Pakistan was also awarded the hosting rights for the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2028 on Thursday. However, the PCB was not compensated monetarily for the partial loss of hosting rights for the Champions Trophy. Former Pakistan spinner Iqbal Qasim praised the PCB for successfully securing the ICC, BCCI, and ICC board’s agreement on a compromise formula. ""The BCCI is a very strong and financially influential board. But unlike last year’s Asia Cup, this time our board took a stance and gained something. The main thing is that we are hosting the tournament and will also not travel to India to play in ICC events. Both teams will now compete at neutral venues,"" Qasim said.

And that partnership, I think of about 80 or 90, suddenly turned the game on its head and by the end of the day, India had won the Test match.”Watch the video here-

Notably, Ashwin recently announced his retirement from international cricket after the third Test against Australia in Brisbane. The veteran all-rounder has been arguably the biggest match-winner for India in the longest format, which is evident from his 11 Player of the Series awards. Recently, Pujara opened up on Ashwin’s overseas performances and mentioned how he always played a key role for the team in SENA(South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia) countries. Pujara highlighted that Ashwin may not have picked fifers in SENA but was always consistent with his key strikes and picked big wickets from the opposing teams. “Yes, they are underrated and when he performs the way he performs in India because most of the time it will be fifers or three or four wickets. But there are times where he will pick two or three important wickets away from India and those are key wickets. For example, we’re talking about getting Smith out, I think it was in Melbourne 2020. But those are some of the key wickets overseas, important ones. It’s not about picking a fifer, it’s about picking those two-three quick wickets to support other bowlers. Sometimes, we underestimate that role,” Pujara said on ESPNCricinfo. Further speaking ahead, Pujara hailed the India spinner for evolving his game with time and revealed his preparations to outsmart batters.Ashwin retires as India's 2nd highest wicket taker in Tests “He’s evolved as a bowler, he’s got lot of variations in his bowling because he’s someone who likes to think about his game. He likes to think about the opponents as well. What kind of strategies do they have, what are the options a batter has? when he’s facing Ashwin. So, he thinks from both sides. He knows his game plan as well but at the same time, it’s important as well to understand what the batter is trying to do by seeing his videos. The strength which Ashwin had, which he’s developed over a period of time, is having enough variations in his bowling,” he added. Ashwin didn’t have a memorable time in SENA nations at the beginning of his career as he averaged in the high 40s in the initial few years. However, he made a remarkable comeback from 2018 onwards as he got under the skin of top players such as Alastair Cook and Steve Smith. The off spinner played crucial roles in India’s famous wins in Adelaide 2018, Melbourne 2020 and Centurion 2021. Ashwin retired as the second-highest wicket taker for India in Tests with 537 scalps from 106 matches at an average of 24 with 37 five wicket hauls and eight ten wicket hauls in his career.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  BCCI to hold Special General Meeting in January to elect Jay Shah's replacement

PBKS acquired Shreyas for a whopping Rs 26.75 crore in the IPL 2025 auction after the batter led Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to their third IPL title in 2024. 2024 has been a remarkable year for Shreyas Iyer, as the India batter won four trophies as a captain. Under his leadership, Mumbai won the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT), clinching their second-ever SMAT title. The team defeated Madhya Pradesh by five wickets in the final at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, with Iyer once again showcasing his leadership prowess.

— Punjab Kings (@PunjabKingsIPL) December 20, 2024 Reflecting on his recent achievements, Iyer shared his excitement for the upcoming IPL season: ""It's been a surreal feeling after winning SMAT. A lot of hard work went on behind the scenes, and the boys were tremendous in their performance. Now, we are done with this part and moving on to the next big thing, which is IPL. I'm super excited to be part of Punjab Kings and can't wait to join the Punjab Kings family,"" Iyer said in a video posted by the franchise. Iyer's success in 2024 has been marked by a series of impressive victories, having led teams to four major titles. As he prepares for the IPL 2025 season, his primary goal is clear: to win the IPL for Punjab Kings. ""It's been a great year for me personally, winning four trophies this season. My main goal now is to win the IPL for Punjab. I understand the feeling among the fans, and with Ricky Ponting coming in, we share a great camaraderie from the past. We will be brainstorming on many aspects and hopefully deliver from match one,"" Iyer added. Ricky Ponting, the newly appointed head coach of Punjab Kings, has already expressed confidence in Iyer's leadership abilities. The former Australian captain's tactical insights and wealth of experience will be invaluable as Iyer looks to steer the team toward its maiden IPL title. The synergy between Ponting and Iyer is expected to be a major strength for Punjab Kings, and fans are hopeful that the team's combination of fresh leadership and renewed momentum will break the franchise's title drought.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Prithvi Shaw is his own enemy: Mumbai Cricket breaks silence on Vijay Hazare snub

This leadership role comes at a time when Rinku's IPL franchise, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), has yet to announce their captain for the next season. Rinku will captain a state team at the senior level for the first time. Earlier this year, he led the Meerut Mavericks to victory in the UPT20 League, scoring 210 runs in nine innings with a strike rate of 161.54, primarily as a finisher. He has been a part of the KKR setup since 2018 and was retained ahead of the mega auction in November, along with Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ramandeep Singh. ""I am not overthinking about the captaincy of KKR in the new IPL season,"" Rinku was quoted saying to ESPN Cricinfo. ""I am focused on my plans for Uttar Pradesh, as I want my team to regain the trophy we had won for the first time in 2015-16."" Rinku revealed his efforts to become a more versatile cricketer, citing his attempts at bowling off spin during the UPT20 league.  ""I did try my hand at bowling [offspin] too at the UPT20 league. Present-day cricket demands a full package - a cricketer who can bat, bowl and field. Now I am focusing on my bowling too. As captain of Uttar Pradesh, I have got a bigger role to play, and I'm ready for this."" The Vijay Hazare Trophy presents a crucial opportunity for players aiming to make an impression on national selectors, particularly with the Champions Trophy scheduled for February. While Rinku has become a regular feature in India’s T20I squad, his ODI appearances remain limited to two matches since his debut in South Africa last year. Rinku’s List A statistics underline his potential: he has amassed 1,899 runs in 52 innings at an impressive average of 48.69 and a strike rate of 94.8. His record includes one century and 17 half-centuries. Despite these achievements, Rinku remains grounded. ""I believe in God,"" he said. ""I didn't even think of being part of team India when I struck five consecutive sixes in the IPL last year. That turned out to be the biggest game changer in my life. Even now I feel that if God has decided something for me, I will get that surely. But at the same time, I also need to work hard on my job."" As the captain of Uttar Pradesh, Rinku Singh carries the responsibility of guiding his team to replicate their 2015-16 Vijay Hazare Trophy triumph. His focus on team success over personal milestones reflects his maturity and leadership qualities. The upcoming tournament will not only test his abilities as a leader but also solidify his position as a key figure in Indian domestic cricket.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Ravichandran Ashwin's overseas contributions are underrated: Cheteshwar Pujara

Notably, Rohit is known for his nature of forgetting things which he’s openly shared during his various interviews. Recently, Imam was asked in a podcast what he would do if he woke up as Rohit Sharma. The Pakistan cricketer replied that he would look where his things were and what all he did the previous night, keeping in mind Rohit’s forgetful nature. The Pakistan batter went on to call him a different level of personality, mentioning how he even forgets his gloves and bats. “I’ll look where I put everything in the night, where did I put my shoes, where did I keep my phone, where did I put my belt, who did I message, who did I phone. Oh my God, you haven’t met him, he’s a different level of personality. He completely forgets where he kept his gloves and bats,” said Imam on Cricwick’s Ultra Edge podcast. Further speaking ahead, Imam shared a story involving Babar and Rohit from the 2023 ODI World Cup mentioning how Babar prevented Rohit’s phone from being lost. “Babar told me about this story, do you remember there was a captain’s meeting before World Cup 2023 and these guys went in a plane? He had bought a new iPhone, and AirPods. He said they were talking and he first left his iPhone here, then left it in the plane, and then his AirPods every two minutes,” he added.India to play Champions Trophy matches at neutral venue “Then, he was cursing himself, what am I doing, I keep forgetting things everywhere. [Babar] said twice he took his phone saying, 'Rohit bhai, apna phone rakhein,' (please keep your phone with you.) He even had to call up his manager to say that he had left his AirPods. He forgets his things constantly,” Imam said.

The ICC (International Cricket Council) shared the update on 19th December clearing the path for the announcement of the schedule soon. The Champions Trophy 2025 is expected to be another blockbuster cricketing tournament where India and Pakistan will be once again seen locking horns with each other. Pakistan will be defending their title in the upcoming edition having won the trophy back  in 2017 by beating India in the final.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  BCCI to hold Special General Meeting in January to elect Jay Shah's replacement

— Virat Kohli Fan Club (@Trend_VKohli) December 20, 2024  Kohli had an argument with a female Australian journalist at Melbourne airport. The incident occurred when Kohli landed in Melbourne with his wife, actor Anushka Sharma, and their children on Thursday, December 19. A journalist from Australia’s Channel 7 captured a video of the family, which angered Kohli, according to local media. The cricketer was particularly upset about the intrusion into his family’s privacy. He approached the journalist, requesting to view the pictures and videos taken. Kohli then asked her to delete any images or footage of his family, while allowing her to retain any of him alone. Under Australian law, there are no restrictions on photographing or filming celebrities in public places, which likely complicated the matter. ""With my kids, I need some privacy. You can't film without asking me,"" he told the media at the airport.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ravi-shastri-reacts-to-india-brisbane-follow-on-celebrations-vs-australia-2653014-2024-12-20,"Former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes India's Brisbane follow-on celebrations were fully justified, and the tourists can use this achievement as a springboard as the Test series against Australia moves towards Melbourne. Shastri said that India's remarkable fightback on the final day of the third Test against Australia in Brisbane was a defining moment in the ongoing series. The former Indian coach praised the team's resilience, particularly the efforts of Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep, who played pivotal roles in ensuring India avoided the follow-on in a crucial moment of the match. Speaking on The ICC Review with host Sanjana Ganesan, Ravi Shastri emphasised that the celebrations after India managed to escape the follow-on were fully justified, considering the context of the match and the series. ""You should celebrate,"" Shastri said. ""It required a lot of character from the last pair with 35-36 runs needed. That celebration showed, they knew the importance of that effort within the dressing room in the context of the series."" For Shastri, the fight to avoid the follow-on was not just about saving face-it was about setting the tone for the next Test. He explained that it could have been disastrous for India to go into the second innings behind by more than 200 runs, especially with a vulnerable batting order. ""It's one thing following on, it's one thing then again being 2-3 down as opposed to, you going ahead and rattling the Australian top-order,"" Shastri remarked. ""It is fully justified."" The former coach also drew parallels with another iconic moment in India's recent Test history-the unforgettable 89-run partnership between Bumrah and Mohammed Shami at Lord's during the 2021 England series, which turned the game on its head. ""It reminded me of the celebration, when in COVID times, when Jasprit and Mohammed Shami were involved in a partnership at Lord's, which turned the game on its head,"" Shastri recalled. ""England were odds on favourites on the final day to win the Test. And that partnership, I think of about 80 or 90, suddenly turned the game on its head and by the end of the day, India had won the Test match."" Shastri stressed that India's recent success in Test cricket has often been built on the tenacity and resilience of their tail-enders. From Bumrah and Shami's remarkable partnerships to the steadfast efforts of Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari in Sydney, India's lower order has often been the unsung hero in their fights. ""When the tail-enders are stubborn, they fight it out there. It makes a massive difference,"" Shastri noted. ""It did it on the last tour. When Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari batted the whole of the last session to save the game, going into the Gabba and then winning the series."" Such efforts provide a psychological lift for the team, and Shastri believes this fightback in Brisbane could play a crucial role as India prepares for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. ""It'll lift the Indian team. And for me, the series is on a level peg now and India might just be calling the shots,"" Shastri said. With the series tied at 1-1, Shastri expressed optimism for India's prospects moving forward. Reflecting on the challenging road India has already faced, Shastri acknowledged how significant the 1-1 scoreline is for the team. ""Massive. They would give anything for a 1-1 result,"" he said, considering the difficulties of the early stages of the series, which included the fast, bouncy pitches of Perth and the challenges of Adelaide's day-night Test. ""The first Test is in Perth, second Test is a day-nighter in Adelaide, and then the third Test in Brisbane. Any overseas team will, you know, settle for a 1-1 score because come Melbourne, come Sydney, I think India will be powerful."" Shastri expressed confidence in India's chances in Melbourne, despite the close call in Brisbane. ""They've been kept in this series single-handedly by Jasprit Bumrah,"" he said. ""If the big boys wake up, and step up to the plate which I just get the gut feeling they will, then Australia has a problem on their hands."" With India heading into the Boxing Day Test with renewed belief, Shastri added, ""Yeah, they got out of jail but they are not on bail. They are free birds in Melbourne. They can do what they want and come and attack Australia on Boxing Day.""Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Javed Miandad reacts to Champions Trophy solution: PCB has gained more than BCCI
