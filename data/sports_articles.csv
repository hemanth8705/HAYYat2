""I, for one, am a bit disappointed that you ended your career today at the international level. Ideally, I would have wanted to see you go beyond 619, but you have your reasons for that,"" Kumble added.Kumble's wish for Ashwin Kumble also wished Ashwin the best of luck for his future endeavours. ""All the best to you in your second chapter. And I am sure it will be as glorious as chapter one. So, Ash, here’s to a fantastic career that you’ve had for India. And congratulations once again. All the very best. Catch you soon,"" Kumble concluded.

The squad sees the inclusion of Keshav Maharaj and Wiaan Mulder, both of whom are recovering from injuries, while also offering opportunities to uncapped players like Corbin Bosch and Kwena Maphaka. Maharaj, who was forced to miss the first ODI against Pakistan due to an acute groin strain sustained during warm-ups, will undergo a scan to assess the injury's severity. His inclusion in the Test squad comes despite this setback, with Cricket South Africa (CSA) closely monitoring his recovery. Meanwhile, Mulder is returning to full fitness after a fractured right middle finger ruled him out of the second Test against Sri Lanka. The all-rounder has completed the final phase of his recovery and will provide additional depth to the South African squad. If Mulder is selected for the first Test, batter Matthew Breetzke will be released from the squad. In a significant move, 30-year-old seamer Corbin Bosch has earned his first call-up to the Test team. Bosch has impressed with his all-round performances in domestic cricket, taking 72 wickets at an average of 36.75 across 34 first-class matches, while also contributing with the bat. His selection follows strong performances for the SA Invitational XI against England Lions, where he claimed 1-21. Alongside Bosch, uncapped seamer Kwena Maphaka retains his place in the squad after being part of the group for the second Test against Sri Lanka. South Africa Test squad Temba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Corbin Bosch, Matthew Breetzke, Tony de Zorzi, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kwena Maphaka, Aiden Markram, Wiaan Mulder, Senuran Muthusamy, Dane Paterson, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Kyle Verreynne (wk). CSA head coach Shukri Conrad expressed confidence in the squad's ability to challenge Pakistan, with the pace attack seen as one of the team's strongest assets. ""We are excited to see Corbin make his step up to Test cricket. His all-round ability adds depth to our attack, and his pace brings an extra bite. We’re also closely monitoring Keshav's injury and hope it won’t be too serious,"" said Conrad. South Africa enters the series with a clear objective — a win over Pakistan would bring them a step closer to securing a place in the World Test Championship Final. With one more victory needed to guarantee a spot, the Proteas are eager to extend their lead at the top of the WTC standings. “We’re focused on the task at hand — a spot in the World Test Championship Final is the ultimate goal. This series against Pakistan will be a tough challenge, especially with their talented fast bowlers, but we believe our squad is well-equipped for the task,"" Conrad added. The first Test against Pakistan will be played at SuperSport Park in Centurion, with the second Test taking place at Cape Town in the New Year. South Africa's batters, who stood up during the series against Sri Lanka, will be keen to showcase their skills against a quality Pakistan bowling attack in the upcoming series.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Also Read |  Watch: Retiring R Ashwin's emotional parting speech at Gabba dressing roomMust Watch

Let us recall some of Ashwin's memorable performances in the blue jersey for India. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/ravichandran-ashwin-white-ball-cricket-odis-retirement-test-heroics-australia-vs-india-2651920-2024-12-18,"When Ravichandran Ashwin first broke into the Indian Test team in 2011, he faced considerable criticism. Many viewed him as a 'white-ball specialist,' doubting his ability to succeed in the rigours of Test cricket. Yet as Ashwin bids farewell to all formats of the game, he leaves behind a legacy as one of the greatest Test players. But let’s not overlook the legend’s invaluable contributions to white-ball cricket. While Ashwin’s mastery of long spells and his role as the spearhead of India’s bowling attack during their dominant run at home since 2015 are celebrated, his white-ball heroics—often in tandem with MS Dhoni’s brilliance behind the stumps—are equally unforgettable.The Champions Trophy 2013 Final In the rain-marred final of the 2013 Champions Trophy, Ravichandran Ashwin showcased nerves of steel and a wizardry with the ball that scipted his name into Indian cricket folklore. Tasked with defending a modest 129, Ashwin rose to the occasion, delivering a spell that turned the tide in India’s favor.   Opening his account with remarkable precision, Ashwin struck twice in successive overs, dismissing Jonathan Trott and Joe Root to derail England’s chase. His first two overs yielded just six runs and two wickets, an exceptional effort in a high-stakes encounter. As the tension mounted, Ashwin bowled a game-changing maiden in his third over, which tightened the noose around England’s batting lineup.  When the equation boiled down to England needing 15 off the final over, MS Dhoni entrusted Ashwin to deliver under immense pressure. True to his reputation, the spinner showcased remarkable composure, outwitting the batters with his variations and taking India to a thrilling five-run victory.   Ashwin’s brilliant 2/15 was more than just figures; it was a defining performance that secured India the Champions Trophy title and reaffirmed his stature as a match-winner in clutch moments.

— Harsh 17 (@harsh03443) December 18, 2024 Ravichandran Ashwin once again showcased his unmatched game awareness and composure in one of the most nail-biting moments of the T20 World Cup 2022. Facing Pakistan in a high-stakes tournament opener at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground, India needed 16 runs off the final over to seal a dramatic win.   With Virat Kohli’s heroic knock keeping India alive, the equation boiled down to two runs required off the final ball. Ashwin, walking in under immense pressure, displayed a remarkable presence of mind. As Mohammad Nawaz delivered a high-pressure delivery, Ashwin coolly assessed that the ball would miss his leg stump and let it sail past. His judgment paid off, earning India a crucial extra run as the umpire signalled a wide.   Now with the scores level, the pressure remained intense, but Ashwin stayed unfazed. Off the very next delivery, he lofted the ball gracefully over mid-off as India secured a historic victory. 
This moment showcased Ashwin’s cricketing intelligence, proving why he is often hailed as one of the sharpest minds in the game.

He finished with figures of 10-1-41-2, picking up the crucial wickets of Chris Gayle and Devon Smith. His ability to contain runs while striking at key moments gave the team an edge. In the high-stakes quarter-final against defending champions Australia, Ashwin once again stepped up.

The 33-year-old then returned to the court in March where she took part in the Miami Open. Halep sounded excited on her return to Melbourne Park. ""I have been working hard to get ready for the 2025 season. The Australian Open has provided me with some of the best moments in my career, so I can't wait to be back in Melbourne and playing in front of the Aussie fans,” Halep, who is currently ranked No.877  in the world, said.

Former Australia stars Brad Haddin and Brett Lee wondered why Ashwin decided to leave in the middle of the Australia tour.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ind-vs-aus-ravichandran-ashwin-retirement-shocks-haddin-brett-lee-2651889-2024-12-18,"India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's shock retirement baffled former Australian cricketers Brad Haddin and Brett Lee. Ashwin, who announced his decision after the conclusion of the Gabba Test match on Wednesday, 18 December, said that he would reveal more details about his retirement call later. Haddin and Brett Lee, speaking during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy's 3rd Test match, speculated if everything was right in that Indian dressing room. Haddin, while speaking to Fox Cricket said that Ashwin might have been frustrated given India used three spinners in the first three Test matches of the series, out of which he only played one in Adelaide. “More will come out when Ashwin has his opportunity to speak; just reading between the lines, it looked like he may have been a bit frustrated with the spinning options that they’ve changed in the first three Test matches,” Brad Haddin told Fox Cricket after his press conference. “To me, he was a student of the game (and) always looking at ways to get better ... he’s earned the right.” Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Former Australia cricketer compared Ashwin's retirement to that of Graeme Swann who called it quits during the infamous 2013-14 Ashes, where England were rolled over by Australia Down Under. “I think the last time a spinner retired through a series (in Australia) was Graeme Swann,” said Lee. “He may have been told that he’s not going to play any further part in this series, and rightly so, (he) just decided to go out on his own terms.” Also Read: When Rohit convinced Ashwin to play in Adelaide Legendary former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar was critical of Ashwin's decision and said that Ashwin's choice to leave mid-series leaves India short of one key cricketer. “He could have said, listen after the end of the series, I won’t be available for selection for India. What it does is that, similarly when MS Dhoni retired at the end of the third Test in 2014-15 series, it leaves you one short. The selection committee has picked so many players for a tour with a purpose. If there are any injuries, they can select from the reserve players to have in the team.” Gavaskar told broadcasters. “So, Sydney is somewhere where there is a lot of support on offer for spinners. So India could have played with two spinners. You never know. He could have been there for sure. I don’t know how the pitch in Melbourne will be like. Normally, you tend to look at the end of the series. That’s it. In the middle, it is not usual.

Rashford, 27, ignited speculation about his future on Tuesday during a visit to his old school, where he hinted at being ""ready for the next steps."" The timing of the statement raised eyebrows as it came just days after he was left out of the squad for United's dramatic 2-1 derby win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. When asked about Rashford's remarks, Amorim struck a composed yet emphatic tone. ""I don't talk about the future; we talk about the present,"" he said during the pre-match press conference for Thursday's League Cup quarter-final against Tottenham Hotspur. ""We are better with Marcus Rashford. This kind of club needs big talents - and he is a big talent."" Having been with the club since the age of seven, Rashford is synonymous with United's identity. He has made 426 appearances since his debut in 2016, scoring 138 goals and winning the Europa League, two FA Cups, and two League Cups. However, his form has dipped in recent seasons. Despite a stellar 2022-23 campaign with 30 goals in 56 matches, Rashford managed just eight goals in 43 appearances last term, marking the lowest shot conversion rate of his career at 9.4%. This season, his appearances have been sporadic, with his last Premier League start coming in a 4-0 win against Everton on December 1, where he scored twice. Amorim acknowledged the forward's recent struggles but expressed unwavering confidence in his ability to regain top form. ""We will try different things to push Rashford to the best levels that he has shown me in the past,"" he said. Rashford's exclusion from the derby squad, along with 20-year-old Argentine winger Alejandro Garnacho, sparked questions about Amorim's approach. The Portuguese manager explained his decisions as part of a larger effort to enforce high standards across the squad. ""I have to make choices based on what I see in training,"" Amorim stated. ""Rashford and Garnacho are in the same situation as every other player. If they train well, they'll be considered for selection."" While Rashford's comments about seeking a new challenge might suggest a potential exit, Amorim framed the situation differently, urging his players to embrace the ""new challenge"" of restoring Manchester United to its former glory. ""For me, this is the biggest challenge in football because we are in a difficult situation,"" Amorim said. ""I really hope all my players are ready for this new challenge."" Amorim also reiterated his desire to see Rashford thrive within the team, emphasizing the importance of the forward's contribution. ""What I want is to take the best of Marcus Rashford. He just needs to perform at the highest level, and that's my focus,"" he added.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Read More |  Amidst Manchester United exit talk, Marcus Rashford ready for 'new challenge'

Back in 2018, Ashwin and Finch played together for PBKS. Finch wrote, “One of the all time careers. Congratulations R Ashwin. It was a pleasure to play with and against you. PS: Thanks for not running me out this day!”

Rahul is India’s leading run-scorer of the series, having scored 235 runs from three games at an average of 47 with two half-centuries to show for his efforts. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard On Day 5, India were asked to chase down 275, after which the match was drawn with India at eight for no loss. Gavaskar, who holds the record for being the first batter to score 10,000 Test runs, said that India would not have lost all 10 wickets had they tried to chase down the target. But Gavaskar also said that Australia had the better of India in Brisbane after their dominance in the first innings. Gavaskar also had words of praise for Jasprit Bumrah, who picked up a six-wicket haul in the first innings of the Gabba Test. “No, no, I don’t think India could have been bowled out for the second time in the Test match. Our batting isn’t that pretty, not everybody has been at their best, but we would not have been bowled out in 50 overs. But you have to concede that with 445 runs on the board, Australia had the better of the Test match,” Gavaskar told India Today in an interview. “What I really loved was the resolve shown by your 10th wicket; Jasprit Bumrah is one cricketer that every captain would want in their team, as a bowler, batter, thinker and a complete team man. And he was the one who was guiding Akash Deep as well. The resolve shown by KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja will augur well for the remaining two Tests. Remember, India lost in Adelaide in two and a half days. Had they not done well here, the next Tests would also have been gone,” Gavaskar added. “What I really loved was the resolve shown by your 10th wicket; Jasprit Bumrah is one cricketer that every captain would want in their team, as a bowler, batter, thinker and a complete team man.

Despite being India's best red-ball spinner, non-selection controversies and undervaluation of specialist skills likely influenced his decision.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/r-ashwin-retires-what-pushed-indias-best-red-ball-spinner-to-call-it-quits-2651768-2024-12-18,"Could we say this retirement was expected, or is it a surprise? If I had to choose one word, it's a shocker. It feels like a bolt from the blue, primarily because this decision wasn't made by the selectors regarding Ashwin. As Rohit Sharma noted, and as Ravichandran Ashwin himself mentioned, this was a personal decision. Clearly, it's a choice that has come directly from the off-spinner. When does a player decide they've had enough? It's usually when they feel surplus to requirements, believe they're no longer capable of contributing, or sense that their abilities are waning. But truth be told, at this moment, in a country of 1.4 billion people, Ashwin remains unquestionably the best red-ball spinner -- head and shoulders above the rest. And I'm referring strictly to his current form, not relying on his legacy to argue for an extended tenure. The reality is that even if Ashwin were a youngster competing against the other spinners in the country-some of whom are part of the current squad-he would still stand out as India's best red-ball spinner. So, when someone at the peak of their powers decides to retire, it leaves you stunned. When Roger Federer retired, or when Rafael Nadal announced his plans to step away, it was because they'd reached the end of their respective cycles. They were grappling with physical injuries and knew they couldn't compete at the highest level anymore. But that's not the case with Ashwin right now. Just look at the last Test match he played for India, a week ago in Adelaide. He may not have ended up with many wickets, but we must consider that it was a pink-ball Test, with conditions heavily favouring fast bowlers. Despite that, Ashwin impressed as a spinner. Under these circumstances, if he still decides to retire, there's no word other than ""shock"" to describe it. Now, let’s examine another aspect of this decision that doesn’t quite add up. Ashwin is second on the list of most Test wickets for India, trailing only the great Anil Kumble. How often have we heard of players chasing records? We’ve discussed Virat Kohli’s aspirations to surpass Sachin Tendulkar’s record of 100 centuries. Wasn’t Ashwin similarly chasing the record of being India’s highest Test wicket-taker? After all, Anil Kumble is just 82 wickets ahead of him. With the kind of bowling Ashwin has displayed recently, one could easily imagine him playing another World Test Championship cycle. A couple more years of Test cricket, and it wouldn’t have been far-fetched to see him surpass ""Jumbo.""WHAT LED TO THE SUDDEN RETIREMENT? So, what led to this abrupt retirement? In the absence of an official word from Ashwin himself, we can only speculate. However, the circumstances surrounding his non-selection cannot be ignored. Ashwin has faced significant disappointment in recent years, consistently being left out of the playing XI despite his form. It’s hard to believe this didn’t weigh on his mind when making this decision. What must have hurt the most is the consistency with which various coaches and captains chose to keep him on the bench, particularly in overseas Tests. Perhaps the events in Australia proved to be the proverbial last straw. Ashwin debuted in 2011, but one can’t help but wonder: had he made his debut a decade earlier—when traditional Test cricket placed greater emphasis on primary skills rather than multi-skilled players—he might have played far more Test matches than he ultimately did. In earlier times, the approach was straightforward: white-ball cricket demanded multi-dimensional players, but Test cricket prioritised primary skills. Outstanding batters or bowlers were always picked. Unfortunately, this thinking seems to have shifted within the Indian setup. Take Australia as an example, particularly Nathan Lyon. Both Lyon and Ashwin are off-spinners of similar stature, yet Lyon remains a consistent feature of Australia’s XI regardless of recent results or conditions. The same courtesy has not been extended to Ashwin in India. Over the past decade, India hasn’t always played its best spinner, often opting instead for one who could contribute with the bat. Small factors in recent series, like Jadeja’s runs in Brisbane and Sundar getting picked in Perth ahead of Ashwin, may have further nudged him towards making this final decision. In the end, the best red-ball spinner in the country called time on his career—not because his powers were waning, but while he was still at the top of his game. This loss is one for Indian cricket to bear.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 18, 2024Read More |  Rohit Sharma's emotional farewell message for R Ashwin: You are a true OG
