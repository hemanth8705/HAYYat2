Samson now appears to be in pole position to become India’s T20 opener following the dual retirements of Kohli and Sharma after the T20 World Cup victory earlier this year. His three centuries in four T20Is against Bangladesh and South Africa have firmly signaled his intent to secure that spot. ""Yeah, it has been. I had a decent relationship with Gautam Gambir right from a young age. My first IPL team was KKR. When I was 14, they picked me on their B team. At the age of 17, I made it to the KKR main side and that was when KKR won the Championship under Gautam Gambhir,"" Samson said in an interview with the former South African captain, AB de Villiers on YouTube.  Samson's association with Gambhir extended beyond the IPL. The wicketkeeper-batter recounted how Gambhir's words during their time in the Indian team's dressing room bolstered his confidence. ""When he came to the Indian team, in the dressing room he told me 'Sanju, I know what you have. You have something special. I am going to be back you no matter what'. He told me to walk in, go out there and express myself in every innings. That kind of communication from the coach, that gave me clarity and confidence.  The Kerala-born cricketer also spoke about the pressure of living up to Gambhir's faith, especially after a string of low scores. ""After few games of dismissals, you feel pressure because you have a guy who's backing you and you are not performing. I thought 'common Sanju, you need to show something and repay the faith the coach has in',"" Samson added. Samson's determination eventually paid off, and he has since become a vital player in India's cricketing ecosystem. Reflecting on his journey, he expressed gratitude for the turning points in his career. ""By God's grace, something special has happened. I want to continue scoring runs and win games for my country,"" he concluded.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Explained: What the new India-Pakistan ICC agreement means for world cricket

Ravichandran said he had come to terms with his son's decision but admitted that he wished Ashwin had continued playing for the senior national team. ""What was going on in his mind I don’t know.

However, the veteran off-spinner was dropped for the third Test in Brisbane and Ravindra Jadeja took his spot in the XI.

While the decision worked out well for both countries, here's how it affects the rest of the cricketing world.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/india-vs-pakistan-champions-trophy-nuetral-venues-explained-2652458-2024-12-19,"The International Cricket Council on December 19, Thursday, announced that India and Pakistan will play their matches in ICC tournaments at neutral venues till 2028. The deal was announced by the ICC during the confirmation of hybrid model for Champions Trophy 2025.  ICC announced that India will be playing their matches for the Champions Trophy 2025 on a neutral venue - likely UAE - and in return, Pakistan do not need to travel to India to play any world tournaments till 2028 - including the 2026 men's T20 World Cup.  While the Champions Trophy stand-off after India's refusal to travel across the border ended, the new agreement has given rise to fresh concerns.  The ICC released a statement confirming that ""India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue,"" as reported by India Today last week. This will mean that Pakistan will not travel to India for their matches during the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the T20 World Cup in 2026. The tournament, scheduled to begin on February 19 in Pakistan, faced uncertainty due to India's refusal to travel to the host nation. The ICC reiterated in its statement: ""This will apply to the upcoming ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 (hosted by Pakistan), set to be played in February and March 2025, as well as the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 (hosted by India) and the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 (hosted by India and Sri Lanka)."" The statement also announced that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been awarded the hosting rights for the ICC Women's T20 World Cup in 2028, where neutral venue arrangements will also apply.ICC Statement Key Pointers
Champions Trophy will be played in Pakistan, India matches at neutral venue
The 50-over tournament will be played in February-March in 2025
The hybrid model rule will apply for all ICC tournaments hosted by India and Pakistan in 2024-27 cycle
Pakistan will not travel to India for Women's World Cup in 2025 and T20 World Cup in 2026
Pakistan have been awarded the hosting rights for Women's T20 World Cup in 2028
As India Today reported, no compensation for Pakistan for losing a part of Champions Trophy hosting rights 
The schedule for ICC Champions Trophy will be confirmed soon
What Does This Mean for the Rest? While India and Pakistan play at the comfort of their neutral venues in the ICC tournaments, the major problems will be faced by the rest of the cricketing nations who would have to travel more than usual, if they are pitted against India and Pakistan.  Take the 2023 Asia Cup for example. the Asian Cricket Council tournament was co-hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka as India refused travel to Pakistan for the tournament. India were stationed in Sri Lanka with the other teams forced to travel to and fro between countries - playing in drastically different conditions. For example, Bangladesh started their tournament in Pallekele on Ausgust 31, flew out to Lahore to play Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the travelled back to Sri Lanka to play their final two matches - in a space of two weeks. The fate was more or less same for the other countries depending on how deep they went into the tournament. Former BCB operations chairman had spoken to the media where he had sounded helpless about the issue. ""After playing our first match in Kandy, we have to go to Lahore for the second. There is nothing to do, it was ACC's decision. To make the journey a bit more comfortable, the ACC will provide us with a chartered plane. All the teams who have matches in both countries will get the same,"" Jalal had said during the tournament. ""There is always a little discomfort when you have to travel so much. We all know that you have to go to the airport two hours before a flight and have to carry your luggage too. Then there is the issue of jet lag. The distance between Sri Lanka and Pakistan is very long. We have nothing we can do, everyone will playing like this and we have to be okay with ACC's decision,"" he had further added.   Now the question rises, is that fair for the other boards? Forget Asia Cup - a tournament of only 6 teams, the T20 World Cup 2026 is set to have 20 teams in total, out of which upto 12 different teams might end up playing India and Pakistan, in potentially two different countries.ICC Needs to Do Better India Today reported that all major stakeholder boards in international cricket were consulted when the ICC discussed the possibility of adopting a hybrid model. While the boards may not raise concerns regarding the Champions Trophy 2025, logistical challenges could pose significant issues for teams in larger tournaments in the future. If the hybrid model becomes more prevalent due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, the ICC would do well to establish a long-term solution to these challenges. Engaging with member boards before awarding hosting rights and finalising schedules well in advance could help mitigate potential disruptions, ensuring players, broadcasters, and fans face fewer inconveniences. Broadcasters, who are instrumental in bolstering the financial health of the sport, would also welcome such a proactive approach. It would spare them the uncertainty of waiting until the last minute to confirm venues and schedules. The Champions Trophy, expected to take place between February and March, still does not have official venues. Neither the boards nor the fans know where they will need to travel to watch their favourite cricketers in action. The ICC must recognise that its tournaments are global. For cricket to truly grow as a worldwide sport, these events must prioritise fan experience and seamless organisation. Otherwise, the aspiration of making cricket a genuinely global sport will remain a distant dream. With cricket set to feature in the 2028 Olympics, fostering a better global image for the sport has never been more crucial.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

Donnarumma’s face was bloodied after being struck by his opponent’s cleat in PSG’s 4-2 victory over Monaco on Wednesday. The Italy international was struck by Singo's studs in the 17th minute as the Monaco defender attempted to hurdle over the sliding goalkeeper after his shot was blocked. Instead, Singo's cleats struck Donnarumma, leaving him with multiple cuts and visible trauma below his right eye. Acknowledging the severity of the injury, Singo took to social media to express remorse. ""My gesture was obviously not intentional, but I was able to see afterwards that he had a significant injury to his face,"" he wrote in French and Italian. ""I wish you a good recovery."" Donnarumma required on-field treatment before being replaced by backup goalkeeper Matvey Safonov. PSG later confirmed the 24-year-old suffered ""a facial trauma with multiple wounds"" and would undergo further medical assessments. Photos of Donnarumma's injuries circulated widely, drawing attention to Singo's earlier yellow card. Despite calls for stricter punishment, officials deemed the collision unintentional, allowing Singo to remain in the game. PSG overcame the early loss of their star goalkeeper and a 2-1 deficit in the second half to secure the win. Gonçalo Ramos scored to level the match, and Ousmane Dembélé delivered a brace to ensure victory, extending PSG's unbeaten league run to 16 matches. ""The objective was achieved. It was a difficult match, we weren't up to par at all times, but they knew how to come back and take the lead,"" PSG manager Luis Enrique said post-match. ""I'm happy with the result."" The win gives PSG a commanding 10-point lead atop the Ligue 1 standings as they enter the Christmas break with 40 points. Olympique de Marseille and Monaco, both on 30 points, trail the league leaders, with Marseille holding a game in hand. While the result reinforces PSG's dominance, Donnarumma's condition remains a concern for the club as they prepare for the remainder of the season.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim on Rashford situation: I will handle itTrending Reel

Badrinath said Ashwin's unexpected decision left him shocked, adding that the off-spinner deserved to exit on a high. R Ashwin surprised many by retiring midway through the all-important Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Minutes after India drew the third Test in Brisbane, Ashwin announced his retirement during a press conference alongside captain Rohit Sharma at the Gabba. Rohit revealed that Ashwin had discussed his retirement plans at the start of the Australia tour and that he had convinced the off-spinner to play the second Test in Adelaide. When asked if Ashwin should have continued until the end of the series, Rohit defended the spinner's decision, emphasising that Ashwin had every right to choose when to step away. Also Read: R Ashwin, a student of the game and professor of spin, leaves an unmatched legacy Amid discussions surrounding the timing of Ashwin's retirement, S Badrinath defended the off-spinner, attributing the decision to the treatment he received over the years. ""I am shocked. I think, to be honest, he wasn't treated fairly. Rohit Sharma said he wanted to leave after the Perth Test match. He wanted to leave when Washington Sundar was played ahead of him. That tells you he was not happy,"" Badrinath told Star Sports Tamil. ""Honestly, I am saying something-it's a big thing for a cricketer from Tamil Nadu. There are many reasons for that. Players from a few other states get better chances. Despite all these odds, Ashwin went on to take more than 500 wickets and became a legend. ""Imagine what he must have gone through. I know he has faced quite a few things. On many occasions, efforts were made to sideline him. But every time, he has bounced back like a phoenix bird,"" he added.I FEEL BAD FOR ASHWIN: BADRINATH Badrinath argued that Ashwin deserved a grand farewell and suggested that players from other states might not have faced the same treatment. ""He can quit cricket, but this is not the way he should have gone out. It should have been a glorious exit. He deserved a glorious exit. It's not fair, it's not right. ""He has not been treated properly. I have closely followed his progress. Because he is from Tamil Nadu, he has faced this. If you ask me if it would have happened with a cricketer from any other state, I don't think so. ""I feel bad for Ashwin. This exit should not have been like this,"" Badrinath added. Notably, R Ashwin's father, in a television interview on Thursday, claimed that Ashwin was humiliated, which he suggested could have been one of the reasons for his sudden retirement. Ashwin, however, remained tight-lipped about the timing of his decision, maintaining that he had no regrets about his cricketing career. The off-spinner said he was already looking forward to representing the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL 2025. Ashwin departed Australia and returned to Chennai as early as Thursday. Meanwhile, the rest of the Indian team travelled from Brisbane to Melbourne, where the Boxing Day Test will be played from December 26.

Speculation around Rashford's tenure at Old Trafford has intensified, particularly after the player’s own comments about seeking a “new challenge” added fuel to the fire. The 27-year-old forward, a product of United’s academy since the age of seven, finds himself at a crossroads. His role under Amorim has been a subject of uncertainty, leading to doubts about his long-term stay at the club. During the pre-match press conference ahead of United's Carabao Cup clash against Tottenham Hotspur on December 20, Amorim refrained from providing detailed answers on Rashford’s situation, emphasising his intent to manage it internally. “It’s a hard situation to comment on...""If this was me, probably I would speak with the manager,"" Amorim said. “If I give a lot of importance to it, it will have big headlines in the papers and if I say it’s not a problem, then my standards are getting low. So I will deal with that, I understand that,” he added. Despite Manchester United’s morale-boosting 2-1 victory over rivals Manchester City on Sunday, Rashford’s absence from the squad, alongside teammate Alejandro Garnacho, sparked further questions. Amorim later clarified that the decision stemmed from his commitment to maintaining high standards within the team, but the omission has only heightened rumors of a potential sale. Rashford’s struggles to recapture his electrifying form from the 2022-23 season, where he scored 30 goals across all competitions, have not gone unnoticed. Under Amorim, who took charge last month, the England international has netted just three goals and has failed to make a significant impact. In United’s Europa League win against Viktoria Plzen, Rashford was substituted as early as the 56th minute, a decision that was met with boos from sections of the Old Trafford crowd. The mounting frustration among fans and the lack of clarity over Rashford’s future have contributed to an uneasy atmosphere. However, Amorim’s direct approach to the matter indicates a focus on resolving the situation without unnecessary public scrutiny. As Manchester United prepare for their Carabao Cup clash, the spotlight remains on Rashford’s next move. Whether the forward reignites his United career or embarks on a new chapter, Amorim’s handling of the scenario could prove pivotal in shaping the club’s immediate future.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  PSG's Donnarumma leaves field bloodied after boot to the face tackle vs Monaco

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/wouldnt-have-let-r-ashwin-retire-like-this-he-deserves-respect-kapil-dev-2652324-2024-12-19,"Former India skipper Kapil Dev was not happy that the star off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin retired from international cricket without getting a proper farewell. Earlier on Wednesday, Ashwin appeared alongside India's captain Rohit Sharma at the post-match press conference to make the announcement. Speculation about his retirement had intensified after Ashwin became visibly emotional and was embraced by Virat Kohli. ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar...Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there, I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,"" Kapil Dev said as quoted by ANI. Ashwin finishes his career with 537 wickets in 106 Test matches, placing him seventh on the all-time wicket-takers list, behind Anil Kumble's tally of 619 for India. His strike rate of 50.73 is the highest among the nine bowlers with over 500 wickets, while his bowling average of 24 ranks third. He achieved five or more wickets in a Test innings on 37 occasions, a number bettered only by Muttiah Muralitharan, who achieved it 67 times. Shane Warne also managed this feat on 37 occasions. Ashwin has also claimed ten or more wickets in a Test match eight times, the highest among Indian bowlers, alongside Kumble. Ashwin's remarkable success at home has contributed significantly to India's impressive record in home Tests over the past decade. He has played every home Test since his debut in 2011, spanning 65 matches. Of those 65 home Tests, India won 47; only Sachin Tendulkar has featured in more Test wins (52). Among all players, only Alastair Cook (89) played more home Tests than Ashwin without missing any. Among all-rounders, the previous highest was Tony Greig (31), and among bowlers, it was Dilip Doshi (21). The Tamil Nadu cricketer is the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket and the second-highest for India, trailing only the legendary Anil Kumble. Ashwin's tally of five-wicket hauls is second only to Sri Lankan great Muttiah Muralitharan. Kapil Dev, who led India to its maiden World Cup triumph in 1983, also highlighted the evolution of Indian cricket and the legacy left behind by players like Ashwin. ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead.

Ravichandran added that he had hoped his son would continue playing for the senior national team.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ashwin-retires-father-ravichandran-humilation-shock-decison-2652272-2024-12-19,"R Ashwin's father, Ravichandran, revealed that the off-spinner's retirement decision came as a surprise to many in their family, adding that he wanted his son to continue playing for the senior national team. Ravichandran alleged that his son was being humiliated, which he suggested could have been one of the reasons for Ashwin's sudden retirement from international cricket. While Ravichandran did not elaborate on the specifics of his allegation, it appears he was alluding to the lack of consistent opportunities for Ashwin in overseas Tests. Ashwin reitred from international cricket midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The off-spinner announced his decision, minutes after the third Test between India and Australia ended in Brisbane on Wednesday, December 18. Ashwin reached Chennai as early as Thursday morning.  ""I too came to know (about his retirement) in the last minute, actually,"" Ravichandran told News18.  ""Retiring is his wish and desire, I cannot interfere in that, but the way in which he gave that, there could be many reasons. Only Ashwin knows, maybe humiliation,"" he added.  When asked if the family was emotional when Ashwin dropped the bombshell on Wednesday, Ashwin's father said: ""No doubt about it (emotional moment for the family) because he was on the field for 14-15 years. The sudden change, retirement, gave us really kind of a shock. ""At the same time, we were expecting that also because humiliation was going on. How long he can just tolerate all those things? Probably, he would have decided on his own,"" he added.  Ashwin's father has been a pillar of support in the off-spinner's career. A fast bowler at club-level cricket, Ravichandran encouraged his son to take up the sport. Ashwin's father backed him when the Tamil Nadu cricketer made the switch from a batter to an off-spinner in a bid to break into the state's Ranji Trophy team as a teenager. MIXED EMOTIONS FOR ASHWIN'S FATHER Ravichandran said he had come to terms with his son's decision but admitted that he wished Ashwin had continued playing for the senior national team. ""What was going on in his mind I don’t know. He just announced. I too accepted it with full pleasure. I did not have any feeling at all for that. But the way he gave his retirement, one part I was very happy, another part not happy because he should have continued,"" he said.  Ashwin chose not to stay with the rest f the squad for the last two Tests of the crucial series. Melbourne will host the Boxing Day Test and Sydney will host the New Year's Test. Both the iconic venues offer more assistance to spin than other pitches Down Under.  Notably, legendary Sunil Gavaskar had criticised the timing of Ashwin's retirement and said Washington Sundar's emergence might have influenced the off-spinner's mid-series retirement.  India picked Sundar ahead of R Ashwin for the first Test of the series in Perth. Ashwin returned to play the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. However, the veteran off-spinner was dropped for the third Test in Brisbane and Ravindra Jadeja took his spot in the XI.  Ashwin has been consistently left out of the XI in overseas Tests, especially in England and Australia. Jadeja was preferred as the lone spinner in the XI because of his better ability with the bat.

Maharaj suffered a left abductor strain during the warm-up session ahead of the first ODI on December 17 and was unable to take the field. Subsequent scans confirmed the injury, sidelining him for the second and third ODIs scheduled for December 19 and December 22. Bjorn Fortuin has been named as Maharaj's replacement for the remaining games. This setback comes just a day after Maharaj was included in South Africa's Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against Pakistan. The Test series, starting on December 26 in Centurion, holds significant importance for South Africa as they aim to secure a spot in next year's World Test Championship (WTC) final. The Proteas currently sit atop the WTC standings with a PCT of 63.33 and need one more win to guarantee a top-two finish. Maharaj will now return to Durban for rehabilitation and will be monitored ahead of the Boxing Day Test. His role as the team’s primary specialist spinner is crucial, having recently delivered a match-winning performance against Sri Lanka in Gqeberha, where he took 5 for 76 to clinch victory. The injury adds to South Africa's growing list of unavailable bowlers. Key pacer Anrich Nortje is sidelined with a fractured toe, Gerald Coetzee and Lungi Ngidi are nursing groin and hip injuries, Nandre Burger is out for the summer due to a stress fracture, and all-rounder Wiaan Mulder is recovering from a finger injury sustained against Sri Lanka. In case Maharaj fails to recover in time for the Test series, options such as Dane Piedt, Senuran Muthusamy, Neil Brand, and Shaun von Berg may be considered. Tabraiz Shamsi, who last played first-class cricket in 2021, also presents a potential, though less likely, alternative. South Africa will look to make up for Maharaj's absence in the ODIs as they aim to continue their strong form against Pakistan. The Test series that follows will further test their depth and resilience as they chase a spot in the WTC final.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Not easy for Mohammed Siraj to support world-class Jasprit Bumrah: Brett Lee

Despite their best efforts, Lee believes the gap between Bumrah’s brilliance and the support acts is undeniable. Bumrah has been a standout player in this BGT series, already claiming 21 wickets across three Tests. His devastating spells have left the Australian batting lineup scrambling on Day 5 of the Brisbane Test, proving his mettle as one of the finest fast bowlers in modern cricket. Lee, speaking to Fox Cricket, noted that Bumrah’s consistency and ability to deliver under pressure make him a generational talent. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard “He is world class, Jasprit Bumrah. Unfortunately, they had no Mohammed Shami, but I think the backing of Mohammed Siraj—there has been a bit of conjecture around him—but I think he has bowled really well,"" Lee told Fox Sports. “In my opinion, they have an attack that has some good pace bowlers, but the reason why people say or think he is shouldering the whole load of the attack is that he is so good. He (Bumrah) is miles ahead of any other bowler, and that is no disrespect to the other bowlers going around, but that is how good he is,"" he added. In the second innings of the Brisbane Test, Bumrah etched his name in history by first equalling Kapil Dev's record of 51 wickets, and then taking a couple more to have the most wickets by an Indian bowler in Australia with his 53. His dismissal of Usman Khawaja on Day 5 not only levelled the record but also highlighted his knack for striking at crucial moments.

— BCCI (@BCCI) December 18, 2024 Bumrah's contributions were particularly critical in the first innings of the Gabba Test, where he took a six-wicket haul, almost single-handedly restricting Australia's scoring. While Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep managed to redeem themselves with notable spells in the second innings, it was Bumrah who consistently led the charge. His ability to extract bounce, pace, and movement on Australian tracks has made him a nightmare for opposition batters. The 31-year-old's performances in this series have solidified his reputation as India’s most reliable bowler. With an average below 11 and 20 wickets to his name so far, Bumrah has dominated the bowling charts. With his remarkable achievements, Bumrah continues to carry India’s pace attack, setting an unparalleled standard and proving why he remains an invaluable asset to Indian cricket.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  Watch: Emotional father kisses R Ashwin during hero's welcome at Chennai residence

The 33-year-old's injury woes continued as scans confirmed a right calf strain sustained during the warm-up on the morning of Day 2 of the Brisbane Test. While medical reports suggested the injury was a minor strain, it was enough to sideline Hazlewood for the remainder of the series. Speaking to 7NEWS, Hazlewood expressed his disappointment, saying, ""Just frustrating really. Ticked every box heading into the Test, I could understand if it was my side again, but it was just a random calf strain. Obviously, do a deep dive into it and see what we can come up with ... feels pretty random."" This setback adds to Hazlewood's recent history of injuries, which have seen him miss parts of four of the last six Australian home summers. Notably, the 2020/21 and 2023/24 seasons were the only exceptions where he managed to stay fit throughout. Reflecting on his injury record, Hazlewood said, ""I've had a history of sides and calves, they're probably the two things that have kept me out for the majority over the last four years. But yeah, I sort of just keep adding another layer to the defence, hopefully. Get back into the gym; I've ticked a lot of boxes over the last 12 months."" The fast bowler's primary frustration stems from the timing of his injuries. ""It's just the timing again. They are only little 2-3 week injuries, but missing big games is the frustrating thing,"" he lamented. Despite the disappointment, Hazlewood remains optimistic about returning to full fitness for Australia's two-Test tour of Sri Lanka, scheduled for late January and February. ""That's probably the goal, just take it as it comes over the next few weeks,"" he said. ""No rush to get anything in a hurry, it's just getting everything right. Probably take a few extra days here and there, ticking things off and getting everything right."" Hazlewood's absence adds to Australia's challenges in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a series already marked by intense competition and high stakes.

The former captain accompanied his family during the trip ahead of the fourth Test, starting December 26 in Melbourne.  Notably, Kohli and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah have been travelling separately with their families between cities in Australia. Kohli and Bumrah shared a chartered plane from Adelaide to Brisbane ahead of the third Test, which ended on Wednesday.  Virat Kohli has not been in the best of forms with the bat in the much-talked-about Test series. Kohli hit a hundred in the second innings of the series opener in Perth, but he hasn't lived up to the hype in the first three Tests. Kohli has managed just 126 runs in six innings at an average of 30. Barring the hundred, Kohli has scored 26 runs across five innings.  Kohli has been struggling to control his urge to poke at deliveries bowled wide outside the off-stump --  a plan that Australia have executed well to trouble the Indian batting star.  Kohli will look to return to his best in Melbourne. Team India need their star batter to step up and deliver in the evenly-contest Test series.  India managed to deny Australia a win at the Gabba in the third Test. Despite conceding a 185-run first innings lead, India avoided a defeat, thanks to the wet weather in Brisbane.

— Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) December 19, 2024 It is a little known fact that Zakir Hussain loved cricket as a young kid and wanted to follow the passion of many Indians. Like many young boys, Zakir's early years were not solely dedicated to music. Growing up, he shared a love for cricket, often skipping his tabla practice to play ""gully cricket"" with his friends. But his father, the legendary Ustad Alla Rakha, recognised his son's potential and pushed him to hone his craft, even if it meant making difficult decisions. Zakir recalls a pivotal moment when his father, concerned that his son's budding cricket career might harm his ability to play the tabla, gave him an ultimatum. ""My father once got angry because I broke a finger while playing cricket. I was a keeper. He was so upset because he was worried if I would be able to play the tabla again or not,"" he said. This moment of concern from Ustad Alla Rakha marked a turning point in Zakir's life, steering him fully toward the tabla. Despite his early love for cricket, Zakir went on to make his mark as one of the greatest tabla players in history. Yet, he never strayed far from the world of cricket. Over the years, he formed a close bond with cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar, who became a dear friend. The two shared a unique connection, bonding over their mutual respect and admiration for each other's craft.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/who-is-liam-lawson-f1-driver-who-joins-max-verstappen-at-red-bull-2652561-2024-12-19,"New Zealand driver Liam Lawson will replace Sergio Perez as Max Verstappen's teammate at Red Bull Racing for the 2025 Formula 1 season, the team announced on Thursday. Perez's departure was confirmed the day before, and Lawson’s promotion from Red Bull's sister team, AlphaTauri, had long been anticipated. At just 22 years old, Lawson made his F1 debut in 2023, stepping in for the injured Daniel Ricciardo at the Dutch Grand Prix. He later returned for the final six races of the season after Ricciardo was dropped. Lawson expressed his excitement at the opportunity in a team statement:  ""To be announced as an Oracle Red Bull Racing driver is a lifelong dream for me. This is something I’ve wanted and worked towards since I was eight years old,"" Lawson said. ""It’s been an incredible journey so far. A huge thank you to everyone at VCARB (AlphaTauri) for their support. The last six races have been key in preparing me for this next step. I’m super excited to work alongside Max and learn from a world champion. I have no doubt I’ll gain a lot from his expertise, and I can’t wait to get started."" Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner praised Lawson’s abilities, describing him as ""a real racer, not afraid to mix it with the best and come out on top."" He also highlighted the team's history of promoting talent from within its junior program, mentioning how Lawson follows in the footsteps of champions like Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen himself.  ""Him racing alongside Max—a four-time champion and one of the greatest drivers F1 has ever seen—is certainly a daunting challenge,"" Horner added. ""But I’m confident Liam can rise to the occasion and deliver impressive results for us next year."" Red Bull has seen a series of teammates struggle to match Verstappen's pace since he joined the team in 2016. Perez, who joined in 2021, had a solid 2023 season, finishing second in the championship, though he was a distant 290 points behind Verstappen, who won a record 19 out of 22 races. This year, Perez's form has dramatically declined, finishing only eighth in the standings, while Verstappen claimed his fourth consecutive title. Before Perez, drivers like Alex Albon (now at Williams) and Pierre Gasly (now at Alpine) failed to match Verstappen’s performance, and Daniel Ricciardo, who partnered Verstappen from 2016 to 2018, ultimately left Red Bull for Renault after falling behind his teammate. With Lawson’s promotion, Red Bull will have an open seat at its sister team, AlphaTauri, which will be renamed Racing Bulls next season. French-Algerian driver Isack Hadjar, who finished as the runner-up in Formula 2 this season, is expected to fill the vacancy.WHO IS LIAM LAWSON? Liam Lawson is a promising New Zealand racing driver who has rapidly ascended through the ranks of motorsport to compete at the highest level in Formula 1. Born on February 11, 2002, in Hastings, New Zealand, and raised in Pukekohe, Lawson began his competitive racing career at the age of seven with karting. He was mentored by three-time New Zealand Grand Prix winner Ken Smith, which played a significant role in his early development. Lawson quickly made a name for himself in junior formulae, winning his first title in the NZ F1600 Championship in 2015 as a privateer. He continued to excel, finishing as the runner-up in the 2017 Australian F4, 2018 ADAC F4, and 2019 Euroformula Open championships. Lawson's breakthrough year was 2019, where he won the Toyota Racing Series in New Zealand with M2 Competition, securing the championship title just a day before his 17th birthday. He also made his debut in the FIA Formula 3 Championship with MP Motorsport and participated in the Euroformula Open with Motopark, where he finished second in the standings. In 2020, Lawson returned to the Toyota Racing Series, finishing second, and continued in FIA Formula 3 with Hitech Grand Prix, where he won three races and finished fifth in the standings. His progression to Formula 2 in 2021 saw him secure his maiden victory and two additional podiums, concluding the season in ninth place. He also debuted in the DTM with AF Corse, driving a Ferrari 488 GT3 Evo 2020, and narrowly missed the championship title by three points. Lawson's performance in Formula 2 improved significantly in 2022, driving for Carlin and finishing third in the standings with four wins and six other podium finishes. This success led to his Formula 1 debut during the first free practice sessions for the Belgian, Mexican, and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix, driving for AlphaTauri and Red Bull. In 2023, Lawson competed in the Super Formula Championship with Team Mugen, supported by Red Bull, and served as a test and reserve driver for both AlphaTauri and Red Bull Racing. He made his first F1 race appearances as a temporary replacement for Daniel Ricciardo at AlphaTauri, outperforming his teammate Yuki Tsunoda in several races and earning valuable points for the team. For the 2024 season, Lawson was announced as a permanent F1 driver for Visa Cash App RB following the Singapore Grand Prix, replacing Ricciardo. Despite his promising start, he has faced criticism from teammate Sergio Pérez regarding his aggressive driving style and attitude on and off the track. Pérez has suggested that Lawson needs to adopt a more humble and respectful approach to succeed in Formula 1. Lawson's career is marked by his ability to win on debut in various categories and his quick adaptation to new series. However, as he navigates the highly competitive world of Formula 1, he will need to balance his aggressive driving with the strategic and respectful approach that the sport demands.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  Formula 1: Sergio Perez and Red Bull part ways months after contract extensionTrending Reel

After the drawn third Test in Brisbane, Rohit Sharma sounded miffed after being persistently asked for an update on Shami’s availability. Sharma put the onus on NCA and said that the body should update the Indian team on Shami's condition. “I think it’s high time somebody from NCA talks about him, where he is rehabbing... Those guys are the ones who need to come up and give us some kind of update. I understand he’s playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well. We won’t take any risks unless we are 200% sure about his fitness,"" Rohit had said. Shami’s participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy is seen as a key step towards determining his availability for the upcoming international assignments, including the Champions Trophy.

On Thursday, India beat the West Indies in the deciding game to claim the series 2-1. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-india-vs-west-indies-womens-t20i-series-smriti-mandhana-drought-2652634-2024-12-19,"Smriti Mandhana opened up on how she motivated Team India to end their five-year-long wait to win a Women’s T20I series on home soil. Since September 2019, India could not secure a series win at home in five series on the trot. But on Thursday, December 19, the Women in Blue defeated Hayley Matthews’ West Indies by 60 runs to win the series 2-1. India Women vs West Indies Women, 3rd T20I Updates India started the series with a thumping 49-run win, but slumped to a nine-wicket defeat in the second game on Tuesday. In the decider, India recorded their highest team total of 217 for four after which they restricted the visitors to 157 for nine. “After the last match, I told the girls it has been five years that we have not won a T20I series. That does not reflect the team we are. I told them that today, we have an opportunity to do that and we just want to keep doing the right things,” Mandhana said in the post-match presentation ceremony.‘Raghvi was impressive’ Mandhana also had high praise for youngster Raghvi Bist, who scored an unbeaten 31 off 22 balls with two fours and a six. Mandhana, who made 77 runs and took down a number of T20I records, said that she was awestruck with Raghvi’s strokeplay. “The way Raghvi batted was impressive. She came in with lots of intent and hitting her fourth or fifth ball for six, I would not have been able to do that in my second match,” Mandhana said. Richa Ghosh was also at her very best after she smashed the joint-fastest fifty in Women’s T20Is off 18 balls, equalling Sophie Devine and Phoebe Litchfield’s record. “Richa's innings was also amazing, as it was the other day, but could not appreciate that unfortunately because of the result,” Mandhana added. After the T20Is, India are now set to face the West Indies in a three-match ODI series from December 22 onwards.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  India Women thrash West Indies in decider to win first home T20I series in five yearsTrending Reel

India won the decider courtesy of some sensational batting from the Indian unit. In the post match presentation, Ghosh credited stand-in captain Smriti Mandhana setting the stage for the Indian batters to fire. On Thursday, December 19, playing at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, Richa Ghosh hit the joint-fastest fifty in the women's T20Is. Richa went berserk against the Windies side and hit 3 fours and 5 sixes. Richa broke Smriti Mandhana's record to become the fastest half-centurion in WT20I by an Indian. Mandhana had held the record for nearly 5 years now. She had slammed her half-century in 24 balls against New Zealand in February 2019. India Women vs West Indies Women: 3rd T20I Highlights Richa's sensational innings combined with Mandhana's fireworks at the top meant that India registered the biggest total in the WT20Is. The Indian team scored 217 runs from their 20 overs, after losing 4 wickets. Smriti Mandhana started the assault at the top, with 77 off just 47 balls. After Mandhana got out, Jemimah Rodrigues (39 off 28), Raghvi Bist (31* off 22) and Richa Ghosh (54* off 21 balls) stole the show. India hit a total of 7 sixes, 5 of which came off Richa's bat. The explosive wicketkeeper-batter got out in the penultimate ball of the final over, trying to hit a six against Aaliyah Alleyne. After the match, Richa credited Mandhana for setting the stage for the rest of the Indian batters. ""We got a good start today. The way Mandhana played, I just continued to do that. I play in the same way in the nets. I like to hit the ball when it is in the slot. Feels good as all of us contributed to the team's victory. Happy with my contribution too,"" Richa said. IND W vs WI W: 3rd T20I Match Report Mandhana on the other hand hailed India's maiden T20I series victory at home in 5 years. She said that the team was aware of the record and want to push themselves to win the bilateral series. ""It's been five years we haven't won a T20I series in India. That was the chat earlier in the day. We had the chance to do it after 5 years. Need to keep doing the right things now. With the kind of batting line-up, we have some new youngsters. So need to take responsibility. More than timing the ball, I try to put my head into playing according to the situation. Liked the way Richa Ghosh batted. Girls stepped up today, they played with a lot of intent.

Speaking ahead of the Boxing Day Test match, Langer showered praise on Bumrah and said that the India seamer must be a nightmare to face for the batters. Bumrah has been in sensational touch in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy so far. The leader of the India pace attack has 21 wickets after 3 Test matches, 7 more than the next best Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. Bumrah's ability to seam and swing the new ball has come in handy for the Indians as they have gotten wickets on demand from the pacer. “I would hate to face him. He is like Wasim Akram. For me, he is a right-hand version of Wasim Akram, and every time I am asked the question ‘Who is the best bowler you have ever faced’, I say, Wasim Akram,"" Justin Langer told The Nightly on Thursday, December 19. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “They have got good pace and the great bowlers just hit the same spot every time, and they have got a good bouncer, so it makes them a bloody nightmare. He has got the ability to swing the ball both ways, his seam is literally picture perfect."" “If you present a perfect seam and it comes perfectly out of the fingers as it does with him, you get the double whammy, swing in the right conditions and if it hits the rope it can go either way. That’s what Akram used to do and was a nightmare to face,"" he added. “I would hate to face Bumrah. He’s a great competitor, he bowls good pace and he’s just awesome. I said at the start of the series, if Bumrah stays fit, it is going to be a really tough summer for the Australian batters, if he doesn’t, then I think Australia will win the series easily, and I still maintain that,"" Langer concluded.

A stellar batting display, led by the likes of Babar Azam, captain Mohammad Rizwan, and Kamran Ghulam, coupled with a sensational bowling spell by Shaheen Afridi, sealed Pakistan’s third consecutive ODI series win. Finding form after a long slump, Babar Azam got running alongside Mohammad Rizwan who anchored the innings with a 115-run partnership, showcasing some crucial grit in their approach. Followed by Kamran Ghulam’s explosive knock of 63 off just 32 balls provided the late surge, propelling Pakistan to a formidable total of 330 runs. The batting trio’s efforts left South Africa with a daunting chase, compounded by Afridi’s fiery 4/47 spell that dismantled the Proteas’ batting lineup. SA vs PAK, 2nd ODI: Highlights South Africa’s chase began with promise, reminiscent of their approach in Paarl, but faltered under pressure. The hosts struggled to build partnerships, relying heavily on skipper Heinrich Klaasen, who played a heroic knock of 97 off 74 balls. Klaasen’s innings stood out as the only consistent effort in an otherwise lacklustre batting display by the Proteas, who were bowled out for just 248. Afridi’s lethal pace and reverse swing proved decisive, as he claimed crucial wickets both at the top and during the death overs. His return to form bolstered Pakistan’s all-round performance, which has been their most complete display in ODIs over the past six weeks. The series victory provides Pakistan a significant morale boost ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, set to be held at their home. For the Proteas, the loss highlighted the need to address inconsistencies in their batting and rethink their aggressive approach. Rizwan-led Pakistan, rejuvenated after their T20I series loss to South Africa, now shift their focus to the final ODI in Sandton on December 22, aiming for a series whitewash. A clean sweep against a competitive side like South Africa would further solidify Pakistan’s growing momentum in international cricket.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Leave my dad alone: Ashwin reacts to father's controversial retirement statement

Known for his cricketing intellect and tactical acumen, Ashwin was a master in home conditions, orchestrating numerous match-winning performances. His remarkable form in 2016 saw him claim both the ICC Cricketer of the Year and ICC Test Cricketer of the Year awards, becoming only the third Indian to receive the prestigious Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy. Ashwin was more than just a bowler; his contributions with the bat added significant value. A reliable lower-order batter, he amassed 3503 Test runs, including five centuries. While Ashwin has bid farewell to international cricket, he remains committed to playing club cricket and the IPL. In the IPL 2025 mega auction, he was re-signed by Chennai Super Kings for Rs 9.25 crore, marking a homecoming to the franchise where he initially rose to prominence.

 The defining moment came when Kohli struck two stunning sixes off Haris Rauf's last two deliveries, reigniting India’s hopes. The equation boiled down to 16 off the final over, bowled by Mohammad Nawaz. Kohli continued his brilliance, running hard between the wickets and launching a six despite Pandya’s dismissal on the first ball. Drama peaked when a no-ball and subsequent free-hit brought India within two runs of victory with two balls to spare. It was Ashwin who showcased nerves of steel, calmly lifting the final delivery over the infield to seal a famous win, with Kohli unbeaten on 82 in what many called one of his greatest innings.The Emotional Connection Before Ashwin’s official announcement, an emotional embrace between Kohli and Ashwin in the Brisbane dugout had sparked speculation about the spinner’s retirement.

The abruptness of his decision has left fans and experts alike grappling with the void his departure creates. For a player of his stature, the goodbye felt all too quiet, almost unworthy of a cricketer who has done so much for Indian cricket. India’s most successful off-spinner deserved a grand farewell. He merited the roar of a packed stadium, a guard of honour, and the chance to weave his magic one last time on the field. Instead, his announcement came in a room full of reporters at the end of the third Test in Brisbane. There were no rousing tributes or emotional speeches to a stadium filled with adoring fans. Ashwin’s final words as an Indian cricketer were shared in the dressing room, amidst scattered teammates, a low-key farewell to a high-impact career. Also read: R Ashwin was not treated fairly, his sudden retirement a shock: Ex-CSK teammate The only solace is that Ashwin walked away on his terms. As skipper Rohit Sharma observed, the off-spinner saw the writing on the wall and decided there was no point in continuing if his services were no longer required. Still, one cannot help but wonder if the lack of a regular spot in the playing XI, despite his extraordinary record, weighed heavily on his decision.ASHWIN DESERVED A BETTER FAREWELL Ashwin’s father, Ravichandran, alleged that his son faced humiliation, which may have influenced his decision to retire during India’s ongoing tour of Australia. While he could not pinpoint a specific incident, it appears he was pointing fingers at how his son was repeatedly overlooked in overseas tours. World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev lamented the unceremonious nature of Ashwin’s departure, stressing the importance of a respectful send-off for such a legendary all-rounder. “The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar... Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there; I wouldn’t have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,” Kapil Dev said. Former chief selector MSK Prasad echoed similar sentiments, remarking, “While retirement decisions are personal, a legendary farewell would certainly have been a fitting tribute to his illustrious career. It would not only celebrate his achievements but also allow fans, teammates, and the cricketing fraternity to express their gratitude for his immense contributions. Regardless of when or how he chooses to step away, his legacy as one of India’s greatest cricketers is forever etched in history.” Ashwin’s retirement marks not just the end of a glittering career but also the conclusion of an intellectual journey that redefined the art of spin bowling. From his debut in 2011, Ashwin has constantly evolved. His off-breaks expanded into an arsenal of carrom balls, arm balls, and deceptive top-spinners. His genius lay in being both a bowler of the past and a visionary for the future. With 537 Test wickets—second only to Anil Kumble among Indians—his numbers speak for themselves, though his legacy extends far beyond statistics. While legends like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli are often hailed as India’s greatest match-winners in cricket history, Ravichandran Ashwin has quietly claimed a unique distinction—being the backbone of India’s dominance in home Tests. With a career spanning 15 years, Ashwin’s contributions to India’s Test victories, particularly in home conditions, are unparalleled. Of the 106 Tests he has played, India emerged victorious in 61—a feat surpassed only by Tendulkar (72) and Kohli (62) in terms of Test wins. Ashwin’s win percentage of 57.55% ranks as the sixth-highest among players who have participated in over 100 Tests, a remarkable accomplishment considering the stiff competition from icons like Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath, and Shane Warne, who thrived during Australia’s dominant era of the 1990s and early 2000s.CONSTANT NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF Despite his brilliance, Ashwin’s career was not without its challenges. He faced criticism for overanalysing situations and was often sidelined in overseas Tests. Ever since Ravindra Jadeja surpassed him as a Test batter, and conditions in England, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia favoured a fourth fast bowler over a spinner in the No.8 spot, Ashwin frequently found himself benched. Out of the 50 Tests India played in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) during his career, Ashwin featured in only 26. Even so, Ashwin persevered, proving time and again that he belonged amongst cricket’s elite. His partnership with Ravindra Jadeja became legendary, their combined efforts dismantling opposition teams on Indian pitches. Ashwin’s cerebral edge often made the decisive difference, though his artistry was sometimes overshadowed by the dominance of batting stars like Kohli, Sharma, and Pant. Ashwin’s retirement serves as a poignant reminder of how cricket often undervalues its thinkers. Even former India cricketer and women’s team coach WV Raman remarked, “If I am ever convinced about something, it is that intelligence is not always an advantage.” In a sport that glorifies instinct and aggression, deep thinkers like Ashwin are frequently underappreciated. Throughout his career, Ashwin battled not just challenging conditions and gritty batters but also the struggle to be taken seriously. Despite over 500 Test wickets, critics hesitated to place him amongst the game’s greatest. Perhaps, in time, as India searches for someone of his calibre, his contributions will be fully recognised. Every time, he went overseas, he needed to prove himself all over again. His numbers in Australia and England drastically improved after the 2014 tour Down Under. Yet, he was benched for the majority of overseas tours, even in his prime, as India picked Ravindra Jadeja as the lone spinner.  It is a cruel irony that the career of India’s greatest match-winner ends with four consecutive Test losses—three against New Zealand at home and the Adelaide Test in Australia. For someone as emotional as Ashwin, the timing of his retirement is intriguing. One might have expected him to play a farewell Test, savour the moment, and perhaps have his family present—though they were absent at the Gabba. However, Ashwin is not someone who would complain that he retired without a proper farewell. Perhaps, the spin maestro will celebrate that he played over 100 Tests for India, shedding tears of joy rather than sorrow. If his career didn’t have a perfect ending, it simply wasn’t meant to be.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Jasprit Bumrah is the right-handed Wasim Akram: Justin LangerMust Watch

Rishad Hossain was the standout performer with 3/20, executing a sharp run-out of Johnson Charles and dismissing Rovman Powell, Gudakesh Motie, and Alzarri Joseph. The hosts struggled to build partnerships, with Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran offering the only resistance. This sweep marked a significant turnaround for Bangladesh, coming after a 3-0 loss in the ODI series. The emphatic performances from Jaker Ali and Rishad Hossain signal promising prospects for the team as they build momentum for future challenges.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  R Ashwin responds to Virat Kohli's tribute, reveals poignant MCG message

28674c32-55d9-4384-9b56-28f9b97df423,"Australia drop Nathan McSweeney for Boxing Day Test, add teenage opener to squadBorder-Gavaskar Trophy: Australia named a 15-man squad for the last two tests against India on Friday. In a bold call, the Australian selectors dropped Nathan McSweeney and roped in 19-year-old Sam Konstas. Pacers Jhye Richardson and Sean Abbott also returned to the squad. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-squad-nathan-mcsweeney-dropped-sam-konstas-jhye-richardson-2652715-2024-12-20,"Australia dropped their latest Test debutant, Nathan McSweeney, after just the first three matches in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Australia announced a 15-member squad for the last two Tests of the series. The fourth Test, a Boxing Day blockbuster, starts December 26 in Melbourne. Teenager Sam Konstas has been added to the squad and he is likely to open the batting with Usman Khawaja at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  While the decision to drop 25-year-old Nathan McSweeney after just three Tests has divided opinions, Australia have added the attacking Sam Konstas in a bid to inject some firepower at the top of the order. McSweeney, who made his debut in Perth, had a tough time dealing with Jasprit Bumrah in the first three games.  Meanwhile, Australia have also recalled express pacer Jhye Richardson to the squad for the first time in three years. Along with him, pacer Sean Abbott and Tasmania all-rounder Beau Webster have been added to the squad, which is 15 members in size.  AUSTRALIA SQUAD FOR LAST 2 TESTS OF BGT 2024-25 Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.WHY WAS MCSWEENEY DROPPED?  25-year-old McSweeney was slotted into the opening spot in Perth despite him being a middle-order batter in domestic cricket. McSweeney struggled to get going and keep the scoreboard moving in the first three Tests of the series.  While Usman Khawaja, the senior opener, has also struggled, scoring with an average of just 12 and a top score of 21 so far in the series.  However, Australia have backed their senior opener and dropped the youngster, who is just three Test matches old. McSweeney has managed 72 runs in his first six innings, the lowest by an Australian opener in 50 years in the first six of their career in the longest format of the game.  Chief selector George Bailey explained the decision, backing McSweeney's ability to find success at the highest level, adding Sam Konstas' ability to score at a good pace worked in his favour.  ""We remain confident Nathan has the ability and temperament to succeed at Test level in the future,"" Bailey said. ""It was a difficult decision to leave him out,"" he added. BIG BACKING FOR SAM KONSTAS  Australia have rewarded 19-year-old Sam Konstas for some exciting performances in the ongoing season. Known for his aggressive approach, Konstas is expected to fill the void that David Warner left in the Australian Test team.  Konstas has been making significant waves in the 2024-25 cricket season with his impressive performances across formats.  The 19-year-0ld smashed 56 off just 37 balls for Sydney Thunder in their Big Bash League match on December 17 in Canberra against the Adelaide Strikers.  In the Sheffield Shield, playing for New South Wales, Konstas has scored two centuries and accumulated 369 runs across six innings, highlighting his form in first-class cricket. One of his most standout performances came in the practice match for the Prime Minister's XI against India, where he scored a blistering century. In this pink-ball match at Manuka Oval in Canberra, Konstas hit 107 runs off just 97 balls, including 14 fours and one six, showcasing his exceptional stroke play and ability to handle challenging conditions. Against India A, Konstas made a notable impact, scoring 92 runs in four innings, including a solid 73 off 128 balls in the second unofficial Test in October-November.  Meanwhile, the injury to Josh Hazlewood has forced Australia to bring back Sean Abbott and hand a recall to Jhye Richardson. Australia are looking to provide enough cover for their fast bowlers as the turnaround time between the fourth and the fifth Tests is just three days.  With injury concerns surrounding Mitchell Marsh, Australia also recalled exciting all-rounder Beau Webster. Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Trending Reel

In the auction that took place in Bengaluru, MI picked Maheshwari for Rs 20 lakhs. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-exclusive-interview-akshita-maheshwari-mumbai-indians-wpl-2025-deal-2652644-2024-12-20,"Khelo, kya fark padta hain kaun kya bol raha hain In India, where a layman is still getting accustomed to the concept of women’s cricket, playing the sport for a female athlete comes with its fair share of challenges. For Akshita Maheshwari, Mumbai Indians’ new recruit in the Women’s Premier League, it wasn’t any different. In Jaipur, the youngster was in a circle where cricket is still considered a male-dominated sport, but what was different was her family’s support. When she was in her teens, Akshita had to face rejections from academies that did not promote the women’s game, but they did not stop her from pursuing her dreams passionately. Once she found her way, she kept taking mini strides, rising through age group cricket and, in 2024, landed her maiden WPL deal with the 2023 champions. “I always used to play with my brothers in the terrace, but not that intensely as there were not many girls where my father bought a new house. I never liked staying at home, and preferred going out and playing. My father had to face questions in our colony about me playing with boys every time,” Akshita said in an exclusive interview with India Today.   Also Read: WPL 2025 Auction: Dottin, Simran, Kamalini earn big paycheques, Sneh Rana unsold “But he, my mother and brother supported me; they said, ‘khelo, kya fark padta hain kaun kya bol raha hain, aapko jo accha lagta hain wo karo (play, it doesn’t matter what people are saying, do what your heart says). Then I got to know that there are academies and I looked out for Neerja Modi Academy. “But they said that they don’t teach girls. It was five to six years ago. I went to the KL Saini Cricket Academy for running and I saw another girl training. I immediately called my father, after which I registered there, and it started from there,” Akshita said.The surreal moment With only 19 slots to be filled in the mini-auction, Akshita had to fight with 122 players who threw their hat in the ring. In the opening round and first accelerated round, her name did not pop up. But in the second accelerated round, the franchises shortlisted her, and it was MI, who roped her in at a base price of Rs 20 lakhs. Akshita was plying her trade with Rajasthan in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy when MI picked her.

— Mumbai Indians (@mipaltan) December 17, 2024 “I was in Haryana with my teammates, but wasn’t watching the auction as expectations can get the better of you. But I started watching and knew that my name was there. Then I heard Reema Malhotra di chanting my name ‘Akshita, Akshita’ and I was happy that they are aware of our performance and are tracking us. That increases your hope and expectations. I told my roommate that if my name comes up in the second round of the accelerated auction, well and good, if not, then I will try next year,” Akshita recalled. “Then I got to know that out of the list of 17 players, my name was there. When I was picked by MI, I was happy, but I found it hard to believe in the beginning. Once it happened, my family was very happy, and I started getting calls; it was surreal.”Unexpected things, big goals Interestingly, the WPL deal with MI wasn’t the beginning of Akshita’s association with Mumbai. The Women’s Under-23 One-Day Trophy earlier this year turned her career around. She finished as the second-highest wicket-taker with 23 wickets from eight games at an economy rate of 2.66. The 24-year-old took two hat-tricks and both of them came at venues in Mumbai. Akshita took a hat-trick against Mizoram at the Sachin Tendulkar Gymkhana in Kandivili, where she finished with stupendous figures of 6-4-6-4. Then, at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy at BKC, she took her second hat-trick when she demolished Odisha with figures of 10-1-36-3. On the back of her performance, Rajasthan went through to the quarters where they lost to Haryana by 15 runs. After bagging the WPL deal, Akshita raised her game and helped Rajasthan beat Meghalaya by five wickets in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy match with figures of 10-3-23-4.

 “They say Mumbai sapno ka sheher hain (city of dreams) and it was for me as we had matches at BKC and other venues. Sometimes, unexpected things help you achieve your goals. It was my last year in the U23 tournament and it gave me so much that I entered the WPL. And even more surprisingly, it was Mumbai who picked me and so, I have developed a strong connection with the city,” Akshita said. After honing her skills at the KL Saini Academy, Akshita moved to the GR Cricket Ground in Jaipur and trained under Ashwani Kherwa and Jagaimran Singh. The all-rounder said that it was the words of wisdom from her coaches that helped her move forward. “The spells were very important for me as, two years ago, I wasn’t able to break into the Rajasthan team. But then I got a chance and my coach, Ashwani (Kherwa) Sir, also supported me and gave me belief that I could do it.The learning and idols

 Even as Akshita is known for her fiery fast bowling, she is also someone who can play the big shots lower down the order. MI are known for going for quality all-rounders, including Nat Sciver-Brunt, Amelia Kerr and Hayley Matthews, with South Africa’s Nadine de Klerk being the newest addition to the team. Akshita is eager to rub shoulders with the world’s very best. “Basics are very important. The stronger our basics, the better we will get. I was a part of the Senior Women’s Challenger Trophy, and although I did not play, I got the confidence and learning. I carried that confidence into the One-Day Trophy, which showed in my bowling, batting and fielding. If I play alongside them, my cricket is bound to improve. I want to work on myself and learn as much as possible,” Akshita said. For Akshita, the Indian pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar are her idols. Bumrah is currently on the tour of Australia where he has shouldered the Indian bowling attack with wickets at regular intervals. Bumrah also won the Player of the Match award in the Perth Test. Similar to Bumrah, Akshita talked about building a reputation as someone reliable in the bowling department. “I didn’t watch a lot of cricket earlier. My father was fond of cricket, and so we watched men’s cricket on TV and not women’s cricket. I am a big fan of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah, they are my idols. They are of very high quality. I want to become like them that whenever my team needs a breakthrough, the captain will look up to Akshita to do that. This is how I want to build myself,” she said.Harmanpreet fandom and fastest Shabnim

 Harmanpreet Kaur has played several match-winning knocks for India across all three formats. Akshita sounded excited at the prospect of picking her brains and sharing the same change-room. “I have butterflies in my stomach. She is the captain of the Indian team and sharing the dressing room with an experienced player like her, attending team meetings, net sessions and bowling to her will help me a lot,” Akshita said. Akshita also wants to learn the tricks of the trade from former South African speedster Shabnim Ismail. Earlier this year, Shabnim recorded the fastest ball in women’s cricket when she clocked 132.1 kmph (82.08 miles per hour during the WPL match between MI and Delhi Capitals. “She has bowled the fastest delivery and I just want to see her. Once I see her, talk to her and take her experience, I will be able to apply them in my game. It’s not possible to learn everything overnight, it will take time. But the experience is going to help me get better,” Akshita signed off. In the inaugural edition, it was left-arm Saika Ishaque, who broke into the Indian team after her impressive performances for MI. Hence, there’s every chance for Akshita to make a mark in the upcoming WPL and give herself a chance to break into the Indian team. With the likes of Tejal Hasabnis, Saima Thakor, Priya Mishra and Raghvi Bist donning the national colours in the last two months, Akshita would know that a few decent performances for MI could just be the tonic her career needs for now.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  IND-W vs WI-W: How Smriti Mandhana inspired India to end 5-year drought at homeMust Watch

Tottenham took control early in the game, with Dominic Solanke netting twice and Dejan Kulusevski adding a third to put the hosts ahead 3-0 by the 54th minute. However, two critical mistakes by Spurs’ 36-year-old goalkeeper Fraser Forster dramatically shifted the momentum.

But moments later, under pressure from Zirkzee, he attempted a poor pass intercepted by Bruno Fernandes. Fernandes set up Zirkzee for a simple finish, making it 3-1. The drama heightened seven minutes later when Forster mishandled another backpass, allowing Amad Diallo to slide in and deflect his clearance into the net for 3-2. Diallo, who recently scored a decisive goal against Manchester City, came close to an equaliser with a long-range effort that rattled Forster further.

Australia recently announced their 15-member team for the final two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with Konstas coming in for Mcsweeny, who had only made his Test debut in this BGT series opener in Perth. McSweeney, who debuted in the ongoing series, was dropped after just three matches, a move that sparked mixed reactions amongst fans and former cricketers alike. However, Bailey emphasised that the decision was made to strengthen Australia’s top-order batting, which has struggled against India’s formidable pace attack, particularly Jasprit Bumrah, who has been in some record-breaking form down under. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""We remain confident Nathan has the ability and temperament to succeed at Test level in the future...It was a difficult decision to leave him out,"" Bailey told cricket.com.au on Mcsweeny. ""It has clearly been a challenge at the top of the order for batters throughout the series, and we want to provide the option of a different line-up for the next two matches... Sam gets a call-up to the Test squad for the first time. His style of batting offers a point of difference and we look forward to watching his game develop further,"" he added. Australia's batting unit took a concerning shape in the second innings of the Brisbane Test, where the lineup faltered despite a stellar first-innings performance. Travis Head had smashed 152 off 160 balls, and Steve Smith added a solid 101, but their collapse in the latter innings raised questions about the consistency of their opening pair in Mcsweeny and Usman Khawaja. McSweeney, who was shifted to the opener’s role despite being a middle-order batter in domestic cricket, struggled to adapt, scoring only 72 runs across six innings—a record low for an Australian opener in their first six innings in over five decades. Khawaja, the senior opener, has also faced challenges, averaging just 12 runs in the series with a top score of 21. However, the selectors chose to back Khawaja while dropping McSweeney, prioritising experience over youth.Can Konstas make chance count? The inclusion of Konstas reflects a bold decision aimed at revitalising the lineup. Konstas has been in stellar form during the 2024-25 domestic season, with his most notable performance coming in a pink-ball practice match against India for the Prime Minister's XI. He scored a blistering 107 off 97 balls at Manuka Oval, including 14 boundaries and a six, showcasing his ability to thrive under pressure and adapt to challenging conditions. Bailey expressed confidence in Konstas, highlighting his aggressive stroke play and versatility, which could provide the Australian batting order with much-needed stability and dynamism in the high-stakes Boxing Day Test set to begin on December 26 in Melbourne.AUSTRALIA SQUAD FOR LAST 2 TESTS OF BGT 2024-25 Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  R Ashwin retires: India's greatest match-winner deserved more respect

After months of anticipation, Konstas has finally received his Test call-up for the final two matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. It promises to be a baptism by fire for the young New South Wales cricketer, but the Australian cricket community is quietly confident that Konstas will thrive under pressure.   On Friday, December 20, Australia announced a 15-man squad for the last two Tests against India. With the series level at 1-1 after Australia were denied victory at the Gabba, the selectors have made some pivotal changes to the squad. In a major decision, they have dropped 25-year-old Nathan McSweeney after just three Test matches. McSweeney, who struggled against the Jasprit Bumrah-led pace attack, scored only 72 runs across six innings—the lowest tally for an Australian Test opener in their first six knocks since 1974.   Usman Khawaja fared no better. The 38-year-old managed just 63 runs in six innings but retained his place due to the invaluable experience he offers.   Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Australia appear to have learned a hard lesson. When McSweeney, primarily a middle-order batsman in domestic cricket, was added to the squad at the start of the series, doubts were raised about his ability to handle India’s high-quality attack. McSweeney struggled to keep the scoreboard moving, and Khawaja’s poor form exacerbated the fragility of Australia’s top order.WHO IS SAM KONSTAS By including Sam Konstas, Australia hope to inject aggressive intent at the top of the order. Konstas enters the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with an impressive record across formats.   In December 2024, Konstas made his debut for the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League. Opening alongside David Warner, he smashed a blistering 57 off 26 balls, marking the fastest half-century in Sydney Thunder’s history. His innings included eight boundaries and two sixes, playing a key role in the team’s victory over the Adelaide Strikers.   Konstas also featured for the Prime Minister’s XI in a pink-ball warm-up match against India at Manuka Oval. He scored an outstanding 107 off 97 balls, including 14 fours and a six, against a formidable Indian bowling attack featuring Mohammed Siraj and Ravindra Jadeja. This performance further solidified his reputation as a rising star in Australian cricket.   In October-November 2024, Konstas was selected for Australia A in their series against India A. In the second unofficial Test, he played a crucial role with an unbeaten 73 in the second innings, helping secure a victory for his team. 'LIKE CLARKE, WARNER AND SMITH'  With 736 runs across formats this summer, Konstas has drawn widespread acclaim from cricketing legends and commentators. Former England captain Michael Vaughan had championed his inclusion in the Test squad, describing him as ""fearless"" and ""unflappable.""   England’s World Cup-winning former coach and Sydney Thunder coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised Konstas’s attitude, comparing his confidence to that of David Warner, Steve Smith, and Michael Clarke.   “What I can say is Sam has a self-confidence you don’t see in very many. I’ve only seen it in a few over the years, and all of those players were outstanding Test players and international players, guys like Clarke and Haddin, Warner and Smith,” Bayliss had said, as quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald.   With 718 runs at an average of 42.23 in 11 first-class matches, Konstas has already shown immense promise. If he debuts in Melbourne, he will become only the third Australian cricketer in the last 40 years to make his Test debut as a teenager, following in the footsteps of Pat Cummins and Ashton Agar.

Known for his love of pop culture, Ashwin used a viral line from Thalapathy Vijay's recent blockbuster Tamil film, The Greatest of All Time, to wish his former teammate. Ashwin retired from international cricket on Wednesday, midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He concluded his career as one of the greatest off-spinners in history, taking 537 wickets in 106 Tests. Sundar had penned a heartfelt tribute to Ashwin, saying the senior cricketer has been inspiration and mentor.  Washington Sundar, 25, has been groomed to take over the off-spin responsibilities from Ashwin in red-ball cricket. ""Thupakkiya pudinga washiii! (Hold the gun, Washi)"" Ashwin said, adding: ""The 2 minutes you spoke that night in the get-together was the best."" For the uninitiated, Ashwin's comment referenced a popular line from Thalapathy Vijay, who symbolically passed the baton to rising Tamil film star Sivakarthikeyan, who played a cameo in the film. Vijay, who had announced that GOAT would be his penultimate film before entering politics, handed over the torch to Sivakarthikeyan, a promising commercial hero.

 Ashwin had been one of the pillars of the Test team, especially in home conditions, for over a decade. On the other hand, Sundar was recalled to the Test side for the first time in three years for a home series against New Zealand in October-November.  Sundar made the most of the opportunity, picking up 16 wickets in two Tests and finishing the series, which India lost 0-3, as the leading wicket-taker. Ashwin managed just 9 wickets from three Tests in a rare off-colour series at home.  Sundar was picked in the XI for the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth ahead of Ashwin as the team management hinted they were looking to move on from the veteran.

It remains to be seen if the young Tamil Nadu all-rounder will get a place in the XI in the last two Tests of the series.

Regretting the lack of a grand farewell, Kapil remarked, ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar... Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there-I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him off with a lot of respect and happiness."" Since the announcement of his retirement, Ashwin has been the recipient of heartfelt tributes from the cricketing fraternity. Icons such as Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Gautam Gambhir have all acknowledged the 38-year-old's immense contributions to Indian cricket. Ashwin leaves the game as one of India's greatest matchwinners, with 537 Test wickets—second only to Anil Kumble—and six centuries in the longest format. His record for the most Player of the Series awards in men's Test cricket (11) speaks volumes about his ability to influence games. Known for his innovative skills and cricketing intellect, Ashwin often delivered match-winning performances with both ball and bat. His memorable innings against Bangladesh in Chennai, where he scored a century under pressure, stands out as a testament to his all-round abilities. Ashwin was a vital member of India's triumphs in the 2011 ODI World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy. His stellar performances earned him the ICC Cricketer of the Year and ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year accolades in 2016.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Tune InRead More |  Australia selector explains 'very difficult decision' of dropping Nathan McSweeney

With South Africa currently leading the points table for the ongoing WTC cycle, Bavuma is determined to guide his side to the final, a prestigious milestone for the team and the country's cricketing history. South Africa hold the top position in the WTC standings with 63.33%, placing them within touching distance of securing a spot in the much-anticipated final. Their next challenge comes in the form of a two-match Test series against Pakistan, with the first match scheduled for December 26 at SuperSport Park in Centurion, followed by the New Year's Test at Newlands in Cape Town, starting January 3. Reflecting on the significance of this opportunity, Bavuma expressed the team's collective goal. ""The World Test Championship, it's a World Cup for the red-ball players,"" Bavuma said. ""We've obviously set our sights on seeing ourselves in that final."" The upcoming series against Pakistan is crucial, as a win in one of the two Tests would guarantee their place in the final. The competition for the top spots is fierce, with reigning champions Australia (58.89%) and two-time runners-up India (55.88%) trailing South Africa in the standings. After sweeping Sri Lanka 2-0 in their most recent series, South Africa’s chances of reaching the final look strong. Bavuma was optimistic, saying, ""We've given ourselves a very good opportunity to do so and we're quite close to that. We've played some good cricket as a team. We'd want to continue that. That championship means a lot as well to cricket around the world."" In addition to South Africa, other teams in contention for the final include Australia, India, and Sri Lanka, with Sri Lanka currently sitting in fifth place. As the WTC cycle heads into its final stages, Bavuma reflects on the essence of Test cricket. ""From a pure skill point of view, as players, we've always wanted to play Test cricket. You want to see yourself succeeding where things are tough, where you're tested for long periods,"" he said.

Despite United’s spirited late fightback, they were knocked out of the competition, raising questions about the decision to exclude one of their star players. Pre-match discussions were dominated by Rashford’s absence in United's loss to Tottenham on Friday, following recent comments where the 27-year-old forward expressed his desire for a “new challenge.” Amorim insisted the decision was not rooted in a strained relationship with the player but was based purely on training performance and tactical considerations. However, Rashford’s omission has added fuel to speculation about his uncertain future at the club. “I feel that I do the right thing for the team, so it’s never a mistake. We have to make a selection. Sometimes, like in the game, you feel that some of the guys go inside the pitch and change a little bit of the game. Sometimes it is like that,"" Amorim said post-match. “I think it was not a mistake because I feel I am always doing the best for the team in my way of seeing things,” he added. A product of Manchester United’s academy since the age of seven, Rashford is at a pivotal moment in his career. His role under Amorim has been inconsistent, leading to mounting doubts about his long-term prospects at Old Trafford. This comes despite United’s morale-boosting 2-1 victory over Manchester City in the Premier League just days earlier, where Rashford was also absent from the squad. Although Alejandro Garnacho, another young talent initially left out of the City clash, returned to feature against Tottenham, Rashford remained sidelined. This decision has further intensified rumours about potential exits, with Amorim reiterating that Rashford is ""still a Manchester United player."" Yet, the manager provided little clarity on when the forward might return to action. The timing of Rashford’s exclusion is particularly notable as United face a gruelling schedule with upcoming matches against Bournemouth, Wolves, Newcastle United, and Liverpool. Amorim acknowledged the challenges ahead and stressed the importance of squad harmony and performance-based selections. However, with Rashford’s absence casting a shadow over United’s recent performances, the pressure is mounting on both the player and the manager to resolve the uncertainty. As the season progresses, Rashford’s situation remains a talking point, and whether he can regain his place in the squad will significantly impact United’s fortunes in the coming weeks.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Argentina top FIFA men's football rankings for second straight year

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-prithvi-shaw-own-enemy-mumbai-cricket-on-vijay-hazare-snub-2652785-2024-12-20,"The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has dismissed Prithvi Shaw's dramatic outburst following his withdrawal from the Vijay Hazare Trophy squad, claiming that the volatile batter has repeatedly violated disciplinary guidelines and is ""his own enemy"". The official revealed that Shaw's fitness issues were so significant during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy that the team was ""forced to hide"" him on the field. ""The ball would pass near him, and he would barely make an effort to reach it,"" the official said, speaking anonymously to the news agency PTI. ""Even while batting, he struggled to reach the ball. His fitness, discipline, and attitude are lacking, and we cannot have different rules for different players."" The concerns extended beyond his on-field performance, as Shaw reportedly missed training sessions and frequently returned to the team hotel at odd hours. These behaviors have led to mounting frustration among senior team members, who have begun voicing their displeasure. Prithvi Shaw, excluded from the 16-member Vijay Hazare squad despite being part of Mumbai's title-winning Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy campaign, took to social media to express his disappointment. However, the MCA official dismissed the impact of such posts, emphasizing that the selectors' decisions would not be influenced by public sentiment. ""Social media posts will not sway the Mumbai selectors or the MCA. Shaw needs to focus on his game, not on gaining sympathy,"" the official remarked. Shaw's teammate and Mumbai captain Shreyas Iyer also addressed the issue, offering blunt advice following Mumbai's Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy victory. ""He needs to get his work ethics right. If he does, the sky's the limit for him,"" Iyer said. ""We can't babysit anyone. At the end of the day, it’s his responsibility to figure things out for himself."" Prithvi burst onto the cricket scene with a remarkable Test debut in 2018, scoring a century against the West Indies at just 18 years old. However, his career trajectory has since faltered. Shaw has played only four additional Tests, the last of which was in 2020. His ODI and T20I appearances have also been sparse, with no international white-ball games since 2021. Off-field controversies and inconsistent performances have overshadowed Shaw's talent. In October, he was dropped from Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy squad and assigned a fitness program at the MCA Academy, which he allegedly failed to follow diligently. Adding to the woes, Shaw went unsold at the IPL auction despite setting a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh. This marked another blow for the player once hailed Indian cricket’s next big star. The cricketing community has expressed disappointment at Prithvi Shaw’s inability to capitalise on his potential. ""No one is Shaw's enemy. He is his own enemy,"" the MCA official concluded, summarising the sentiment surrounding the player. For Shaw, the path to redemption lies in introspection, improved fitness, and a renewed commitment to his craft. Only then can he hope to revive his career and fulfil the promise he once showed.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  R Ashwin grateful for calls from Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev on retirement day

""Yes, after the Apex Council Meeting on Thursday, state units were sent a notification about the date of the SGM, which is January 12 at the BCCI headquarters,"" a state association president told PTI. Shah has already taken over as the youngest chairman of ICC on December 1 and Shelar, a seasoned BJP politician, has been sworn in as a cabinet minister in the recently-formed Maharashtra government. As per the Lodha Committee reforms accepted by the Supreme Court, one person can't hold two positions. Shah, who still had a year left in his BCCI tenure before the mandatory cooling-off period, relinquished his post as required. Shelar, who was a Maharashtra BJP president, had to quit the BCCI post as Lodha Reforms do not allow any minister or public servant to be an office-bearer.

This move sparked discussions amongst fans and analysts, adding another layer to the heated rivalry. The aftermath saw a surge in online trolling and banter between the fanbases, solidifying the fierce competition between the two teams. As the 2025 IPL season approaches, expectations are sky-high for another chapter in this storied rivalry.

The decision was made following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan, originally slated to host the tournament exclusively. The ICC announced that India would play its matches at a neutral venue, likely in the UAE. In exchange, Pakistan is exempt from travelling to India for ICC tournaments until 2028, including the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup. The ICC’s statement clarified: “India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue.” ""Pakistan is not losing money. In fact, in this arrangement, Pakistan hasn't even lost its face. No matter how much they might have talked against the Hybrid Model, they had ultimately agreed, but they have also not walked away empty-handed,"" Chopra said. ""It's now almost confirmed that it will be tit for tat. All matches till 2027 will be in the Hybrid Model. If India are not going to Pakistan, Pakistan will also not come to India and play against India. Pakistan will play their matches in a third country,"" he added. This arrangement also applies to the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the Women’s T20 World Cup in 2028, for which Pakistan has secured hosting rights. In his recent YouTube video, Chopra emphasised that this agreement does not harm the PCB financially or reputational-wise.Implications for Global Cricket While the arrangement appears to be a diplomatic solution to the India-Pakistan cricketing impasse, it creates logistical challenges for other cricketing nations. Teams drawn against India and Pakistan will have to navigate increased travel and play in varied conditions. A recent example of these logistical hurdles was the 2023 Asia Cup, co-hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan resulted in the team being stationed in Sri Lanka, forcing other teams to shuttle between the two countries. Players faced drastically different playing conditions, leading to criticism of the tournament’s structure. Uncertainty Ahead The Champions Trophy, set to be held between February and March 2025, still lacks finalised venues. Fans and boards alike remain in the dark about where matches will be played. This uncertainty may affect ticket sales, travel plans, and logistical arrangements for the event. While the hybrid model addresses political sensitivities, it raises significant concerns for global cricket operations. Teams, fans, and administrators will need to adapt to these complexities as they navigate an evolving cricketing landscape.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Australia selector explains 'very difficult decision' of dropping Nathan McSweeney

In his place, Australia brought in 19-year-old Sam Konstas, who has been garnering attention with his remarkable performances in the domestic season. McSweeney, 25, scored 72 runs across six innings in the first three Tests. While he struggled against the Jasprit Bumrah-led bowling attack, he showed considerable resilience during the twilight session on Day 1 of the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. His partnership with Marnus Labuschagne was pivotal in helping Australia post a strong first-innings total, which led to a 10-wicket victory in the match. Several fans and pundits expressed dissatisfaction with McSweeney's exclusion after just three Tests. Some even criticised Bailey for selecting McSweeney, who had been batting in the middle order in domestic cricket, as an opener and then failing to back him after three matches.  Senior batter Usman Khawaja has struggled, scoring just 63 runs in the series so far while Marnus Labuschagne has managed just 83 runs, but the axe fell on McSweeney.

We believed it doesn’t change too much wherever he’s coming in the order. It hasn’t quite worked out as you’d like it to, but it’s still very much the start of his career.” he added.  Sam Konstas, 19, is all set to open the batting alongside Usman Khawaja in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Konstas will become first teenager since Pat Cummins in 2011 to make his debut for the Australian men's Test team.  Konstas smashed 56 off just 37 balls for Sydney Thunder in their Big Bash League match on December 17 in Canberra against the Adelaide Strikers. In the Sheffield Shield, playing for New South Wales, Konstas has scored two centuries and accumulated 369 runs across six innings, highlighting his form in first-class cricket. One of his most standout performances came in the practice match for the Prime Minister's XI against India, where he scored a blistering century. In this pink-ball match at Manuka Oval in Canberra, Konstas hit 107 runs off just 97 balls, including 14 fours and one six, showcasing his exceptional stroke play and ability to handle challenging conditions.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Pakistan had also considered England and Dubai as potential venues. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi stated that other details, such as the timing of the draft and the venue specifics, would be shared later. Gwadar, a key hub of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, boasts one of the most beautiful and scenic cricket grounds in the country. However, due to recent attacks on security installations in the area, it has not hosted any cricket matches so far. Naqvi explained that the decision to select Gwadar aimed to bring the game closer to the people of Balochistan and inspire future generations. ""Gwadar, with its stunning coastline and strategic importance, represents the heart of Pakistan’s economic future. By hosting the PSL player draft here, we aim to highlight its cultural and economic significance while celebrating the unity cricket brings to our nation,"" Naqvi said. ""I look forward to welcoming all the franchises and relevant stakeholders to the beautiful city of Gwadar as we take an exciting step toward marking the start of the 10th edition of Pakistan's biggest sporting extravaganza,"" he added. The PCB has already announced the list of Pakistani players placed by their franchises in the platinum and other categories. However, the final list of foreign players available for the draft is yet to be released. This will be the first time the PSL, launched in 2016, clashes with the Indian Premier League (IPL), as it is scheduled to take place during the same window usually reserved for the IPL. The PCB and its franchises are making efforts to attract high-profile overseas players who went unsold in last month's IPL auction.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  U19 Women's T20 Asia Cup: Aayushi Shukla stars as India beat Sri Lanka to reach final

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ind-vs-aus-kl-rahul-opener-border-gavaskart-trophy-dinesh-karthk-2652987-2024-12-20,"Former India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik has urged the team management to give KL Rahul extended backing at the top of the batting order. Karthik stated that Rahul is often underappreciated, particularly for his contributions away from home in Test cricket, and added that the selectors should not have short memories. Karthik's comments come at a time when Rahul has re-established himself as the first-choice opening batter in Test cricket. The Karnataka batsman was initially picked in the 18-man squad for a middle-order role, but Rohit Sharma's absence in the series opener in Perth forced the management to play Rahul at the top. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal impressed at the top of the order, combining for a match-winning 201-run partnership in the second innings of the first Test in Perth. Rahul contributed with a gritty 77, playing a pivotal role in India's victory. Even after Rohit Sharma returned for the second Test in Adelaide, KL Rahul continued to open alongside Jaiswal. Rohit moved to No. 6 but has struggled in the lower middle order. Meanwhile, Rahul strengthened his reputation at the top with a match-saving 84 in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane. ""I believe, in KL Rahul, we have the opener that India needs. I hope they continue to back him. If, within the next year, there's a series where he has a couple of low scores, I hope people don’t have a short memory. We need to appreciate what he has done and what he is doing today. That matters a lot. People often forget that many Test cricketers are judged on what they do abroad. And Rahul has been as good as anyone who has played for the country over an extended period,"" Dinesh Karthik told Cricbuzz. ""People always complain about his consistency; I don't want to use that word. But he takes it upon himself. His average shows that. But he is far better than that. He is someone who is much, much better than that."" ""But, if you take any Indian team planning to tour abroad, he will be one of the first names on that list because you know exactly what you will get from him,"" he added. Rahul has been India's leading run-scorer in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, amassing 235 runs in six innings at an average of 47. Since the start of 2021, KL Rahul has scored 889 runs, including three centuries, at an average of 40.40 in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia).

The WPBL promises a competitive and inclusive spectacle in January-February next year. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/world-pickleball-league-gaurav-natekar-interview-2652892-2024-12-20,"Pickleball, one of the fastest-growing sports worldwide, is poised to make a significant splash in India with the inaugural edition of the World Pickleball League (WPBL). Combining the sport's rapid rise in popularity with top-tier global talent and an entertainment-packed format, the league is set to redefine sports engagement in the country. The WPBL, co-founded by former Indian tennis stars Gaurav Natekar and Arati Ponnappa Natekar, promises a competitive and inclusive spectacle while tapping into pickleball's growing community appeal. With the Cricket Club of India (CCI) hosting the league, it marks a historic moment -- the iconic venue's first non-cricket sporting event in over 15 years. Scheduled from January 24 to February 02, the league will bring together players from 14 countries, delivering a truly global pickleball showcase. For Gaurav Natekar, a seven-time national tennis champion and Arjuna Awardee, the transition to pickleball was natural, driven by the sport's accessibility and inclusive ethos. ""Pickleball is going to explode in India primarily for three reasons. First, it is very easy to play but tough to master. It requires very little space and significantly less infrastructure compared to building a badminton, squash, tennis, volleyball, or basketball court,"" he told India Today. ""The third reason is that it's age-agnostic. Forty per cent of the players in this sport are women. I mean, you know, my background of, you know, me and my wife, Arati, who's played tennis for India, my dad, my in-laws, and as a family, we could never really get down to playing one sport together. A couple of months back, 16 of us played pickleball together. The oldest was 66, and the youngest was 11. That's when it really hit me that this is a game for community and relationship building.""STAR-STUDDED LEAGUE WITH COMPETITIVE EDGE The WPBL recently concluded its player draft, selecting 48 players from a pool of 75 contracted athletes, representing 14 countries, including India, Spain, Japan, South Korea, and the UK. With franchises based in Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Delhi, each team comprises eight players, four men and four women, with a mandatory Indian player in every squad.

Addressing the competition in India's budding pickleball ecosystem, Natekar emphasised, ""I think there is competition in everything, right? One thing that playing sport at the highest level has taught me is that one has to focus on what one needs to do. So I'm very focused, me and Arati are both very focused on the next point in the next game. ""We believe in our ability and our capability. This is the first time, from what I am told, that there are two international-level players who've actually started a league. Otherwise, leagues are generally started by business houses. This is the first time that we are attempting to do a league of this scale.""COLD WAR BETWEEN TENNIS AND PICKLEBALL? Natekar also addressed the much-talked-about cold war between tennis and pickleball. The former tennis player acknowledged concerns raised by many, including Novak Djokovic, about pickleball eating into the tennis ecosystem. ""Tennis is my first love. Tennis has given me everything. And not only me, but even my wife, Arti Ponnappa, you know, we've got everything from tennis. I think having said that we are in the sports business. It's almost as if, you know, you're asking a cricketer, why are you getting into another sport, right? So it's not that I don't love tennis. Tennis has and will be my first love. While I think Novak's comment needs to be taken a little seriously because he obviously knows what he's saying. I don't know whether it is a huge threat to tennis. I think that there is a space for both sports to exist and coexist,"" the former tennis player said. All eyes are on the World Pickleball League.

Notably, McSweeney didn’t have a memorable start to his career has he could only score 72 runs from first three games. The 25-year-old was picked in the team on the back of some solid performances against India A and in the Sheffield Shield trophy. However, the Queensland-born batter failed to emulate his good show at the international level as he was tormented by Jasprit Bumrah.  Following his poor performances, McSweeney finds himself out of the team and has been replaced by Sam Konstas. His dropping hasn’t gone down well with Clarke who felt that he should’ve got a long run at the top of the order. ""Nathan McSweeney has been dropped. I can't believe that. No matter who they picked in that opening position, they had to give them the series. I think the selectors have got this wrong. We've got Usman Khawaja who is 38 years old, and he's made no runs. He's a senior player,"" Clarke said on the Beyond 23 Cricket podcast. Further speaking ahead, Clarke highlighted the ageing Australian batting line up and felt that the selectors also need to look at the future.What happens if Usman Khawaja retires in two Test matches?: Clarke ""We've got Marnus Labuschagne, who before the series was under pressure and has made one decent score. Steve Smith batted like a genius to make a hard-fought hundred, but he's also been under pressure. Everyone apart from McSweeney is over 30 years of age, some in their high 30s. What happens if Usman Khawaja retires in two Test matches? Does McSweeney then come back in, or does he go to the back of the queue? They've got to come out and say, ‘We made a mistake picking him,'"" he added. Meanwhile, Sam Konstas also starred in the recent tour matches against India A as he scored a match-winning unbeaten 73 in the second unofficial Test. The 19-year-old also boasts a good first class average of 42.23 and will be eager to continue his good form at the international level as well in the fourth Test beginning from 26th December in Melbourne.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  BCCI to hold Special General Meeting in January to elect Jay Shah's replacement

The match was part of a three-game series, played in Harare. The incident occurred in the fifth over of Zimbabwe's innings when Farooqi expressed frustration after his LBW appeal against Craig Ervine was turned down. The left-arm pacer made a gesture requesting a review, despite the match not having DRS (Decision Review System) available. This act breached Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which penalises players for “showing dissent at an umpire’s decision during an international match.” In addition to the fine, one demerit point has been added to Farooqi's disciplinary record. This marks his first offence within a 24-month period. The bowler admitted to the violation and accepted the penalty proposed by Match Referee Andy Pycroft.

Miandad stated that the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) mediation of the new agreement between India and Pakistan for world events represents a bigger victory for Pakistan than for their arch-rivals. On Thursday, 20 December, the ICC announced that next year's Champions Trophy would be held in a hybrid model—featuring three venues in Pakistan and a neutral venue to host India’s matches. The decision followed a protracted standoff after India refused to travel to Pakistan. Although Pakistan initially rejected the hybrid model, the ICC ensured that all stakeholders, including the BCCI and PCB, reached an agreement. Pakistan had previously suffered setbacks, including losing nine matches and the final, when they agreed to host last year’s Asia Cup using a hybrid model. The ICC also announced that matches between India and Pakistan in world events hosted by either country between 2025 and 2028 would be held at neutral venues. ""I think the PCB took the sensible approach and, instead of doing something rash and facing isolation from the ICC and other cricketing nations, opted for a solution where I believe the PCB has gained more than the BCCI,"" Miandad said, as quoted by the PTI news agency. ""Still, Pakistan is hosting a major event after a very long time, and we have sent a clear message that if you don’t come and play in our country, we will also not play in India,"" he added. The agreement means that Pakistan will not travel to India for their matches during the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the Men’s T20 World Cup in 2026. Meanwhile, Pakistan was also awarded the hosting rights for the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2028 on Thursday. However, the PCB was not compensated monetarily for the partial loss of hosting rights for the Champions Trophy. Former Pakistan spinner Iqbal Qasim praised the PCB for successfully securing the ICC, BCCI, and ICC board’s agreement on a compromise formula. ""The BCCI is a very strong and financially influential board. But unlike last year’s Asia Cup, this time our board took a stance and gained something. The main thing is that we are hosting the tournament and will also not travel to India to play in ICC events. Both teams will now compete at neutral venues,"" Qasim said.

And that partnership, I think of about 80 or 90, suddenly turned the game on its head and by the end of the day, India had won the Test match.”Watch the video here-

Notably, Ashwin recently announced his retirement from international cricket after the third Test against Australia in Brisbane. The veteran all-rounder has been arguably the biggest match-winner for India in the longest format, which is evident from his 11 Player of the Series awards. Recently, Pujara opened up on Ashwin’s overseas performances and mentioned how he always played a key role for the team in SENA(South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia) countries. Pujara highlighted that Ashwin may not have picked fifers in SENA but was always consistent with his key strikes and picked big wickets from the opposing teams. “Yes, they are underrated and when he performs the way he performs in India because most of the time it will be fifers or three or four wickets. But there are times where he will pick two or three important wickets away from India and those are key wickets. For example, we’re talking about getting Smith out, I think it was in Melbourne 2020. But those are some of the key wickets overseas, important ones. It’s not about picking a fifer, it’s about picking those two-three quick wickets to support other bowlers. Sometimes, we underestimate that role,” Pujara said on ESPNCricinfo. Further speaking ahead, Pujara hailed the India spinner for evolving his game with time and revealed his preparations to outsmart batters.Ashwin retires as India's 2nd highest wicket taker in Tests “He’s evolved as a bowler, he’s got lot of variations in his bowling because he’s someone who likes to think about his game. He likes to think about the opponents as well. What kind of strategies do they have, what are the options a batter has? when he’s facing Ashwin. So, he thinks from both sides. He knows his game plan as well but at the same time, it’s important as well to understand what the batter is trying to do by seeing his videos. The strength which Ashwin had, which he’s developed over a period of time, is having enough variations in his bowling,” he added. Ashwin didn’t have a memorable time in SENA nations at the beginning of his career as he averaged in the high 40s in the initial few years. However, he made a remarkable comeback from 2018 onwards as he got under the skin of top players such as Alastair Cook and Steve Smith. The off spinner played crucial roles in India’s famous wins in Adelaide 2018, Melbourne 2020 and Centurion 2021. Ashwin retired as the second-highest wicket taker for India in Tests with 537 scalps from 106 matches at an average of 24 with 37 five wicket hauls and eight ten wicket hauls in his career.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  BCCI to hold Special General Meeting in January to elect Jay Shah's replacement

A lot of hard work went on behind the scenes, and the boys were tremendous in their performance. Now, we are done with this part and moving on to the next big thing, which is IPL. I'm super excited to be part of Punjab Kings and can't wait to join the Punjab Kings family,"" Iyer said in a video posted by the franchise. Iyer's success in 2024 has been marked by a series of impressive victories, having led teams to four major titles. As he prepares for the IPL 2025 season, his primary goal is clear: to win the IPL for Punjab Kings. ""It's been a great year for me personally, winning four trophies this season. My main goal now is to win the IPL for Punjab. I understand the feeling among the fans, and with Ricky Ponting coming in, we share a great camaraderie from the past. We will be brainstorming on many aspects and hopefully deliver from match one,"" Iyer added. Ricky Ponting, the newly appointed head coach of Punjab Kings, has already expressed confidence in Iyer's leadership abilities. The former Australian captain's tactical insights and wealth of experience will be invaluable as Iyer looks to steer the team toward its maiden IPL title. The synergy between Ponting and Iyer is expected to be a major strength for Punjab Kings, and fans are hopeful that the team's combination of fresh leadership and renewed momentum will break the franchise's title drought.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Prithvi Shaw is his own enemy: Mumbai Cricket breaks silence on Vijay Hazare snub

This leadership role comes at a time when Rinku's IPL franchise, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), has yet to announce their captain for the next season. Rinku will captain a state team at the senior level for the first time. Earlier this year, he led the Meerut Mavericks to victory in the UPT20 League, scoring 210 runs in nine innings with a strike rate of 161.54, primarily as a finisher. He has been a part of the KKR setup since 2018 and was retained ahead of the mega auction in November, along with Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ramandeep Singh. ""I am not overthinking about the captaincy of KKR in the new IPL season,"" Rinku was quoted saying to ESPN Cricinfo. ""I am focused on my plans for Uttar Pradesh, as I want my team to regain the trophy we had won for the first time in 2015-16."" Rinku revealed his efforts to become a more versatile cricketer, citing his attempts at bowling off spin during the UPT20 league.  ""I did try my hand at bowling [offspin] too at the UPT20 league. Present-day cricket demands a full package - a cricketer who can bat, bowl and field. Now I am focusing on my bowling too. As captain of Uttar Pradesh, I have got a bigger role to play, and I'm ready for this."" The Vijay Hazare Trophy presents a crucial opportunity for players aiming to make an impression on national selectors, particularly with the Champions Trophy scheduled for February. While Rinku has become a regular feature in India’s T20I squad, his ODI appearances remain limited to two matches since his debut in South Africa last year. Rinku’s List A statistics underline his potential: he has amassed 1,899 runs in 52 innings at an impressive average of 48.69 and a strike rate of 94.8. His record includes one century and 17 half-centuries. Despite these achievements, Rinku remains grounded. ""I believe in God,"" he said. ""I didn't even think of being part of team India when I struck five consecutive sixes in the IPL last year. That turned out to be the biggest game changer in my life. Even now I feel that if God has decided something for me, I will get that surely. But at the same time, I also need to work hard on my job."" As the captain of Uttar Pradesh, Rinku Singh carries the responsibility of guiding his team to replicate their 2015-16 Vijay Hazare Trophy triumph. His focus on team success over personal milestones reflects his maturity and leadership qualities. The upcoming tournament will not only test his abilities as a leader but also solidify his position as a key figure in Indian domestic cricket.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Ravichandran Ashwin's overseas contributions are underrated: Cheteshwar Pujara

Notably, Rohit is known for his nature of forgetting things which he’s openly shared during his various interviews. Recently, Imam was asked in a podcast what he would do if he woke up as Rohit Sharma. The Pakistan cricketer replied that he would look where his things were and what all he did the previous night, keeping in mind Rohit’s forgetful nature. The Pakistan batter went on to call him a different level of personality, mentioning how he even forgets his gloves and bats. “I’ll look where I put everything in the night, where did I put my shoes, where did I keep my phone, where did I put my belt, who did I message, who did I phone. Oh my God, you haven’t met him, he’s a different level of personality. He completely forgets where he kept his gloves and bats,” said Imam on Cricwick’s Ultra Edge podcast. Further speaking ahead, Imam shared a story involving Babar and Rohit from the 2023 ODI World Cup mentioning how Babar prevented Rohit’s phone from being lost. “Babar told me about this story, do you remember there was a captain’s meeting before World Cup 2023 and these guys went in a plane? He had bought a new iPhone, and AirPods. He said they were talking and he first left his iPhone here, then left it in the plane, and then his AirPods every two minutes,” he added.India to play Champions Trophy matches at neutral venue “Then, he was cursing himself, what am I doing, I keep forgetting things everywhere.

The incident occurred when Kohli landed in Melbourne with his wife, actor Anushka Sharma, and their children on Thursday, December 19. A journalist from Australia’s Channel 7 captured a video of the family, which angered Kohli, according to local media. The cricketer was particularly upset about the intrusion into his family’s privacy. He approached the journalist, requesting to view the pictures and videos taken. Kohli then asked her to delete any images or footage of his family, while allowing her to retain any of him alone. Under Australian law, there are no restrictions on photographing or filming celebrities in public places, which likely complicated the matter. ""With my kids, I need some privacy. You can't film without asking me,"" he told the media at the airport.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ravi-shastri-reacts-to-india-brisbane-follow-on-celebrations-vs-australia-2653014-2024-12-20,"Former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes India's Brisbane follow-on celebrations were fully justified, and the tourists can use this achievement as a springboard as the Test series against Australia moves towards Melbourne. Shastri said that India's remarkable fightback on the final day of the third Test against Australia in Brisbane was a defining moment in the ongoing series. The former Indian coach praised the team's resilience, particularly the efforts of Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep, who played pivotal roles in ensuring India avoided the follow-on in a crucial moment of the match. Speaking on The ICC Review with host Sanjana Ganesan, Ravi Shastri emphasised that the celebrations after India managed to escape the follow-on were fully justified, considering the context of the match and the series. ""You should celebrate,"" Shastri said. ""It required a lot of character from the last pair with 35-36 runs needed. That celebration showed, they knew the importance of that effort within the dressing room in the context of the series."" For Shastri, the fight to avoid the follow-on was not just about saving face-it was about setting the tone for the next Test. He explained that it could have been disastrous for India to go into the second innings behind by more than 200 runs, especially with a vulnerable batting order. ""It's one thing following on, it's one thing then again being 2-3 down as opposed to, you going ahead and rattling the Australian top-order,"" Shastri remarked. ""It is fully justified."" The former coach also drew parallels with another iconic moment in India's recent Test history-the unforgettable 89-run partnership between Bumrah and Mohammed Shami at Lord's during the 2021 England series, which turned the game on its head. ""It reminded me of the celebration, when in COVID times, when Jasprit and Mohammed Shami were involved in a partnership at Lord's, which turned the game on its head,"" Shastri recalled. ""England were odds on favourites on the final day to win the Test. And that partnership, I think of about 80 or 90, suddenly turned the game on its head and by the end of the day, India had won the Test match."" Shastri stressed that India's recent success in Test cricket has often been built on the tenacity and resilience of their tail-enders. From Bumrah and Shami's remarkable partnerships to the steadfast efforts of Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari in Sydney, India's lower order has often been the unsung hero in their fights. ""When the tail-enders are stubborn, they fight it out there. It makes a massive difference,"" Shastri noted. ""It did it on the last tour. When Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari batted the whole of the last session to save the game, going into the Gabba and then winning the series."" Such efforts provide a psychological lift for the team, and Shastri believes this fightback in Brisbane could play a crucial role as India prepares for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. ""It'll lift the Indian team. And for me, the series is on a level peg now and India might just be calling the shots,"" Shastri said. With the series tied at 1-1, Shastri expressed optimism for India's prospects moving forward. Reflecting on the challenging road India has already faced, Shastri acknowledged how significant the 1-1 scoreline is for the team. ""Massive. They would give anything for a 1-1 result,"" he said, considering the difficulties of the early stages of the series, which included the fast, bouncy pitches of Perth and the challenges of Adelaide's day-night Test. ""The first Test is in Perth, second Test is a day-nighter in Adelaide, and then the third Test in Brisbane. Any overseas team will, you know, settle for a 1-1 score because come Melbourne, come Sydney, I think India will be powerful."" Shastri expressed confidence in India's chances in Melbourne, despite the close call in Brisbane. ""They've been kept in this series single-handedly by Jasprit Bumrah,"" he said. ""If the big boys wake up, and step up to the plate which I just get the gut feeling they will, then Australia has a problem on their hands."" With India heading into the Boxing Day Test with renewed belief, Shastri added, ""Yeah, they got out of jail but they are not on bail. They are free birds in Melbourne. They can do what they want and come and attack Australia on Boxing Day.""Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Javed Miandad reacts to Champions Trophy solution: PCB has gained more than BCCI

Notably, Ashwin recently retired from international cricket after the third Test against Australia at the Gabba in Brisbane. The veteran off spinner retires as the second-highest wicket taker for India in Tests with 537 wickets from 106 matches. Recently, BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) uploaded a special video tribute for Ashwin capturing all of his milestone scalps and the other great moments from his career. In the special video feature, Ashwin shared the promise he made to himself about not letting India lose another series after losing against England in 2012 at home. “Look, I don't know where to begin, honestly, I think. I made myself a promise in 2012. We lost the series against England, a tricky one. It was very early in my career and I was just telling myself, we're not going to lose another one ever, and that's what I promised myself . How many wickets you take, how many hour runs you make, in 10 years' time, you won't remember them. It's the memories that matters,” said Ashwin in a video released by BCCI. Following the series loss against England in 2012, which was India’s first loss in a home rubber since 2004, India went on to win a world record 18 consecutive series on their home soil. Ashwin played a pivotal role in India’s over 11-year-long home dominance as he scalped 320 wickets from 53 matches at an average of 20.04 with 24 five wicket hauls and five ten wicket hauls.

I wouldn't have believed them because I knew that this is a game that I loved, but I never did expect that I would get so much love and so many wickets and so many runs as well. I'm very glad, deep sense of gratitude for everyone that supported me, everyone that's challenged me. So happy today. Thank you,” he added. Ashwin played his last Test against Australia in Adelaide where he registered figures of 1/53 in 18 overs and scored 22 and 7 across two innings.

This marks another blow for the struggling champions, whose chances of retaining the Premier League title appear to be slipping away. City will travel to Aston Villa on Saturday, hoping to steady the ship amidst the worst run of results in Guardiola's managerial career. Currently sitting fifth in the league table, City have managed just one win in their last 11 games across all competitions. Dias sustained the injury during City's disastrous 2-1 derby loss to Manchester United on Sunday. ""It was a muscular injury,"" Guardiola explained. ""After 75 minutes against Manchester United, he felt something. He is so strong that he stayed on the pitch, but now he's injured."" There is some relief, however, as fellow defender Manuel Akanji returned to training this week following an injury earlier this month. ""That's good for us,"" Guardiola said. City's loss to United was particularly dramatic, as they conceded two goals in less than two minutes after leading in the 88th minute. Guardiola appeared dejected afterward, taking full responsibility for the team's shocking run. Speaking candidly in a heartfelt post-game press conference, he admitted, ""I am not good enough."" ""I had just finished a game where we were close to winning but lost. Given the sequence of events, I wasn't happy,"" Guardiola said. ""I try to be honest with myself. If you fall six times, you have to stand up seven. ""I'm fine. I'm a normal person with feelings, like all of us. When things are going well, we feel better. When they're not, we focus more on what we need to do."" Aston Villa, just two points and two places behind City in the league table, could leapfrog them with a win on Saturday at Villa Park. Unai Emery's team has also outperformed City in their Champions League campaign. They currently sit fifth in the standings with two games remaining in the league phase, while City languish in 22nd. ""I'm not surprised,"" Guardiola said of Villa's success. ""They have an excellent manager. Their qualification for the Champions League and their results speak for themselves. They're handling it well-balancing both competitions is never easy, and they've done really well."" City last played at Villa Park just over a year ago, losing 1-0 before rebounding to thrash Emery's side 4-1 in early April. Guardiola, however, dismissed the relevance of those results.

 The young batter, once hailed as the next big thing in Indian cricket, has faced a barrage of criticism in recent times, with questions raised about his focus and ability to handle pressure. Shaw's recent social media activity appears to be his way of addressing detractors and standing up for himself amidst the growing scrutiny. ""The ball would pass near him, and he would barely make an effort to reach it,"" the official said, speaking anonymously to the news agency PTI. ""Even while batting, he struggled to reach the ball. His fitness, discipline, and attitude are lacking, and we cannot have different rules for different players."" The concerns extended beyond his on-field performance, as Shaw reportedly missed training sessions and frequently returned to the team hotel at odd hours. These behaviors have led to mounting frustration among senior team members, who have begun voicing their displeasure. Prithvi Shaw, left out of Mumbai's 16-member Vijay Hazare Trophy squad despite being part of their victorious Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy campaign, voiced his disappointment on social media. However, an MCA official dismissed the significance of such posts, stressing that selectors remain unaffected by public opinion. ""Social media posts won’t influence the Mumbai selectors or the MCA’s decisions. Shaw should concentrate on his game instead of seeking sympathy,"" the official stated firmly. While Shaw’s immense talent is unquestionable, the recurring concerns over his fitness and discipline could overshadow his potential if not addressed. As the debate continues, fans and critics alike will be watching closely to see how the young cricketer navigates this challenging phase of his career.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Bumrah-Akashdeep's match-saving partnership reminds Ravi Shastri of Lords 2021Trending Reel

— Arjun Erigaisi (@ArjunErigaisi) December 20, 2024 The World Rapid and Blitz Championship holds significant importance for Arjun, as strong performances could enhance his chances of qualifying for the next Candidates Tournament, a key pathway to challenging India’s Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa for the World Chess Championship title. Currently, Arjun is in a close race with Fabiano Caruana for a spot in the Candidates, with 124.40 points compared to Caruana’s 130.42.   This year has been remarkable for Arjun. He broke the elusive 2800 ELO rating, climbed to fourth in the FIDE rankings, and played a crucial role in India’s maiden FIDE Olympiad victory, contributing to both the men’s and women’s triumphs.   Despite his visa concerns, Arjun remains optimistic about resolving the issue in time to compete. “It’s a World Championship, very prestigious. Doing well here is crucial for my career,” he emphasised.   As the tournament approaches, all eyes are on Arjun, hoping he can overcome this hurdle and represent India on one of the biggest stages in chess.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  D Gukesh reveals how he plans to spend Rs 11.45 crore world championship prizeMust Watch

Notably, Pant made his long awaited Test comeback in September earlier this year after surviving a near-fatal car crash on December 30, 2022. Following his accident, it was believed that Pant wouldn’t be able to do wicketkeeping again. However, the India star has proved his naysayers wrong as he’s returned to be his acrobatic best behind the stumps. Recently, Healy shared his opinion on Pant’s wicketkeeping skills and said that the 27-year-old still has a lot to work on. The Australian legend pointed out a glaring error in his technique as the India player makes the wrong initial movement which leads to drop catches. “Rishabh Pant is a work in progress, but I saw him in the mornings and like the drills he is doing; he is bound to improve more. At times, as he did when he dropped a catch in this series earlier, he can make an initial wrong movement. Some keepers like to move a touch to their left first and then press from there. It’s better to be still and if you can’t, then you start that trigger movement a touch early so that by the time the ball is out there, you can still press to the right side. One of those two decisions have to be made,” Healy told the Indian Express.Pant's low returns with the bat in the series so far Apart from taking some sensational grabs with the gloves, Pant has also dropped a few chances in the ongoing series as he dropped Nathan McSweeney late on Day 1 of the second Test in Adelaide. Despite that, the India wicketkeeper has done a fine job with the gloves having taken 19 catches in three matches. However, Pant hasn’t been able to replicate his performances with the bat having scored just 96 runs from three matches (five innings) at an average of 19.20 with a highest score of 37. As India travel to the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) for the fourth Test, they will desperately need Pant to fire with the bat as they look to take a lead in the series which is tied at 1-1.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Watch: Virat Kohli's latest intense avatar ahead of Boxing Day Test

Furthermore, all the ICC events till 2027 will follow the same model with Pakistan also playing at a neutral venue in the events hosted by India. Following the announcement by the ICC, Shehzad shared his thoughts on the development, saying that PCB missed a great opportunity of hosting India. ""Pakistan had a golden chance to host India. All cricket boards had signed the agreement in 2021 that Pakistan will host the Champions Trophy. ICC cannot back off. PCB has missed the chance I think. We should forget that the Indian team will ever come to Pakistan now. Just forget it. The only way you could have brought India here was by an ICC event,"" Shehzad told YouTuber Nadir Ali. Further speaking ahead, the opening batter suggested a bizarre idea of building a stadium at the border of two countries and playing matches there.India don't hold bilateral relations with Pakistan since 2012-13 ""I did a podcast where I suggested the idea of building a stadium by the border. One gate would be towards India, the other gate would be towards Pakistan. The players would come from the respective gates and play. But even then there would be issues for the BCCI and their government. When their players come to the field by our side, they would need visas which they would not get,"" he added. India and Pakistan don’t hold bilateral cricketing relations since 2012-13, when Pakistan came to India for a limited overs tour. India last travelled to Pakistan to play in the Asia Cup 2008 and haven’t travelled to the country since then due to the stiff political relations between the two nations.

Match Referee Richie Richardson imposed the penalty, citing Klaasen’s inappropriate behaviour. Klaasen had been a standout performer for South Africa, playing a valiant knock of 97 off 74 balls in a challenging chase of 330. Despite his efforts, the Proteas struggled due to a lack of support at the other end and were bowled out for 248, falling short by 81 runs.

Ever since  Ashwin hung up his boots, tributes have been pouring in for the India cricketer from all over the world acknowledging his immense contribution to the game. His wife Prithi Narayanan also penned a long emotional tribute recalling his cricketing journey over the years as the two stood by each other during the highs and lows of life. ""It has been a blurry two days for me. I have been thinking about what I can say.. Do I put this down as a tribute to my all time favourite cricketer ? Maybe I'll just take the partner angle? Or maybe a love letter from a fan girl? I guess this is a little bit of all of it. When I saw Ashwin's PC, I thought of small and big moments. Many many memories over the last 13-14 years,” wrote Prithi in a post on her Instagram account. “The big wins , the MOS awards, the quiet silence in our room after an intense game, the sound of the shower running for much longer than usual on some evenings post play , the scratch of pencil over paper as he scribbled thoughts down, the constant streaming of footage videos when he is making a game plan, the calm of meditative breathing before leaving for each game, certain songs playing on repeat while he unwinds.. The times we weeped in joy - after the CT final, after the MCG win, after the Sydney draw, The Gabba win, after making a comeback in T20s...the times we sat in silence and the times when we had our hearts broken,” she added. ""Dear Ashwin, from not knowing how to put a kit bag together to following you to stadiums all over the world, rooting for you, watching you and learning from you, it has been an absolute pleasure. The world you introduced me to gave me the privilege to watch and enjoy a sport that I love from close quarters. It also showed me how much passion, hardwork and discipline is needed to keep your head above water. And sometimes even that is not enough. I remember us talking about why you, R Ashwin, had to do all of this and a lot more to even stay relevant in the scheme of things,” she further wrote.

Ashwin's retirement came after India's historic third Test against Australia at the Gabba, a match that ended in a thrilling draw. Ashwin's career statistics underscore his monumental contributions to Indian cricket. Over a 14-year span, he claimed 537 wickets in 106 Test matches at an average of 24, making him India's second-highest Test wicket-taker after the legendary Anil Kumble. Ashwin's tally includes 37 five-wicket hauls-second only to Muttiah Muralitharan in Test cricket-and eight ten-wicket match hauls. Beyond his bowling exploits, Ashwin also shone with the bat, amassing six centuries and 14 fifties in the longest format. In his final international game, the day-night Test against Australia in Adelaide, Ashwin delivered a characteristically all-round performance. He took 1-53 in 18 overs and contributed a gritty 29 runs with the bat, although India succumbed to a ten-wicket defeat. Mukund, who shared a close bond with Ashwin from their early days in domestic cricket, penned a poignant column for ESPNCricinfo on Friday. He described Ashwin as a relentless thinker, whose intellect and curiosity extended far beyond the cricketing field. ""His brain was in overdrive throughout. You could never keep him quiet,"" Mukund wrote. Recalling long bus rides during the Ranji Trophy, Mukund highlighted Ashwin's penchant for leading games of Mafia, a deduction game that showcased his love for strategy and interaction. Mukund also reminisced about their youthful days in club cricket, where Ashwin's analytical mind often shone. ""He would bring a pen and paper to the dressing room and orchestrate mock IPL auction drafts, meticulously plotting team compositions. That restless intelligence means he never fails to surprise you every time you speak to him,"" Mukund shared. Mukund revealed that during India's Test match against Bangladesh in Chennai in September, he sensed Ashwin was preparing to call time on his international career. The moment, while subtle, marked the beginning of the end for a cricketer who had become synonymous with excellence and innovation. Ashwin's impact extended beyond his numbers. He was a key member of India's victorious 2011 ODI World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy squads. In 116 ODIs, Ashwin took 156 wickets, while his T20I career saw him claim 72 wickets in 65 matches. As Ashwin steps away from international cricket, he leaves behind a legacy defined not just by his achievements but by his relentless quest for improvement and his unique approach to the game.

Jadeja revealed that Ashwin and he had been sitting together throughout the final day's play, but his former spin partner did not give the slightest hint about the significant decision that followed.   Speaking to the press on Saturday, December 21, after India's first training session in Melbourne, Ravindra Jadeja addressed Ashwin's announcement, which had made headlines last week.  | Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage | ""I got to know about it only in the last moment. Just before when he came to address the press. I think it was 5 minutes before the press conference, people told me that this was going to happen. Obviously, I was surprised because we both were sitting together throughout that day. He didn't even give a hint. I got to know in the last minute. Yes, we all know Ashwin's mind and how it works,"" Jadeja said.   Ashwin made an unforeseen announcement minutes after the third Test in Brisbane ended in a draw on 18 December. The veteran off-spinner stated that he was retiring with immediate effect. Ashwin left the team at the conclusion of the third Test and reached Chennai the following day.   The timing of R Ashwin's retirement has left the cricketing world divided. However, Jadeja emphasised that it was time for the team to move on and ensure the youngster stepping in for Ashwin gains as much experience and exposure as possible in the days ahead.   ""We have to move on. In India, it's not like you won't get someone who can replace him. Everybody knows we will get someone.   ""It's a good opportunity for a youngster who comes into the team and to prove himself at this level,"" Jadeja added.   India have fielded as many as three spinners across the first three Tests. Washington Sundar played as the lone spinner in the series opener in Perth, while Ashwin featured in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, which was his final match. For the third Test in Brisbane, India replaced Ashwin with Ravindra Jadeja in the playing XI.  JADEJA ON NOT PLAYING FIRST TWO TESTS While Jadeja could not make a significant impact with the ball, he stepped up with the bat when his team needed him the most. Jadeja scored a crucial 77 runs in the first innings of the rain-affected Brisbane Test, ensuring that India avoided a follow-on.   India were struggling at 74 for 5 after losing key players, including Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, cheaply in response to Australia's first innings total of 445. However, KL Rahul and Jadeja stitched together a vital 67-run partnership to steer the team out of trouble.   Reflecting on his innings, Jadeja said the match-saving knock in Brisbane would boost his confidence for the rest of the series. He credited the time he spent training during the first two Tests as a crucial factor in his performance.   ""The first two Tests I didn't play, but it gave me an opportunity to practice and get used to conditions. All the time I got to understand the conditions, bowl on these pitches and bat on these pitches, it made me familiar with these conditions. All the hard work in the nets helped me in the match,"" he said.   With the series level at 1-1, India and Australia are set to face off in the fourth Test, beginning on Boxing Day at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Abhinav Mukund believes Ashwin contemplated retirement before final decisionTrending Reel

While Ashwin and Jadeja have parted ways in Test cricket, fans will be thrilled to see the duo reunite for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in IPL 2025. Jadeja, retained by CSK for Rs 18 crore, will be joined by Ashwin, who was acquired for Rs 9.75 crore after a fierce bidding war at the auction. Their partnership in the IPL is expected to bring back the chemistry and experience that made them a feared pair in Test cricket.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/football-pep-guardiola-backs-erling-haaland-perform-manchester-city-better-2653223-2024-12-21,"Pep Guardiola has thrown his support behind star striker Erling Haaland, highlighting the need for Manchester City to improve their overall play to maximize the Norwegian's impact. This comes as City navigate a challenging spell of form, with only one win in their last 11 matches across all competitions - a stark contrast to the dominance typically associated with Guardiola's tenure. Haaland, who has been a goal-scoring machine since joining City, has struggled recently, scoring just once in his last five games. The lack of service has left him isolated against opposing defenders. However, Guardiola dismissed any suggestion of reverting to a false nine system, which had previously brought him success. ""I prefer to play with Erling,"" Guardiola said ahead of City's Premier League clash with Aston Villa. ""I don't think in this situation that I should not let Erling play - absolutely not. We have to adapt to the qualities he brings."" Guardiola acknowledged that Haaland's reduced goal tally is a symptom of the team's struggles rather than a reflection of the player's form. ""The reason he's not been as productive is the way we're playing,"" Guardiola explained. ""We're not creating the volume of chances we did in the past. When he's surrounded by two, three, or four defenders, it's tough for him. We need to play better as a team to create the spaces he needs."" Amid City's current struggles, Guardiola hinted at the possibility of January reinforcements, a departure from the club's usual reluctance to engage heavily in the winter transfer market. ""We've spoken about doing something,"" Guardiola revealed. ""But it has to be for the long term, not just for four or five months. Historically, we haven't done much business in January, but the circumstances this season have been special."" Guardiola referenced Aymeric Laporte's signing in January 2018 as a rare exception and underscored the challenges of making impactful signings mid-season. ""Teams don't want to sell, and prices are high,"" he noted. One potential hurdle for City is the ongoing investigation into alleged breaches of Premier League financial regulations. While the club faces 115 charges, Guardiola expressed uncertainty over whether this could impact recruitment plans. As City prepare for their trip to Villa Park, the focus remains on turning their season around. Guardiola's faith in Haaland and the team's ability to rediscover their rhythm will be crucial as they navigate this critical period.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Read More |  Ruben Dias ruled out for four weeks as Manchester City suffer fresh injury blowMust Watch

Although Jadeja did not make a significant impact with the ball at the Gabba, his batting contributions proved to be crucial for India in getting a hard-fought draw to keep the series level. Jadeja played a key role with the bat in the first innings, scoring a vital 77 runs off 123 balls while batting at No.7. His 67-run partnership with KL Rahul helped stabilise India’s innings and ensured a competitive total, which played a significant part in securing a draw against Australia. Speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of the Boxing Day Test, he explained how he had prepared for the Gabba Test even better after not being named in the India eleven for Perth and Adelaide. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard ""The first two Tests I didn’t play, but it gave me an opportunity to practice and get used to the conditions. All the time, I got to understand the conditions, bowl on these pitches and bat on these pitches, it made me familiar with these conditions. All the hard work in the nets helped me in the match,"" Jadeja added. With his long-time spin-bowling partner Ravichandran Ashwin announcing his retirement after the Gabba Test, Jadeja now shoulders the primary spin-bowling duties for the team. Jadeja’s role will also be pivotal in the Sydney Test, which traditionally offers assistance to spinners. His vast experience in similar conditions makes him a key player for skipper Rohit Sharma as India looks to build on the momentum gained from the Gabba Test draw.  Heading into the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, India is likely to depend heavily on Jadeja’s all-round abilities. His experience with both bat and ball will be crucial in maintaining balance within the team, particularly with Washington Sundar being the only other full-time spin option available. As the Border-Gavaskar Trophy progresses, Jadeja’s performances will be central to India’s plans. His ability to contribute in all facets of the game is expected to play a major role in shaping the team’s success in the remainder of the series.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Nathan McSweeney 'devastated' as Boxing Day Test dream shattered

Jadeja's remarks come ahead of the Boxing Day Test, scheduled in Melbourne from December 26. The five-match Test series is currently tied at 1-1 after the rain-hit third Test in Brisbane ended in a draw.  The highly anticipated BGT series has seen its fair share of drama. India started on a high note, securing a commanding 295-run victory in the first Test at the Optus Stadium, with stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah leading from the front. However, Australia bounced back in style, claiming a comprehensive 10-wicket win in the second Test, a day-night affair at the Adelaide Oval.  Speaking at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) ahead of the fourth Test, Jadeja highlighted the importance of staying focused on the task at hand. ""We are in a good position, after three matches, it's still 1-1. It is going to be interesting. Even if we win one match out of the next two, we will retain the series because we have won the last two times here. It's a good opportunity to push ourselves and do well in Melbourne. Yes, we will worry about the last match later, the focus now is on the Boxing Day Test. It's a crucial game for us,"" Jadeja said. The third Test in Brisbane saw Australia dominate the first two days. Batting first, they posted an imposing total of 445, driven by centuries from Travis Head and Steve Smith. India, on the back foot with the bat, appeared set for a potential defeat. However, rain interruptions and a valiant lower-order effort ensured the match ended in a draw. The stage is now set for the fourth Test, starting on Boxing Day (December 26). Both teams will look to seize the advantage in what promises to be another gripping contest. This match holds added significance as it could potentially determine the series winner and play a pivotal role in shaping the teams' paths to the ICC World Test Championship final. India will aim to capitalise on their resilience, while Australia will look to regain momentum.

The decision to exclude McSweeney after just three Test matches has drawn mixed reactions from fans and former cricketers alike. Despite the disappointment, McSweeney vowed to work on his game and fight his way back into the national team. The 25-year-old, who was handed the challenging role of opening the batting despite being a middle-order specialist in domestic cricket, struggled to find form. In his three matches, McSweeney managed just 72 runs in six innings, marking the lowest output for an Australian opener in their first six innings in 50 years. His difficulties were compounded as he faced some of the most lethal bowlers in India’s lineup, particularly the early brilliance of Jasprit Bumrah. Speaking to 7 News McSweeney admitted that missing out on the Boxing Day Test was a bitter pill to swallow, but he remained optimistic for a return. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard ""Yes, I mean devastated. I get the dream come true and then didn't quite work out the way I wanted it, but it's all part of it and yeah I'll get the head down and get back in the nets and work really hard and hopefully be ready to go for the next opportunity,"" Mcsweeney said.  ""I think it's the game we're in. if you don't take your opportunity and you're not performing as well as you want to, your position's never safe. So I missed out a few times with the bat and unfortunately wasn't able to take my opportunity. But yeah, as I said, I'll work really hard to make sure if the opportunity comes around again, I'm definitely ready,"" he added. McSweeney’s lack of impact, paired with senior opener Usman Khawaja’s struggles—an average of just 12 runs and a top score of 21—prompted a shake-up in Australia’s squad. However, the selectors opted to back Khawaja’s experience while dropping the young debutant. Chief selector George Bailey explained the decision to replace McSweeney with 19-year-old Sam Konstas, an attacking batter, stating that the move was aimed at adding a ""point of difference"" to the squad. Konstas has been in fine form, with standout performances in the domestic circuit, including a century in a pink-ball match against India.  Meanwhile, injuries have forced Australia to make additional changes to their squad. Josh Hazlewood’s fitness issues led to recalls for Sean Abbott and Jhye Richardson to ensure adequate cover for the fast bowlers. All-rounder Beau Webster was also brought in as Mitchell Marsh faces ongoing injury concerns. AUSTRALIA SQUAD FOR LAST 2 TESTS OF BGT 2024-25 Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.

The hearing, considered one of the most significant cases in sports law, concluded on December 9, leaving the footballing world awaiting the outcome. The backdrop to these allegations comes during a season of growing unease amongst Manchester City fans. The club’s inconsistent form across all competitions has raised concerns, and the impending verdict adds further uncertainty to their future. Guardiola, speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of their December 21 clash with Aston Villa, acknowledged the looming decision but emphasised that it remains external to his team’s immediate focus. ""It’s going to happen in the winter time. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I know people are expecting that but I don’t know. In February, March, [maybe] will be the sentence,"" Guardiola said. ""We're in a difficult situation, but we will continue to focus on what we can control - our performance on the field...Our priority remains winning matches and maintaining our standards, regardless of the external pressures we face,"" he added. City's 115 charges include 80 alleged breaches related to financial misrepresentation and 35 for failing to cooperate with investigations. These allegations span the period from 2009 to 2018, accusing the club of providing inaccurate financial disclosures regarding sponsorship revenues and salaries. If found guilty, the reigning Premier League champions could face severe repercussions, including points deductions or even relegation to the Championship. Manchester City has consistently denied the allegations and is committed to defending its reputation. The club argues that its rise to prominence over the past decade was built on robust management, innovative strategies, and substantial investment from its ownership group. However, if the independent panel finds City guilty, it could severely tarnish the club’s legacy. City’s case aligns with a broader trend of financial scrutiny in English football. Recently, Everton faced a points deduction for breaching financial sustainability rules, while Nottingham Forest also came under investigation for irregularities. The Premier League’s increased vigilance reflects its commitment to ensuring financial fairness within its framework. As the footballing world anticipates the verdict, the implications could redefine City’s standing in the sport. From their meteoric rise to being a dominant European powerhouse under Guardiola, their legacy now hangs in the balance. Regardless of the outcome, this case serves as a critical moment in the history of financial governance within football.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Pep Guardiola backs Erling Haaland to perform if Manchester City 'play better'

They see pickleball's age and gender-agnostic inclusivity as the secret sauce behind its rapid rise, even envisioning it paddling its way to the 2032 Olympics. Vrushali, who transitioned from badminton to pickleball and rose to the top, teams up with Vanshik, a pickleball prodigy hooked on the sport since childhood, to dominate the court. Pickleball is the game everyone's talking about these days. Mixing the best bits of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, this paddle sport is on a rapid rise, and even celebrities are hopping on the bandwagon, swinging their paddles to stay fit. The game is gaining a global following, but India is quickly catching up. Just last month, tennis legend Andre Agassi also visited India to promote the sport in India. The dynamic pair recently struck gold in the 19+ open mixed doubles at the Hong Kong leg of the World Pickleball Championship, building on India's medal streak from the India leg last November, where the country claimed 28 medals, including 11 golds. Both Vrushali and Vanshik will participate in the inaugural World Pickleball League, scheduled for January 2025. While Vrushali was selected by the Bengaluru franchise during the player draft, Vanshik will represent Pune. A total of 48 players were chosen by the six teams under the close guidance of the league.

Known for her sharp anticipatory skills, Vrushali began her journey in the small town of Jalgaon, Maharashtra. Despite societal pressure to pursue a teaching career, she chose to follow her passion for sports. ""At the end of 2017, my coach Bhupendra Pal, who initially taught table tennis, introduced me to pickleball. He had seen the sport and suggested, ""Try it out; it's a good sport. If you like it, you can continue, or else leave it."" At that time, I was playing badminton and had been a university-level badminton player for four years. I decided to give pickleball a shot, and three months after starting, there was a tournament in Jalgaon. Players from various states were participating. My coach encouraged me to play, saying, ""You might perform well."" I participated and won gold in doubles and silver in mixed doubles. After that, my coach told me to continue because I was doing well, and that's how my pickleball journey began,"" Vrushali Thakare said in an exclusive interview with IndiaToday.in.

 However, starting from a remote area was not without its challenges. ""Coming from a remote area, we faced significant challenges. We didn't have paddles or balls. Our coach had wooden paddles made by a carpenter, which didn't even have proper grips and were hard to hold. Balls weren't available in India then, so we used smiley balls to play. Thankfully, our college had two badminton courts. We lowered the nets and used them for pickleball. Today, the situation has improved. Wooden paddles are available for as little as Rs 250, and a ball can last a week on a decent surface. So now, even kids in remote areas can afford to play pickleball,""Vrushali explained. In 2021, Vrushali and her mixed doubles partner Ajay Choudhary established the Thakare Pickleball Academy in Pune. With two courts funded from their own earnings, the academy has since trained over 200 players, including five juniors who represented India at the Junior Championship in Vietnam. "" At that time, pickleball was relatively unknown in the city, and there weren't any courts. We invested our earnings from pickleball to build two courts and began training players. In just two years, we coached over 200 players, including five juniors who were selected to represent India in the Junior Championship in Vietnam. It's been incredible to see the sport grow and gain recognition. Pickleball is a sport for everyone. At our academy, we've trained players as young as five and as old as 80. I remember a 72-year-old woman from a nearby building who used to watch the games. She was so inspired that she decided to join us, saying, ""I want to learn and play too."" Vrushali explains how the Indian Pickleball Association (IPA) has played a key role in promoting the sport nationwide, organizing tournaments and providing players with essential resources. As pickleball rapidly gains popularity, with tennis courts in housing societies being converted for the game, it mirrors the sport's growth in the US. With this momentum, pickleball could soon rank among India's top sports. ""The Indian Pickleball Association (IPA) has played a significant role in the sport's growth. When I started, IPA was already organizing tournaments, providing exposure and experience for players. Today, they continue to support players with equipment and resources. Their efforts have been instrumental in popularising pickleball across India."" ""Pickleball is growing rapidly in India, just as it has in the US. In many housing societies, tennis courts are being converted into pickleball courts. With such expansion, I believe pickleball can become the second or third most popular sport in India in the next five years. To aspiring players, I would say: play because you enjoy it. If you love the sport, it will give back to you in ways you can't imagine. Whether it's pickleball or any other sport, passion and joy will take you far.""VANSHIK HOPES PICKLEBALL REACHES OLYMPICS At just 19 years old, Vanshik Kapadia made a formidable presence in pickleball. Transitioning from tennis, a sport he began playing at the age of six, Vanshik found his true calling in pickleball in 2018. Today, he holds the prestigious rank of No. 1 in both Asia and India. Reflecting on his journey, Vanshik shared, ""I started playing pickleball when I was six years old, and in 2018, I began playing professionally. My journey began at my home club, Khar Gymkhana, where I hit my first pickleball shot. It was my dad who introduced me to the sport, and from that moment, there was no looking back. I fell in love with pickleball the instant I played my first shot. That's how it all started, and I decided then and there that this was the path I wanted to pursue."" Despite competing on the global stage, Vanshik's calm and focused demeanour sets him apart. ""I don't see pressure as a hindrance. It's all about focusing on what's within your control. External factors are just distractions,"" he explained.

Despite Kohli’s long-awaited century in India’s victory in the Perth Test, the star batter has struggled to replicate that form in the subsequent two matches. Bangar, speaking to Star Sports, emphasised that Kohli needs to remain patient and cautious while batting at Melbourne, especially given his struggles with deliveries outside the off-stump. Australian bowlers have consistently troubled Kohli by exploiting this weakness, a strategy that has yielded results throughout the series. | Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage | ""Sometimes you need to keep your status as a batter in control a little. When you surrender slightly to the game, spend a little time, ease out in the middle for some time, wait for the bowler to come to you, and do not go yourself towards the bowler, that's the sign of a big player,"" Bangar said. ""Play as many balls as possible close to your front pad and then the runs will flow because it's not that he hasn't scored runs. He scored a century three innings ago and in the series before that, he played a 70-run knock against New Zealand in Bengaluru,"" he added. Kohli’s numbers in the series so far underline his struggles: he has accumulated just 126 runs across six innings at an average of 30. Excluding his hundred in Perth, he managed only 26 runs in his remaining five innings. This inconsistent form has sparked concerns among fans, who anticipated Kohli playing a pivotal role in conditions where he has historically thrived. Melbourne Cricket Ground, however, remains a promising venue for Kohli to rediscover his best form. The batter has amassed 316 runs at an average of 52.66 at this venue, including a memorable 169-run knock during the Boxing Day Test in 2014. With India needing a strong batting performance to regain momentum, Kohli will look to draw inspiration from his past successes at the iconic ground. India’s drawn Gabba Test showcased resilience, but the batting failures of experienced players like Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma remain a significant concern. With the Border-Gavaskar Trophy level at 1-1, the Boxing Day Test is a crucial fixture. India’s chances of sealing a spot in the World Test Championship Final hinge on their ability to secure a positive result in Melbourne. Bangar’s advice underscores the importance of Kohli’s role in this high-stakes encounter. The star batter’s ability to adapt and deliver under pressure could be the difference-maker in a series that has already witnessed intense battles between two of the world’s top Test sides.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  I got to know R Ashwin was retiring 5 minutes before he announced it: Ravindra Jadeja

Now the Australian press have accused spinner Ravindra Jadeja of refusing to answer questions in English. Notably, Jadeja addressed the media after India's first practice session at the MCG. The press conference proceeded smoothly until Jadeja concluded the session and decided to return to practice. At this point, an Australian journalist expressed frustration, displaying anger over Jadeja not answering any questions in English. India's media manager attempted to explain that the press conference was organised primarily for the Indian media, but the Australian journalist appeared unwilling to accept this clarification. The reporter was seen lashing out at the India team media manager, further escalating the situation. Australian media: One question in English?  Team manager: sorry, we don't have time now. You can see the team bus is waiting.  Aussie media: Can't we take one question in English? Manager: This was organised mainly for the travelling Indian media.  Aussie media: The organisation is hopeless. This is not the first time tensions have flared between Indian players and the Australian media. The press in Australia has a history of creating narratives that put Indian cricketers under scrutiny, often playing the role of the ""12th man"" in favour of their team. Earlier in the series, Virat Kohli confronted the Australian media for invading his privacy at Melbourne airport. Channel 7 cameras, which were initially covering Australian pacer Scott Boland, shifted their focus to Kohli and his family, prompting the cricketer to demand respect for his personal space. The matter was resolved amicably after assurances were given that his children were not being filmed. Incidents like the infamous ""Monkeygate"" scandal in 2008 and frequent press-driven altercations underscore the contentious relationship between the Australian media and Indian players. These controversies often surface during high-stakes matches, adding fuel to the already intense rivalry. With the series tied at 1-1, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has already seen its share of on-field drama.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Read More |  Robin Uthappa in trouble after arrest warrant over PF Fraud allegations

 Sixes was co-founded by Calum Mackinnon and Andy Waugh, the creative minds behind the Scottish restaurant and butcher chain Mac & Wild. The first Sixes location launched in Fulham in December 2020, with a focus on combining food, drink, and cricket in a way that resonates with both fans and newcomers. ""More people now play cricket at Sixes in the UK than actually play the sport itself,"" Mackinnon stated, highlighting the rapid growth of the brand. Four years since its inception, Sixes boasts 18 locations across the UK, with plans to add another 20-30 venues domestically and expand into the Caribbean and the US. The company has received approximately 1,500 franchise requests, primarily from the US, demonstrating the appeal of its ""competitive socialising"" concept. REDEFINING SOCIALISING Sixes is part of a broader trend in the UK's entertainment scene, where traditional sports are reimagined for a social setting. This movement began with ventures like bowling and cocktails at All Star Lanes in 2006, followed by table tennis at Bounce, darts at Flight Club, mini-golf at Puttshack, and F1 Arcade. Sixes adds cricket to this lineup, offering a high-tech, fun-filled environment for players to enjoy.

Players score runs by hitting targets around the cage, choosing from three game modes, including a Hundred version developed in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board. Six difficulty levels ensure that the experience caters to all abilities, from casual participants to seasoned players. WINNING OVER NEW AUDIENCE With a customer base that's 54% in their 20s and 35% female, Sixes is appealing to a demographic that traditional cricket has struggled to engage. Co-founder Mackinnon, a cricket convert himself, believes in the potential of Sixes to bridge the gap between socialising and sport. ""We're two Scots who never played or watched cricket in our lives,"" he said. ""Now we're huge fans, attending matches and truly appreciating the game."" As Sixes continues to grow, its fusion of cricket, cuisine, and camaraderie is redefining how people experience the sport, bringing a fresh energy to the cricketing world and beyond.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Read More |  Jasprit Bumrah will do a very good job: Border backs pacer to flourish as skipper

The warrant, issued by PF Regional Commissioner Shadakshari Gopal Reddy, directs the Pulakeshinagar police to take appropriate action. Uthappa, who managed a private firm called Centuries Lifestyle Brand Private Limited, is accused of deducting PF contributions from employees’ salaries but failing to deposit the amounts, leading to an alleged fraud of Rs 23 lakh. In a letter dated December 4, Commissioner Reddy instructed the police to execute the warrant. However, the warrant was returned to the PF office as Uthappa is reportedly no longer residing at his previous address. The officials stated, ""The warrant, issued on December 4, has been returned after Mr. Uthappa was found not to be at the Pulakeshinagar residence."" The former Indian opening batsman and his family are reportedly living in Dubai. The warrant noted that the failure to remit the dues has prevented the PF office from settling the accounts of the affected workers. It directed the police to arrest Robin Uthappa and return the warrant by December 27. Uthappa, who represented India in 59 international matches, was a prominent player in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Over his cricket career, he scored 1,183 runs in 54 ODI innings, including seven half-centuries. In the IPL, Uthappa played for teams such as Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Mumbai Indians. He was part of KKR's winning squad in 2014 and was known for his aggressive batting style. Authorities are now working to trace Uthappa’s whereabouts to proceed with the investigation and ensure legal compliance.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Pickleball can make it to Olympics: India's Vrushali, Vanshik relish sport's boomMust Watch

A prominent figure in the world of lucha libre, Mysterio Sr. was the uncle of WWE Hall of Famer Rey Mysterio Jr. and the great uncle of WWE superstar Dominik Mysterio. His passing marks the loss of a beloved pioneer in Mexican wrestling. Mysterio Sr.’s illustrious career began in January 1976, during which he captivated audiences with his skill and charisma. A staple in several Mexican wrestling promotions, he performed for organisations such as the World Wrestling Association (WWA), Pro Wrestling Revolution, and Tijuana Wrestling. As a versatile competitor, he clinched the WWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship and held the WWA Tag Team Championship alongside his nephew, Rey Mysterio Jr., further solidifying their family legacy. To differentiate him from his nephew, Rey Mysterio Jr., he was commonly referred to as Rey Mysterio Sr. His influence extended beyond his own achievements, as he played a crucial role in mentoring and shaping the careers of Rey Mysterio Jr. and other aspiring wrestlers. Rey Misterio Sr. was also the granduncle to Dominik Mysterio, another rising WWE star, and his grandniece Aalyah, who has made occasional WWE appearances. The family’s multi-generational contributions to wrestling are a testament to the enduring legacy that Mysterio Sr. built throughout his career. Social media platforms were flooded with tributes and condolences from fans and fellow wrestlers, remembering Mysterio Sr.’s impact on the sport and his gracious spirit outside the ring. This devastating news follows the recent loss of Roberto Gutierrez, Rey Mysterio Jr.’s father and Dominik’s grandfather, who passed away on November 17 at the age of 76. In an emotional tribute to his father, Rey Mysterio Jr. shared on Instagram: ""You did more than set the example of how to love and maintain a strong marriage and father 4 boys. You were the example, and passed every single time... until your death with flying colours."" “You are with God now and smiling from the heavens while we continue with the real struggle of life until we see again. You will never be forgotten and will always be loved, RIP Pops,"" he added. The wrestling community mourns the passing of Rey Mysterio Sr., a trailblazer whose influence will resonate for generations to come.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Pickleball can make it to Olympics: India's Vrushali, Vanshik relish sport's boom

This was Konstas's final innings in the Big Bash League before his anticipated Test debut on Boxing Day at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The 19-year-old prodigy, playing his first match since being included in Australia’s Test squad, attempted to cut a short delivery from Akeal Hosein but chopped it onto his stumps. The dismissal contrasted sharply with his sensational debut just five days earlier, where he smashed the fastest half-century in Sydney Thunder’s history against the Adelaide Strikers. Konstas earned a spot in the Test squad after replacing Nathan McSweeney and is widely expected to don the Baggy Green in the highly anticipated Boxing Day Test against India. His selection follows a remarkable domestic season, highlighted by a record-breaking performance in the Sheffield Shield, where he became the youngest player since Ricky Ponting to score twin centuries in a match. Earlier this month, Konstas made headlines with a blistering 107 against an Indian attack missing Jasprit Bumrah and followed it up with a composed 88 against Western Australia. His exploits have drawn praise from cricketing legends and analysts alike, with former England captain Michael Vaughan hailing him as “fearless” and “unflappable.” If Konstas takes the field at the MCG, he will face one of the sternest challenges in world cricket. India’s pace spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, has been a nightmare for Australian batters this summer, with 53 career wickets in Australia at an average of 17.15—the best by any overseas bowler with 50 or more wickets Down Under. Despite the daunting task, Konstas enters the Test arena with 718 first-class runs at an average of 42.23 from 11 matches. His ability to deliver under pressure and adapt to different formats sets him apart. England’s World Cup-winning coach and Sydney Thunder mentor, Trevor Bayliss, spoke highly of Konstas, likening his self-confidence to that of David Warner, Steve Smith, and Michael Clarke. “Sam has a self-confidence you don’t see in very many. I’ve only seen it a few over the years, and all of those players were outstanding Test players,” Bayliss said.

Notably, Bumrah had announced himself with a sensational debut against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the 2013 season picking 3/32 in four overs. Since then, everybody took notice of the young seamer from Gujarat as he got the prized scalp of Virat Kohli as his maiden IPL wicket. Recently, Hussey also recalled facing a young Bumrah in nets and revealed how he was tested by him. The legendary Australian batter mentioned how Bumrah’s unusual action left him unsettled that he couldn’t even see the ball. ""I remember facing him in the nets and literally couldn't get bat on the ball. I felt like I was using a toothpick. I couldn't even see the ball, let alone pick it coming out of his hand. His action is so different, so deceptive. My first impression? I honestly didn't think he'd even make it to the crease. His run-up was staggered and awkward. I remember thinking, ‘Who is this guy?' And then suddenly, woof - the ball whistles past my eyebrows at 145kph!,” Hussey said on Willow Talk. Further speaking ahead, Hussey revealed how people felt that Bumrah was not made for Test cricket in his early days and mentioned how he’s proved everyone wrong.People said his action and run-up would be too hard on his body: Hussey ""In India, there was so much scepticism. People said his action and run-up would be too hard on his body, that he wouldn't last in Test cricket. But even back then, I could see his skills and ability. I knew that if he had the desire to play Test cricket, he could succeed. Isn't he doing it bloody well at the moment? It's just phenomenal to see how he's grown. Watching him transform from a kid in the nets who terrified us to one of the best bowlers in the world has been incredible,” he added. Bumrah made his Test debut in 2018 and became the leader of the Indian pace attack within a year. He’s scalped 194 wickets from 43 matches so far at an average of 19.52 which is only second best to Sydney Barnes among bowlers with over 150 Test wickets. The India speedster is the current number ranked bowler in Test cricket with 890 ratings to his name.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja confident India can complete BGT hat-trick in Australia

The son of England international George Senior, Eastham was a midfielder and inside forward who played for Newcastle United, Arsenal, and Stoke City in the English top-flight league during a professional career spanning two decades. He earned 19 caps for England. Renowned for his lethal left foot and creativity, Eastham is regarded as a legend at Stoke City. He famously scored the winning goal in the 1972 League Cup final, securing the club's first major trophy with a 2-1 victory over Chelsea. Over eight seasons, Eastham made 194 league appearances for Stoke and later managed the club from 1977 to 1978. Born in Blackpool, Eastham is also remembered for his pivotal role in challenging the old 'retain and transfer' system, which allowed clubs to keep a player's registration to prevent them from leaving. When his contract with Newcastle expired in 1959, Eastham went on an eight-month strike to force the club to let him join Arsenal.

— Stoke City FC (@stokecity) December 21, 2024 He also took the matter to the High Court, where a judge ruled the'retain and transfer' system unreasonable. This landmark case led to significant reforms in the British transfer market, including the establishment of a tribunal to resolve disputes. In 1973, Eastham was honoured with the title of Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his contributions to football. As a mark of respect, Stoke City players will wear black armbands during their Championship game against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday, the club announced. ""The Stoke City family is immensely saddened by the passing of club legend George Eastham OBE at the age of 88,"" his former club said upon announcing his death on their website. ""George was signed by the Potters for a £35,000 fee shortly after being part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad. He went on to represent the club for eight seasons in the top division of the English game and was a two-time FA Cup semi-finalist in red and white.  ""He is perhaps best remembered as the man whose goal secured the 1972 League Cup in a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Wembley. The Potters will wear black armbands for the fixture against Sheffield Wednesday [on Saturday] as a mark of respect. Our thoughts are with George's family and friends at this difficult time.""

He hit a 35-ball hundred to register the overall 3rd fastest ton in List A matches. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/anmolpreet-singh-breaks-14-year-old-record-hits-fastest-list-a-century-by-an-indian-2653425-2024-12-21,"Anmolpreet Singh, the Punjab top-order batter, scripted his name in cricketing history by scoring the fastest List A century by an Indian. His explosive 35-ball hundred during the Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad, shattered Yusuf Pathan’s 14-year-old record. Pathan had previously held the record for his 40-ball century against Maharashtra in 2009.   The record-breaking knock placed Anmolpreet third on the all-time list for the fastest List A centuries, behind Jake Fraser-McGurk (29 balls) and AB de Villiers (31 balls). Fraser-McGurk’s record-breaking innings came earlier this year during the Marsh Cup in Australia, while De Villiers’ 31-ball effort remains the fastest in ODIs.  Anmolpreet Singh creates history Walking in at No. 3 after the early dismissal of captain Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet launched a relentless assault on Arunachal Pradesh’s bowling attack. His innings was studded with 12 boundaries and nine towering sixes, showcasing his ability to dominate both pace and spin. He particularly targeted off-spinner Techi Neri, smashing 31 runs in a single over. By the time Anmolpreet reached his hundred, Punjab were well on their way to a commanding victory. Anmolpreet remained unbeaten on 115 off just 45 balls, as Punjab chased down a modest target of 165 in just 12.5 overs, securing a dominant nine-wicket win. Prabhsimran Singh provided support with a steady 35 off 25 balls, forging an unbroken 153-run stand for the second wicket with Anmolpreet.   Earlier in the match, Arunachal Pradesh struggled against Punjab’s disciplined bowling attack, managing only 164 in their 50 overs. Mayank Markande and Ashwani Kumar were the pick of the bowlers with three wickets each, while Baltej Singh claimed two scalps. Techi Neri (42) and Hardik Varma (38) were the only notable contributors for Arunachal.   Anmolpreet’s stunning performance not only cemented his place in the record books but also reminded cricket fans of his immense potential as he went unsold in the IPL 2025 auction. Despite his moderate returns in the IPL with Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad, this knock could reignite his career and open doors for future opportunities.

Following a commanding 3-0 victory over Pachuca in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup final, Ancelotti secured his record-breaking 15th trophy with Los Blancos. The triumph highlighted a remarkable managerial career that spans two successful spells at the club, first from 2013-2015 and again from 2021-present.   Ancelotti's impressive haul with Madrid includes three UEFA Champions League titles, two La Liga crowns, two Copa del Reys, two Spanish Supercopas, three UEFA Super Cups, two Club World Cups, and now the Intercontinental Cup. The Italian tactician surpassed the late Miguel Muñoz, who previously held the record with 14 trophies, including nine La Liga titles and two European Cups, during his time as Madrid's manager from 1959 to 1974. “It is an honour and a pleasure to have been able to achieve this success,” said Ancelotti. “I have to share it with the club, first because it gave me the opportunity to return, and second because it has allowed me to coach players of a very high technical level. That has been the key,” he added.

India also racked up their highest T20I score of 217 for four with Richa Ghosh smashing the joint-fastest fifty off 18 balls. For the ODI series, India have given a call-up to Delhi batter Pratika Rawal, who was the second-highest run-scorer in the previous edition of the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy. The 24-year-old scored 411 runs from eight games at an average of 68.50 and a strike-rate of 91.94.

Recently, the 19-year-old shared his thoughts on his Test call up on the sidelines of the Big Bash League (BBL) Match 8 between Sydney Thunder and Sydney Sixers.

Leading Uttar Pradesh in the men’s Under-23 State A Trophy match against Tripura, Rizvi scored an unbeaten 201 off just 97 balls. His blistering knock included 13 fours and 20 towering sixes, leaving the Tripura bowlers in tatters. Rizvi walked in to bat in the 23rd over and single-handedly propelled his team to an imposing total of 405 runs. While this incredible feat doesn’t qualify as a List A record, Rizvi’s knock remains extraordinary. The record for the fastest double century in List A cricket is currently held by New Zealand’s Chad Bowes, who broke the joint record of India’s Narayan Jagadeesan and Australia’s Travis Head. Both Jagadeesan and Head achieved the milestone in 114 balls during the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Marsh Cup, respectively. Rizvi’s innings, despite not being officially listed, stands out for its sheer brutality and remarkable pace.Sameer Rizvi shines in domestic cricket In the IPL 2025 mega auction, Rizvi was picked up by the Delhi Capitals for Rs 95 lakh, marking a significant drop from the previous season, where Chennai Super Kings signed him for a whopping Rs 8.4 crore. Often compared to Suresh Raina for his aggressive batting style, Rizvi had an underwhelming debut IPL season, managing just 51 runs across five innings at a strike rate of 118.60. CSK chose not to retain the uncapped player for Rs 4 crore, opting to release him instead. However, Rizvi’s recent performances suggest a turnaround in form. In addition to his double century, he has delivered two back-to-back stellar knocks, scoring 153 in one match and an unbeaten 137 in another. These explosive innings underline his potential as a match-winner and justify the Delhi Capitals’ decision to invest in him. With his current purple patch, Rizvi looks set to be a vital asset for the Delhi Capitals in the upcoming IPL season and a player to watch in Indian domestic cricket.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Anmolpreet Singh breaks 14-year-old record, hits fastest List A century by an IndianMust Watch

Head has been instrumental in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, already amassing two centuries in Adelaide and Brisbane, showcasing his adaptability and skill on challenging pitches. However, this resurgence wasn’t always on the cards. Head endured a tough phase early in his career, including being dropped from the Australian squad ahead of the Sydney Test during the BGT 2020/21, after his dismal performance in th Boxing Day Test. Head subsequently lost his national contract. Reflecting on his journey, Head identified his time with Sussex on England's county circuit as a turning point. Playing in different conditions allowed him to refine his approach, leading to a better understanding of his strengths and limitations. ""I lost my (national) contract, and then I went to Sussex and stunk it up there as well...I tried to keep batting the way I was batting and it wasn't working,"" Head said. ""Then in one of my last games at Sussex I got 49 off 46 in the second innings and I thought, 'F**k this, I am just going to slog...And I did well, so I thought, 'Why don't I just do that?',"" he added. Since his return to the Australian side, Head has been a consistent performer, rewriting his narrative as one of the team’s most dependable batters. In 33 Tests since his comeback, he has averaged 46.71 and recorded nine centuries. Furthermore, he has been named Player of the Match eight times during this period, underlining his impact on Australia’s success. In the current Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Head’s contributions have been outstanding. After three Tests, he has compiled 409 runs at an impressive average of 81.80, including consecutive centuries that turned the tide for Australia in Adelaide and Brisbane. His ability to balance aggression with composure has made him a key figure in Australia’s batting lineup. As the series stands level at 1-1, the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne holds immense significance for both sides as they vie for a spot in the World Test Championship Final. For Head, it’s another opportunity to solidify his place as a match-winner. His form and confidence make him arguably Australia’s most pivotal player heading into this crucial encounter. Head’s journey, marked by resilience and self-discovery, epitomizes the value of adaptation and perseverance, ensuring he remains a cornerstone of Australia’s Test aspirations.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Did Ravindra Jadeja snub English questions at MCG?

Notably, Kohli hasn’t been in the best of forms in recent times having scored just 21 runs in the last three innings after his hundred in the first Test against Australia in Perth. The former India captain has suffered a massive decline in his performances since 2020 with just three hundreds to his name in the last four years and has accumulated just 1964 runs from 65 innings at an average of 31.67. Recently, Greg Chappell analyzed Kohli’s recent performances and mentioned that he’s shown signs of EPDS due to the tendency of beginning his innings tentatively.  “The first visible sign of EPDS is a subtle but unmistakable shift in a player’s approach at the crease. Kohli, once renowned for his domineering starts, has in recent years shown a tendency to begin tentatively,” Chappell wrote in his column for The Sydney Morning Herald. Chappell also said that Kohli’s poor form is much like legendary cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting and suggested that he needs a buffer of 20-30 runs to rediscover his flow at the crease. “Much like Tendulkar and Ponting before him, Kohli seems to need a buffer – a score of 20 or 30 – before he can rediscover his flow. Reaching a score of 20 or 30 acts as a psychological turning point, helping them regain the confidence and fluency of their prime,"" he added.Kohli's weakness being exploited by Australian bowlers Kohli’s weakness outside the off stump has been exploited by Australian bowlers throughout the series as he’s constantly got out in a similar fashion. The star batter worked to correct his mistake ahead of the third Test in Brisbane but once again ended up chasing a widish delivery which went straight into Alex Carey’s gloves. Hence, Kohli is yet to put his past mistakes behind him as he heads into the fourth Test in Melbourne. Having not been able to have a massive impact in the series so far, there is massive uncertainty about his future in the Test team and if India doesn’t make it to the World Test Championship (WTC) final, some tough decisions are likely to be on the cards.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja confident India can complete BGT hat-trick in Australia

The Afghanistan team registered their 6th consecutive white-ball series victory this year. Winning the toss, Afghanistan opted to bowl first and their decision paid off instantly. The bowlers struck early, reducing Zimbabwe to 38/3 in the power-play. The hosts showed little intent, which allowed Afghanistan to dictate terms. Zimbabwe's senior players, Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza, tried to stabilise the innings. However, Rashid Khan's introduction proved decisive as he dismissed Raza and further dented the hosts' fragile batting lineup. The star of the innings was Allah Ghazanfar, whose mystery spin left Zimbabwe's batters clueless. Bowling a remarkable ten-over spell, Ghazanfar picked up a five-wicket haul, dismantling the middle and lower order. Only Williams displayed some resistance with a well-made fifty, but his departure, attempting to accelerate, sealed Zimbabwe’s fate.

— Afghanistan Cricket Board (@ACBofficials) December 21, 2024 Chasing a modest target, Afghanistan’s batters displayed maturity and composure. Zimbabwe's seamers, led by Richard Ngarava, started well by exploiting the swinging conditions. Abdul Malik struggled at the crease but managed to hold one end for a while. On the other hand, Sediqullah Atal continued his impressive run of form, playing with confidence and composure. The southpaw rotated the strike well and punished loose deliveries, reaching a fine fifty before falling to a stunning catch by Bennett. By the time Malik was dismissed, Afghanistan were well in control. Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi and Rahmat Shah ensured no further hiccups as they stitched a steady partnership to chase down the target with ease. Afghanistan secured a comprehensive 8-wicket victory, wrapping up the series in style. For Zimbabwe, it was another disappointing outing with the bat. Only four players managed to reach double figures. The hosts need to address their batting woes as they look forward to the upcoming Boxing Day Test in Bulawayo, marking the first such game in Zimbabwe since 1996. Afghanistan’s consistent performances bode well for their preparations ahead of the Champions Trophy, as they continue to uncover exciting talents like Atal and Ghazanfar.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Jasprit Bumrah and Co. engage in hardcore bowling practice before Boxing Day Test

On the first ball of the 12th over, Thunder captain Moises Henriques charged down the track against Nathan McAndrew and called Jack Edwards for a quick single. However, Warner, who was stationed at cover, quickly ran in and collected the ball and hit the stumps at the striker’s end.

The former India skipper’s weakness outside the off stump has been exposed by Australian bowlers time and again as he’s repeatedly got out edging the ball to slips or to wicketkeeper. Despite Kohli’s woes, Chetan Sharma has backed him to go big in the last two Tests against Australia as he’s expecting two more centuries from his bat. ""He is a player who has achieved so much for us, which raises our expectations. I am confident he will perform well. Let's hope he scores two more centuries in the next two matches.

The India skipper has given up his opening slot to KL Rahul, who performed exceptionally in the series opener in Perth in his absence. However, the sudden shift in the batting order hasn’t worked well for the India skipper, who’s found it hard to get going lower down the order. Recently, Sanjay Bangar came up with an advice for the India captain and suggested that he could come in to bat at number three. ""That is a mantra for any batter. I feel he can do two things. One, can he come to bat at No. 3 because if we have to strengthen our bowling a little and add a little sharpness, he can definitely change his number,"" Bangar told Star Sports. Further speaking ahead, Bangar also mentioned how Rohit looked a bit late to reach the ball, which has averted him to play his favourite pull shot. ""Apart from that, prepare yourself a little early. It seems like he is getting slightly late and he is also getting late because we saw his bat not going forward for his favorite pull shot. He generally doesn't miss the pull shot. It's a signal for every batter whether he is playing his best shot or not,"" he added.Rohit's poor form in current Test season Rohit had a good beginning to 2024 as he scored 400 runs in the five-match series against England. The opening batter scored two centuries and one half century across five games. However, he failed to continue his form in the recent home season and has scored just 152 runs in the last seven Tests at an average of 11.69 with just one fifty to his name.

Nonetheless, the Women in Blue triumphed 2-1, with Smriti Mandhana stepping up as captain and leading the team with three consecutive fifties in Harmanpreet's absence. “Harmanpreet is going to bat today in the nets... a complete, full nets schedule. We’ll take a call once the nets are over, and I’m sure she’ll be fine,” Muzumdar stated during the pre-series press conference. IND-W vs WI-W ODI series: All you need to know The coach acknowledged that the team will feel the absence of young wicketkeeper-batter Yastika Bhatia, who is sidelined due to injury, during the three-match ODI series. However, he assured that the management would focus on selecting the best eleven from the 15-member squad. “Yes, we will feel the absence of some players. Yastika Bhatia is injured, she is doing rehab at NCA. Hopefully, she will be fit and fine very soon.

 Rahul has re-established himself as the first-choice opening batter in Test cricket. The Karnataka batsman was initially picked in the 18-man squad for a middle-order role, but Rohit Sharma's absence in the series opener in Perth forced the management to play Rahul at the top. Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal impressed at the top of the order, combining for a match-winning 201-run partnership in the second innings of the first Test in Perth. Rahul contributed with a gritty 77, playing a pivotal role in India's victory. Even after Rohit Sharma returned for the second Test in Adelaide, KL Rahul continued to open alongside Jaiswal. Rohit moved to No. 6 but has struggled in the lower middle order. Meanwhile, Rahul strengthened his reputation at the top with a match-saving 84 in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Robin Uthappa breaks silence after arrest warrant over PF fraud allegationMust Watch

Notably, Ashwin recently announced his retirement from international cricket after the third Test against Australia in Brisbane. The off spinner finished his career as India’s second-highest wicket taker in both Tests (537 wickets) and overall in international cricket (765 wickets). However, Ashwin’s sudden retirement in the middle of the series raised many eyebrows. Aakash Chopra also shared his opinion on the matter and said that the veteran spinner may have been frustrated by being continuously overlooked in overseas conditions by the team management. ""What exactly has happened? There is a moment in everyone's life, where you think, do I want to do this anymore? Am I OK with it? Ashwin must have had this in his mind for a long time that he does not play much overseas. He is not the no.1 spin option when it comes to overseas games. This was going on for quite some time. He made peace with it. Jaddu was always ahead of him overseas. So, he made peace with it that Jadeja is playing,” said Chopra on his Youtube Channel. Further speaking ahead, Chopra also mentioned that being put even below Washington Sundar in the pecking order might’ve triggered Ashwin’s retirement decision. “But when Sundar played the Perth Test, then he said, that's it, I am done. Ashwin played the Pink-ball Test but when he was dropped from Gabba, he said, he was done. You are not serious in playing me in the XI. I did nothing wrong in Pink-ball Test to be dropped from the Gabba game. In Gabba, Jaddu made runs so Ashwin was unlikely to feature in Melbourne,” he added.Ashwin's dismal show in home series vs New Zealand Sundar played ahead of Ashwin and Jadeja in the first Test against Australia in Perth and picked two wickets along with registering scores of 4 and 29 across two innings. Sundar also outperformed both senior spinners in the recent home series against New Zealand as he scalped 16 wickets from just two matches at an average of 14.12. On the other hand, Ashwin had his second-worst performance in a home Test series with nine wickets from three matches at an average of 41.22 while Jadeja also picked 16 wickets from three matches. Hence, being outperformed by his peers in the conditions he’s dominated throughout his life mustn’t have gone down well with the Indian spinner, which could well have triggered his retirement call.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja confident India can complete BGT hat-trick in Australia

The 13-year-year-old achieved the feat during Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Group E match in the Vijay Hazare Trophy 20234-25 on Saturday, December 21 at NexGen Cricket Ground, Hyderabad. At the age of 13 years and 269 days, Suryavanshi broke the record of Ali Akbar who made his List A debut at the age of 14 years and 51 days for Vidarbha during the 1999/2000 season. He's already the youngest Indian to make his Ranji Trophy debut and also to play at the Under 19 level. However, Suryavanshi didn’t have a memorable outing on his List A debut as he got out on just the second ball of his innings by Aryan Pandey after scoring a boundary off the first one. Being put in to bat first, Bihar were bundled out for 196 in 46.4 overs with Bipin Saurabh (50 off 54) and captain Sakibul Gani (48 off 62) being the top scorers. In reply, Madhya Pradesh comfortably chased down the target in 25.1 overs as Harsh Gawli played a brilliant match-winning innings of 83 off 63 balls. As a result, Madhya Pradesh won the match by six wickets and Suryavanshi didn’t have a great beginning to his List-A career. However, the teen prodigy has been making headlines both on and off the field in recent times as he recently became the youngest player to be sold at the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction. The 13-year-old was bought for Rs 1.10 Crore by the Rajasthan Royals (RR) where he will work under the guidance of the legendary India cricketer and head coach Rahul Dravid.Suryavanshi's marvellous performance in Under 19 Asia Cup After a record-breaking IPL deal, Suryavanshi impressed everyone with his batting exploits in the recent Under-19 Asia Cup, where he finished as the second-highest run scorer for India. The Bihar-born cricketer scored 176 runs from five innings at an average of 44 and a strike rate of 145.45 with two half centuries to his name. Suryavanshi played belligerent innings of 76* (46) vs UAE and 67 (36) vs Sri Lanka as he put his wide array of strokes on display. Meanwhile, the youngster will be eager to bounce back to form in the remaining games of the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy and help his team win the title.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja confident India can complete BGT hat-trick in Australia

He is expected to return to action in the Boxing Day Test against India, scheduled to start on December 26 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. On December 7, Head dedicated his sensational Adelaide century to Harrison. Scoring a fantastic hundred at his home ground, the southpaw celebrated his milestone in the presence of his wife and kids.

Head's record vs India While concerns arose over a groin injury during the third Test at Gabba, Head assured fans of his fitness for the fourth Test. ""Very pleased with the way I am batting at the moment. Just a little sore, but I should be fine,"" said Head after winning the Player of the Match award in the drawn Brisbane Test. Shastri, who served as India men’s head coach from 2017 to 2021, referred to Head’s “new surname” to describe the form the Australian batter is in. “Because his new surname is Travis Head’ache’. They are looking for balms in India. For foot problems, ankle problems (and) even a headache, they are looking for a balm. He is ideal for that,” Shastri said on The ICC Review. Shastri said that Head has upped his game over the last three years and has transformed himself into someone who is hard to contain. “I think he is very smart. From what I saw of him three years ago, he has improved immensely. Especially with the way he plays the short ball. He prepared to leave it. He has learned to leave it well at times,” Shastri said. “I think he is very smart. From what I saw of him three years ago, he has improved immensely. Especially with the way he plays the short ball.

This victory marks Usyk's second consecutive win over Fury, following his split-decision triumph in May that made him the undisputed heavyweight champion. The 37-year-old Usyk’s performance was a repeat of his May victory over Fury, where he became the undisputed heavyweight champion. Although 36-year-old Fury showed improvement from their first encounter, including a strong start, he could not find a way to solve Usyk's elusive style. Despite giving up advantages in height, weight, and reach to the much larger Fury, Usyk demonstrated exceptional skill and movement throughout the bout. Fury, who weighed in at a career-high 281 pounds (127kg), 55 pounds (25kg) heavier than Usyk, started strong but was ultimately unable to overcome the Ukrainian's strategic boxing. Fury attempted to control the centre of the ring with his jab, but Usyk effectively countered by ducking inside and unleashing combinations. Fury briefly had success in the fifth and sixth rounds, landing hard body shots, but Usyk’s sharp counters and strategic movement took over, particularly in the later rounds. By the 10th round, Fury was noticeably fatigued and struggled to keep up with Usyk’s pace. Usyk closed out the final rounds with precision and intensity to secure the win. Usyk's superior movement and precise punching allowed him to dictate the fight, particularly in the later rounds. Despite a strong start to the tenth round by Fury, Usyk regained control, finishing the frame at a furious pace and cruising through the final two rounds to secure a convincing victory. In his post-fight interview, Usyk remained humble, stating, ""I win, it's good ... I'm not the judges, I'm a sportsman, I'm an athlete."" He also praised his sons, who had participated in judo competitions earlier that day. The victory was followed by a challenge from Britain's Daniel Dubois, who Usyk had defeated in August 2023. Meanwhile, Fury, visibly disappointed by his second professional loss, left the ring without giving an interview, prompting his promoter Frank Warren to express disbelief at the scoring. Warren argued that Fury had won more rounds than the judges' scorecards reflected, saying, ""How can Tyson only get four rounds in this fight? It's impossible.""Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  Liron Jaden wears the overall crown of JK Tyre Novice Cup Momentum Motorsport

Samson spoke highly of the team's tradition of picking young talents and converting them into superstars.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/ipl-2025-sanju-samson-rajasthan-royals-13-year-old-vaibhav-suryavanshi-2653606-2024-12-22,"Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson spoke highly about 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi ahead of the Indian Premier League's 2025 season. Speaking on AB de Villiers' YouTube channel, Samson said that the management watched Suryavanshi bat against Australia in the U19 Test match and wanted to have him on board. Vaibhav Suryavanshi broke into the scene with the fastest hundred by an Indian in the U19 Test, earlier in October. Playing at the MA Chidambaram Stadium smashed his hundred in just 58 balls in his maiden red-ball match for the India Under-19 team. Vaibhav Suryavanshi's 58-ball hundred was only behind former England all-rounder Moeen Ali, who hit a 56-ball hundred for England Under-19 in 2005. Vaibhav hit 14 boundaries and 4 sixes in a destructive knock. He was run out when batting on 104 in just 62 deliveries. On the back of his heroics, Suryavanshi was bought by Rajasthan for Rs 1.10 crore in the 2025 mega-auction. Sanju spoke highly of the player and said that Rajasthan had a verified history of taking in young talent and nurturing them into world-beaters. Samson gave the example of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel as he spoke highly about the team's culture. ""I have seen his highlights. All of the people in the Rajasthan decision-making group saw him bat at the U19 Test match vs Australia in Chennai, where he scored a hundred of 60-70 balls. The shots that he played there, it felt like, that's something special and we felt like we have to have those kind of individuals in the side and see where they go,"" Sanju Samson told AB de Villiers in an interview. ""But Rajasthan Royals have a history of doing this. They find out talents and make them champions. For example, there is a Yashasvi Jaiswal who came to RR as a youngster and now is a rockstar of the Indian team. There is Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel - they all fall under that line. I think RR loves that kind of thing - yes, we want to win the IPL, but we also want to make sure that we are giving enough champions to Indian cricket. It will be exciting to meet him,"" he further added. The 13-year-old Suryavanshi has been doing well in domestic cricket. After making his Ranji Trophy debut with Bihar last season, the batter has now etched his name in record books becoming the youngest Indian player to play List-A cricket. At the age of 13 years and 269 days, Suryavanshi broke the record of Ali Akbar who made his List A debut at the age of 14 years and 51 days for Vidarbha during the 1999/2000 season. He's already the youngest Indian to make his Ranji Trophy debut and also to play at the Under 19 level.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Injury scare for Rohit Sharma after blow to knee in Melbourne netsTrending Reel

But she also heaped praise on the bowlers for defending a low total as India became the champions of the inaugural edition after winning the match by 41 runs at the Bayuemas Oval in Kuala Lumpur. After being asked to bat first, all India could manage was 117 for seven on the back of Gongadi Trisha’s half-century and a 17-run cameo from Mithila Vinod. Thereafter, Aayushi Shukla picked up three wickets as India bowled their opponents out for 76 in 18.3 overs. Prasad, who will play for the Delhi Capitals (DC) in the upcoming Women’s Premier League (WPL), said that staying calm under pressure has helped the Indian team in the tournament. “We felt we were a few runs short, maybe 20 runs short, but scoring 117 on this wicket is good. But we knew that we had a good bowling side and would bowl well. We were trying to stay in the game, have that intent, body language and our bowlers and fielders did a fantastic job,” Prasad said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Akash Deep was sensational with his bowling, which earned laurels from Australian great Steve Smith during the Test match. The India pacer, who debuted against England in 2024, has only played 6 Test matches so far. The Bengal pacer has never looked out of depth in his short tenure, helping India pick wickets with the new ball. In Gabba, the pacer picked 3 wickets - in his first outing in Australia, and looked like the second-best bowler from the Indian team, only behind Jasprit Bumrah. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Speaking to the press after the nets in Melbourne, Akash Deep explained how senior batters Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli helped the young India pacers prepare for their first tour of Australia. Akash Deep said that the feedback from Rohit Sharma and Kohli aided the likes of Harshit Rana not look like novices in the first overseas Test match. ""This is my first time in Australia. I trust Jasprit Bumrah and the little inputs that he gives help a lot. The things that he says are not complicated and that clarity helps a lot. Like he said that do not get excited by the help in the pitch, and that helped me bowl well,"" Akash Deep said on Sunday. ""The fact that we do not look novices while playing our first match in Australia - a lot of that credit goes to Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who constantly give feedback to the bowlers,"" he further added. Many considered Akash Deep unlucky in the 3rd Test match at Brisbane, as the seamer did not pick wickets despite looking incredibly threatening on the moving day of the game. In fact, Australia batter Steve Smith picked Akash Deep as the standout bowler, stating that the pacer had incredible skills. ""I thought Akash bowled really nicely, particularly that first spell. He was getting the ball to move with pretty significant movement. He bowled a really good length. He's a nice bowler. It was the first time I've actually faced him. He has got some skill there for sure,"" Smith remarked at Gabba.Sticking to Process Did not picking wickets hurt his confidence? Akash Deep does not think so. The pacer said that he trusted his process and that the result was not in his hands. The disciplined bowler, well known for his ability hit a consistent line and length said that he would try to stick to his methods in the upcoming Test matches. ""As a cricketer, we only have process, the result is not in our hand. What I try to do is stick to my discipline, to my lines and lengths and hope that it works out,"" Akash Deep said. ""It is good for us that Australia have made changes. They have brought in a new batter (Sam Konstas) but we have played him. Nothing new for us. We don't think about who comes in, who goes out, our job is to bowl well and I want to do that,"" he added. ""Our mindset is to exploit the new ball. They are facing issues with the new ball. The plan is to attack in the first 30 overs,"" concluded the India pacer on the matter. There were injury concerns for India on Sunday, with Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Akash Deep getting hit by the ball. The seamer allayed those concerns and said that it was a part and parcel of their profession. ""We keep getting hit in the nets. That is fine. I think that the practice pitch was for white-ball, so it was keeping a little low. There is no concern with Rohit Sharma,"" concluded the pacer.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  India high on confidence after Gabba: Series 50-50 going into MCG, says Akash DeepMust Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/delhi-sg-pipers-rajkumar-pal-aiming-for-hockey-india-league-spotlight-2653638-2024-12-22,"For Delhi SG Pipers' Rajkumar Pal, the journey over the past years in hockey has been sensational. After missing the chance to make the trip for the Tokyo Olympics, the midfielder went back to the drawing board and worked hard. This was rewarded in 2024, when he was part of the Indian team that won the bronze medal at the Paris Olympics.  Now, set to be part of the revamped Hockey India League, Rajkumar is hoping to make the spotlight his own with the Delhi SG Pipers. The team made heads turn at the auction table with their eye for young talent and the midfielder feels this will help the side in the long run. Speaking exclusively to Indiatoday.in, Rajkumar was realistic about Delhi's chances in the 2024-25 season and also opened up about being reunited with PR Sreejesh.  The midfielder also gave a sneak peek into his journey so far and his goals going forward. Rajkumar Pal interaction India Today: Let's start with the Hockey India League again. Last time we were here, many stars got a chance to make a name for themselves. People at home started recognising players. Do you expect the same impact from the upcoming league? Rajkumar Pal: Absolutely! In this league, I think three or four players will shine. I also want to give my 100 percent and take the spotlight. Every player wants to be noticed, and everyone will try their best. It's great to be a part of a team. The whole game should be about making an impact, as every team has that one player who consistently scores goals and gets noticed. Scoring gives confidence and motivation and the game continues to improve. I hope that if I start the tournament well, I can aim for better performances throughout the league. India Today: As you mentioned, you are playing for Delhi SG Pipers. What makes the Delhi SG Pipers team special compared to other teams this time? Rajkumar Pal: I think our team has the most number of young players, which is going to be a huge advantage for Delhi SG Pipers. The players are young and fit, and we’ve built a well-balanced team. We have experienced forwards, midfielders, and defenders, and even the juniors are getting the support they need. So, I believe it’s a strong team, and we will all support each other. The more experienced players will guide the younger ones. We have a good balance, and now it’s just about preparing well and putting in our best effort. India Today: You’re a young player yourself, very energetic. Do you think the team will achieve success right away, or will it take time? Rajkumar Pal: I think we will have success, but we might not finish in the top 4 right away. However, we can make it to the finals in the future, and I believe that in the coming seasons, as we gain more experience, the team will become much stronger. After 2-3 years, the team will be much better, with improved confidence and skill from the new players as well. So, success is definitely on the horizon, but it will take some time to reach our peak. India Today: You will reunite with PR Sreejesh at Delhi SG Pipers. What does it feel like to play with him again? Rajkumar Pal: Playing with Sreejesh Bhai is great. He always motivates the players, and that’s important for every team. During our previous time together, he was a huge help, always guiding us, and I’m sure he will continue to do that. It feels good to be with such a player because he understands the game and the mental aspects of it. We can always talk to him about what to do, and his guidance is a big contribution to the team’s success. India Today: Your rise to the top has been challenging. You lost your father, then you didn’t make the Olympic team in 2020. But you kept pushing forward, and eventually, you made it to the Paris Olympics and won a medal. How do you see your journey? Rajkumar Pal: When I look back, I feel there’s been a lot of change in my life. People want to meet me now because of the Olympic medal, but when I didn’t make it in 2020, it was very disappointing. I was sad, but I didn’t let it drag me down for too long. I quickly moved on and kept my mind fresh. Every player has a turning point in their career, and that was mine. If I had kept thinking about not making the team, I wouldn’t have reached where I am today. I continued working hard, and eventually, the opportunity came. When I finally played in the Olympics, my whole journey changed. My family, my village, everything became special. The most happiness came when the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh came to my village to honour me and my family. India Today: Give us a sneak peek into your hockey journey. Rajkumar Pal: I’m from a village called Karmapur in the Ghazipur district, which is near Varanasi. My journey started in 2009 when I began playing. All three of my brothers played too, and I started playing because of them. Initially, my family didn’t approve, but they eventually supported me, and I started practicing at a private academy run by the late Tej Bahadur Singh. Over time, the craze for hockey grew in my village, and people started getting jobs in the army and other departments because of hockey. That’s when things started changing. I later moved to Lucknow, but my family faced a tough time. My father had passed away in 2011, and my mother had to make some very difficult decisions. She was alone at home, and even though it was tough for her, she encouraged me to go pursue my dreams. I can never forget that sacrifice. India Today: It must have been a very difficult decision for your mother. Rajkumar Pal: Yes, it was incredibly difficult for her, especially with no one else at home. She had to manage everything herself. She even had to take care of the cows and handle other household work. But I’m grateful to her for letting me pursue my dreams. I can never forget that time, especially when I had to leave in 2011. India Today: Now that you've won an Olympic bronze and performed excellently well with the national side, what’s your personal goal? Rajkumar Pal: My personal goal is to continue improving my skills. I want to control the ball and positioning better, especially in high-speed situations, and create more scoring opportunities. I hope to show my skills and contribute more to the team. I always strive to be better, and my focus is to help my team win by playing my best.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  HIL is for Indian players to grow: PR Sreejesh on foreign signings pulling outMust Watch

India are playing their 4th Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Melbourne, having drawn the previous Test match at the Gabba. Speaking on Star Sports before the Boxing Day game, Pujara has raised alarms about the depth of the Indian bowling unit. So far, Jasprit Bumrah has been the only consistent performer in the Indian line-up, who has looked threatening in every single spell that he has bowled.  Pujara analysed the Indian team's performance ahead of the 4th Test, and said that while the batting output had improved due to the tail-enders putting up a resilient display at the Gabba, the bowling output however had gone down. ""My first biggest question and slight reason for concern is that the Indian bowling is looking slightly weak. The batting has improved a little. The top five have not batted well but the middle order and lower-middle order have done that,"" Cheteshwar Pujara said on Star Sports. ""Ravindra Jadeja and Nitish (Kumar Reddy), and even the tailenders, (Jasprit) Bumrah and Akash Deep, contributed with the bat. There is a weakness somewhere or the other in bowling. So what team will you play, that's the biggest question,"" Pujara further added. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage India have fielded a different line-up in each of the first three Test matches. The spin bowler's position has been the most fragile, with Washington Sundar, Ravichandran Ashwin and then Ravindra Jadeja playing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Test respectively. Now India are one man short in their squad with R Ashwin retiring from all forms of international cricket after the Gabba Test match. It is expected that India will not change their line-up for the MCG Test match - unless there is a injury in the build-up to the game. India have the back up of Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna in the fast bowling department, while Sarfaraz Khan and Dhruv Jurel are waiting in the ranks on the batting side of things.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  India high on confidence after Gabba: Series 50-50 going into MCG, says Akash DeepMust Watch

She was the second highest run-scorer for her team after Tanisha Singh, having scored 182 runs from nine matches at an average of 26 and a strike-rate of 85.94. In the previous edition of the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy, Rawal was the second-highest run-scorer. In eight matches, Pratika made 411 runs at an average of 68.50 and a strike-rate of 91.94 with two centuries and a top score of 141 to show for her efforts. Rawal also played for East Delhi Riders in the Women’s Delhi Premier League. After the Women’s T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), India handed ODI caps to six cricketers, one of whom was Pratika. The others are Minnu Mani, Tejal Hasabnis, Titas Sadhu, Saima Thakor and Priya Mishra. Saima and Uttarakhand’s Raghvi Bist also made their T20I debuts against the West Indies earlier this month.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  India clinch inaugural Under-19 Women's Asia Cup title after beating Bangladesh

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/ind-vs-aus-what-is-indias-record-in-the-much-coveted-boxing-day-test-2653696-2024-12-22,"The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is 3 Tests down, with India and Australia level at 1-1. After a strong start in Perth, India has slightly mellowed after being hammered in Adelaide and then eking out a tough draw in Brisbane. However, India has taken much confidence from their sensational escape at the Gabba and is looking forward to the penultimate Test match of the series. The Boxing Day Test match is set to be played at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground — popularly known as the MCG or simply as the 'G.' The Test match is expected to shatter all records of attendance for a non-Ashes game. India will be looking to make a strong comeback in the final two games of the series, not only to clinch a 3-peat in Australia but also to keep their hopes of the World Test Championship final alive. India has had a strong record at the MCG in recent years. India has won the Boxing Day Tests in the last two tours and drawn one Test before that. The likes of Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane have put in strong batting performances in recent years, and on the other hand, Bumrah has weaved his magic as usual. Overall, India has played 14 Test matches at the venue, winning only 4 of them. The team has lost 8 Test matches at the MCG and has drawn 2 games. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full CoverageINDIA'S MOST RECENT PERFORMANCES AT THE MCG BGT 2014-15 The only drawn Test match in the last three tours. Bowling first in the game, India was put in trouble by a prolific Steve Smith, who scored 192 runs in the first innings.   India replied with twin centuries from Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane, who helped India score 465 runs in response to Australia's 530. After Australia declared for 318/9, India saw Australia off despite panicking early. Kohli and Rahane once again stabilized the Indian innings, after which Pujara, Dhoni, and Ashwin saw India off to a draw. BGT 2018-19 Under the captaincy of Virat Kohli, India notched up a famous win in the Boxing Day Test match. After a strong batting performance in the first innings by Cheteshwar Pujara (106) and Virat Kohli (82), India put up 443/7d. In response, Australia fumbled in both innings, courtesy of Jasprit Bumrah (9 wickets), and India won by 137 runs. BGT 2020-21 It was once again Jasprit Bumrah and Ajinkya Rahane who showed the way. Bumrah bowled out Australia for just 195 runs in the first innings, after which Rahane added insult to injury with his patient hundred, helping India take a 100+ lead. Australia faltered with the bat once again due to the combined prowess of Mohammed Siraj, Bumrah, and Umesh Yadav, helping India notch up an 8-wicket win. Rahane was named the player of the match for his century and captaincy.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Sam Konstas ready to face Bumrah?

Star batter Joe Root has returned to the ODI setup for the first time since the ODI World Cup 2023. However, all rounder Ben Stokes has missed out from the 15-member squad following a left hamstring injury sustained during the third Test match against New Zealand earlier this month. The ECB medical team will continue to assess the extent of Stokes’ injury as the all rounder will miss the tournament after coming out of his retirement for the ODI World Cup 2023. Jos Buttler will continue to lead both the ODI and T20I teams having recently made his return to the team in the West Indies tour following an injury. The entire squad will leave for India on 17th January where they will play five T20Is beginning from January 22 followed by three ODIs set to begin from February 6. The ODI series will act as the final preparation for both teams for the ICC Champions Trophy. Meanwhile, the schedule for the Champions Trophy is yet to be out as the ICC (International Cricket Council) is yet to decide a neutral venue for the event where India will play their matches after their reluctance to travel to host country Pakistan. However, the tournament is set to be held from the fourth week in February 2025 and will go on until the second week of March. England were knocked out in the semi-final of the last edition of the tournament on their home soil by the eventual champions Pakistan and hence will be eager to win the upcoming edition of the event.

She was dismissed for 91, entering an all-time unlucky list. This marked the fourth time Mandhana was dismissed in the nervous nineties in ODIs, joining West Indies’ Stafanie Taylor as the women’s batter with the most dismissals in the nineties. Mandhana had the chance to achieve a unique milestone, potentially becoming only the second women’s batter after Tammy Beaumont to score consecutive hundreds in ODIs twice. She had smashed a century in the 3rd ODI against Australia, a match India lost, and was in excellent touch heading into this game. Zaida James dismissed Smriti Mandhana, trapping her leg-before-wicket (LBW) to deny the Indian opener a well-deserved century. Mandhana's disappointment was evident as she walked back to the pavilion.  India vs West Indies, 1st Women's ODI Updates The delivery was pitched at a good length outside off and was slightly quicker than expected. Mandhana shuffled across the stumps, attempting a paddle shot, but missed it entirely. The ball struck her front pad near the knee-roll, and the umpire raised the finger.

Notably, Rohit hasn’t been in the best of form in the series so far, having scored just 19 runs from two matches at an average of 6.33. The India skipper has sacrificed his opening slot for KL Rahul, who performed exceptionally in his absence during the series opener in Perth. Speaking about Rohit’s batting position, Shastri said that he would’ve loved to see him opening the batting but now that, since KL Rahul has performed well at the top spot, he should continue playing in that spot. “I would have asked him (Rohit) to open in the last Test match but then the way Rahul has batted, I mean he was a joy to watch and the way he's batting, I believe he struck a purple patch,” Shastri said on the ICC Review. Further speaking ahead, Shastri said that Rohit can still be dangerous at number 6, but he’s got to be clear in his mindset and attack the opposition. “I would like to see Rohit Sharma, his tactics change a bit because he can still be extremely dangerous at that number (six). I think he's got to be very clear in his mindset to go out there and take the attack to the opposition and not worry about anything else,” he added. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage “The last thing you want is him to be in two minds whether to defend or attack. In his case, it should be attack. He picks up length quickly, he should take the opposition on at that number. Because if he gets away in the first 10-15 minutes, in any way, he's not got past that 15-20 minutes, half an hour. So why don’t you play a natural game, go and take the attack to the opposition and take it from there?,” Shastri said.Rohit's poor form in ongoing season Rohit is batting at number 6 after almost six years and has found it tough to adapt to the position. He began his career batting at six only and scored consecutive hundreds in his first two innings. Hence, he has the best record batting at that position with 1056 runs to his name from 18 matches (28 innings) at an average of 48 with three hundreds and six fifties. However, he’s yet to find his mojo back in the ongoing year, having scored just 152 runs in the last seven Tests at an average of 11.69 with just one fifty to his name. Hence, it’s extremely crucial for the India skipper to find his form back as India aim to take a lead in the series in Melbourne.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-sam-konstas-mcg-boxing-day-test-match-2653712-2024-12-22,"Youngster Sam Konstas is ready to get a taste of the Boxing Day Test match against India, set to begin on December 26. Konstas who replaced Nathan McSweeney in the Australian side comes in with a big reputation of being one of the most exciting talents in the Australian domestic competition. Konstas astronomically improved his stocks in Australian cricket when he hit a terrific hundred against India A in the pink-ball tour game before the Adelaide Test match. Konstas was the lone warrior from the side and put every single India bowler in trouble. Speaking on the build-up to the Test match, the youngster said that he was confident and was going to back his skills if he is given a debut in the coveted Boxing Day Test match. ""I'm super confident,"" he told Fox Sports. ""Just backing my skills, I have done all the hard work. Just another game, I guess, and trying to keep it simple. As a kid you have always dreamt of the moment, and it is very rare, getting your baggy green. So it's a huge honour if I do get in."" The batter was specifically quizzed about Bumrah, who has been in sensational form in this series. Konstas said that he was not worried about the star India pacer as he had seen him play so much. ""It was all a bit unexpected but very privileged to get the opportunity,"" Konstas said. ""I just had dinner with the family [to celebrate], pretty chilled. It was emotional, mum was crying ... Everything has happened so fast,"" Konstas said. The batter spoke about his family and how his loved ones reacted to the Test call. Konstas said that everything was sudden and it was quite an emotional moment for his family. ""Mum and dad and my brothers, all their sacrifices, taking me to training, throwing me balls, experiencing the journey through highs and lows. Just to give something back to them was very special. I can't wait to have them in Melbourne for support,"" he added. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full CoverageWHO IS SAM KONSTAS? Sam Konstas was called-up for the pink ball tour game against India on the back of just 5 first class matches. The right-handed rose to fame after his twin hundreds against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield series. Konstas achieved a remarkable feat by scoring twin centuries against South Australia, a performance that has drawn comparisons to some of the greatest names in Australian cricket history. The young batter has already been compared to legendary Ricky Ponting by the New South Wales coach Greg Shipperd. ""I think I might have used that on a couple of players over my journey and called them the 'pint-sized Punter'...It just again references his (Konstas' potential),"" the NSW coach said on the batter. Konstas's innings were nothing short of spectacular. In his first innings, he scored 152 runs, marking his maiden first-class century. This was followed by an equally impressive 105 runs in the second innings, as New South Wales took control of the game at Cricket Central. His aggregate of 257 runs in the match is the highest by a batter under 20 in the Sheffield Shield, surpassing the previous record held by Doug Walters, who scored 253 runs in one innings 60 years ago. This achievement places Konstas in the company of cricket legends. He is the youngest player since Ricky Ponting in 1992 to score centuries in both innings of a Sheffield Shield match. Ponting, who went on to have an illustrious Test career with 168 appearances, achieved this feat at the age of 18 years and 85 days. Konstas's performance has not only highlighted his technical skills but also his mental toughness and adaptability. In his second innings, he faced different bowling plans from the South Australian team, which included wider deliveries, but he adjusted his approach effectively, showing a mix of precision driving and aggressive play when necessary. His innings included 13 boundaries and four sixes, with a notable slog-sweep that took him to his historic hundred.KONSTAS' HUNDRED vs INDIA A 19-year-old Sam Konstas hit a blazing century in Canberra on Sunday in the Australian PM XI's match vs India. Konstas, who opened the innings for his team counter-attacked India's bowlers and hit them predominantly through the leg side as wickets fell on the other end. Konstas, who was pipped as the replacement for David Warner before the start of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, showed his quality against the pink ball. The opener took on Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna, dominating them after the first hour of play. Konstas brought up his century in just 90 balls, as wickets fell from the other end. Konstas slammed 14 boundaries and a six en route his century. The batter opened the innings for Australia in overcast conditions and remained steady at one end while the hosts lost 2 quick wickets of Matt Renshaw and Jayden Goodwin. After a difficult period of first 10 overs, Konstas started cutting loose alongside Jack Clayton and added 100-plus runs. After Clayton fell, Konstas continued his barrage of impressive shots as Australia saw a mini-collapse on the other side. The batter finally got out for 107 off 97 balls in the 38th over of the match with Australia at 205 runs. He was Australia's 78th wicket to fall.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: What is India's record in the coveted Boxing Day Test?

Sam Konstas replaced McSweeney as the opener for the last two Tests of the Border Gavaskar Trophy series. Vaughan acknowledged that McSweeney had one of the hardest starts to his career in the ongoing series between Australia and India. However, he felt that McSweeney could have been given a chance in the middle order, as the batter is, anyway, not a natural opener.  ""I look at McSweeney and think I don't think there's a player who has had a harder start to their career. I feel for the kid, because of all the people that I've seen come into Test cricket over the last 10 years, I don't think anyone's been given a harder challenge,"" Vaughan told Fox Sports. ""To face Bumrah in the conditions that he's had to face now, the pink ball under lights in his second game, in Perth it did all sorts and in Brisbane the ball was moving around,"" he added. McSweeney smacks 4 fours in an over: read hereMcSweeney gets snubbed Despite his challenges, Vaughan remained hopeful of seeing McSweeney feature in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne. ""I thought they'd go with McSweeney for Melbourne, and if he failed again, they'd bring Sam (Konstas) in for his home Test at the SCG."" However, Vaughan felt that the Test snub might act as a blessing in disguise for McSweeney.  ""I don't think in the long run it's going to be a bad thing for McSweeney. I think he will end up being an Australian Test cricketer, but I don't think he'll be up the top of the order; I think it'll be down at four or five,"" Vaughan said.Vaughan suggests middle order role The 25-year-old, who was handed the challenging role of opening the batting despite being a middle-order specialist in domestic cricket, struggled to find form. In his three matches, McSweeney managed just 72 runs in six innings, marking the lowest output for an Australian opener in their first six innings in 50 years.  ""If I was McSweeney, next time I get the chance to wear the baggy green, I'd want him to be in the position that he's played all his life. I feel for Nathan, I think he'll be back - but I totally understand why Australia made this move."" Senior Australian opener Usman Khawaja is facing significant pressure due to his underwhelming performances with the bat. In his six innings so far, he has managed scores of 8, 4, 13, 9*, 21, and 8. ""I do think that Usman needs runs in the next two games; I don't think he can be anywhere near a shoe-in to go to Sri Lanka and the West Indies if he doesn't score runs in this series, because eventually you have to look to the future,"" Vaughan continued.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  Smriti Mandhana misses out on hundred in 1st ODI, enters all-time unlucky list

Notably, Starc didn’t have a memorable outing in the series opener in Perth as he registered match figures of 3/125. India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal also sledged him, saying that he was bowling too slow in the first Test. The comment seemed to awaken the sleeping beast in Starc as he came back to pick 6/48 in the pink ball Test in Adelaide. The left-arm speedster finished with figures of 8/108 in the game, being the best bowler from his team. Commenting on Starc’s form, Pujara said that the Australia speedster has improved his bowling a lot in the past few years. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage ""He has been their best bowler thus far in this series. He has improved his bowling a lot in the last one to one-and-a-half years. If I talk about my personal experience, when he used to bowl in the last two series, we felt we could get runs. However, now it seems like when he comes to bowl, he will pick up wickets,” said Pujara on Star Sports. Further speaking ahead, Pujara called Starc even more dangerous than Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. He also suggested India to see off his first spell to avert his threat.We need to make Starc bowl the second and third spells: Pujara ""He is looking more dangerous than Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. So we will have to manage his bowling, especially with the new ball. He has taken most of his wickets in his first five overs, his first spell. We need to bat well in the first five overs and make him bowl the second and third spells because he gets tired,"" he added. Starc is the joint second-highest wicket taker of the series so far with 14 wickets to his name from three matches at an average of 22.85 and an economy of 3.54. The veteran seamer has had the wood over Jaiswal having dismissed him in the very first over both in Adelaide and Brisbane. Hence, Melbourne will once again treat fans with another mouth-watering clash between the two players, with both teams eager to take a lead in the series. Australia will miss the services of Josh Hazlewood who’s been ruled out of the entire series due to a side strain and will be replaced by Scott Boland.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

In response, Heats lost their openers early and were reduced at 19/3. McSweeney walked into bat and shared a crucial 66-run stand from just 39 deliveries with Matt Renshaw, who scored 27-ball 54.

McSweeney dropped from Test side The 25-year-old, who was handed the challenging role of opening the batting despite being a middle-order specialist in domestic cricket, struggled to find form. In his three matches, McSweeney managed just 72 runs in six innings, marking the lowest output for an Australian opener in their first six innings in 50 years. His difficulties were compounded as he faced some of the most lethal bowlers in India’s lineup, particularly the early brilliance of Jasprit Bumrah. Speaking to 7 News, McSweeney admitted that missing out on the Boxing Day Test was a bitter pill to swallow, but he remained optimistic about a return. ""Yes, I mean devastated. I get the dream come true and then didn't quite work out the way I wanted it, but it's all part of it and yeah I'll get the head down and get back in the nets and work really hard and hopefully be ready to go for the next opportunity,"" Mcsweeney said. ""I think it's the game we're in. if you don't take your opportunity and you're not performing as well as you want to, your position's never safe.

 Jasprit Bumrah is on the cusp of becoming the fastest Indian fast bowler to the landmark of 200 wickets in Test cricket. The speedster has a chance to achieve the feat in India’s upcoming Boxing Day Test against Australia, starting December 26 at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. Kapil holds the record in 50 Tests in the match against the West Indies at Port of Spain back in March 1983. Six wickets away from the record, Bumrah currently has 194 wickets from 43 Tests at an economy rate of 2.75 with six four-wicket hauls and 12 five-wicket hauls to show for his efforts.  If the 31-year-old picks up six wickets in the Melbourne Test, he will also be the joint second-fastest Indian to the 200-wicket landmark along with Ravindra Jadeja. Former spinner Ravi Ashwin is the fastest, having got there in 37 Tests back in September 2016. Bumrah has been solely carrying the weight of the Indian bowling unit in the ongoing series and currently has 21 wickets from three Tests at an economy rate of 2.60.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 22, 2024

Seven players have made debuts for them in international cricket, six of them are in ODIs. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-india-women-vs-west-indies-women-pratika-rawal-debut-world-cup-2653783-2024-12-22,"Since failing to qualify for the semi-final of the Women’s T20 World Cup in the UAE, the Indian women’s team is on an experimentation spree. India have handed international caps to seven of their cricketers in the last two months. In ODIs, Minnu Mani, Tejal Hasabnis, Pratika Rawal, Titas Sadhu, Saima Thakor and Priya Mishra got their maiden India caps. Delhi’s Pratika was the latest to make her debut after Smriti Mandhana handed her the cap ahead of the series opener against the West Indies on Sunday at the Kotambi Stadium in Vadodara. 28-year-old Saima also made her T20I debut in the T20Is against the Caribbean team. Uttarakhand’s Raghvi Bist also had the chance in the second match of the same series. Bist’s domestic teammate Nandini Kashyap, who was the top run-scorer in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy, was also a part of the squad for the West Indies T20Is, but did not get to play. India vs West Indies, 1st Women's ODI Updates It goes without saying that India are trying their heart out to build a pool ahead of the ODI World Cup to be held next year at home. With women’s cricket growing in stature and players prone to injuries due to hectic schedules, India realise the importance of having a large set of cricketers to choose from.In the article, let’s look at how India’s debutants after the T20 World Cup have fared thus far Minnu Mani  Minnu Manu came through the ranks after playing eight matches for the Delhi Capitals (DC) in the Women’s Premier League (WPL). Minnu was also the captain of the India A team on the tour of Australia. She made her ODI debut against Australia in Brisbane, scoring an unbeaten 46 and picking up two wickets. Minnu is also a part of the ongoing ODIs against the West Indies. Tejal Hasabnis  Tejal Hasabnis grabbed the limelight after she scored three fifties on the trot for India A in their One-Dayers against Australia A earlier this year. She scored 42 runs on debut in the ODI series against New Zealand. In the series, she made 57 runs at an average of 28.50. Recently, she went unsold in the WPL auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakhs. Pratika Rawal  Pratika Rawal made her ODI debut on Sunday and had her fair share of trouble while opening the batting, scoring five runs off her first 25 balls. But she found some rhythm to make 40 off 69 before Hayley Matthews dismissed her. Rawal has done well for Delhi in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy. She also played for East Delhi Riders in the Women’s Delhi Premier League. Titas Sadhu  Titas Sadhu has been impressive in T20Is thus far, picking up 13 wickets from 12 matches. But in the two ODIs that she played in Australia where she also made her ODI debut, Sadhu failed to take a wicket and leaked runs at an economy rate of 6.41. The pacer also played only four matches across two seasons for the Capitals in the WPL. Saima Thakor  Saima Thakor has been a big positive for India since she made her debut against New Zealand back in October. In six ODIs, she has taken seven wickets at an economy rate of 5.41. She took a three-wicket in an ODI against Australia at the Allan Border Field in Brisbane. Thakor has also had her role to play for the Alyssa Healy-led UP Warriorz in the WPL. Priya Mishra  Leg-spinner Priya Mishra broke into the Indian team after taking a five-wicket haul and a four-wicket haul against Australia A. She picked up five wickets from her first three ODIs after making her debut against New Zealand. But she also had her troubles after setting the record for most runs conceded by an Indian women’s bowler in an ODI innings when she finished with figures of 10-0-88-1 against Australia in Brisbane.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  India captain Niki elated after historic Asia Cup win: Bowlers did a fantastic job

Harmanpreet Kaur pulled off an absolute stunner to dismiss Alleyne off Renuka Singh’s bowling. Alleyne, looking to clear mid-on, struck the ball well, but Kaur had other plans. Timing her jump to perfection, she extended fully to complete a one-handed catch, showcasing remarkable agility and sharp reflexes. The ball was travelling at pace, but Kaur’s presence of mind and height played a crucial role in pulling off the remarkable grab. It wasn’t just about timing; her stretch and control turned what seemed like a certain boundary into a highlight-reel moment.  This incredible effort from the Indian captain not only sent Alleyne packing but also showed Kaur’s remarkable brilliance as a fielder, leaving her teammates in awe and the crowd buzzing.

She suffered a niggle in her knee while batting during the 1st T20I and made a sensational return in the 1st ODI. The Indian captain added crucial runs to India's mammoth total of 314/9. She scored a quick-fire 34 from 23 deliveries before getting run-out in the 1st innings. Earlier in India's innings, Smriti Mandhana and debutant Prakiti Rawal gave India a flying start with their 110-run opening stand. Mandhana, however, missed out on a well-deserved century as she was dismissed at 91 runs. However, the middle and lower order batters ensured India posted a dominant total on board.

4c031451-1088-4949-89e1-1c02b83911a2,Sanjay Bangar's plan to dismiss Travis Head: Force him to do something differentFormer India cricketer and batting coach Sanjay Bangar has suggested a plan to dismiss India's chief tormentor Travis Head in the upcoming fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-sanjay-bangar-travis-head-aus-vs-ind-border-gavaskar-trophy-2024-25-2653779-2024-12-22,"Former India cricketer and batting coach Sanjay Bangar has suggested a plan to dismiss India’s chief tormentor Travis Head in the upcoming fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne. Notably, Head has been the thorn in India’s flesh since 2023, and has also continued his form in the ongoing series as well. The southpaw is the highest run scorer of the series so far with 409 runs from three matches at an average of 81.80 with two hundreds and one fifty to his name. India have struggled massively to get rid of Head as Australia batter has been successful in taking the game away from them with his aggressive stroke play. Ahead of the fourth Test in Melbourne, Sanjay Bangar has suggested bowling in the corridor of uncertainty from around the wicket to the swashbuckling batter at the start of his innings. ""At the start of the innings, go around the wicket and bowl in the corridor. If it proves successful in the first 10-15 balls, stick to that plan. Plan A is to come around the wicket and make him play at off stump. If there’s no success, shift to over the wicket with more fielders on the on-side and a deep third man,"" Bangar advised on Star Sports. Further speaking ahead, the former India batting coach said that India need to force him into doing something different and put catching men in the deep. ""By sticking to the middle-stump line, you force him to do something different. Against the short ball, his bat always comes into play, making deep third man, deep fine leg, and deep square leg potential catching positions. This approach dries up his scoring opportunities and creates pressure. India needs to persist with this plan and have patience to neutralize the Travis Head threat,"" he added. Head has frustrated India since the World Test Championship final 2023 as his 163 helped Australia clinch the title with a massive 209-run win. The southpaw further scored a magnificent 137 in the final of the ODI World Cup 2023 helping Australia win by six wickets. Head’s love-affair with India has also continued in the ongoing series as well, with back-to-back centuries in Adelaide and Brisbane. Hence, India are desperate to end his golden run against them, which will also help them win the series which is currently tied at 1-1.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

India’s bowling unit maintained relentless pressure, with Titas Sadhu and Priya Mishra also chipping in with crucial wickets.   This emphatic victory showcased India’s all-round dominance. Mandhana’s brilliance with the bat and Renuka’s career milestone with the ball showed their collective effort. The West Indies, on the other hand, will need to regroup quickly and address their batting failures and subpar fielding, as they look to bounce back in the series.  The win gave India a strong start to the ODI series, with the hosts aiming to build on this momentum in the upcoming matches.

Kohli dedicated a full hour to batting, facing a range of Indian bowlers, with a special focus on Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep as they tested him with the new ball. The Indian batter displayed his class against the pace attack, handling the bounce and swing with ease. However, it wasn’t just the pacers who caught his attention—Kohli also faced throwdown specialists, playing some elegant shots with his usual grace. His fluidity and rhythm in the middle were reminiscent of his dominant performance on Day 1 of the practice session, signalling that he was in excellent form and ready for the challenge ahead in the Test. Alongside Kohli, opening batters KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal also went through their paces. Jaiswal, in particular, was the focus of attention during the practice session. At one point, Rahul took some time to speak to Jaiswal in detail, offering guidance and advice on how to approach the challenging conditions at the MCG. It was clear that the senior players were keen to help Jaiswal settle into the Test atmosphere. The young opener, who hasn't been able to get going in recent matches after the Perth hundred, was seen engaging in several in-depth discussions with senior members of the team, such as Rahul, Kohli, and coach Gautam Gambhir. These interactions are part of Jaiswal’s preparation to understand the nuances of the ga,e and adjust his technique to face the best bowlers.

Notably, Pakistan fans have often compared Babar with Kohli as the star batter has managed to break few of his records so far in his career. However, the comparisons have often mounted the pressure on the Pakistan batter which has resulted in his poor form in the past few years. Recently, Amir shared his thoughts on the comparisons of Kohli with the other players in the world and praised the India star as ‘incomparable’, mentioning his ability to win matches across all three formats. ""Virat Kohli is the greatest player of this generation. I laugh when comparisons are made between him and Babar Azam, Steve Smith, or Joe Root. We cannot compare Virat Kohli to anyone because he has won so many matches for India, which seems impossible for any one player. Not just in one format, but in all three formats, Virat is the greatest batsman of this generation,"" Amir said on the Cricket Predicta Show. Further speaking ahead, the former speedster mentioned how Kohli made a remarkable comeback in his career after his disastrous tour to England in 2014. Amir also touched upon their on-field battles and said that his wicket in the 2017 Champions Trophy final played the key role in Pakistan’s victory in that tournament. ""Virat Kohli’s work ethic sets him apart from all players. After his bad phase in England in 2014, the way he made a comeback and then consistently performed brilliantly for the next 10 years was no ordinary feat. His wicket in the 2017 Champions Trophy final was very important for us, which helped us win the final. If Virat had not been dismissed, we would have lost the final because we all know how exceptional Virat’s record is while chasing runs,"" he added.Kohli struggling for runs in Tests Amir managed to dismiss Kohli for just 5 (9) as the former India captain got a leading edge while playing a flick which went straight to Shadab Khan at point. As a result, India were bundled out for 158 chasing a massive target of 339 and failed to defend their Champions Trophy crown. Meanwhile, Kohli has been undergoing poor form in Test cricket for a long time as he continued to register low scores after scoring his long-awaited hundred in Perth.

Notably, Konstas has received his maiden call up to the Australian Test team replacing Nathan McSweeney. Coming into the Test on the back of three fifty plus scores in his last four innings, Konstas is high on confidence. However, he will be facing the menacing India speedster Jasprit Bumrah with the new ball. Speaking about the massive challenge, Konstas said that he wouldn’t be watching too much of the Indian pace ace and expressed his excitement about facing him. ""I won't watch too much [of him]. I have already seen him a lot. But I am excited to challenge myself and face him. Usually, our analysts do a little feedback on each bowler. I might read that, maybe,” Konstas was quoted as saying by the ICC. Further speaking ahead, the 19-year-old said that he will back his skills and treat his debut as just another game. ""I'm super confident. Just backing my skills, I have done all the hard work. Just another game, I guess, and trying to keep it simple. As a kid you have always dreamt of the moment, and it is very rare, getting your baggy green. So it's a huge honour if I do get in,” he added.Konstas' brilliant run of form Konstas didn’t have a memorable outing in his first game after earning his maiden call up as he got dismissed for a three-ball duck. He got dismissed for a three-ball duck in his second Big Bash League match for Sydney Thunder against Sydney Sixers. Konstas has been in magnificent form in the Sheffield Shield being the second-highest run scorer for New South Wales (NSW) with 471 runs from eight innings at an average of 58.87 with two hundreds and one fifty. Earlier, he also scored a magnificent hundred for Prime Minister’s XI against India during the pink-ball warm up fixture. Konstas scored a sensational 107 (97) with the help of 14 fours and a six as he guided his team to a score of 240. He also scored a match-winning unbeaten 73 in the second unofficial Test against India A.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

Notably, Indian batters have been in poor form off late as they were recently whitewashed in the home Test series against New Zealand. The collapses have followed the team to Australia as well, which resulted in the loss in the second Test in Adelaide. Recently, Patel shared his opinion on the matter and mentioned India’s weakness against facing spin on turning tracks at home. ""There is no doubt that collapses have occurred, especially in home series. We have seen collapses on rank turner pitches against New Zealand. When we toured Australia, the collapses continued there,"" Patel said on Cricbuzz. Further speaking ahead, the former wicketkeeper batter highlighted that the batting failures is not the result of extreme aggression and the Indian batters need to apply themselves more. ""I do not believe this has happened due to extreme aggression. If we respect the traditional style of Test cricket and bat with discipline, these are the same batters who have previously performed well. Indian batters need to apply themselves more because they have the ability. If they bat with discipline, they can succeed anywhere,"" he added.India's batting debacles in recent times India were recently bundled out for 46, which was their third lowest score, in the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru. The Indian batting has crumbled in both spinning and swinging conditions in the past few months. They failed to negate the threat of Ajaz Patel and Mitchell Santner in home conditions against New Zealand. In the ongoing series, India have been undone by the Australian pacers as they’ve surpassed the 300-run mark just once in the six innings so far in the series. Indian batters have struggled massively in Tests in the ongoing year with just two players, namely Yashasvi Jaiswal (52.48) and Shubman Gill (43.30) averaging over 40 among batters having over 203 runs to their name. Batting stalwarts Virat Kohli (25.06 avg) and Rohit Sharma (26.39 avg) have also had one of their worst years of the careers forcing the likes of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja have contributing immensely lower down the order. As India head to Melbourne for the fourth Test against Australia, they will desperately need their batters to put up an improved performance as they aim to take a lead in the series which is currently tied at 1-1.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

A reliable source in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that Dubai was chosen as the neutral venue after a meeting between PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Nahyan Al Mubarak on Saturday night.

Sheikh Nahyan, who is currently vacationing in the Ghotki region of Sindh and Naqvi, who is also the country's interior minister, met and finalised the logistical and administrative matters for the mega-event hosted by Pakistan. On Thursday, the deadlock over the hosting of Champions Trophy finally ended when the ICC announced that India will play their matches of the 50-over event at a neutral venue instead of host country Pakistan, which will get a similar arrangement for tournaments to be held in India till 2027.

The ICC is now expected to announce the final schedule of the event with Pakistan expected to host 9 to 10 matches.The final will be in Lahore if India doesn’t qualify for the final, the source said. The hybrid arrangement will apply to the Champions Trophy 2025 (Pakistan), next year's women's Cricket World Cup in India and the T20 World Cup in 2026 in India and Sri Lanka.

India had refused to travel to Pakistan for the event scheduled in February-March due to security concerns. The Indians have not played in Pakistan since the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which 150 people were killed. The two countries' last bilateral engagement was back in 2012. Travelling to Pakistan also requires Indian government's clearance, which has remained firm on the status quo. While BCCI's stance was always clear, the matter got stretched because of PCB's refusal to allow a ""one-sided"" arrangement of neutral venues. Led by Naqvi, the PCB was determined not to lose face in front of the local public. PCB, which had sent its team to India for the ODI World Cup last year, had categorically opposed the hybrid model but eventually agreed to it on reciprocal grounds.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  Joe Root named in England's Champions Trophy squad, Ben Stokes misses out

While Virat Kohli confronted a female journalist for taking photos of his family without permission, Ravindra Jadeja was accused by the Australian media of not entertaining questions in English after an MCG net session. Speaking on Channel 7, Katich termed the incidents as 'mind games' and said that they were being done due to the enormity of the series. The former Australian player hit out at the cricketers and said that the media was there to promote the game. “Obviously, there’s been a few things unfolding in the last week or so, that haven’t gone down well at that camp. It’s probably just the mind games being played, given the enormity of this series,” Katich said on Channel 7. “The media are here to promote the game and I don’t know what the Indians are thinking at the moment. That’s their problem,” he added.

The incident occurred when Kohli landed in Melbourne with his wife, actor Anushka Sharma, and their children on Thursday, December 19. A journalist from Australia’s Channel 7 captured a video of the family, which angered Kohli, according to local media. The cricketer was particularly upset about the intrusion into his family’s privacy. He approached the journalist, requesting to view the pictures and videos taken. Kohli then asked her to delete any images or footage of his family, while allowing her to retain any of him alone. Under Australian law, there are no restrictions on photographing or filming celebrities in public places, which likely complicated the matter. ""With my kids, I need some privacy. You can't film without asking me,"" he told the media at the airport. Notably, Virat Kohli had asked the paps not to click photos of his family at the Mumbai airport when he departed for Australia before the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Ravindra Jadeja Runs Out of Time The Australian media has stirred up another controversy just days after Virat Kohli requested an Australian reporter not to take pictures of his family at Melbourne airport. Now the Australian press have accused spinner Ravindra Jadeja of refusing to answer questions in English. Notably, Jadeja addressed the media after India's first practice session at the MCG. The press conference proceeded smoothly until Jadeja concluded the session and decided to return to practice. At this point, an Australian journalist expressed frustration, displaying anger over Jadeja not answering any questions in English. India's media manager attempted to explain that the press conference was organised primarily for the Indian media, but the Australian journalist appeared unwilling to accept this clarification. The reporter was seen lashing out at the India team media manager, further escalating the situation. Australian media: One question in English? Team manager: sorry, we don't have time now. You can see the team bus is waiting. Aussie media: Can't we take one question in English? Manager: This was organised mainly for the travelling Indian media. Aussie media: The organisation is hopeless. An Indian reporter, who was present at the MCG press conference, highlighted that many Indian journalists also missed the opportunity to ask questions but refrained from arguing or causing a scene like the Aussie reporters. ""I was present there, and many Indian touring journalists didn't get the opportunity to ask questions due to time constraints. However, after the press conference ended, a few Australian journalists got annoyed and argued with the Indian team's media manager. They misbehaved as well, which was uncalled for. I cover press conferences regularly, and even during Australian press conferences, many Indian journalists don't get the chance to ask questions due to time shortages, but we have never argued or misbehaved,"" one of the Indian reporters told India Today.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Champions Trophy 2025: Dubai to serve as neutral venue for India matchesMust Watch

Commenting on Shubman's woeful form away from home, Karthik said that Gill is confused about his approach to batting in India vs batting in overseas conditions. Since his heroic Gabba outing in 2021 where he scored 91 runs, Gill's home and away batting form has been of stark contrast. While at home, Gill has scored 1177 runs in 31 innings, his away returns are significantly less - 424 runs from 20 innings. Dinesh Karthik believes that Shubman Gill's trigger of getting on the front foot and pushing at the ball hard has brought his downfall away from home and has resulted in the terrible average 22.31 - since the Gabba Test match in 2021. Speaking on Cricbuzz the former Royal Challengers Bangalore player said that Shubman has to find a way of balancing his methods when he plays in conditions like South Africa, Australia and England. ""I think Shubman Gill definitely has a slight technical error, which is pushing at the ball. When you play a lot of white ball cricket, you tend to do that. Travis Head does that as well, but what he has found is the method of doing that, and I think that players like Shubman Gill are caught in the trap of the way they bat in India and the way they bat outside,"" Dinesh Karthik said on Cricbuzz. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage ""Which is, the moment you see the ball released from the bowler, your mind tells you that this is a full ball you need to go at it. Batsmen who travel abroad to places like Australia, England and South Africa tune themselves in practice when they see a fuller ball like that, especially against a new ball - A) they play with slightly soft hands, or B) they try and focus on playing the ball as close to the body or leave. Shubman Gill is playing like he would play in India, where he sees the release, goes for the ball with hard hands. Now in Australia, sometimes, in places like the Gabba, playing off the front foot is a little difficult. So at the start of the innings, you have to tell yourself that, I have to leave,"" Karthik pointed out Shubman Gill's critical flaw in his batting. Karthik concluded by stating that Shubmam Gill has been around for a very long time and it was not acceptable for him to get out while playing ordinary shots. Gill was dismissed trying to drive a ball on his front foot at the Gabba.  ""For a No.3 batsman who has been around for so long, Shubman Gill has played a very, very ordinary shot, there are no mincing words here.
