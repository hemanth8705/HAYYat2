Samson now appears to be in pole position to become India’s T20 opener following the dual retirements of Kohli and Sharma after the T20 World Cup victory earlier this year. His three centuries in four T20Is against Bangladesh and South Africa have firmly signaled his intent to secure that spot. ""Yeah, it has been. I had a decent relationship with Gautam Gambir right from a young age. My first IPL team was KKR. When I was 14, they picked me on their B team. At the age of 17, I made it to the KKR main side and that was when KKR won the Championship under Gautam Gambhir,"" Samson said in an interview with the former South African captain, AB de Villiers on YouTube.  Samson's association with Gambhir extended beyond the IPL. The wicketkeeper-batter recounted how Gambhir's words during their time in the Indian team's dressing room bolstered his confidence. ""When he came to the Indian team, in the dressing room he told me 'Sanju, I know what you have. You have something special. I am going to be back you no matter what'. He told me to walk in, go out there and express myself in every innings. That kind of communication from the coach, that gave me clarity and confidence.  The Kerala-born cricketer also spoke about the pressure of living up to Gambhir's faith, especially after a string of low scores. ""After few games of dismissals, you feel pressure because you have a guy who's backing you and you are not performing. I thought 'common Sanju, you need to show something and repay the faith the coach has in',"" Samson added. Samson's determination eventually paid off, and he has since become a vital player in India's cricketing ecosystem. Reflecting on his journey, he expressed gratitude for the turning points in his career. ""By God's grace, something special has happened. I want to continue scoring runs and win games for my country,"" he concluded.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Explained: What the new India-Pakistan ICC agreement means for world cricket

Ravichandran said he had come to terms with his son's decision but admitted that he wished Ashwin had continued playing for the senior national team. ""What was going on in his mind I don’t know.

However, the veteran off-spinner was dropped for the third Test in Brisbane and Ravindra Jadeja took his spot in the XI.

While the decision worked out well for both countries, here's how it affects the rest of the cricketing world.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/india-vs-pakistan-champions-trophy-nuetral-venues-explained-2652458-2024-12-19,"The International Cricket Council on December 19, Thursday, announced that India and Pakistan will play their matches in ICC tournaments at neutral venues till 2028. The deal was announced by the ICC during the confirmation of hybrid model for Champions Trophy 2025.  ICC announced that India will be playing their matches for the Champions Trophy 2025 on a neutral venue - likely UAE - and in return, Pakistan do not need to travel to India to play any world tournaments till 2028 - including the 2026 men's T20 World Cup.  While the Champions Trophy stand-off after India's refusal to travel across the border ended, the new agreement has given rise to fresh concerns.  The ICC released a statement confirming that ""India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue,"" as reported by India Today last week. This will mean that Pakistan will not travel to India for their matches during the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the T20 World Cup in 2026. The tournament, scheduled to begin on February 19 in Pakistan, faced uncertainty due to India's refusal to travel to the host nation. The ICC reiterated in its statement: ""This will apply to the upcoming ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 (hosted by Pakistan), set to be played in February and March 2025, as well as the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 (hosted by India) and the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 (hosted by India and Sri Lanka)."" The statement also announced that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been awarded the hosting rights for the ICC Women's T20 World Cup in 2028, where neutral venue arrangements will also apply.ICC Statement Key Pointers
Champions Trophy will be played in Pakistan, India matches at neutral venue
The 50-over tournament will be played in February-March in 2025
The hybrid model rule will apply for all ICC tournaments hosted by India and Pakistan in 2024-27 cycle
Pakistan will not travel to India for Women's World Cup in 2025 and T20 World Cup in 2026
Pakistan have been awarded the hosting rights for Women's T20 World Cup in 2028
As India Today reported, no compensation for Pakistan for losing a part of Champions Trophy hosting rights 
The schedule for ICC Champions Trophy will be confirmed soon
What Does This Mean for the Rest? While India and Pakistan play at the comfort of their neutral venues in the ICC tournaments, the major problems will be faced by the rest of the cricketing nations who would have to travel more than usual, if they are pitted against India and Pakistan.  Take the 2023 Asia Cup for example. the Asian Cricket Council tournament was co-hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka as India refused travel to Pakistan for the tournament. India were stationed in Sri Lanka with the other teams forced to travel to and fro between countries - playing in drastically different conditions. For example, Bangladesh started their tournament in Pallekele on Ausgust 31, flew out to Lahore to play Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the travelled back to Sri Lanka to play their final two matches - in a space of two weeks. The fate was more or less same for the other countries depending on how deep they went into the tournament. Former BCB operations chairman had spoken to the media where he had sounded helpless about the issue. ""After playing our first match in Kandy, we have to go to Lahore for the second. There is nothing to do, it was ACC's decision. To make the journey a bit more comfortable, the ACC will provide us with a chartered plane. All the teams who have matches in both countries will get the same,"" Jalal had said during the tournament. ""There is always a little discomfort when you have to travel so much. We all know that you have to go to the airport two hours before a flight and have to carry your luggage too. Then there is the issue of jet lag. The distance between Sri Lanka and Pakistan is very long. We have nothing we can do, everyone will playing like this and we have to be okay with ACC's decision,"" he had further added.   Now the question rises, is that fair for the other boards? Forget Asia Cup - a tournament of only 6 teams, the T20 World Cup 2026 is set to have 20 teams in total, out of which upto 12 different teams might end up playing India and Pakistan, in potentially two different countries.ICC Needs to Do Better India Today reported that all major stakeholder boards in international cricket were consulted when the ICC discussed the possibility of adopting a hybrid model. While the boards may not raise concerns regarding the Champions Trophy 2025, logistical challenges could pose significant issues for teams in larger tournaments in the future. If the hybrid model becomes more prevalent due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, the ICC would do well to establish a long-term solution to these challenges. Engaging with member boards before awarding hosting rights and finalising schedules well in advance could help mitigate potential disruptions, ensuring players, broadcasters, and fans face fewer inconveniences. Broadcasters, who are instrumental in bolstering the financial health of the sport, would also welcome such a proactive approach. It would spare them the uncertainty of waiting until the last minute to confirm venues and schedules. The Champions Trophy, expected to take place between February and March, still does not have official venues. Neither the boards nor the fans know where they will need to travel to watch their favourite cricketers in action. The ICC must recognise that its tournaments are global. For cricket to truly grow as a worldwide sport, these events must prioritise fan experience and seamless organisation. Otherwise, the aspiration of making cricket a genuinely global sport will remain a distant dream. With cricket set to feature in the 2028 Olympics, fostering a better global image for the sport has never been more crucial.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Must Watch

Donnarumma’s face was bloodied after being struck by his opponent’s cleat in PSG’s 4-2 victory over Monaco on Wednesday. The Italy international was struck by Singo's studs in the 17th minute as the Monaco defender attempted to hurdle over the sliding goalkeeper after his shot was blocked. Instead, Singo's cleats struck Donnarumma, leaving him with multiple cuts and visible trauma below his right eye. Acknowledging the severity of the injury, Singo took to social media to express remorse. ""My gesture was obviously not intentional, but I was able to see afterwards that he had a significant injury to his face,"" he wrote in French and Italian. ""I wish you a good recovery."" Donnarumma required on-field treatment before being replaced by backup goalkeeper Matvey Safonov. PSG later confirmed the 24-year-old suffered ""a facial trauma with multiple wounds"" and would undergo further medical assessments. Photos of Donnarumma's injuries circulated widely, drawing attention to Singo's earlier yellow card. Despite calls for stricter punishment, officials deemed the collision unintentional, allowing Singo to remain in the game. PSG overcame the early loss of their star goalkeeper and a 2-1 deficit in the second half to secure the win. Gonçalo Ramos scored to level the match, and Ousmane Dembélé delivered a brace to ensure victory, extending PSG's unbeaten league run to 16 matches. ""The objective was achieved. It was a difficult match, we weren't up to par at all times, but they knew how to come back and take the lead,"" PSG manager Luis Enrique said post-match. ""I'm happy with the result."" The win gives PSG a commanding 10-point lead atop the Ligue 1 standings as they enter the Christmas break with 40 points. Olympique de Marseille and Monaco, both on 30 points, trail the league leaders, with Marseille holding a game in hand. While the result reinforces PSG's dominance, Donnarumma's condition remains a concern for the club as they prepare for the remainder of the season.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim on Rashford situation: I will handle itTrending Reel

Badrinath said Ashwin's unexpected decision left him shocked, adding that the off-spinner deserved to exit on a high. R Ashwin surprised many by retiring midway through the all-important Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Minutes after India drew the third Test in Brisbane, Ashwin announced his retirement during a press conference alongside captain Rohit Sharma at the Gabba. Rohit revealed that Ashwin had discussed his retirement plans at the start of the Australia tour and that he had convinced the off-spinner to play the second Test in Adelaide. When asked if Ashwin should have continued until the end of the series, Rohit defended the spinner's decision, emphasising that Ashwin had every right to choose when to step away. Also Read: R Ashwin, a student of the game and professor of spin, leaves an unmatched legacy Amid discussions surrounding the timing of Ashwin's retirement, S Badrinath defended the off-spinner, attributing the decision to the treatment he received over the years. ""I am shocked. I think, to be honest, he wasn't treated fairly. Rohit Sharma said he wanted to leave after the Perth Test match. He wanted to leave when Washington Sundar was played ahead of him. That tells you he was not happy,"" Badrinath told Star Sports Tamil. ""Honestly, I am saying something-it's a big thing for a cricketer from Tamil Nadu. There are many reasons for that. Players from a few other states get better chances. Despite all these odds, Ashwin went on to take more than 500 wickets and became a legend. ""Imagine what he must have gone through. I know he has faced quite a few things. On many occasions, efforts were made to sideline him. But every time, he has bounced back like a phoenix bird,"" he added.I FEEL BAD FOR ASHWIN: BADRINATH Badrinath argued that Ashwin deserved a grand farewell and suggested that players from other states might not have faced the same treatment. ""He can quit cricket, but this is not the way he should have gone out. It should have been a glorious exit. He deserved a glorious exit. It's not fair, it's not right. ""He has not been treated properly. I have closely followed his progress. Because he is from Tamil Nadu, he has faced this. If you ask me if it would have happened with a cricketer from any other state, I don't think so. ""I feel bad for Ashwin. This exit should not have been like this,"" Badrinath added. Notably, R Ashwin's father, in a television interview on Thursday, claimed that Ashwin was humiliated, which he suggested could have been one of the reasons for his sudden retirement. Ashwin, however, remained tight-lipped about the timing of his decision, maintaining that he had no regrets about his cricketing career. The off-spinner said he was already looking forward to representing the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL 2025. Ashwin departed Australia and returned to Chennai as early as Thursday. Meanwhile, the rest of the Indian team travelled from Brisbane to Melbourne, where the Boxing Day Test will be played from December 26.

Speculation around Rashford's tenure at Old Trafford has intensified, particularly after the player’s own comments about seeking a “new challenge” added fuel to the fire. The 27-year-old forward, a product of United’s academy since the age of seven, finds himself at a crossroads. His role under Amorim has been a subject of uncertainty, leading to doubts about his long-term stay at the club. During the pre-match press conference ahead of United's Carabao Cup clash against Tottenham Hotspur on December 20, Amorim refrained from providing detailed answers on Rashford’s situation, emphasising his intent to manage it internally. “It’s a hard situation to comment on...""If this was me, probably I would speak with the manager,"" Amorim said. “If I give a lot of importance to it, it will have big headlines in the papers and if I say it’s not a problem, then my standards are getting low. So I will deal with that, I understand that,” he added. Despite Manchester United’s morale-boosting 2-1 victory over rivals Manchester City on Sunday, Rashford’s absence from the squad, alongside teammate Alejandro Garnacho, sparked further questions. Amorim later clarified that the decision stemmed from his commitment to maintaining high standards within the team, but the omission has only heightened rumors of a potential sale. Rashford’s struggles to recapture his electrifying form from the 2022-23 season, where he scored 30 goals across all competitions, have not gone unnoticed. Under Amorim, who took charge last month, the England international has netted just three goals and has failed to make a significant impact. In United’s Europa League win against Viktoria Plzen, Rashford was substituted as early as the 56th minute, a decision that was met with boos from sections of the Old Trafford crowd. The mounting frustration among fans and the lack of clarity over Rashford’s future have contributed to an uneasy atmosphere. However, Amorim’s direct approach to the matter indicates a focus on resolving the situation without unnecessary public scrutiny. As Manchester United prepare for their Carabao Cup clash, the spotlight remains on Rashford’s next move. Whether the forward reignites his United career or embarks on a new chapter, Amorim’s handling of the scenario could prove pivotal in shaping the club’s immediate future.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  PSG's Donnarumma leaves field bloodied after boot to the face tackle vs Monaco

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/wouldnt-have-let-r-ashwin-retire-like-this-he-deserves-respect-kapil-dev-2652324-2024-12-19,"Former India skipper Kapil Dev was not happy that the star off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin retired from international cricket without getting a proper farewell. Earlier on Wednesday, Ashwin appeared alongside India's captain Rohit Sharma at the post-match press conference to make the announcement. Speculation about his retirement had intensified after Ashwin became visibly emotional and was embraced by Virat Kohli. ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar...Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there, I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,"" Kapil Dev said as quoted by ANI. Ashwin finishes his career with 537 wickets in 106 Test matches, placing him seventh on the all-time wicket-takers list, behind Anil Kumble's tally of 619 for India. His strike rate of 50.73 is the highest among the nine bowlers with over 500 wickets, while his bowling average of 24 ranks third. He achieved five or more wickets in a Test innings on 37 occasions, a number bettered only by Muttiah Muralitharan, who achieved it 67 times. Shane Warne also managed this feat on 37 occasions. Ashwin has also claimed ten or more wickets in a Test match eight times, the highest among Indian bowlers, alongside Kumble. Ashwin's remarkable success at home has contributed significantly to India's impressive record in home Tests over the past decade. He has played every home Test since his debut in 2011, spanning 65 matches. Of those 65 home Tests, India won 47; only Sachin Tendulkar has featured in more Test wins (52). Among all players, only Alastair Cook (89) played more home Tests than Ashwin without missing any. Among all-rounders, the previous highest was Tony Greig (31), and among bowlers, it was Dilip Doshi (21). The Tamil Nadu cricketer is the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket and the second-highest for India, trailing only the legendary Anil Kumble. Ashwin's tally of five-wicket hauls is second only to Sri Lankan great Muttiah Muralitharan. Kapil Dev, who led India to its maiden World Cup triumph in 1983, also highlighted the evolution of Indian cricket and the legacy left behind by players like Ashwin. ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead.

Ravichandran added that he had hoped his son would continue playing for the senior national team.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ashwin-retires-father-ravichandran-humilation-shock-decison-2652272-2024-12-19,"R Ashwin's father, Ravichandran, revealed that the off-spinner's retirement decision came as a surprise to many in their family, adding that he wanted his son to continue playing for the senior national team. Ravichandran alleged that his son was being humiliated, which he suggested could have been one of the reasons for Ashwin's sudden retirement from international cricket. While Ravichandran did not elaborate on the specifics of his allegation, it appears he was alluding to the lack of consistent opportunities for Ashwin in overseas Tests. Ashwin reitred from international cricket midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The off-spinner announced his decision, minutes after the third Test between India and Australia ended in Brisbane on Wednesday, December 18. Ashwin reached Chennai as early as Thursday morning.  ""I too came to know (about his retirement) in the last minute, actually,"" Ravichandran told News18.  ""Retiring is his wish and desire, I cannot interfere in that, but the way in which he gave that, there could be many reasons. Only Ashwin knows, maybe humiliation,"" he added.  When asked if the family was emotional when Ashwin dropped the bombshell on Wednesday, Ashwin's father said: ""No doubt about it (emotional moment for the family) because he was on the field for 14-15 years. The sudden change, retirement, gave us really kind of a shock. ""At the same time, we were expecting that also because humiliation was going on. How long he can just tolerate all those things? Probably, he would have decided on his own,"" he added.  Ashwin's father has been a pillar of support in the off-spinner's career. A fast bowler at club-level cricket, Ravichandran encouraged his son to take up the sport. Ashwin's father backed him when the Tamil Nadu cricketer made the switch from a batter to an off-spinner in a bid to break into the state's Ranji Trophy team as a teenager. MIXED EMOTIONS FOR ASHWIN'S FATHER Ravichandran said he had come to terms with his son's decision but admitted that he wished Ashwin had continued playing for the senior national team. ""What was going on in his mind I don’t know. He just announced. I too accepted it with full pleasure. I did not have any feeling at all for that. But the way he gave his retirement, one part I was very happy, another part not happy because he should have continued,"" he said.  Ashwin chose not to stay with the rest f the squad for the last two Tests of the crucial series. Melbourne will host the Boxing Day Test and Sydney will host the New Year's Test. Both the iconic venues offer more assistance to spin than other pitches Down Under.  Notably, legendary Sunil Gavaskar had criticised the timing of Ashwin's retirement and said Washington Sundar's emergence might have influenced the off-spinner's mid-series retirement.  India picked Sundar ahead of R Ashwin for the first Test of the series in Perth. Ashwin returned to play the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. However, the veteran off-spinner was dropped for the third Test in Brisbane and Ravindra Jadeja took his spot in the XI.  Ashwin has been consistently left out of the XI in overseas Tests, especially in England and Australia. Jadeja was preferred as the lone spinner in the XI because of his better ability with the bat.

Maharaj suffered a left abductor strain during the warm-up session ahead of the first ODI on December 17 and was unable to take the field. Subsequent scans confirmed the injury, sidelining him for the second and third ODIs scheduled for December 19 and December 22. Bjorn Fortuin has been named as Maharaj's replacement for the remaining games. This setback comes just a day after Maharaj was included in South Africa's Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against Pakistan. The Test series, starting on December 26 in Centurion, holds significant importance for South Africa as they aim to secure a spot in next year's World Test Championship (WTC) final. The Proteas currently sit atop the WTC standings with a PCT of 63.33 and need one more win to guarantee a top-two finish. Maharaj will now return to Durban for rehabilitation and will be monitored ahead of the Boxing Day Test. His role as the team’s primary specialist spinner is crucial, having recently delivered a match-winning performance against Sri Lanka in Gqeberha, where he took 5 for 76 to clinch victory. The injury adds to South Africa's growing list of unavailable bowlers. Key pacer Anrich Nortje is sidelined with a fractured toe, Gerald Coetzee and Lungi Ngidi are nursing groin and hip injuries, Nandre Burger is out for the summer due to a stress fracture, and all-rounder Wiaan Mulder is recovering from a finger injury sustained against Sri Lanka. In case Maharaj fails to recover in time for the Test series, options such as Dane Piedt, Senuran Muthusamy, Neil Brand, and Shaun von Berg may be considered. Tabraiz Shamsi, who last played first-class cricket in 2021, also presents a potential, though less likely, alternative. South Africa will look to make up for Maharaj's absence in the ODIs as they aim to continue their strong form against Pakistan. The Test series that follows will further test their depth and resilience as they chase a spot in the WTC final.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Read More |  Not easy for Mohammed Siraj to support world-class Jasprit Bumrah: Brett Lee

Despite their best efforts, Lee believes the gap between Bumrah’s brilliance and the support acts is undeniable. Bumrah has been a standout player in this BGT series, already claiming 21 wickets across three Tests. His devastating spells have left the Australian batting lineup scrambling on Day 5 of the Brisbane Test, proving his mettle as one of the finest fast bowlers in modern cricket. Lee, speaking to Fox Cricket, noted that Bumrah’s consistency and ability to deliver under pressure make him a generational talent. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard “He is world class, Jasprit Bumrah. Unfortunately, they had no Mohammed Shami, but I think the backing of Mohammed Siraj—there has been a bit of conjecture around him—but I think he has bowled really well,"" Lee told Fox Sports. “In my opinion, they have an attack that has some good pace bowlers, but the reason why people say or think he is shouldering the whole load of the attack is that he is so good. He (Bumrah) is miles ahead of any other bowler, and that is no disrespect to the other bowlers going around, but that is how good he is,"" he added. In the second innings of the Brisbane Test, Bumrah etched his name in history by first equalling Kapil Dev's record of 51 wickets, and then taking a couple more to have the most wickets by an Indian bowler in Australia with his 53. His dismissal of Usman Khawaja on Day 5 not only levelled the record but also highlighted his knack for striking at crucial moments.

— BCCI (@BCCI) December 18, 2024 Bumrah's contributions were particularly critical in the first innings of the Gabba Test, where he took a six-wicket haul, almost single-handedly restricting Australia's scoring. While Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep managed to redeem themselves with notable spells in the second innings, it was Bumrah who consistently led the charge. His ability to extract bounce, pace, and movement on Australian tracks has made him a nightmare for opposition batters. The 31-year-old's performances in this series have solidified his reputation as India’s most reliable bowler. With an average below 11 and 20 wickets to his name so far, Bumrah has dominated the bowling charts. With his remarkable achievements, Bumrah continues to carry India’s pace attack, setting an unparalleled standard and proving why he remains an invaluable asset to Indian cricket.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  Watch: Emotional father kisses R Ashwin during hero's welcome at Chennai residence

The 33-year-old's injury woes continued as scans confirmed a right calf strain sustained during the warm-up on the morning of Day 2 of the Brisbane Test. While medical reports suggested the injury was a minor strain, it was enough to sideline Hazlewood for the remainder of the series. Speaking to 7NEWS, Hazlewood expressed his disappointment, saying, ""Just frustrating really. Ticked every box heading into the Test, I could understand if it was my side again, but it was just a random calf strain. Obviously, do a deep dive into it and see what we can come up with ... feels pretty random."" This setback adds to Hazlewood's recent history of injuries, which have seen him miss parts of four of the last six Australian home summers. Notably, the 2020/21 and 2023/24 seasons were the only exceptions where he managed to stay fit throughout. Reflecting on his injury record, Hazlewood said, ""I've had a history of sides and calves, they're probably the two things that have kept me out for the majority over the last four years. But yeah, I sort of just keep adding another layer to the defence, hopefully. Get back into the gym; I've ticked a lot of boxes over the last 12 months."" The fast bowler's primary frustration stems from the timing of his injuries. ""It's just the timing again. They are only little 2-3 week injuries, but missing big games is the frustrating thing,"" he lamented. Despite the disappointment, Hazlewood remains optimistic about returning to full fitness for Australia's two-Test tour of Sri Lanka, scheduled for late January and February. ""That's probably the goal, just take it as it comes over the next few weeks,"" he said. ""No rush to get anything in a hurry, it's just getting everything right. Probably take a few extra days here and there, ticking things off and getting everything right."" Hazlewood's absence adds to Australia's challenges in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a series already marked by intense competition and high stakes.

The former captain accompanied his family during the trip ahead of the fourth Test, starting December 26 in Melbourne.  Notably, Kohli and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah have been travelling separately with their families between cities in Australia. Kohli and Bumrah shared a chartered plane from Adelaide to Brisbane ahead of the third Test, which ended on Wednesday.  Virat Kohli has not been in the best of forms with the bat in the much-talked-about Test series. Kohli hit a hundred in the second innings of the series opener in Perth, but he hasn't lived up to the hype in the first three Tests. Kohli has managed just 126 runs in six innings at an average of 30. Barring the hundred, Kohli has scored 26 runs across five innings.  Kohli has been struggling to control his urge to poke at deliveries bowled wide outside the off-stump --  a plan that Australia have executed well to trouble the Indian batting star.  Kohli will look to return to his best in Melbourne. Team India need their star batter to step up and deliver in the evenly-contest Test series.  India managed to deny Australia a win at the Gabba in the third Test. Despite conceding a 185-run first innings lead, India avoided a defeat, thanks to the wet weather in Brisbane.

— Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) December 19, 2024 It is a little known fact that Zakir Hussain loved cricket as a young kid and wanted to follow the passion of many Indians. Like many young boys, Zakir's early years were not solely dedicated to music. Growing up, he shared a love for cricket, often skipping his tabla practice to play ""gully cricket"" with his friends. But his father, the legendary Ustad Alla Rakha, recognised his son's potential and pushed him to hone his craft, even if it meant making difficult decisions. Zakir recalls a pivotal moment when his father, concerned that his son's budding cricket career might harm his ability to play the tabla, gave him an ultimatum. ""My father once got angry because I broke a finger while playing cricket. I was a keeper. He was so upset because he was worried if I would be able to play the tabla again or not,"" he said. This moment of concern from Ustad Alla Rakha marked a turning point in Zakir's life, steering him fully toward the tabla. Despite his early love for cricket, Zakir went on to make his mark as one of the greatest tabla players in history. Yet, he never strayed far from the world of cricket. Over the years, he formed a close bond with cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar, who became a dear friend. The two shared a unique connection, bonding over their mutual respect and admiration for each other's craft.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/who-is-liam-lawson-f1-driver-who-joins-max-verstappen-at-red-bull-2652561-2024-12-19,"New Zealand driver Liam Lawson will replace Sergio Perez as Max Verstappen's teammate at Red Bull Racing for the 2025 Formula 1 season, the team announced on Thursday. Perez's departure was confirmed the day before, and Lawson’s promotion from Red Bull's sister team, AlphaTauri, had long been anticipated. At just 22 years old, Lawson made his F1 debut in 2023, stepping in for the injured Daniel Ricciardo at the Dutch Grand Prix. He later returned for the final six races of the season after Ricciardo was dropped. Lawson expressed his excitement at the opportunity in a team statement:  ""To be announced as an Oracle Red Bull Racing driver is a lifelong dream for me. This is something I’ve wanted and worked towards since I was eight years old,"" Lawson said. ""It’s been an incredible journey so far. A huge thank you to everyone at VCARB (AlphaTauri) for their support. The last six races have been key in preparing me for this next step. I’m super excited to work alongside Max and learn from a world champion. I have no doubt I’ll gain a lot from his expertise, and I can’t wait to get started."" Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner praised Lawson’s abilities, describing him as ""a real racer, not afraid to mix it with the best and come out on top."" He also highlighted the team's history of promoting talent from within its junior program, mentioning how Lawson follows in the footsteps of champions like Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen himself.  ""Him racing alongside Max—a four-time champion and one of the greatest drivers F1 has ever seen—is certainly a daunting challenge,"" Horner added. ""But I’m confident Liam can rise to the occasion and deliver impressive results for us next year."" Red Bull has seen a series of teammates struggle to match Verstappen's pace since he joined the team in 2016. Perez, who joined in 2021, had a solid 2023 season, finishing second in the championship, though he was a distant 290 points behind Verstappen, who won a record 19 out of 22 races. This year, Perez's form has dramatically declined, finishing only eighth in the standings, while Verstappen claimed his fourth consecutive title. Before Perez, drivers like Alex Albon (now at Williams) and Pierre Gasly (now at Alpine) failed to match Verstappen’s performance, and Daniel Ricciardo, who partnered Verstappen from 2016 to 2018, ultimately left Red Bull for Renault after falling behind his teammate. With Lawson’s promotion, Red Bull will have an open seat at its sister team, AlphaTauri, which will be renamed Racing Bulls next season. French-Algerian driver Isack Hadjar, who finished as the runner-up in Formula 2 this season, is expected to fill the vacancy.WHO IS LIAM LAWSON? Liam Lawson is a promising New Zealand racing driver who has rapidly ascended through the ranks of motorsport to compete at the highest level in Formula 1. Born on February 11, 2002, in Hastings, New Zealand, and raised in Pukekohe, Lawson began his competitive racing career at the age of seven with karting. He was mentored by three-time New Zealand Grand Prix winner Ken Smith, which played a significant role in his early development. Lawson quickly made a name for himself in junior formulae, winning his first title in the NZ F1600 Championship in 2015 as a privateer. He continued to excel, finishing as the runner-up in the 2017 Australian F4, 2018 ADAC F4, and 2019 Euroformula Open championships. Lawson's breakthrough year was 2019, where he won the Toyota Racing Series in New Zealand with M2 Competition, securing the championship title just a day before his 17th birthday. He also made his debut in the FIA Formula 3 Championship with MP Motorsport and participated in the Euroformula Open with Motopark, where he finished second in the standings. In 2020, Lawson returned to the Toyota Racing Series, finishing second, and continued in FIA Formula 3 with Hitech Grand Prix, where he won three races and finished fifth in the standings. His progression to Formula 2 in 2021 saw him secure his maiden victory and two additional podiums, concluding the season in ninth place. He also debuted in the DTM with AF Corse, driving a Ferrari 488 GT3 Evo 2020, and narrowly missed the championship title by three points. Lawson's performance in Formula 2 improved significantly in 2022, driving for Carlin and finishing third in the standings with four wins and six other podium finishes. This success led to his Formula 1 debut during the first free practice sessions for the Belgian, Mexican, and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix, driving for AlphaTauri and Red Bull. In 2023, Lawson competed in the Super Formula Championship with Team Mugen, supported by Red Bull, and served as a test and reserve driver for both AlphaTauri and Red Bull Racing. He made his first F1 race appearances as a temporary replacement for Daniel Ricciardo at AlphaTauri, outperforming his teammate Yuki Tsunoda in several races and earning valuable points for the team. For the 2024 season, Lawson was announced as a permanent F1 driver for Visa Cash App RB following the Singapore Grand Prix, replacing Ricciardo. Despite his promising start, he has faced criticism from teammate Sergio Pérez regarding his aggressive driving style and attitude on and off the track. Pérez has suggested that Lawson needs to adopt a more humble and respectful approach to succeed in Formula 1. Lawson's career is marked by his ability to win on debut in various categories and his quick adaptation to new series. However, as he navigates the highly competitive world of Formula 1, he will need to balance his aggressive driving with the strategic and respectful approach that the sport demands.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  Formula 1: Sergio Perez and Red Bull part ways months after contract extensionTrending Reel

After the drawn third Test in Brisbane, Rohit Sharma sounded miffed after being persistently asked for an update on Shami’s availability. Sharma put the onus on NCA and said that the body should update the Indian team on Shami's condition. “I think it’s high time somebody from NCA talks about him, where he is rehabbing... Those guys are the ones who need to come up and give us some kind of update. I understand he’s playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well. We won’t take any risks unless we are 200% sure about his fitness,"" Rohit had said. Shami’s participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy is seen as a key step towards determining his availability for the upcoming international assignments, including the Champions Trophy.

On Thursday, India beat the West Indies in the deciding game to claim the series 2-1. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-india-vs-west-indies-womens-t20i-series-smriti-mandhana-drought-2652634-2024-12-19,"Smriti Mandhana opened up on how she motivated Team India to end their five-year-long wait to win a Women’s T20I series on home soil. Since September 2019, India could not secure a series win at home in five series on the trot. But on Thursday, December 19, the Women in Blue defeated Hayley Matthews’ West Indies by 60 runs to win the series 2-1. India Women vs West Indies Women, 3rd T20I Updates India started the series with a thumping 49-run win, but slumped to a nine-wicket defeat in the second game on Tuesday. In the decider, India recorded their highest team total of 217 for four after which they restricted the visitors to 157 for nine. “After the last match, I told the girls it has been five years that we have not won a T20I series. That does not reflect the team we are. I told them that today, we have an opportunity to do that and we just want to keep doing the right things,” Mandhana said in the post-match presentation ceremony.‘Raghvi was impressive’ Mandhana also had high praise for youngster Raghvi Bist, who scored an unbeaten 31 off 22 balls with two fours and a six. Mandhana, who made 77 runs and took down a number of T20I records, said that she was awestruck with Raghvi’s strokeplay. “The way Raghvi batted was impressive. She came in with lots of intent and hitting her fourth or fifth ball for six, I would not have been able to do that in my second match,” Mandhana said. Richa Ghosh was also at her very best after she smashed the joint-fastest fifty in Women’s T20Is off 18 balls, equalling Sophie Devine and Phoebe Litchfield’s record. “Richa's innings was also amazing, as it was the other day, but could not appreciate that unfortunately because of the result,” Mandhana added. After the T20Is, India are now set to face the West Indies in a three-match ODI series from December 22 onwards.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 19, 2024Also Read |  India Women thrash West Indies in decider to win first home T20I series in five yearsTrending Reel

India won the decider courtesy of some sensational batting from the Indian unit. In the post match presentation, Ghosh credited stand-in captain Smriti Mandhana setting the stage for the Indian batters to fire. On Thursday, December 19, playing at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, Richa Ghosh hit the joint-fastest fifty in the women's T20Is. Richa went berserk against the Windies side and hit 3 fours and 5 sixes. Richa broke Smriti Mandhana's record to become the fastest half-centurion in WT20I by an Indian. Mandhana had held the record for nearly 5 years now. She had slammed her half-century in 24 balls against New Zealand in February 2019. India Women vs West Indies Women: 3rd T20I Highlights Richa's sensational innings combined with Mandhana's fireworks at the top meant that India registered the biggest total in the WT20Is. The Indian team scored 217 runs from their 20 overs, after losing 4 wickets. Smriti Mandhana started the assault at the top, with 77 off just 47 balls. After Mandhana got out, Jemimah Rodrigues (39 off 28), Raghvi Bist (31* off 22) and Richa Ghosh (54* off 21 balls) stole the show. India hit a total of 7 sixes, 5 of which came off Richa's bat. The explosive wicketkeeper-batter got out in the penultimate ball of the final over, trying to hit a six against Aaliyah Alleyne. After the match, Richa credited Mandhana for setting the stage for the rest of the Indian batters. ""We got a good start today. The way Mandhana played, I just continued to do that. I play in the same way in the nets. I like to hit the ball when it is in the slot. Feels good as all of us contributed to the team's victory. Happy with my contribution too,"" Richa said. IND W vs WI W: 3rd T20I Match Report Mandhana on the other hand hailed India's maiden T20I series victory at home in 5 years. She said that the team was aware of the record and want to push themselves to win the bilateral series. ""It's been five years we haven't won a T20I series in India. That was the chat earlier in the day. We had the chance to do it after 5 years. Need to keep doing the right things now. With the kind of batting line-up, we have some new youngsters. So need to take responsibility. More than timing the ball, I try to put my head into playing according to the situation. Liked the way Richa Ghosh batted. Girls stepped up today, they played with a lot of intent.

Speaking ahead of the Boxing Day Test match, Langer showered praise on Bumrah and said that the India seamer must be a nightmare to face for the batters. Bumrah has been in sensational touch in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy so far. The leader of the India pace attack has 21 wickets after 3 Test matches, 7 more than the next best Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. Bumrah's ability to seam and swing the new ball has come in handy for the Indians as they have gotten wickets on demand from the pacer. “I would hate to face him. He is like Wasim Akram. For me, he is a right-hand version of Wasim Akram, and every time I am asked the question ‘Who is the best bowler you have ever faced’, I say, Wasim Akram,"" Justin Langer told The Nightly on Thursday, December 19. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “They have got good pace and the great bowlers just hit the same spot every time, and they have got a good bouncer, so it makes them a bloody nightmare. He has got the ability to swing the ball both ways, his seam is literally picture perfect."" “If you present a perfect seam and it comes perfectly out of the fingers as it does with him, you get the double whammy, swing in the right conditions and if it hits the rope it can go either way. That’s what Akram used to do and was a nightmare to face,"" he added. “I would hate to face Bumrah. He’s a great competitor, he bowls good pace and he’s just awesome. I said at the start of the series, if Bumrah stays fit, it is going to be a really tough summer for the Australian batters, if he doesn’t, then I think Australia will win the series easily, and I still maintain that,"" Langer concluded.

A stellar batting display, led by the likes of Babar Azam, captain Mohammad Rizwan, and Kamran Ghulam, coupled with a sensational bowling spell by Shaheen Afridi, sealed Pakistan’s third consecutive ODI series win. Finding form after a long slump, Babar Azam got running alongside Mohammad Rizwan who anchored the innings with a 115-run partnership, showcasing some crucial grit in their approach. Followed by Kamran Ghulam’s explosive knock of 63 off just 32 balls provided the late surge, propelling Pakistan to a formidable total of 330 runs. The batting trio’s efforts left South Africa with a daunting chase, compounded by Afridi’s fiery 4/47 spell that dismantled the Proteas’ batting lineup. SA vs PAK, 2nd ODI: Highlights South Africa’s chase began with promise, reminiscent of their approach in Paarl, but faltered under pressure. The hosts struggled to build partnerships, relying heavily on skipper Heinrich Klaasen, who played a heroic knock of 97 off 74 balls. Klaasen’s innings stood out as the only consistent effort in an otherwise lacklustre batting display by the Proteas, who were bowled out for just 248. Afridi’s lethal pace and reverse swing proved decisive, as he claimed crucial wickets both at the top and during the death overs. His return to form bolstered Pakistan’s all-round performance, which has been their most complete display in ODIs over the past six weeks. The series victory provides Pakistan a significant morale boost ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, set to be held at their home. For the Proteas, the loss highlighted the need to address inconsistencies in their batting and rethink their aggressive approach. Rizwan-led Pakistan, rejuvenated after their T20I series loss to South Africa, now shift their focus to the final ODI in Sandton on December 22, aiming for a series whitewash. A clean sweep against a competitive side like South Africa would further solidify Pakistan’s growing momentum in international cricket.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Leave my dad alone: Ashwin reacts to father's controversial retirement statement

Known for his cricketing intellect and tactical acumen, Ashwin was a master in home conditions, orchestrating numerous match-winning performances. His remarkable form in 2016 saw him claim both the ICC Cricketer of the Year and ICC Test Cricketer of the Year awards, becoming only the third Indian to receive the prestigious Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy. Ashwin was more than just a bowler; his contributions with the bat added significant value. A reliable lower-order batter, he amassed 3503 Test runs, including five centuries. While Ashwin has bid farewell to international cricket, he remains committed to playing club cricket and the IPL. In the IPL 2025 mega auction, he was re-signed by Chennai Super Kings for Rs 9.25 crore, marking a homecoming to the franchise where he initially rose to prominence.

 The defining moment came when Kohli struck two stunning sixes off Haris Rauf's last two deliveries, reigniting India’s hopes. The equation boiled down to 16 off the final over, bowled by Mohammad Nawaz. Kohli continued his brilliance, running hard between the wickets and launching a six despite Pandya’s dismissal on the first ball. Drama peaked when a no-ball and subsequent free-hit brought India within two runs of victory with two balls to spare. It was Ashwin who showcased nerves of steel, calmly lifting the final delivery over the infield to seal a famous win, with Kohli unbeaten on 82 in what many called one of his greatest innings.The Emotional Connection Before Ashwin’s official announcement, an emotional embrace between Kohli and Ashwin in the Brisbane dugout had sparked speculation about the spinner’s retirement.

The abruptness of his decision has left fans and experts alike grappling with the void his departure creates. For a player of his stature, the goodbye felt all too quiet, almost unworthy of a cricketer who has done so much for Indian cricket. India’s most successful off-spinner deserved a grand farewell. He merited the roar of a packed stadium, a guard of honour, and the chance to weave his magic one last time on the field. Instead, his announcement came in a room full of reporters at the end of the third Test in Brisbane. There were no rousing tributes or emotional speeches to a stadium filled with adoring fans. Ashwin’s final words as an Indian cricketer were shared in the dressing room, amidst scattered teammates, a low-key farewell to a high-impact career. Also read: R Ashwin was not treated fairly, his sudden retirement a shock: Ex-CSK teammate The only solace is that Ashwin walked away on his terms. As skipper Rohit Sharma observed, the off-spinner saw the writing on the wall and decided there was no point in continuing if his services were no longer required. Still, one cannot help but wonder if the lack of a regular spot in the playing XI, despite his extraordinary record, weighed heavily on his decision.ASHWIN DESERVED A BETTER FAREWELL Ashwin’s father, Ravichandran, alleged that his son faced humiliation, which may have influenced his decision to retire during India’s ongoing tour of Australia. While he could not pinpoint a specific incident, it appears he was pointing fingers at how his son was repeatedly overlooked in overseas tours. World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev lamented the unceremonious nature of Ashwin’s departure, stressing the importance of a respectful send-off for such a legendary all-rounder. “The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar... Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there; I wouldn’t have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,” Kapil Dev said. Former chief selector MSK Prasad echoed similar sentiments, remarking, “While retirement decisions are personal, a legendary farewell would certainly have been a fitting tribute to his illustrious career. It would not only celebrate his achievements but also allow fans, teammates, and the cricketing fraternity to express their gratitude for his immense contributions. Regardless of when or how he chooses to step away, his legacy as one of India’s greatest cricketers is forever etched in history.” Ashwin’s retirement marks not just the end of a glittering career but also the conclusion of an intellectual journey that redefined the art of spin bowling. From his debut in 2011, Ashwin has constantly evolved. His off-breaks expanded into an arsenal of carrom balls, arm balls, and deceptive top-spinners. His genius lay in being both a bowler of the past and a visionary for the future. With 537 Test wickets—second only to Anil Kumble among Indians—his numbers speak for themselves, though his legacy extends far beyond statistics. While legends like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli are often hailed as India’s greatest match-winners in cricket history, Ravichandran Ashwin has quietly claimed a unique distinction—being the backbone of India’s dominance in home Tests. With a career spanning 15 years, Ashwin’s contributions to India’s Test victories, particularly in home conditions, are unparalleled. Of the 106 Tests he has played, India emerged victorious in 61—a feat surpassed only by Tendulkar (72) and Kohli (62) in terms of Test wins. Ashwin’s win percentage of 57.55% ranks as the sixth-highest among players who have participated in over 100 Tests, a remarkable accomplishment considering the stiff competition from icons like Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath, and Shane Warne, who thrived during Australia’s dominant era of the 1990s and early 2000s.CONSTANT NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF Despite his brilliance, Ashwin’s career was not without its challenges. He faced criticism for overanalysing situations and was often sidelined in overseas Tests. Ever since Ravindra Jadeja surpassed him as a Test batter, and conditions in England, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia favoured a fourth fast bowler over a spinner in the No.8 spot, Ashwin frequently found himself benched. Out of the 50 Tests India played in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) during his career, Ashwin featured in only 26. Even so, Ashwin persevered, proving time and again that he belonged amongst cricket’s elite. His partnership with Ravindra Jadeja became legendary, their combined efforts dismantling opposition teams on Indian pitches. Ashwin’s cerebral edge often made the decisive difference, though his artistry was sometimes overshadowed by the dominance of batting stars like Kohli, Sharma, and Pant. Ashwin’s retirement serves as a poignant reminder of how cricket often undervalues its thinkers. Even former India cricketer and women’s team coach WV Raman remarked, “If I am ever convinced about something, it is that intelligence is not always an advantage.” In a sport that glorifies instinct and aggression, deep thinkers like Ashwin are frequently underappreciated. Throughout his career, Ashwin battled not just challenging conditions and gritty batters but also the struggle to be taken seriously. Despite over 500 Test wickets, critics hesitated to place him amongst the game’s greatest. Perhaps, in time, as India searches for someone of his calibre, his contributions will be fully recognised. Every time, he went overseas, he needed to prove himself all over again. His numbers in Australia and England drastically improved after the 2014 tour Down Under. Yet, he was benched for the majority of overseas tours, even in his prime, as India picked Ravindra Jadeja as the lone spinner.  It is a cruel irony that the career of India’s greatest match-winner ends with four consecutive Test losses—three against New Zealand at home and the Adelaide Test in Australia. For someone as emotional as Ashwin, the timing of his retirement is intriguing. One might have expected him to play a farewell Test, savour the moment, and perhaps have his family present—though they were absent at the Gabba. However, Ashwin is not someone who would complain that he retired without a proper farewell. Perhaps, the spin maestro will celebrate that he played over 100 Tests for India, shedding tears of joy rather than sorrow. If his career didn’t have a perfect ending, it simply wasn’t meant to be.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Jasprit Bumrah is the right-handed Wasim Akram: Justin LangerMust Watch

Rishad Hossain was the standout performer with 3/20, executing a sharp run-out of Johnson Charles and dismissing Rovman Powell, Gudakesh Motie, and Alzarri Joseph. The hosts struggled to build partnerships, with Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran offering the only resistance. This sweep marked a significant turnaround for Bangladesh, coming after a 3-0 loss in the ODI series. The emphatic performances from Jaker Ali and Rishad Hossain signal promising prospects for the team as they build momentum for future challenges.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  R Ashwin responds to Virat Kohli's tribute, reveals poignant MCG message

28674c32-55d9-4384-9b56-28f9b97df423,"Australia drop Nathan McSweeney for Boxing Day Test, add teenage opener to squadBorder-Gavaskar Trophy: Australia named a 15-man squad for the last two tests against India on Friday. In a bold call, the Australian selectors dropped Nathan McSweeney and roped in 19-year-old Sam Konstas. Pacers Jhye Richardson and Sean Abbott also returned to the squad. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-squad-nathan-mcsweeney-dropped-sam-konstas-jhye-richardson-2652715-2024-12-20,"Australia dropped their latest Test debutant, Nathan McSweeney, after just the first three matches in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Australia announced a 15-member squad for the last two Tests of the series. The fourth Test, a Boxing Day blockbuster, starts December 26 in Melbourne. Teenager Sam Konstas has been added to the squad and he is likely to open the batting with Usman Khawaja at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  While the decision to drop 25-year-old Nathan McSweeney after just three Tests has divided opinions, Australia have added the attacking Sam Konstas in a bid to inject some firepower at the top of the order. McSweeney, who made his debut in Perth, had a tough time dealing with Jasprit Bumrah in the first three games.  Meanwhile, Australia have also recalled express pacer Jhye Richardson to the squad for the first time in three years. Along with him, pacer Sean Abbott and Tasmania all-rounder Beau Webster have been added to the squad, which is 15 members in size.  AUSTRALIA SQUAD FOR LAST 2 TESTS OF BGT 2024-25 Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.WHY WAS MCSWEENEY DROPPED?  25-year-old McSweeney was slotted into the opening spot in Perth despite him being a middle-order batter in domestic cricket. McSweeney struggled to get going and keep the scoreboard moving in the first three Tests of the series.  While Usman Khawaja, the senior opener, has also struggled, scoring with an average of just 12 and a top score of 21 so far in the series.  However, Australia have backed their senior opener and dropped the youngster, who is just three Test matches old. McSweeney has managed 72 runs in his first six innings, the lowest by an Australian opener in 50 years in the first six of their career in the longest format of the game.  Chief selector George Bailey explained the decision, backing McSweeney's ability to find success at the highest level, adding Sam Konstas' ability to score at a good pace worked in his favour.  ""We remain confident Nathan has the ability and temperament to succeed at Test level in the future,"" Bailey said. ""It was a difficult decision to leave him out,"" he added. BIG BACKING FOR SAM KONSTAS  Australia have rewarded 19-year-old Sam Konstas for some exciting performances in the ongoing season. Known for his aggressive approach, Konstas is expected to fill the void that David Warner left in the Australian Test team.  Konstas has been making significant waves in the 2024-25 cricket season with his impressive performances across formats.  The 19-year-0ld smashed 56 off just 37 balls for Sydney Thunder in their Big Bash League match on December 17 in Canberra against the Adelaide Strikers.  In the Sheffield Shield, playing for New South Wales, Konstas has scored two centuries and accumulated 369 runs across six innings, highlighting his form in first-class cricket. One of his most standout performances came in the practice match for the Prime Minister's XI against India, where he scored a blistering century. In this pink-ball match at Manuka Oval in Canberra, Konstas hit 107 runs off just 97 balls, including 14 fours and one six, showcasing his exceptional stroke play and ability to handle challenging conditions. Against India A, Konstas made a notable impact, scoring 92 runs in four innings, including a solid 73 off 128 balls in the second unofficial Test in October-November.  Meanwhile, the injury to Josh Hazlewood has forced Australia to bring back Sean Abbott and hand a recall to Jhye Richardson. Australia are looking to provide enough cover for their fast bowlers as the turnaround time between the fourth and the fifth Tests is just three days.  With injury concerns surrounding Mitchell Marsh, Australia also recalled exciting all-rounder Beau Webster. Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Trending Reel

In the auction that took place in Bengaluru, MI picked Maheshwari for Rs 20 lakhs. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-exclusive-interview-akshita-maheshwari-mumbai-indians-wpl-2025-deal-2652644-2024-12-20,"Khelo, kya fark padta hain kaun kya bol raha hain In India, where a layman is still getting accustomed to the concept of women’s cricket, playing the sport for a female athlete comes with its fair share of challenges. For Akshita Maheshwari, Mumbai Indians’ new recruit in the Women’s Premier League, it wasn’t any different. In Jaipur, the youngster was in a circle where cricket is still considered a male-dominated sport, but what was different was her family’s support. When she was in her teens, Akshita had to face rejections from academies that did not promote the women’s game, but they did not stop her from pursuing her dreams passionately. Once she found her way, she kept taking mini strides, rising through age group cricket and, in 2024, landed her maiden WPL deal with the 2023 champions. “I always used to play with my brothers in the terrace, but not that intensely as there were not many girls where my father bought a new house. I never liked staying at home, and preferred going out and playing. My father had to face questions in our colony about me playing with boys every time,” Akshita said in an exclusive interview with India Today.   Also Read: WPL 2025 Auction: Dottin, Simran, Kamalini earn big paycheques, Sneh Rana unsold “But he, my mother and brother supported me; they said, ‘khelo, kya fark padta hain kaun kya bol raha hain, aapko jo accha lagta hain wo karo (play, it doesn’t matter what people are saying, do what your heart says). Then I got to know that there are academies and I looked out for Neerja Modi Academy. “But they said that they don’t teach girls. It was five to six years ago. I went to the KL Saini Cricket Academy for running and I saw another girl training. I immediately called my father, after which I registered there, and it started from there,” Akshita said.The surreal moment With only 19 slots to be filled in the mini-auction, Akshita had to fight with 122 players who threw their hat in the ring. In the opening round and first accelerated round, her name did not pop up. But in the second accelerated round, the franchises shortlisted her, and it was MI, who roped her in at a base price of Rs 20 lakhs. Akshita was plying her trade with Rajasthan in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy when MI picked her.

— Mumbai Indians (@mipaltan) December 17, 2024 “I was in Haryana with my teammates, but wasn’t watching the auction as expectations can get the better of you. But I started watching and knew that my name was there. Then I heard Reema Malhotra di chanting my name ‘Akshita, Akshita’ and I was happy that they are aware of our performance and are tracking us. That increases your hope and expectations. I told my roommate that if my name comes up in the second round of the accelerated auction, well and good, if not, then I will try next year,” Akshita recalled. “Then I got to know that out of the list of 17 players, my name was there. When I was picked by MI, I was happy, but I found it hard to believe in the beginning. Once it happened, my family was very happy, and I started getting calls; it was surreal.”Unexpected things, big goals Interestingly, the WPL deal with MI wasn’t the beginning of Akshita’s association with Mumbai. The Women’s Under-23 One-Day Trophy earlier this year turned her career around. She finished as the second-highest wicket-taker with 23 wickets from eight games at an economy rate of 2.66. The 24-year-old took two hat-tricks and both of them came at venues in Mumbai. Akshita took a hat-trick against Mizoram at the Sachin Tendulkar Gymkhana in Kandivili, where she finished with stupendous figures of 6-4-6-4. Then, at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy at BKC, she took her second hat-trick when she demolished Odisha with figures of 10-1-36-3. On the back of her performance, Rajasthan went through to the quarters where they lost to Haryana by 15 runs. After bagging the WPL deal, Akshita raised her game and helped Rajasthan beat Meghalaya by five wickets in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy match with figures of 10-3-23-4.

 “They say Mumbai sapno ka sheher hain (city of dreams) and it was for me as we had matches at BKC and other venues. Sometimes, unexpected things help you achieve your goals. It was my last year in the U23 tournament and it gave me so much that I entered the WPL. And even more surprisingly, it was Mumbai who picked me and so, I have developed a strong connection with the city,” Akshita said. After honing her skills at the KL Saini Academy, Akshita moved to the GR Cricket Ground in Jaipur and trained under Ashwani Kherwa and Jagaimran Singh. The all-rounder said that it was the words of wisdom from her coaches that helped her move forward. “The spells were very important for me as, two years ago, I wasn’t able to break into the Rajasthan team. But then I got a chance and my coach, Ashwani (Kherwa) Sir, also supported me and gave me belief that I could do it.The learning and idols

 Even as Akshita is known for her fiery fast bowling, she is also someone who can play the big shots lower down the order. MI are known for going for quality all-rounders, including Nat Sciver-Brunt, Amelia Kerr and Hayley Matthews, with South Africa’s Nadine de Klerk being the newest addition to the team. Akshita is eager to rub shoulders with the world’s very best. “Basics are very important. The stronger our basics, the better we will get. I was a part of the Senior Women’s Challenger Trophy, and although I did not play, I got the confidence and learning. I carried that confidence into the One-Day Trophy, which showed in my bowling, batting and fielding. If I play alongside them, my cricket is bound to improve. I want to work on myself and learn as much as possible,” Akshita said. For Akshita, the Indian pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar are her idols. Bumrah is currently on the tour of Australia where he has shouldered the Indian bowling attack with wickets at regular intervals. Bumrah also won the Player of the Match award in the Perth Test. Similar to Bumrah, Akshita talked about building a reputation as someone reliable in the bowling department. “I didn’t watch a lot of cricket earlier. My father was fond of cricket, and so we watched men’s cricket on TV and not women’s cricket. I am a big fan of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah, they are my idols. They are of very high quality. I want to become like them that whenever my team needs a breakthrough, the captain will look up to Akshita to do that. This is how I want to build myself,” she said.Harmanpreet fandom and fastest Shabnim

 Harmanpreet Kaur has played several match-winning knocks for India across all three formats. Akshita sounded excited at the prospect of picking her brains and sharing the same change-room. “I have butterflies in my stomach. She is the captain of the Indian team and sharing the dressing room with an experienced player like her, attending team meetings, net sessions and bowling to her will help me a lot,” Akshita said. Akshita also wants to learn the tricks of the trade from former South African speedster Shabnim Ismail. Earlier this year, Shabnim recorded the fastest ball in women’s cricket when she clocked 132.1 kmph (82.08 miles per hour during the WPL match between MI and Delhi Capitals. “She has bowled the fastest delivery and I just want to see her. Once I see her, talk to her and take her experience, I will be able to apply them in my game. It’s not possible to learn everything overnight, it will take time. But the experience is going to help me get better,” Akshita signed off. In the inaugural edition, it was left-arm Saika Ishaque, who broke into the Indian team after her impressive performances for MI. Hence, there’s every chance for Akshita to make a mark in the upcoming WPL and give herself a chance to break into the Indian team. With the likes of Tejal Hasabnis, Saima Thakor, Priya Mishra and Raghvi Bist donning the national colours in the last two months, Akshita would know that a few decent performances for MI could just be the tonic her career needs for now.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  IND-W vs WI-W: How Smriti Mandhana inspired India to end 5-year drought at homeMust Watch

Tottenham took control early in the game, with Dominic Solanke netting twice and Dejan Kulusevski adding a third to put the hosts ahead 3-0 by the 54th minute. However, two critical mistakes by Spurs’ 36-year-old goalkeeper Fraser Forster dramatically shifted the momentum.

But moments later, under pressure from Zirkzee, he attempted a poor pass intercepted by Bruno Fernandes. Fernandes set up Zirkzee for a simple finish, making it 3-1. The drama heightened seven minutes later when Forster mishandled another backpass, allowing Amad Diallo to slide in and deflect his clearance into the net for 3-2. Diallo, who recently scored a decisive goal against Manchester City, came close to an equaliser with a long-range effort that rattled Forster further.

Australia recently announced their 15-member team for the final two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with Konstas coming in for Mcsweeny, who had only made his Test debut in this BGT series opener in Perth. McSweeney, who debuted in the ongoing series, was dropped after just three matches, a move that sparked mixed reactions amongst fans and former cricketers alike. However, Bailey emphasised that the decision was made to strengthen Australia’s top-order batting, which has struggled against India’s formidable pace attack, particularly Jasprit Bumrah, who has been in some record-breaking form down under. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""We remain confident Nathan has the ability and temperament to succeed at Test level in the future...It was a difficult decision to leave him out,"" Bailey told cricket.com.au on Mcsweeny. ""It has clearly been a challenge at the top of the order for batters throughout the series, and we want to provide the option of a different line-up for the next two matches... Sam gets a call-up to the Test squad for the first time. His style of batting offers a point of difference and we look forward to watching his game develop further,"" he added. Australia's batting unit took a concerning shape in the second innings of the Brisbane Test, where the lineup faltered despite a stellar first-innings performance. Travis Head had smashed 152 off 160 balls, and Steve Smith added a solid 101, but their collapse in the latter innings raised questions about the consistency of their opening pair in Mcsweeny and Usman Khawaja. McSweeney, who was shifted to the opener’s role despite being a middle-order batter in domestic cricket, struggled to adapt, scoring only 72 runs across six innings—a record low for an Australian opener in their first six innings in over five decades. Khawaja, the senior opener, has also faced challenges, averaging just 12 runs in the series with a top score of 21. However, the selectors chose to back Khawaja while dropping McSweeney, prioritising experience over youth.Can Konstas make chance count? The inclusion of Konstas reflects a bold decision aimed at revitalising the lineup. Konstas has been in stellar form during the 2024-25 domestic season, with his most notable performance coming in a pink-ball practice match against India for the Prime Minister's XI. He scored a blistering 107 off 97 balls at Manuka Oval, including 14 boundaries and a six, showcasing his ability to thrive under pressure and adapt to challenging conditions. Bailey expressed confidence in Konstas, highlighting his aggressive stroke play and versatility, which could provide the Australian batting order with much-needed stability and dynamism in the high-stakes Boxing Day Test set to begin on December 26 in Melbourne.AUSTRALIA SQUAD FOR LAST 2 TESTS OF BGT 2024-25 Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  R Ashwin retires: India's greatest match-winner deserved more respect

After months of anticipation, Konstas has finally received his Test call-up for the final two matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. It promises to be a baptism by fire for the young New South Wales cricketer, but the Australian cricket community is quietly confident that Konstas will thrive under pressure.   On Friday, December 20, Australia announced a 15-man squad for the last two Tests against India. With the series level at 1-1 after Australia were denied victory at the Gabba, the selectors have made some pivotal changes to the squad. In a major decision, they have dropped 25-year-old Nathan McSweeney after just three Test matches. McSweeney, who struggled against the Jasprit Bumrah-led pace attack, scored only 72 runs across six innings—the lowest tally for an Australian Test opener in their first six knocks since 1974.   Usman Khawaja fared no better. The 38-year-old managed just 63 runs in six innings but retained his place due to the invaluable experience he offers.   Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Australia appear to have learned a hard lesson. When McSweeney, primarily a middle-order batsman in domestic cricket, was added to the squad at the start of the series, doubts were raised about his ability to handle India’s high-quality attack. McSweeney struggled to keep the scoreboard moving, and Khawaja’s poor form exacerbated the fragility of Australia’s top order.WHO IS SAM KONSTAS By including Sam Konstas, Australia hope to inject aggressive intent at the top of the order. Konstas enters the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with an impressive record across formats.   In December 2024, Konstas made his debut for the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League. Opening alongside David Warner, he smashed a blistering 57 off 26 balls, marking the fastest half-century in Sydney Thunder’s history. His innings included eight boundaries and two sixes, playing a key role in the team’s victory over the Adelaide Strikers.   Konstas also featured for the Prime Minister’s XI in a pink-ball warm-up match against India at Manuka Oval. He scored an outstanding 107 off 97 balls, including 14 fours and a six, against a formidable Indian bowling attack featuring Mohammed Siraj and Ravindra Jadeja. This performance further solidified his reputation as a rising star in Australian cricket.   In October-November 2024, Konstas was selected for Australia A in their series against India A. In the second unofficial Test, he played a crucial role with an unbeaten 73 in the second innings, helping secure a victory for his team. 'LIKE CLARKE, WARNER AND SMITH'  With 736 runs across formats this summer, Konstas has drawn widespread acclaim from cricketing legends and commentators. Former England captain Michael Vaughan had championed his inclusion in the Test squad, describing him as ""fearless"" and ""unflappable.""   England’s World Cup-winning former coach and Sydney Thunder coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised Konstas’s attitude, comparing his confidence to that of David Warner, Steve Smith, and Michael Clarke.   “What I can say is Sam has a self-confidence you don’t see in very many. I’ve only seen it in a few over the years, and all of those players were outstanding Test players and international players, guys like Clarke and Haddin, Warner and Smith,” Bayliss had said, as quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald.   With 718 runs at an average of 42.23 in 11 first-class matches, Konstas has already shown immense promise. If he debuts in Melbourne, he will become only the third Australian cricketer in the last 40 years to make his Test debut as a teenager, following in the footsteps of Pat Cummins and Ashton Agar.

Known for his love of pop culture, Ashwin used a viral line from Thalapathy Vijay's recent blockbuster Tamil film, The Greatest of All Time, to wish his former teammate. Ashwin retired from international cricket on Wednesday, midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. He concluded his career as one of the greatest off-spinners in history, taking 537 wickets in 106 Tests. Sundar had penned a heartfelt tribute to Ashwin, saying the senior cricketer has been inspiration and mentor.  Washington Sundar, 25, has been groomed to take over the off-spin responsibilities from Ashwin in red-ball cricket. ""Thupakkiya pudinga washiii! (Hold the gun, Washi)"" Ashwin said, adding: ""The 2 minutes you spoke that night in the get-together was the best."" For the uninitiated, Ashwin's comment referenced a popular line from Thalapathy Vijay, who symbolically passed the baton to rising Tamil film star Sivakarthikeyan, who played a cameo in the film. Vijay, who had announced that GOAT would be his penultimate film before entering politics, handed over the torch to Sivakarthikeyan, a promising commercial hero.

 Ashwin had been one of the pillars of the Test team, especially in home conditions, for over a decade. On the other hand, Sundar was recalled to the Test side for the first time in three years for a home series against New Zealand in October-November.  Sundar made the most of the opportunity, picking up 16 wickets in two Tests and finishing the series, which India lost 0-3, as the leading wicket-taker. Ashwin managed just 9 wickets from three Tests in a rare off-colour series at home.  Sundar was picked in the XI for the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth ahead of Ashwin as the team management hinted they were looking to move on from the veteran.

It remains to be seen if the young Tamil Nadu all-rounder will get a place in the XI in the last two Tests of the series.

Regretting the lack of a grand farewell, Kapil remarked, ""The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar... Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there-I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him off with a lot of respect and happiness."" Since the announcement of his retirement, Ashwin has been the recipient of heartfelt tributes from the cricketing fraternity. Icons such as Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Gautam Gambhir have all acknowledged the 38-year-old's immense contributions to Indian cricket. Ashwin leaves the game as one of India's greatest matchwinners, with 537 Test wickets—second only to Anil Kumble—and six centuries in the longest format. His record for the most Player of the Series awards in men's Test cricket (11) speaks volumes about his ability to influence games. Known for his innovative skills and cricketing intellect, Ashwin often delivered match-winning performances with both ball and bat. His memorable innings against Bangladesh in Chennai, where he scored a century under pressure, stands out as a testament to his all-round abilities. Ashwin was a vital member of India's triumphs in the 2011 ODI World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy. His stellar performances earned him the ICC Cricketer of the Year and ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year accolades in 2016.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Tune InRead More |  Australia selector explains 'very difficult decision' of dropping Nathan McSweeney

With South Africa currently leading the points table for the ongoing WTC cycle, Bavuma is determined to guide his side to the final, a prestigious milestone for the team and the country's cricketing history. South Africa hold the top position in the WTC standings with 63.33%, placing them within touching distance of securing a spot in the much-anticipated final. Their next challenge comes in the form of a two-match Test series against Pakistan, with the first match scheduled for December 26 at SuperSport Park in Centurion, followed by the New Year's Test at Newlands in Cape Town, starting January 3. Reflecting on the significance of this opportunity, Bavuma expressed the team's collective goal. ""The World Test Championship, it's a World Cup for the red-ball players,"" Bavuma said. ""We've obviously set our sights on seeing ourselves in that final."" The upcoming series against Pakistan is crucial, as a win in one of the two Tests would guarantee their place in the final. The competition for the top spots is fierce, with reigning champions Australia (58.89%) and two-time runners-up India (55.88%) trailing South Africa in the standings. After sweeping Sri Lanka 2-0 in their most recent series, South Africa’s chances of reaching the final look strong. Bavuma was optimistic, saying, ""We've given ourselves a very good opportunity to do so and we're quite close to that. We've played some good cricket as a team. We'd want to continue that. That championship means a lot as well to cricket around the world."" In addition to South Africa, other teams in contention for the final include Australia, India, and Sri Lanka, with Sri Lanka currently sitting in fifth place. As the WTC cycle heads into its final stages, Bavuma reflects on the essence of Test cricket. ""From a pure skill point of view, as players, we've always wanted to play Test cricket. You want to see yourself succeeding where things are tough, where you're tested for long periods,"" he said.

Despite United’s spirited late fightback, they were knocked out of the competition, raising questions about the decision to exclude one of their star players. Pre-match discussions were dominated by Rashford’s absence in United's loss to Tottenham on Friday, following recent comments where the 27-year-old forward expressed his desire for a “new challenge.” Amorim insisted the decision was not rooted in a strained relationship with the player but was based purely on training performance and tactical considerations. However, Rashford’s omission has added fuel to speculation about his uncertain future at the club. “I feel that I do the right thing for the team, so it’s never a mistake. We have to make a selection. Sometimes, like in the game, you feel that some of the guys go inside the pitch and change a little bit of the game. Sometimes it is like that,"" Amorim said post-match. “I think it was not a mistake because I feel I am always doing the best for the team in my way of seeing things,” he added. A product of Manchester United’s academy since the age of seven, Rashford is at a pivotal moment in his career. His role under Amorim has been inconsistent, leading to mounting doubts about his long-term prospects at Old Trafford. This comes despite United’s morale-boosting 2-1 victory over Manchester City in the Premier League just days earlier, where Rashford was also absent from the squad. Although Alejandro Garnacho, another young talent initially left out of the City clash, returned to feature against Tottenham, Rashford remained sidelined. This decision has further intensified rumours about potential exits, with Amorim reiterating that Rashford is ""still a Manchester United player."" Yet, the manager provided little clarity on when the forward might return to action. The timing of Rashford’s exclusion is particularly notable as United face a gruelling schedule with upcoming matches against Bournemouth, Wolves, Newcastle United, and Liverpool. Amorim acknowledged the challenges ahead and stressed the importance of squad harmony and performance-based selections. However, with Rashford’s absence casting a shadow over United’s recent performances, the pressure is mounting on both the player and the manager to resolve the uncertainty. As the season progresses, Rashford’s situation remains a talking point, and whether he can regain his place in the squad will significantly impact United’s fortunes in the coming weeks.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Argentina top FIFA men's football rankings for second straight year

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-prithvi-shaw-own-enemy-mumbai-cricket-on-vijay-hazare-snub-2652785-2024-12-20,"The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has dismissed Prithvi Shaw's dramatic outburst following his withdrawal from the Vijay Hazare Trophy squad, claiming that the volatile batter has repeatedly violated disciplinary guidelines and is ""his own enemy"". The official revealed that Shaw's fitness issues were so significant during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy that the team was ""forced to hide"" him on the field. ""The ball would pass near him, and he would barely make an effort to reach it,"" the official said, speaking anonymously to the news agency PTI. ""Even while batting, he struggled to reach the ball. His fitness, discipline, and attitude are lacking, and we cannot have different rules for different players."" The concerns extended beyond his on-field performance, as Shaw reportedly missed training sessions and frequently returned to the team hotel at odd hours. These behaviors have led to mounting frustration among senior team members, who have begun voicing their displeasure. Prithvi Shaw, excluded from the 16-member Vijay Hazare squad despite being part of Mumbai's title-winning Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy campaign, took to social media to express his disappointment. However, the MCA official dismissed the impact of such posts, emphasizing that the selectors' decisions would not be influenced by public sentiment. ""Social media posts will not sway the Mumbai selectors or the MCA. Shaw needs to focus on his game, not on gaining sympathy,"" the official remarked. Shaw's teammate and Mumbai captain Shreyas Iyer also addressed the issue, offering blunt advice following Mumbai's Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy victory. ""He needs to get his work ethics right. If he does, the sky's the limit for him,"" Iyer said. ""We can't babysit anyone. At the end of the day, it’s his responsibility to figure things out for himself."" Prithvi burst onto the cricket scene with a remarkable Test debut in 2018, scoring a century against the West Indies at just 18 years old. However, his career trajectory has since faltered. Shaw has played only four additional Tests, the last of which was in 2020. His ODI and T20I appearances have also been sparse, with no international white-ball games since 2021. Off-field controversies and inconsistent performances have overshadowed Shaw's talent. In October, he was dropped from Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy squad and assigned a fitness program at the MCA Academy, which he allegedly failed to follow diligently. Adding to the woes, Shaw went unsold at the IPL auction despite setting a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh. This marked another blow for the player once hailed Indian cricket’s next big star. The cricketing community has expressed disappointment at Prithvi Shaw’s inability to capitalise on his potential. ""No one is Shaw's enemy. He is his own enemy,"" the MCA official concluded, summarising the sentiment surrounding the player. For Shaw, the path to redemption lies in introspection, improved fitness, and a renewed commitment to his craft. Only then can he hope to revive his career and fulfil the promise he once showed.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  R Ashwin grateful for calls from Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev on retirement day

""Yes, after the Apex Council Meeting on Thursday, state units were sent a notification about the date of the SGM, which is January 12 at the BCCI headquarters,"" a state association president told PTI. Shah has already taken over as the youngest chairman of ICC on December 1 and Shelar, a seasoned BJP politician, has been sworn in as a cabinet minister in the recently-formed Maharashtra government. As per the Lodha Committee reforms accepted by the Supreme Court, one person can't hold two positions. Shah, who still had a year left in his BCCI tenure before the mandatory cooling-off period, relinquished his post as required. Shelar, who was a Maharashtra BJP president, had to quit the BCCI post as Lodha Reforms do not allow any minister or public servant to be an office-bearer.

This move sparked discussions amongst fans and analysts, adding another layer to the heated rivalry. The aftermath saw a surge in online trolling and banter between the fanbases, solidifying the fierce competition between the two teams. As the 2025 IPL season approaches, expectations are sky-high for another chapter in this storied rivalry.

The decision was made following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan, originally slated to host the tournament exclusively. The ICC announced that India would play its matches at a neutral venue, likely in the UAE. In exchange, Pakistan is exempt from travelling to India for ICC tournaments until 2028, including the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup. The ICC’s statement clarified: “India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue.” ""Pakistan is not losing money. In fact, in this arrangement, Pakistan hasn't even lost its face. No matter how much they might have talked against the Hybrid Model, they had ultimately agreed, but they have also not walked away empty-handed,"" Chopra said. ""It's now almost confirmed that it will be tit for tat. All matches till 2027 will be in the Hybrid Model. If India are not going to Pakistan, Pakistan will also not come to India and play against India. Pakistan will play their matches in a third country,"" he added. This arrangement also applies to the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the Women’s T20 World Cup in 2028, for which Pakistan has secured hosting rights. In his recent YouTube video, Chopra emphasised that this agreement does not harm the PCB financially or reputational-wise.Implications for Global Cricket While the arrangement appears to be a diplomatic solution to the India-Pakistan cricketing impasse, it creates logistical challenges for other cricketing nations. Teams drawn against India and Pakistan will have to navigate increased travel and play in varied conditions. A recent example of these logistical hurdles was the 2023 Asia Cup, co-hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan resulted in the team being stationed in Sri Lanka, forcing other teams to shuttle between the two countries. Players faced drastically different playing conditions, leading to criticism of the tournament’s structure. Uncertainty Ahead The Champions Trophy, set to be held between February and March 2025, still lacks finalised venues. Fans and boards alike remain in the dark about where matches will be played. This uncertainty may affect ticket sales, travel plans, and logistical arrangements for the event. While the hybrid model addresses political sensitivities, it raises significant concerns for global cricket operations. Teams, fans, and administrators will need to adapt to these complexities as they navigate an evolving cricketing landscape.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Australia selector explains 'very difficult decision' of dropping Nathan McSweeney

In his place, Australia brought in 19-year-old Sam Konstas, who has been garnering attention with his remarkable performances in the domestic season. McSweeney, 25, scored 72 runs across six innings in the first three Tests. While he struggled against the Jasprit Bumrah-led bowling attack, he showed considerable resilience during the twilight session on Day 1 of the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. His partnership with Marnus Labuschagne was pivotal in helping Australia post a strong first-innings total, which led to a 10-wicket victory in the match. Several fans and pundits expressed dissatisfaction with McSweeney's exclusion after just three Tests. Some even criticised Bailey for selecting McSweeney, who had been batting in the middle order in domestic cricket, as an opener and then failing to back him after three matches.  Senior batter Usman Khawaja has struggled, scoring just 63 runs in the series so far while Marnus Labuschagne has managed just 83 runs, but the axe fell on McSweeney.

We believed it doesn’t change too much wherever he’s coming in the order. It hasn’t quite worked out as you’d like it to, but it’s still very much the start of his career.” he added.  Sam Konstas, 19, is all set to open the batting alongside Usman Khawaja in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Konstas will become first teenager since Pat Cummins in 2011 to make his debut for the Australian men's Test team.  Konstas smashed 56 off just 37 balls for Sydney Thunder in their Big Bash League match on December 17 in Canberra against the Adelaide Strikers. In the Sheffield Shield, playing for New South Wales, Konstas has scored two centuries and accumulated 369 runs across six innings, highlighting his form in first-class cricket. One of his most standout performances came in the practice match for the Prime Minister's XI against India, where he scored a blistering century. In this pink-ball match at Manuka Oval in Canberra, Konstas hit 107 runs off just 97 balls, including 14 fours and one six, showcasing his exceptional stroke play and ability to handle challenging conditions.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

Pakistan had also considered England and Dubai as potential venues. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi stated that other details, such as the timing of the draft and the venue specifics, would be shared later. Gwadar, a key hub of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, boasts one of the most beautiful and scenic cricket grounds in the country. However, due to recent attacks on security installations in the area, it has not hosted any cricket matches so far. Naqvi explained that the decision to select Gwadar aimed to bring the game closer to the people of Balochistan and inspire future generations. ""Gwadar, with its stunning coastline and strategic importance, represents the heart of Pakistan’s economic future. By hosting the PSL player draft here, we aim to highlight its cultural and economic significance while celebrating the unity cricket brings to our nation,"" Naqvi said. ""I look forward to welcoming all the franchises and relevant stakeholders to the beautiful city of Gwadar as we take an exciting step toward marking the start of the 10th edition of Pakistan's biggest sporting extravaganza,"" he added. The PCB has already announced the list of Pakistani players placed by their franchises in the platinum and other categories. However, the final list of foreign players available for the draft is yet to be released. This will be the first time the PSL, launched in 2016, clashes with the Indian Premier League (IPL), as it is scheduled to take place during the same window usually reserved for the IPL. The PCB and its franchises are making efforts to attract high-profile overseas players who went unsold in last month's IPL auction.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  U19 Women's T20 Asia Cup: Aayushi Shukla stars as India beat Sri Lanka to reach final

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ind-vs-aus-kl-rahul-opener-border-gavaskart-trophy-dinesh-karthk-2652987-2024-12-20,"Former India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik has urged the team management to give KL Rahul extended backing at the top of the batting order. Karthik stated that Rahul is often underappreciated, particularly for his contributions away from home in Test cricket, and added that the selectors should not have short memories. Karthik's comments come at a time when Rahul has re-established himself as the first-choice opening batter in Test cricket. The Karnataka batsman was initially picked in the 18-man squad for a middle-order role, but Rohit Sharma's absence in the series opener in Perth forced the management to play Rahul at the top. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal impressed at the top of the order, combining for a match-winning 201-run partnership in the second innings of the first Test in Perth. Rahul contributed with a gritty 77, playing a pivotal role in India's victory. Even after Rohit Sharma returned for the second Test in Adelaide, KL Rahul continued to open alongside Jaiswal. Rohit moved to No. 6 but has struggled in the lower middle order. Meanwhile, Rahul strengthened his reputation at the top with a match-saving 84 in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane. ""I believe, in KL Rahul, we have the opener that India needs. I hope they continue to back him. If, within the next year, there's a series where he has a couple of low scores, I hope people don’t have a short memory. We need to appreciate what he has done and what he is doing today. That matters a lot. People often forget that many Test cricketers are judged on what they do abroad. And Rahul has been as good as anyone who has played for the country over an extended period,"" Dinesh Karthik told Cricbuzz. ""People always complain about his consistency; I don't want to use that word. But he takes it upon himself. His average shows that. But he is far better than that. He is someone who is much, much better than that."" ""But, if you take any Indian team planning to tour abroad, he will be one of the first names on that list because you know exactly what you will get from him,"" he added. Rahul has been India's leading run-scorer in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, amassing 235 runs in six innings at an average of 47. Since the start of 2021, KL Rahul has scored 889 runs, including three centuries, at an average of 40.40 in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia).

The WPBL promises a competitive and inclusive spectacle in January-February next year. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/world-pickleball-league-gaurav-natekar-interview-2652892-2024-12-20,"Pickleball, one of the fastest-growing sports worldwide, is poised to make a significant splash in India with the inaugural edition of the World Pickleball League (WPBL). Combining the sport's rapid rise in popularity with top-tier global talent and an entertainment-packed format, the league is set to redefine sports engagement in the country. The WPBL, co-founded by former Indian tennis stars Gaurav Natekar and Arati Ponnappa Natekar, promises a competitive and inclusive spectacle while tapping into pickleball's growing community appeal. With the Cricket Club of India (CCI) hosting the league, it marks a historic moment -- the iconic venue's first non-cricket sporting event in over 15 years. Scheduled from January 24 to February 02, the league will bring together players from 14 countries, delivering a truly global pickleball showcase. For Gaurav Natekar, a seven-time national tennis champion and Arjuna Awardee, the transition to pickleball was natural, driven by the sport's accessibility and inclusive ethos. ""Pickleball is going to explode in India primarily for three reasons. First, it is very easy to play but tough to master. It requires very little space and significantly less infrastructure compared to building a badminton, squash, tennis, volleyball, or basketball court,"" he told India Today. ""The third reason is that it's age-agnostic. Forty per cent of the players in this sport are women. I mean, you know, my background of, you know, me and my wife, Arati, who's played tennis for India, my dad, my in-laws, and as a family, we could never really get down to playing one sport together. A couple of months back, 16 of us played pickleball together. The oldest was 66, and the youngest was 11. That's when it really hit me that this is a game for community and relationship building.""STAR-STUDDED LEAGUE WITH COMPETITIVE EDGE The WPBL recently concluded its player draft, selecting 48 players from a pool of 75 contracted athletes, representing 14 countries, including India, Spain, Japan, South Korea, and the UK. With franchises based in Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Delhi, each team comprises eight players, four men and four women, with a mandatory Indian player in every squad.

Addressing the competition in India's budding pickleball ecosystem, Natekar emphasised, ""I think there is competition in everything, right? One thing that playing sport at the highest level has taught me is that one has to focus on what one needs to do. So I'm very focused, me and Arati are both very focused on the next point in the next game. ""We believe in our ability and our capability. This is the first time, from what I am told, that there are two international-level players who've actually started a league. Otherwise, leagues are generally started by business houses. This is the first time that we are attempting to do a league of this scale.""COLD WAR BETWEEN TENNIS AND PICKLEBALL? Natekar also addressed the much-talked-about cold war between tennis and pickleball. The former tennis player acknowledged concerns raised by many, including Novak Djokovic, about pickleball eating into the tennis ecosystem. ""Tennis is my first love. Tennis has given me everything. And not only me, but even my wife, Arti Ponnappa, you know, we've got everything from tennis. I think having said that we are in the sports business. It's almost as if, you know, you're asking a cricketer, why are you getting into another sport, right? So it's not that I don't love tennis. Tennis has and will be my first love. While I think Novak's comment needs to be taken a little seriously because he obviously knows what he's saying. I don't know whether it is a huge threat to tennis. I think that there is a space for both sports to exist and coexist,"" the former tennis player said. All eyes are on the World Pickleball League.

Notably, McSweeney didn’t have a memorable start to his career has he could only score 72 runs from first three games. The 25-year-old was picked in the team on the back of some solid performances against India A and in the Sheffield Shield trophy. However, the Queensland-born batter failed to emulate his good show at the international level as he was tormented by Jasprit Bumrah.  Following his poor performances, McSweeney finds himself out of the team and has been replaced by Sam Konstas. His dropping hasn’t gone down well with Clarke who felt that he should’ve got a long run at the top of the order. ""Nathan McSweeney has been dropped. I can't believe that. No matter who they picked in that opening position, they had to give them the series. I think the selectors have got this wrong. We've got Usman Khawaja who is 38 years old, and he's made no runs. He's a senior player,"" Clarke said on the Beyond 23 Cricket podcast. Further speaking ahead, Clarke highlighted the ageing Australian batting line up and felt that the selectors also need to look at the future.What happens if Usman Khawaja retires in two Test matches?: Clarke ""We've got Marnus Labuschagne, who before the series was under pressure and has made one decent score. Steve Smith batted like a genius to make a hard-fought hundred, but he's also been under pressure. Everyone apart from McSweeney is over 30 years of age, some in their high 30s. What happens if Usman Khawaja retires in two Test matches? Does McSweeney then come back in, or does he go to the back of the queue? They've got to come out and say, ‘We made a mistake picking him,'"" he added. Meanwhile, Sam Konstas also starred in the recent tour matches against India A as he scored a match-winning unbeaten 73 in the second unofficial Test. The 19-year-old also boasts a good first class average of 42.23 and will be eager to continue his good form at the international level as well in the fourth Test beginning from 26th December in Melbourne.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  BCCI to hold Special General Meeting in January to elect Jay Shah's replacement

The match was part of a three-game series, played in Harare. The incident occurred in the fifth over of Zimbabwe's innings when Farooqi expressed frustration after his LBW appeal against Craig Ervine was turned down. The left-arm pacer made a gesture requesting a review, despite the match not having DRS (Decision Review System) available. This act breached Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which penalises players for “showing dissent at an umpire’s decision during an international match.” In addition to the fine, one demerit point has been added to Farooqi's disciplinary record. This marks his first offence within a 24-month period. The bowler admitted to the violation and accepted the penalty proposed by Match Referee Andy Pycroft.

Miandad stated that the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) mediation of the new agreement between India and Pakistan for world events represents a bigger victory for Pakistan than for their arch-rivals. On Thursday, 20 December, the ICC announced that next year's Champions Trophy would be held in a hybrid model—featuring three venues in Pakistan and a neutral venue to host India’s matches. The decision followed a protracted standoff after India refused to travel to Pakistan. Although Pakistan initially rejected the hybrid model, the ICC ensured that all stakeholders, including the BCCI and PCB, reached an agreement. Pakistan had previously suffered setbacks, including losing nine matches and the final, when they agreed to host last year’s Asia Cup using a hybrid model. The ICC also announced that matches between India and Pakistan in world events hosted by either country between 2025 and 2028 would be held at neutral venues. ""I think the PCB took the sensible approach and, instead of doing something rash and facing isolation from the ICC and other cricketing nations, opted for a solution where I believe the PCB has gained more than the BCCI,"" Miandad said, as quoted by the PTI news agency. ""Still, Pakistan is hosting a major event after a very long time, and we have sent a clear message that if you don’t come and play in our country, we will also not play in India,"" he added. The agreement means that Pakistan will not travel to India for their matches during the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the Men’s T20 World Cup in 2026. Meanwhile, Pakistan was also awarded the hosting rights for the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2028 on Thursday. However, the PCB was not compensated monetarily for the partial loss of hosting rights for the Champions Trophy. Former Pakistan spinner Iqbal Qasim praised the PCB for successfully securing the ICC, BCCI, and ICC board’s agreement on a compromise formula. ""The BCCI is a very strong and financially influential board. But unlike last year’s Asia Cup, this time our board took a stance and gained something. The main thing is that we are hosting the tournament and will also not travel to India to play in ICC events. Both teams will now compete at neutral venues,"" Qasim said.

And that partnership, I think of about 80 or 90, suddenly turned the game on its head and by the end of the day, India had won the Test match.”Watch the video here-

Notably, Ashwin recently announced his retirement from international cricket after the third Test against Australia in Brisbane. The veteran all-rounder has been arguably the biggest match-winner for India in the longest format, which is evident from his 11 Player of the Series awards. Recently, Pujara opened up on Ashwin’s overseas performances and mentioned how he always played a key role for the team in SENA(South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia) countries. Pujara highlighted that Ashwin may not have picked fifers in SENA but was always consistent with his key strikes and picked big wickets from the opposing teams. “Yes, they are underrated and when he performs the way he performs in India because most of the time it will be fifers or three or four wickets. But there are times where he will pick two or three important wickets away from India and those are key wickets. For example, we’re talking about getting Smith out, I think it was in Melbourne 2020. But those are some of the key wickets overseas, important ones. It’s not about picking a fifer, it’s about picking those two-three quick wickets to support other bowlers. Sometimes, we underestimate that role,” Pujara said on ESPNCricinfo. Further speaking ahead, Pujara hailed the India spinner for evolving his game with time and revealed his preparations to outsmart batters.Ashwin retires as India's 2nd highest wicket taker in Tests “He’s evolved as a bowler, he’s got lot of variations in his bowling because he’s someone who likes to think about his game. He likes to think about the opponents as well. What kind of strategies do they have, what are the options a batter has? when he’s facing Ashwin. So, he thinks from both sides. He knows his game plan as well but at the same time, it’s important as well to understand what the batter is trying to do by seeing his videos. The strength which Ashwin had, which he’s developed over a period of time, is having enough variations in his bowling,” he added. Ashwin didn’t have a memorable time in SENA nations at the beginning of his career as he averaged in the high 40s in the initial few years. However, he made a remarkable comeback from 2018 onwards as he got under the skin of top players such as Alastair Cook and Steve Smith. The off spinner played crucial roles in India’s famous wins in Adelaide 2018, Melbourne 2020 and Centurion 2021. Ashwin retired as the second-highest wicket taker for India in Tests with 537 scalps from 106 matches at an average of 24 with 37 five wicket hauls and eight ten wicket hauls in his career.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  BCCI to hold Special General Meeting in January to elect Jay Shah's replacement

A lot of hard work went on behind the scenes, and the boys were tremendous in their performance. Now, we are done with this part and moving on to the next big thing, which is IPL. I'm super excited to be part of Punjab Kings and can't wait to join the Punjab Kings family,"" Iyer said in a video posted by the franchise. Iyer's success in 2024 has been marked by a series of impressive victories, having led teams to four major titles. As he prepares for the IPL 2025 season, his primary goal is clear: to win the IPL for Punjab Kings. ""It's been a great year for me personally, winning four trophies this season. My main goal now is to win the IPL for Punjab. I understand the feeling among the fans, and with Ricky Ponting coming in, we share a great camaraderie from the past. We will be brainstorming on many aspects and hopefully deliver from match one,"" Iyer added. Ricky Ponting, the newly appointed head coach of Punjab Kings, has already expressed confidence in Iyer's leadership abilities. The former Australian captain's tactical insights and wealth of experience will be invaluable as Iyer looks to steer the team toward its maiden IPL title. The synergy between Ponting and Iyer is expected to be a major strength for Punjab Kings, and fans are hopeful that the team's combination of fresh leadership and renewed momentum will break the franchise's title drought.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Prithvi Shaw is his own enemy: Mumbai Cricket breaks silence on Vijay Hazare snub

This leadership role comes at a time when Rinku's IPL franchise, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), has yet to announce their captain for the next season. Rinku will captain a state team at the senior level for the first time. Earlier this year, he led the Meerut Mavericks to victory in the UPT20 League, scoring 210 runs in nine innings with a strike rate of 161.54, primarily as a finisher. He has been a part of the KKR setup since 2018 and was retained ahead of the mega auction in November, along with Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ramandeep Singh. ""I am not overthinking about the captaincy of KKR in the new IPL season,"" Rinku was quoted saying to ESPN Cricinfo. ""I am focused on my plans for Uttar Pradesh, as I want my team to regain the trophy we had won for the first time in 2015-16."" Rinku revealed his efforts to become a more versatile cricketer, citing his attempts at bowling off spin during the UPT20 league.  ""I did try my hand at bowling [offspin] too at the UPT20 league. Present-day cricket demands a full package - a cricketer who can bat, bowl and field. Now I am focusing on my bowling too. As captain of Uttar Pradesh, I have got a bigger role to play, and I'm ready for this."" The Vijay Hazare Trophy presents a crucial opportunity for players aiming to make an impression on national selectors, particularly with the Champions Trophy scheduled for February. While Rinku has become a regular feature in India’s T20I squad, his ODI appearances remain limited to two matches since his debut in South Africa last year. Rinku’s List A statistics underline his potential: he has amassed 1,899 runs in 52 innings at an impressive average of 48.69 and a strike rate of 94.8. His record includes one century and 17 half-centuries. Despite these achievements, Rinku remains grounded. ""I believe in God,"" he said. ""I didn't even think of being part of team India when I struck five consecutive sixes in the IPL last year. That turned out to be the biggest game changer in my life. Even now I feel that if God has decided something for me, I will get that surely. But at the same time, I also need to work hard on my job."" As the captain of Uttar Pradesh, Rinku Singh carries the responsibility of guiding his team to replicate their 2015-16 Vijay Hazare Trophy triumph. His focus on team success over personal milestones reflects his maturity and leadership qualities. The upcoming tournament will not only test his abilities as a leader but also solidify his position as a key figure in Indian domestic cricket.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Ravichandran Ashwin's overseas contributions are underrated: Cheteshwar Pujara

Notably, Rohit is known for his nature of forgetting things which he’s openly shared during his various interviews. Recently, Imam was asked in a podcast what he would do if he woke up as Rohit Sharma. The Pakistan cricketer replied that he would look where his things were and what all he did the previous night, keeping in mind Rohit’s forgetful nature. The Pakistan batter went on to call him a different level of personality, mentioning how he even forgets his gloves and bats. “I’ll look where I put everything in the night, where did I put my shoes, where did I keep my phone, where did I put my belt, who did I message, who did I phone. Oh my God, you haven’t met him, he’s a different level of personality. He completely forgets where he kept his gloves and bats,” said Imam on Cricwick’s Ultra Edge podcast. Further speaking ahead, Imam shared a story involving Babar and Rohit from the 2023 ODI World Cup mentioning how Babar prevented Rohit’s phone from being lost. “Babar told me about this story, do you remember there was a captain’s meeting before World Cup 2023 and these guys went in a plane? He had bought a new iPhone, and AirPods. He said they were talking and he first left his iPhone here, then left it in the plane, and then his AirPods every two minutes,” he added.India to play Champions Trophy matches at neutral venue “Then, he was cursing himself, what am I doing, I keep forgetting things everywhere.

The incident occurred when Kohli landed in Melbourne with his wife, actor Anushka Sharma, and their children on Thursday, December 19. A journalist from Australia’s Channel 7 captured a video of the family, which angered Kohli, according to local media. The cricketer was particularly upset about the intrusion into his family’s privacy. He approached the journalist, requesting to view the pictures and videos taken. Kohli then asked her to delete any images or footage of his family, while allowing her to retain any of him alone. Under Australian law, there are no restrictions on photographing or filming celebrities in public places, which likely complicated the matter. ""With my kids, I need some privacy. You can't film without asking me,"" he told the media at the airport.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ravi-shastri-reacts-to-india-brisbane-follow-on-celebrations-vs-australia-2653014-2024-12-20,"Former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes India's Brisbane follow-on celebrations were fully justified, and the tourists can use this achievement as a springboard as the Test series against Australia moves towards Melbourne. Shastri said that India's remarkable fightback on the final day of the third Test against Australia in Brisbane was a defining moment in the ongoing series. The former Indian coach praised the team's resilience, particularly the efforts of Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep, who played pivotal roles in ensuring India avoided the follow-on in a crucial moment of the match. Speaking on The ICC Review with host Sanjana Ganesan, Ravi Shastri emphasised that the celebrations after India managed to escape the follow-on were fully justified, considering the context of the match and the series. ""You should celebrate,"" Shastri said. ""It required a lot of character from the last pair with 35-36 runs needed. That celebration showed, they knew the importance of that effort within the dressing room in the context of the series."" For Shastri, the fight to avoid the follow-on was not just about saving face-it was about setting the tone for the next Test. He explained that it could have been disastrous for India to go into the second innings behind by more than 200 runs, especially with a vulnerable batting order. ""It's one thing following on, it's one thing then again being 2-3 down as opposed to, you going ahead and rattling the Australian top-order,"" Shastri remarked. ""It is fully justified."" The former coach also drew parallels with another iconic moment in India's recent Test history-the unforgettable 89-run partnership between Bumrah and Mohammed Shami at Lord's during the 2021 England series, which turned the game on its head. ""It reminded me of the celebration, when in COVID times, when Jasprit and Mohammed Shami were involved in a partnership at Lord's, which turned the game on its head,"" Shastri recalled. ""England were odds on favourites on the final day to win the Test. And that partnership, I think of about 80 or 90, suddenly turned the game on its head and by the end of the day, India had won the Test match."" Shastri stressed that India's recent success in Test cricket has often been built on the tenacity and resilience of their tail-enders. From Bumrah and Shami's remarkable partnerships to the steadfast efforts of Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari in Sydney, India's lower order has often been the unsung hero in their fights. ""When the tail-enders are stubborn, they fight it out there. It makes a massive difference,"" Shastri noted. ""It did it on the last tour. When Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari batted the whole of the last session to save the game, going into the Gabba and then winning the series."" Such efforts provide a psychological lift for the team, and Shastri believes this fightback in Brisbane could play a crucial role as India prepares for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. ""It'll lift the Indian team. And for me, the series is on a level peg now and India might just be calling the shots,"" Shastri said. With the series tied at 1-1, Shastri expressed optimism for India's prospects moving forward. Reflecting on the challenging road India has already faced, Shastri acknowledged how significant the 1-1 scoreline is for the team. ""Massive. They would give anything for a 1-1 result,"" he said, considering the difficulties of the early stages of the series, which included the fast, bouncy pitches of Perth and the challenges of Adelaide's day-night Test. ""The first Test is in Perth, second Test is a day-nighter in Adelaide, and then the third Test in Brisbane. Any overseas team will, you know, settle for a 1-1 score because come Melbourne, come Sydney, I think India will be powerful."" Shastri expressed confidence in India's chances in Melbourne, despite the close call in Brisbane. ""They've been kept in this series single-handedly by Jasprit Bumrah,"" he said. ""If the big boys wake up, and step up to the plate which I just get the gut feeling they will, then Australia has a problem on their hands."" With India heading into the Boxing Day Test with renewed belief, Shastri added, ""Yeah, they got out of jail but they are not on bail. They are free birds in Melbourne. They can do what they want and come and attack Australia on Boxing Day.""Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Read More |  Javed Miandad reacts to Champions Trophy solution: PCB has gained more than BCCI

Notably, Ashwin recently retired from international cricket after the third Test against Australia at the Gabba in Brisbane. The veteran off spinner retires as the second-highest wicket taker for India in Tests with 537 wickets from 106 matches. Recently, BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) uploaded a special video tribute for Ashwin capturing all of his milestone scalps and the other great moments from his career. In the special video feature, Ashwin shared the promise he made to himself about not letting India lose another series after losing against England in 2012 at home. “Look, I don't know where to begin, honestly, I think. I made myself a promise in 2012. We lost the series against England, a tricky one. It was very early in my career and I was just telling myself, we're not going to lose another one ever, and that's what I promised myself . How many wickets you take, how many hour runs you make, in 10 years' time, you won't remember them. It's the memories that matters,” said Ashwin in a video released by BCCI. Following the series loss against England in 2012, which was India’s first loss in a home rubber since 2004, India went on to win a world record 18 consecutive series on their home soil. Ashwin played a pivotal role in India’s over 11-year-long home dominance as he scalped 320 wickets from 53 matches at an average of 20.04 with 24 five wicket hauls and five ten wicket hauls.

I wouldn't have believed them because I knew that this is a game that I loved, but I never did expect that I would get so much love and so many wickets and so many runs as well. I'm very glad, deep sense of gratitude for everyone that supported me, everyone that's challenged me. So happy today. Thank you,” he added. Ashwin played his last Test against Australia in Adelaide where he registered figures of 1/53 in 18 overs and scored 22 and 7 across two innings.

This marks another blow for the struggling champions, whose chances of retaining the Premier League title appear to be slipping away. City will travel to Aston Villa on Saturday, hoping to steady the ship amidst the worst run of results in Guardiola's managerial career. Currently sitting fifth in the league table, City have managed just one win in their last 11 games across all competitions. Dias sustained the injury during City's disastrous 2-1 derby loss to Manchester United on Sunday. ""It was a muscular injury,"" Guardiola explained. ""After 75 minutes against Manchester United, he felt something. He is so strong that he stayed on the pitch, but now he's injured."" There is some relief, however, as fellow defender Manuel Akanji returned to training this week following an injury earlier this month. ""That's good for us,"" Guardiola said. City's loss to United was particularly dramatic, as they conceded two goals in less than two minutes after leading in the 88th minute. Guardiola appeared dejected afterward, taking full responsibility for the team's shocking run. Speaking candidly in a heartfelt post-game press conference, he admitted, ""I am not good enough."" ""I had just finished a game where we were close to winning but lost. Given the sequence of events, I wasn't happy,"" Guardiola said. ""I try to be honest with myself. If you fall six times, you have to stand up seven. ""I'm fine. I'm a normal person with feelings, like all of us. When things are going well, we feel better. When they're not, we focus more on what we need to do."" Aston Villa, just two points and two places behind City in the league table, could leapfrog them with a win on Saturday at Villa Park. Unai Emery's team has also outperformed City in their Champions League campaign. They currently sit fifth in the standings with two games remaining in the league phase, while City languish in 22nd. ""I'm not surprised,"" Guardiola said of Villa's success. ""They have an excellent manager. Their qualification for the Champions League and their results speak for themselves. They're handling it well-balancing both competitions is never easy, and they've done really well."" City last played at Villa Park just over a year ago, losing 1-0 before rebounding to thrash Emery's side 4-1 in early April. Guardiola, however, dismissed the relevance of those results.

 The young batter, once hailed as the next big thing in Indian cricket, has faced a barrage of criticism in recent times, with questions raised about his focus and ability to handle pressure. Shaw's recent social media activity appears to be his way of addressing detractors and standing up for himself amidst the growing scrutiny. ""The ball would pass near him, and he would barely make an effort to reach it,"" the official said, speaking anonymously to the news agency PTI. ""Even while batting, he struggled to reach the ball. His fitness, discipline, and attitude are lacking, and we cannot have different rules for different players."" The concerns extended beyond his on-field performance, as Shaw reportedly missed training sessions and frequently returned to the team hotel at odd hours. These behaviors have led to mounting frustration among senior team members, who have begun voicing their displeasure. Prithvi Shaw, left out of Mumbai's 16-member Vijay Hazare Trophy squad despite being part of their victorious Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy campaign, voiced his disappointment on social media. However, an MCA official dismissed the significance of such posts, stressing that selectors remain unaffected by public opinion. ""Social media posts won’t influence the Mumbai selectors or the MCA’s decisions. Shaw should concentrate on his game instead of seeking sympathy,"" the official stated firmly. While Shaw’s immense talent is unquestionable, the recurring concerns over his fitness and discipline could overshadow his potential if not addressed. As the debate continues, fans and critics alike will be watching closely to see how the young cricketer navigates this challenging phase of his career.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Bumrah-Akashdeep's match-saving partnership reminds Ravi Shastri of Lords 2021Trending Reel

— Arjun Erigaisi (@ArjunErigaisi) December 20, 2024 The World Rapid and Blitz Championship holds significant importance for Arjun, as strong performances could enhance his chances of qualifying for the next Candidates Tournament, a key pathway to challenging India’s Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa for the World Chess Championship title. Currently, Arjun is in a close race with Fabiano Caruana for a spot in the Candidates, with 124.40 points compared to Caruana’s 130.42.   This year has been remarkable for Arjun. He broke the elusive 2800 ELO rating, climbed to fourth in the FIDE rankings, and played a crucial role in India’s maiden FIDE Olympiad victory, contributing to both the men’s and women’s triumphs.   Despite his visa concerns, Arjun remains optimistic about resolving the issue in time to compete. “It’s a World Championship, very prestigious. Doing well here is crucial for my career,” he emphasised.   As the tournament approaches, all eyes are on Arjun, hoping he can overcome this hurdle and represent India on one of the biggest stages in chess.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  D Gukesh reveals how he plans to spend Rs 11.45 crore world championship prizeMust Watch

Notably, Pant made his long awaited Test comeback in September earlier this year after surviving a near-fatal car crash on December 30, 2022. Following his accident, it was believed that Pant wouldn’t be able to do wicketkeeping again. However, the India star has proved his naysayers wrong as he’s returned to be his acrobatic best behind the stumps. Recently, Healy shared his opinion on Pant’s wicketkeeping skills and said that the 27-year-old still has a lot to work on. The Australian legend pointed out a glaring error in his technique as the India player makes the wrong initial movement which leads to drop catches. “Rishabh Pant is a work in progress, but I saw him in the mornings and like the drills he is doing; he is bound to improve more. At times, as he did when he dropped a catch in this series earlier, he can make an initial wrong movement. Some keepers like to move a touch to their left first and then press from there. It’s better to be still and if you can’t, then you start that trigger movement a touch early so that by the time the ball is out there, you can still press to the right side. One of those two decisions have to be made,” Healy told the Indian Express.Pant's low returns with the bat in the series so far Apart from taking some sensational grabs with the gloves, Pant has also dropped a few chances in the ongoing series as he dropped Nathan McSweeney late on Day 1 of the second Test in Adelaide. Despite that, the India wicketkeeper has done a fine job with the gloves having taken 19 catches in three matches. However, Pant hasn’t been able to replicate his performances with the bat having scored just 96 runs from three matches (five innings) at an average of 19.20 with a highest score of 37. As India travel to the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) for the fourth Test, they will desperately need Pant to fire with the bat as they look to take a lead in the series which is tied at 1-1.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 20, 2024Also Read |  Watch: Virat Kohli's latest intense avatar ahead of Boxing Day Test

Furthermore, all the ICC events till 2027 will follow the same model with Pakistan also playing at a neutral venue in the events hosted by India. Following the announcement by the ICC, Shehzad shared his thoughts on the development, saying that PCB missed a great opportunity of hosting India. ""Pakistan had a golden chance to host India. All cricket boards had signed the agreement in 2021 that Pakistan will host the Champions Trophy. ICC cannot back off. PCB has missed the chance I think. We should forget that the Indian team will ever come to Pakistan now. Just forget it. The only way you could have brought India here was by an ICC event,"" Shehzad told YouTuber Nadir Ali. Further speaking ahead, the opening batter suggested a bizarre idea of building a stadium at the border of two countries and playing matches there.India don't hold bilateral relations with Pakistan since 2012-13 ""I did a podcast where I suggested the idea of building a stadium by the border. One gate would be towards India, the other gate would be towards Pakistan. The players would come from the respective gates and play. But even then there would be issues for the BCCI and their government. When their players come to the field by our side, they would need visas which they would not get,"" he added. India and Pakistan don’t hold bilateral cricketing relations since 2012-13, when Pakistan came to India for a limited overs tour. India last travelled to Pakistan to play in the Asia Cup 2008 and haven’t travelled to the country since then due to the stiff political relations between the two nations.

Match Referee Richie Richardson imposed the penalty, citing Klaasen’s inappropriate behaviour. Klaasen had been a standout performer for South Africa, playing a valiant knock of 97 off 74 balls in a challenging chase of 330. Despite his efforts, the Proteas struggled due to a lack of support at the other end and were bowled out for 248, falling short by 81 runs.

Ever since  Ashwin hung up his boots, tributes have been pouring in for the India cricketer from all over the world acknowledging his immense contribution to the game. His wife Prithi Narayanan also penned a long emotional tribute recalling his cricketing journey over the years as the two stood by each other during the highs and lows of life. ""It has been a blurry two days for me. I have been thinking about what I can say.. Do I put this down as a tribute to my all time favourite cricketer ? Maybe I'll just take the partner angle? Or maybe a love letter from a fan girl? I guess this is a little bit of all of it. When I saw Ashwin's PC, I thought of small and big moments. Many many memories over the last 13-14 years,” wrote Prithi in a post on her Instagram account. “The big wins , the MOS awards, the quiet silence in our room after an intense game, the sound of the shower running for much longer than usual on some evenings post play , the scratch of pencil over paper as he scribbled thoughts down, the constant streaming of footage videos when he is making a game plan, the calm of meditative breathing before leaving for each game, certain songs playing on repeat while he unwinds.. The times we weeped in joy - after the CT final, after the MCG win, after the Sydney draw, The Gabba win, after making a comeback in T20s...the times we sat in silence and the times when we had our hearts broken,” she added. ""Dear Ashwin, from not knowing how to put a kit bag together to following you to stadiums all over the world, rooting for you, watching you and learning from you, it has been an absolute pleasure. The world you introduced me to gave me the privilege to watch and enjoy a sport that I love from close quarters. It also showed me how much passion, hardwork and discipline is needed to keep your head above water. And sometimes even that is not enough. I remember us talking about why you, R Ashwin, had to do all of this and a lot more to even stay relevant in the scheme of things,” she further wrote.

Ashwin's retirement came after India's historic third Test against Australia at the Gabba, a match that ended in a thrilling draw. Ashwin's career statistics underscore his monumental contributions to Indian cricket. Over a 14-year span, he claimed 537 wickets in 106 Test matches at an average of 24, making him India's second-highest Test wicket-taker after the legendary Anil Kumble. Ashwin's tally includes 37 five-wicket hauls-second only to Muttiah Muralitharan in Test cricket-and eight ten-wicket match hauls. Beyond his bowling exploits, Ashwin also shone with the bat, amassing six centuries and 14 fifties in the longest format. In his final international game, the day-night Test against Australia in Adelaide, Ashwin delivered a characteristically all-round performance. He took 1-53 in 18 overs and contributed a gritty 29 runs with the bat, although India succumbed to a ten-wicket defeat. Mukund, who shared a close bond with Ashwin from their early days in domestic cricket, penned a poignant column for ESPNCricinfo on Friday. He described Ashwin as a relentless thinker, whose intellect and curiosity extended far beyond the cricketing field. ""His brain was in overdrive throughout. You could never keep him quiet,"" Mukund wrote. Recalling long bus rides during the Ranji Trophy, Mukund highlighted Ashwin's penchant for leading games of Mafia, a deduction game that showcased his love for strategy and interaction. Mukund also reminisced about their youthful days in club cricket, where Ashwin's analytical mind often shone. ""He would bring a pen and paper to the dressing room and orchestrate mock IPL auction drafts, meticulously plotting team compositions. That restless intelligence means he never fails to surprise you every time you speak to him,"" Mukund shared. Mukund revealed that during India's Test match against Bangladesh in Chennai in September, he sensed Ashwin was preparing to call time on his international career. The moment, while subtle, marked the beginning of the end for a cricketer who had become synonymous with excellence and innovation. Ashwin's impact extended beyond his numbers. He was a key member of India's victorious 2011 ODI World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy squads. In 116 ODIs, Ashwin took 156 wickets, while his T20I career saw him claim 72 wickets in 65 matches. As Ashwin steps away from international cricket, he leaves behind a legacy defined not just by his achievements but by his relentless quest for improvement and his unique approach to the game.

Jadeja revealed that Ashwin and he had been sitting together throughout the final day's play, but his former spin partner did not give the slightest hint about the significant decision that followed.   Speaking to the press on Saturday, December 21, after India's first training session in Melbourne, Ravindra Jadeja addressed Ashwin's announcement, which had made headlines last week.  | Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage | ""I got to know about it only in the last moment. Just before when he came to address the press. I think it was 5 minutes before the press conference, people told me that this was going to happen. Obviously, I was surprised because we both were sitting together throughout that day. He didn't even give a hint. I got to know in the last minute. Yes, we all know Ashwin's mind and how it works,"" Jadeja said.   Ashwin made an unforeseen announcement minutes after the third Test in Brisbane ended in a draw on 18 December. The veteran off-spinner stated that he was retiring with immediate effect. Ashwin left the team at the conclusion of the third Test and reached Chennai the following day.   The timing of R Ashwin's retirement has left the cricketing world divided. However, Jadeja emphasised that it was time for the team to move on and ensure the youngster stepping in for Ashwin gains as much experience and exposure as possible in the days ahead.   ""We have to move on. In India, it's not like you won't get someone who can replace him. Everybody knows we will get someone.   ""It's a good opportunity for a youngster who comes into the team and to prove himself at this level,"" Jadeja added.   India have fielded as many as three spinners across the first three Tests. Washington Sundar played as the lone spinner in the series opener in Perth, while Ashwin featured in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, which was his final match. For the third Test in Brisbane, India replaced Ashwin with Ravindra Jadeja in the playing XI.  JADEJA ON NOT PLAYING FIRST TWO TESTS While Jadeja could not make a significant impact with the ball, he stepped up with the bat when his team needed him the most. Jadeja scored a crucial 77 runs in the first innings of the rain-affected Brisbane Test, ensuring that India avoided a follow-on.   India were struggling at 74 for 5 after losing key players, including Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, cheaply in response to Australia's first innings total of 445. However, KL Rahul and Jadeja stitched together a vital 67-run partnership to steer the team out of trouble.   Reflecting on his innings, Jadeja said the match-saving knock in Brisbane would boost his confidence for the rest of the series. He credited the time he spent training during the first two Tests as a crucial factor in his performance.   ""The first two Tests I didn't play, but it gave me an opportunity to practice and get used to conditions. All the time I got to understand the conditions, bowl on these pitches and bat on these pitches, it made me familiar with these conditions. All the hard work in the nets helped me in the match,"" he said.   With the series level at 1-1, India and Australia are set to face off in the fourth Test, beginning on Boxing Day at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Abhinav Mukund believes Ashwin contemplated retirement before final decisionTrending Reel

While Ashwin and Jadeja have parted ways in Test cricket, fans will be thrilled to see the duo reunite for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in IPL 2025. Jadeja, retained by CSK for Rs 18 crore, will be joined by Ashwin, who was acquired for Rs 9.75 crore after a fierce bidding war at the auction. Their partnership in the IPL is expected to bring back the chemistry and experience that made them a feared pair in Test cricket.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/football-pep-guardiola-backs-erling-haaland-perform-manchester-city-better-2653223-2024-12-21,"Pep Guardiola has thrown his support behind star striker Erling Haaland, highlighting the need for Manchester City to improve their overall play to maximize the Norwegian's impact. This comes as City navigate a challenging spell of form, with only one win in their last 11 matches across all competitions - a stark contrast to the dominance typically associated with Guardiola's tenure. Haaland, who has been a goal-scoring machine since joining City, has struggled recently, scoring just once in his last five games. The lack of service has left him isolated against opposing defenders. However, Guardiola dismissed any suggestion of reverting to a false nine system, which had previously brought him success. ""I prefer to play with Erling,"" Guardiola said ahead of City's Premier League clash with Aston Villa. ""I don't think in this situation that I should not let Erling play - absolutely not. We have to adapt to the qualities he brings."" Guardiola acknowledged that Haaland's reduced goal tally is a symptom of the team's struggles rather than a reflection of the player's form. ""The reason he's not been as productive is the way we're playing,"" Guardiola explained. ""We're not creating the volume of chances we did in the past. When he's surrounded by two, three, or four defenders, it's tough for him. We need to play better as a team to create the spaces he needs."" Amid City's current struggles, Guardiola hinted at the possibility of January reinforcements, a departure from the club's usual reluctance to engage heavily in the winter transfer market. ""We've spoken about doing something,"" Guardiola revealed. ""But it has to be for the long term, not just for four or five months. Historically, we haven't done much business in January, but the circumstances this season have been special."" Guardiola referenced Aymeric Laporte's signing in January 2018 as a rare exception and underscored the challenges of making impactful signings mid-season. ""Teams don't want to sell, and prices are high,"" he noted. One potential hurdle for City is the ongoing investigation into alleged breaches of Premier League financial regulations. While the club faces 115 charges, Guardiola expressed uncertainty over whether this could impact recruitment plans. As City prepare for their trip to Villa Park, the focus remains on turning their season around. Guardiola's faith in Haaland and the team's ability to rediscover their rhythm will be crucial as they navigate this critical period.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Read More |  Ruben Dias ruled out for four weeks as Manchester City suffer fresh injury blowMust Watch

Although Jadeja did not make a significant impact with the ball at the Gabba, his batting contributions proved to be crucial for India in getting a hard-fought draw to keep the series level. Jadeja played a key role with the bat in the first innings, scoring a vital 77 runs off 123 balls while batting at No.7. His 67-run partnership with KL Rahul helped stabilise India’s innings and ensured a competitive total, which played a significant part in securing a draw against Australia. Speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of the Boxing Day Test, he explained how he had prepared for the Gabba Test even better after not being named in the India eleven for Perth and Adelaide. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard ""The first two Tests I didn’t play, but it gave me an opportunity to practice and get used to the conditions. All the time, I got to understand the conditions, bowl on these pitches and bat on these pitches, it made me familiar with these conditions. All the hard work in the nets helped me in the match,"" Jadeja added. With his long-time spin-bowling partner Ravichandran Ashwin announcing his retirement after the Gabba Test, Jadeja now shoulders the primary spin-bowling duties for the team. Jadeja’s role will also be pivotal in the Sydney Test, which traditionally offers assistance to spinners. His vast experience in similar conditions makes him a key player for skipper Rohit Sharma as India looks to build on the momentum gained from the Gabba Test draw.  Heading into the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, India is likely to depend heavily on Jadeja’s all-round abilities. His experience with both bat and ball will be crucial in maintaining balance within the team, particularly with Washington Sundar being the only other full-time spin option available. As the Border-Gavaskar Trophy progresses, Jadeja’s performances will be central to India’s plans. His ability to contribute in all facets of the game is expected to play a major role in shaping the team’s success in the remainder of the series.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Nathan McSweeney 'devastated' as Boxing Day Test dream shattered

Jadeja's remarks come ahead of the Boxing Day Test, scheduled in Melbourne from December 26. The five-match Test series is currently tied at 1-1 after the rain-hit third Test in Brisbane ended in a draw.  The highly anticipated BGT series has seen its fair share of drama. India started on a high note, securing a commanding 295-run victory in the first Test at the Optus Stadium, with stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah leading from the front. However, Australia bounced back in style, claiming a comprehensive 10-wicket win in the second Test, a day-night affair at the Adelaide Oval.  Speaking at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) ahead of the fourth Test, Jadeja highlighted the importance of staying focused on the task at hand. ""We are in a good position, after three matches, it's still 1-1. It is going to be interesting. Even if we win one match out of the next two, we will retain the series because we have won the last two times here. It's a good opportunity to push ourselves and do well in Melbourne. Yes, we will worry about the last match later, the focus now is on the Boxing Day Test. It's a crucial game for us,"" Jadeja said. The third Test in Brisbane saw Australia dominate the first two days. Batting first, they posted an imposing total of 445, driven by centuries from Travis Head and Steve Smith. India, on the back foot with the bat, appeared set for a potential defeat. However, rain interruptions and a valiant lower-order effort ensured the match ended in a draw. The stage is now set for the fourth Test, starting on Boxing Day (December 26). Both teams will look to seize the advantage in what promises to be another gripping contest. This match holds added significance as it could potentially determine the series winner and play a pivotal role in shaping the teams' paths to the ICC World Test Championship final. India will aim to capitalise on their resilience, while Australia will look to regain momentum.

The decision to exclude McSweeney after just three Test matches has drawn mixed reactions from fans and former cricketers alike. Despite the disappointment, McSweeney vowed to work on his game and fight his way back into the national team. The 25-year-old, who was handed the challenging role of opening the batting despite being a middle-order specialist in domestic cricket, struggled to find form. In his three matches, McSweeney managed just 72 runs in six innings, marking the lowest output for an Australian opener in their first six innings in 50 years. His difficulties were compounded as he faced some of the most lethal bowlers in India’s lineup, particularly the early brilliance of Jasprit Bumrah. Speaking to 7 News McSweeney admitted that missing out on the Boxing Day Test was a bitter pill to swallow, but he remained optimistic for a return. AUS vs IND 3rd Test Day 5: Highlights | Scorecard ""Yes, I mean devastated. I get the dream come true and then didn't quite work out the way I wanted it, but it's all part of it and yeah I'll get the head down and get back in the nets and work really hard and hopefully be ready to go for the next opportunity,"" Mcsweeney said.  ""I think it's the game we're in. if you don't take your opportunity and you're not performing as well as you want to, your position's never safe. So I missed out a few times with the bat and unfortunately wasn't able to take my opportunity. But yeah, as I said, I'll work really hard to make sure if the opportunity comes around again, I'm definitely ready,"" he added. McSweeney’s lack of impact, paired with senior opener Usman Khawaja’s struggles—an average of just 12 runs and a top score of 21—prompted a shake-up in Australia’s squad. However, the selectors opted to back Khawaja’s experience while dropping the young debutant. Chief selector George Bailey explained the decision to replace McSweeney with 19-year-old Sam Konstas, an attacking batter, stating that the move was aimed at adding a ""point of difference"" to the squad. Konstas has been in fine form, with standout performances in the domestic circuit, including a century in a pink-ball match against India.  Meanwhile, injuries have forced Australia to make additional changes to their squad. Josh Hazlewood’s fitness issues led to recalls for Sean Abbott and Jhye Richardson to ensure adequate cover for the fast bowlers. All-rounder Beau Webster was also brought in as Mitchell Marsh faces ongoing injury concerns. AUSTRALIA SQUAD FOR LAST 2 TESTS OF BGT 2024-25 Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.

The hearing, considered one of the most significant cases in sports law, concluded on December 9, leaving the footballing world awaiting the outcome. The backdrop to these allegations comes during a season of growing unease amongst Manchester City fans. The club’s inconsistent form across all competitions has raised concerns, and the impending verdict adds further uncertainty to their future. Guardiola, speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of their December 21 clash with Aston Villa, acknowledged the looming decision but emphasised that it remains external to his team’s immediate focus. ""It’s going to happen in the winter time. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I know people are expecting that but I don’t know. In February, March, [maybe] will be the sentence,"" Guardiola said. ""We're in a difficult situation, but we will continue to focus on what we can control - our performance on the field...Our priority remains winning matches and maintaining our standards, regardless of the external pressures we face,"" he added. City's 115 charges include 80 alleged breaches related to financial misrepresentation and 35 for failing to cooperate with investigations. These allegations span the period from 2009 to 2018, accusing the club of providing inaccurate financial disclosures regarding sponsorship revenues and salaries. If found guilty, the reigning Premier League champions could face severe repercussions, including points deductions or even relegation to the Championship. Manchester City has consistently denied the allegations and is committed to defending its reputation. The club argues that its rise to prominence over the past decade was built on robust management, innovative strategies, and substantial investment from its ownership group. However, if the independent panel finds City guilty, it could severely tarnish the club’s legacy. City’s case aligns with a broader trend of financial scrutiny in English football. Recently, Everton faced a points deduction for breaching financial sustainability rules, while Nottingham Forest also came under investigation for irregularities. The Premier League’s increased vigilance reflects its commitment to ensuring financial fairness within its framework. As the footballing world anticipates the verdict, the implications could redefine City’s standing in the sport. From their meteoric rise to being a dominant European powerhouse under Guardiola, their legacy now hangs in the balance. Regardless of the outcome, this case serves as a critical moment in the history of financial governance within football.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Pep Guardiola backs Erling Haaland to perform if Manchester City 'play better'

They see pickleball's age and gender-agnostic inclusivity as the secret sauce behind its rapid rise, even envisioning it paddling its way to the 2032 Olympics. Vrushali, who transitioned from badminton to pickleball and rose to the top, teams up with Vanshik, a pickleball prodigy hooked on the sport since childhood, to dominate the court. Pickleball is the game everyone's talking about these days. Mixing the best bits of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, this paddle sport is on a rapid rise, and even celebrities are hopping on the bandwagon, swinging their paddles to stay fit. The game is gaining a global following, but India is quickly catching up. Just last month, tennis legend Andre Agassi also visited India to promote the sport in India. The dynamic pair recently struck gold in the 19+ open mixed doubles at the Hong Kong leg of the World Pickleball Championship, building on India's medal streak from the India leg last November, where the country claimed 28 medals, including 11 golds. Both Vrushali and Vanshik will participate in the inaugural World Pickleball League, scheduled for January 2025. While Vrushali was selected by the Bengaluru franchise during the player draft, Vanshik will represent Pune. A total of 48 players were chosen by the six teams under the close guidance of the league.

Known for her sharp anticipatory skills, Vrushali began her journey in the small town of Jalgaon, Maharashtra. Despite societal pressure to pursue a teaching career, she chose to follow her passion for sports. ""At the end of 2017, my coach Bhupendra Pal, who initially taught table tennis, introduced me to pickleball. He had seen the sport and suggested, ""Try it out; it's a good sport. If you like it, you can continue, or else leave it."" At that time, I was playing badminton and had been a university-level badminton player for four years. I decided to give pickleball a shot, and three months after starting, there was a tournament in Jalgaon. Players from various states were participating. My coach encouraged me to play, saying, ""You might perform well."" I participated and won gold in doubles and silver in mixed doubles. After that, my coach told me to continue because I was doing well, and that's how my pickleball journey began,"" Vrushali Thakare said in an exclusive interview with IndiaToday.in.

 However, starting from a remote area was not without its challenges. ""Coming from a remote area, we faced significant challenges. We didn't have paddles or balls. Our coach had wooden paddles made by a carpenter, which didn't even have proper grips and were hard to hold. Balls weren't available in India then, so we used smiley balls to play. Thankfully, our college had two badminton courts. We lowered the nets and used them for pickleball. Today, the situation has improved. Wooden paddles are available for as little as Rs 250, and a ball can last a week on a decent surface. So now, even kids in remote areas can afford to play pickleball,""Vrushali explained. In 2021, Vrushali and her mixed doubles partner Ajay Choudhary established the Thakare Pickleball Academy in Pune. With two courts funded from their own earnings, the academy has since trained over 200 players, including five juniors who represented India at the Junior Championship in Vietnam. "" At that time, pickleball was relatively unknown in the city, and there weren't any courts. We invested our earnings from pickleball to build two courts and began training players. In just two years, we coached over 200 players, including five juniors who were selected to represent India in the Junior Championship in Vietnam. It's been incredible to see the sport grow and gain recognition. Pickleball is a sport for everyone. At our academy, we've trained players as young as five and as old as 80. I remember a 72-year-old woman from a nearby building who used to watch the games. She was so inspired that she decided to join us, saying, ""I want to learn and play too."" Vrushali explains how the Indian Pickleball Association (IPA) has played a key role in promoting the sport nationwide, organizing tournaments and providing players with essential resources. As pickleball rapidly gains popularity, with tennis courts in housing societies being converted for the game, it mirrors the sport's growth in the US. With this momentum, pickleball could soon rank among India's top sports. ""The Indian Pickleball Association (IPA) has played a significant role in the sport's growth. When I started, IPA was already organizing tournaments, providing exposure and experience for players. Today, they continue to support players with equipment and resources. Their efforts have been instrumental in popularising pickleball across India."" ""Pickleball is growing rapidly in India, just as it has in the US. In many housing societies, tennis courts are being converted into pickleball courts. With such expansion, I believe pickleball can become the second or third most popular sport in India in the next five years. To aspiring players, I would say: play because you enjoy it. If you love the sport, it will give back to you in ways you can't imagine. Whether it's pickleball or any other sport, passion and joy will take you far.""VANSHIK HOPES PICKLEBALL REACHES OLYMPICS At just 19 years old, Vanshik Kapadia made a formidable presence in pickleball. Transitioning from tennis, a sport he began playing at the age of six, Vanshik found his true calling in pickleball in 2018. Today, he holds the prestigious rank of No. 1 in both Asia and India. Reflecting on his journey, Vanshik shared, ""I started playing pickleball when I was six years old, and in 2018, I began playing professionally. My journey began at my home club, Khar Gymkhana, where I hit my first pickleball shot. It was my dad who introduced me to the sport, and from that moment, there was no looking back. I fell in love with pickleball the instant I played my first shot. That's how it all started, and I decided then and there that this was the path I wanted to pursue."" Despite competing on the global stage, Vanshik's calm and focused demeanour sets him apart. ""I don't see pressure as a hindrance. It's all about focusing on what's within your control. External factors are just distractions,"" he explained.

Despite Kohli’s long-awaited century in India’s victory in the Perth Test, the star batter has struggled to replicate that form in the subsequent two matches. Bangar, speaking to Star Sports, emphasised that Kohli needs to remain patient and cautious while batting at Melbourne, especially given his struggles with deliveries outside the off-stump. Australian bowlers have consistently troubled Kohli by exploiting this weakness, a strategy that has yielded results throughout the series. | Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage | ""Sometimes you need to keep your status as a batter in control a little. When you surrender slightly to the game, spend a little time, ease out in the middle for some time, wait for the bowler to come to you, and do not go yourself towards the bowler, that's the sign of a big player,"" Bangar said. ""Play as many balls as possible close to your front pad and then the runs will flow because it's not that he hasn't scored runs. He scored a century three innings ago and in the series before that, he played a 70-run knock against New Zealand in Bengaluru,"" he added. Kohli’s numbers in the series so far underline his struggles: he has accumulated just 126 runs across six innings at an average of 30. Excluding his hundred in Perth, he managed only 26 runs in his remaining five innings. This inconsistent form has sparked concerns among fans, who anticipated Kohli playing a pivotal role in conditions where he has historically thrived. Melbourne Cricket Ground, however, remains a promising venue for Kohli to rediscover his best form. The batter has amassed 316 runs at an average of 52.66 at this venue, including a memorable 169-run knock during the Boxing Day Test in 2014. With India needing a strong batting performance to regain momentum, Kohli will look to draw inspiration from his past successes at the iconic ground. India’s drawn Gabba Test showcased resilience, but the batting failures of experienced players like Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma remain a significant concern. With the Border-Gavaskar Trophy level at 1-1, the Boxing Day Test is a crucial fixture. India’s chances of sealing a spot in the World Test Championship Final hinge on their ability to secure a positive result in Melbourne. Bangar’s advice underscores the importance of Kohli’s role in this high-stakes encounter. The star batter’s ability to adapt and deliver under pressure could be the difference-maker in a series that has already witnessed intense battles between two of the world’s top Test sides.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  I got to know R Ashwin was retiring 5 minutes before he announced it: Ravindra Jadeja

Now the Australian press have accused spinner Ravindra Jadeja of refusing to answer questions in English. Notably, Jadeja addressed the media after India's first practice session at the MCG. The press conference proceeded smoothly until Jadeja concluded the session and decided to return to practice. At this point, an Australian journalist expressed frustration, displaying anger over Jadeja not answering any questions in English. India's media manager attempted to explain that the press conference was organised primarily for the Indian media, but the Australian journalist appeared unwilling to accept this clarification. The reporter was seen lashing out at the India team media manager, further escalating the situation. Australian media: One question in English?  Team manager: sorry, we don't have time now. You can see the team bus is waiting.  Aussie media: Can't we take one question in English? Manager: This was organised mainly for the travelling Indian media.  Aussie media: The organisation is hopeless. This is not the first time tensions have flared between Indian players and the Australian media. The press in Australia has a history of creating narratives that put Indian cricketers under scrutiny, often playing the role of the ""12th man"" in favour of their team. Earlier in the series, Virat Kohli confronted the Australian media for invading his privacy at Melbourne airport. Channel 7 cameras, which were initially covering Australian pacer Scott Boland, shifted their focus to Kohli and his family, prompting the cricketer to demand respect for his personal space. The matter was resolved amicably after assurances were given that his children were not being filmed. Incidents like the infamous ""Monkeygate"" scandal in 2008 and frequent press-driven altercations underscore the contentious relationship between the Australian media and Indian players. These controversies often surface during high-stakes matches, adding fuel to the already intense rivalry. With the series tied at 1-1, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has already seen its share of on-field drama.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Read More |  Robin Uthappa in trouble after arrest warrant over PF Fraud allegations

 Sixes was co-founded by Calum Mackinnon and Andy Waugh, the creative minds behind the Scottish restaurant and butcher chain Mac & Wild. The first Sixes location launched in Fulham in December 2020, with a focus on combining food, drink, and cricket in a way that resonates with both fans and newcomers. ""More people now play cricket at Sixes in the UK than actually play the sport itself,"" Mackinnon stated, highlighting the rapid growth of the brand. Four years since its inception, Sixes boasts 18 locations across the UK, with plans to add another 20-30 venues domestically and expand into the Caribbean and the US. The company has received approximately 1,500 franchise requests, primarily from the US, demonstrating the appeal of its ""competitive socialising"" concept. REDEFINING SOCIALISING Sixes is part of a broader trend in the UK's entertainment scene, where traditional sports are reimagined for a social setting. This movement began with ventures like bowling and cocktails at All Star Lanes in 2006, followed by table tennis at Bounce, darts at Flight Club, mini-golf at Puttshack, and F1 Arcade. Sixes adds cricket to this lineup, offering a high-tech, fun-filled environment for players to enjoy.

Players score runs by hitting targets around the cage, choosing from three game modes, including a Hundred version developed in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board. Six difficulty levels ensure that the experience caters to all abilities, from casual participants to seasoned players. WINNING OVER NEW AUDIENCE With a customer base that's 54% in their 20s and 35% female, Sixes is appealing to a demographic that traditional cricket has struggled to engage. Co-founder Mackinnon, a cricket convert himself, believes in the potential of Sixes to bridge the gap between socialising and sport. ""We're two Scots who never played or watched cricket in our lives,"" he said. ""Now we're huge fans, attending matches and truly appreciating the game."" As Sixes continues to grow, its fusion of cricket, cuisine, and camaraderie is redefining how people experience the sport, bringing a fresh energy to the cricketing world and beyond.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Read More |  Jasprit Bumrah will do a very good job: Border backs pacer to flourish as skipper

The warrant, issued by PF Regional Commissioner Shadakshari Gopal Reddy, directs the Pulakeshinagar police to take appropriate action. Uthappa, who managed a private firm called Centuries Lifestyle Brand Private Limited, is accused of deducting PF contributions from employees’ salaries but failing to deposit the amounts, leading to an alleged fraud of Rs 23 lakh. In a letter dated December 4, Commissioner Reddy instructed the police to execute the warrant. However, the warrant was returned to the PF office as Uthappa is reportedly no longer residing at his previous address. The officials stated, ""The warrant, issued on December 4, has been returned after Mr. Uthappa was found not to be at the Pulakeshinagar residence."" The former Indian opening batsman and his family are reportedly living in Dubai. The warrant noted that the failure to remit the dues has prevented the PF office from settling the accounts of the affected workers. It directed the police to arrest Robin Uthappa and return the warrant by December 27. Uthappa, who represented India in 59 international matches, was a prominent player in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Over his cricket career, he scored 1,183 runs in 54 ODI innings, including seven half-centuries. In the IPL, Uthappa played for teams such as Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Mumbai Indians. He was part of KKR's winning squad in 2014 and was known for his aggressive batting style. Authorities are now working to trace Uthappa’s whereabouts to proceed with the investigation and ensure legal compliance.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Pickleball can make it to Olympics: India's Vrushali, Vanshik relish sport's boomMust Watch

A prominent figure in the world of lucha libre, Mysterio Sr. was the uncle of WWE Hall of Famer Rey Mysterio Jr. and the great uncle of WWE superstar Dominik Mysterio. His passing marks the loss of a beloved pioneer in Mexican wrestling. Mysterio Sr.’s illustrious career began in January 1976, during which he captivated audiences with his skill and charisma. A staple in several Mexican wrestling promotions, he performed for organisations such as the World Wrestling Association (WWA), Pro Wrestling Revolution, and Tijuana Wrestling. As a versatile competitor, he clinched the WWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship and held the WWA Tag Team Championship alongside his nephew, Rey Mysterio Jr., further solidifying their family legacy. To differentiate him from his nephew, Rey Mysterio Jr., he was commonly referred to as Rey Mysterio Sr. His influence extended beyond his own achievements, as he played a crucial role in mentoring and shaping the careers of Rey Mysterio Jr. and other aspiring wrestlers. Rey Misterio Sr. was also the granduncle to Dominik Mysterio, another rising WWE star, and his grandniece Aalyah, who has made occasional WWE appearances. The family’s multi-generational contributions to wrestling are a testament to the enduring legacy that Mysterio Sr. built throughout his career. Social media platforms were flooded with tributes and condolences from fans and fellow wrestlers, remembering Mysterio Sr.’s impact on the sport and his gracious spirit outside the ring. This devastating news follows the recent loss of Roberto Gutierrez, Rey Mysterio Jr.’s father and Dominik’s grandfather, who passed away on November 17 at the age of 76. In an emotional tribute to his father, Rey Mysterio Jr. shared on Instagram: ""You did more than set the example of how to love and maintain a strong marriage and father 4 boys. You were the example, and passed every single time... until your death with flying colours."" “You are with God now and smiling from the heavens while we continue with the real struggle of life until we see again. You will never be forgotten and will always be loved, RIP Pops,"" he added. The wrestling community mourns the passing of Rey Mysterio Sr., a trailblazer whose influence will resonate for generations to come.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Pickleball can make it to Olympics: India's Vrushali, Vanshik relish sport's boom

This was Konstas's final innings in the Big Bash League before his anticipated Test debut on Boxing Day at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The 19-year-old prodigy, playing his first match since being included in Australia’s Test squad, attempted to cut a short delivery from Akeal Hosein but chopped it onto his stumps. The dismissal contrasted sharply with his sensational debut just five days earlier, where he smashed the fastest half-century in Sydney Thunder’s history against the Adelaide Strikers. Konstas earned a spot in the Test squad after replacing Nathan McSweeney and is widely expected to don the Baggy Green in the highly anticipated Boxing Day Test against India. His selection follows a remarkable domestic season, highlighted by a record-breaking performance in the Sheffield Shield, where he became the youngest player since Ricky Ponting to score twin centuries in a match. Earlier this month, Konstas made headlines with a blistering 107 against an Indian attack missing Jasprit Bumrah and followed it up with a composed 88 against Western Australia. His exploits have drawn praise from cricketing legends and analysts alike, with former England captain Michael Vaughan hailing him as “fearless” and “unflappable.” If Konstas takes the field at the MCG, he will face one of the sternest challenges in world cricket. India’s pace spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, has been a nightmare for Australian batters this summer, with 53 career wickets in Australia at an average of 17.15—the best by any overseas bowler with 50 or more wickets Down Under. Despite the daunting task, Konstas enters the Test arena with 718 first-class runs at an average of 42.23 from 11 matches. His ability to deliver under pressure and adapt to different formats sets him apart. England’s World Cup-winning coach and Sydney Thunder mentor, Trevor Bayliss, spoke highly of Konstas, likening his self-confidence to that of David Warner, Steve Smith, and Michael Clarke. “Sam has a self-confidence you don’t see in very many. I’ve only seen it a few over the years, and all of those players were outstanding Test players,” Bayliss said.

Notably, Bumrah had announced himself with a sensational debut against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the 2013 season picking 3/32 in four overs. Since then, everybody took notice of the young seamer from Gujarat as he got the prized scalp of Virat Kohli as his maiden IPL wicket. Recently, Hussey also recalled facing a young Bumrah in nets and revealed how he was tested by him. The legendary Australian batter mentioned how Bumrah’s unusual action left him unsettled that he couldn’t even see the ball. ""I remember facing him in the nets and literally couldn't get bat on the ball. I felt like I was using a toothpick. I couldn't even see the ball, let alone pick it coming out of his hand. His action is so different, so deceptive. My first impression? I honestly didn't think he'd even make it to the crease. His run-up was staggered and awkward. I remember thinking, ‘Who is this guy?' And then suddenly, woof - the ball whistles past my eyebrows at 145kph!,” Hussey said on Willow Talk. Further speaking ahead, Hussey revealed how people felt that Bumrah was not made for Test cricket in his early days and mentioned how he’s proved everyone wrong.People said his action and run-up would be too hard on his body: Hussey ""In India, there was so much scepticism. People said his action and run-up would be too hard on his body, that he wouldn't last in Test cricket. But even back then, I could see his skills and ability. I knew that if he had the desire to play Test cricket, he could succeed. Isn't he doing it bloody well at the moment? It's just phenomenal to see how he's grown. Watching him transform from a kid in the nets who terrified us to one of the best bowlers in the world has been incredible,” he added. Bumrah made his Test debut in 2018 and became the leader of the Indian pace attack within a year. He’s scalped 194 wickets from 43 matches so far at an average of 19.52 which is only second best to Sydney Barnes among bowlers with over 150 Test wickets. The India speedster is the current number ranked bowler in Test cricket with 890 ratings to his name.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja confident India can complete BGT hat-trick in Australia

The son of England international George Senior, Eastham was a midfielder and inside forward who played for Newcastle United, Arsenal, and Stoke City in the English top-flight league during a professional career spanning two decades. He earned 19 caps for England. Renowned for his lethal left foot and creativity, Eastham is regarded as a legend at Stoke City. He famously scored the winning goal in the 1972 League Cup final, securing the club's first major trophy with a 2-1 victory over Chelsea. Over eight seasons, Eastham made 194 league appearances for Stoke and later managed the club from 1977 to 1978. Born in Blackpool, Eastham is also remembered for his pivotal role in challenging the old 'retain and transfer' system, which allowed clubs to keep a player's registration to prevent them from leaving. When his contract with Newcastle expired in 1959, Eastham went on an eight-month strike to force the club to let him join Arsenal.

— Stoke City FC (@stokecity) December 21, 2024 He also took the matter to the High Court, where a judge ruled the'retain and transfer' system unreasonable. This landmark case led to significant reforms in the British transfer market, including the establishment of a tribunal to resolve disputes. In 1973, Eastham was honoured with the title of Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his contributions to football. As a mark of respect, Stoke City players will wear black armbands during their Championship game against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday, the club announced. ""The Stoke City family is immensely saddened by the passing of club legend George Eastham OBE at the age of 88,"" his former club said upon announcing his death on their website. ""George was signed by the Potters for a £35,000 fee shortly after being part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad. He went on to represent the club for eight seasons in the top division of the English game and was a two-time FA Cup semi-finalist in red and white.  ""He is perhaps best remembered as the man whose goal secured the 1972 League Cup in a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Wembley. The Potters will wear black armbands for the fixture against Sheffield Wednesday [on Saturday] as a mark of respect. Our thoughts are with George's family and friends at this difficult time.""

He hit a 35-ball hundred to register the overall 3rd fastest ton in List A matches. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/anmolpreet-singh-breaks-14-year-old-record-hits-fastest-list-a-century-by-an-indian-2653425-2024-12-21,"Anmolpreet Singh, the Punjab top-order batter, scripted his name in cricketing history by scoring the fastest List A century by an Indian. His explosive 35-ball hundred during the Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad, shattered Yusuf Pathan’s 14-year-old record. Pathan had previously held the record for his 40-ball century against Maharashtra in 2009.   The record-breaking knock placed Anmolpreet third on the all-time list for the fastest List A centuries, behind Jake Fraser-McGurk (29 balls) and AB de Villiers (31 balls). Fraser-McGurk’s record-breaking innings came earlier this year during the Marsh Cup in Australia, while De Villiers’ 31-ball effort remains the fastest in ODIs.  Anmolpreet Singh creates history Walking in at No. 3 after the early dismissal of captain Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet launched a relentless assault on Arunachal Pradesh’s bowling attack. His innings was studded with 12 boundaries and nine towering sixes, showcasing his ability to dominate both pace and spin. He particularly targeted off-spinner Techi Neri, smashing 31 runs in a single over. By the time Anmolpreet reached his hundred, Punjab were well on their way to a commanding victory. Anmolpreet remained unbeaten on 115 off just 45 balls, as Punjab chased down a modest target of 165 in just 12.5 overs, securing a dominant nine-wicket win. Prabhsimran Singh provided support with a steady 35 off 25 balls, forging an unbroken 153-run stand for the second wicket with Anmolpreet.   Earlier in the match, Arunachal Pradesh struggled against Punjab’s disciplined bowling attack, managing only 164 in their 50 overs. Mayank Markande and Ashwani Kumar were the pick of the bowlers with three wickets each, while Baltej Singh claimed two scalps. Techi Neri (42) and Hardik Varma (38) were the only notable contributors for Arunachal.   Anmolpreet’s stunning performance not only cemented his place in the record books but also reminded cricket fans of his immense potential as he went unsold in the IPL 2025 auction. Despite his moderate returns in the IPL with Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad, this knock could reignite his career and open doors for future opportunities.

Following a commanding 3-0 victory over Pachuca in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup final, Ancelotti secured his record-breaking 15th trophy with Los Blancos. The triumph highlighted a remarkable managerial career that spans two successful spells at the club, first from 2013-2015 and again from 2021-present.   Ancelotti's impressive haul with Madrid includes three UEFA Champions League titles, two La Liga crowns, two Copa del Reys, two Spanish Supercopas, three UEFA Super Cups, two Club World Cups, and now the Intercontinental Cup. The Italian tactician surpassed the late Miguel Muñoz, who previously held the record with 14 trophies, including nine La Liga titles and two European Cups, during his time as Madrid's manager from 1959 to 1974. “It is an honour and a pleasure to have been able to achieve this success,” said Ancelotti. “I have to share it with the club, first because it gave me the opportunity to return, and second because it has allowed me to coach players of a very high technical level. That has been the key,” he added.

India also racked up their highest T20I score of 217 for four with Richa Ghosh smashing the joint-fastest fifty off 18 balls. For the ODI series, India have given a call-up to Delhi batter Pratika Rawal, who was the second-highest run-scorer in the previous edition of the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy. The 24-year-old scored 411 runs from eight games at an average of 68.50 and a strike-rate of 91.94.

Recently, the 19-year-old shared his thoughts on his Test call up on the sidelines of the Big Bash League (BBL) Match 8 between Sydney Thunder and Sydney Sixers.

Leading Uttar Pradesh in the men’s Under-23 State A Trophy match against Tripura, Rizvi scored an unbeaten 201 off just 97 balls. His blistering knock included 13 fours and 20 towering sixes, leaving the Tripura bowlers in tatters. Rizvi walked in to bat in the 23rd over and single-handedly propelled his team to an imposing total of 405 runs. While this incredible feat doesn’t qualify as a List A record, Rizvi’s knock remains extraordinary. The record for the fastest double century in List A cricket is currently held by New Zealand’s Chad Bowes, who broke the joint record of India’s Narayan Jagadeesan and Australia’s Travis Head. Both Jagadeesan and Head achieved the milestone in 114 balls during the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Marsh Cup, respectively. Rizvi’s innings, despite not being officially listed, stands out for its sheer brutality and remarkable pace.Sameer Rizvi shines in domestic cricket In the IPL 2025 mega auction, Rizvi was picked up by the Delhi Capitals for Rs 95 lakh, marking a significant drop from the previous season, where Chennai Super Kings signed him for a whopping Rs 8.4 crore. Often compared to Suresh Raina for his aggressive batting style, Rizvi had an underwhelming debut IPL season, managing just 51 runs across five innings at a strike rate of 118.60. CSK chose not to retain the uncapped player for Rs 4 crore, opting to release him instead. However, Rizvi’s recent performances suggest a turnaround in form. In addition to his double century, he has delivered two back-to-back stellar knocks, scoring 153 in one match and an unbeaten 137 in another. These explosive innings underline his potential as a match-winner and justify the Delhi Capitals’ decision to invest in him. With his current purple patch, Rizvi looks set to be a vital asset for the Delhi Capitals in the upcoming IPL season and a player to watch in Indian domestic cricket.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Anmolpreet Singh breaks 14-year-old record, hits fastest List A century by an IndianMust Watch

Head has been instrumental in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, already amassing two centuries in Adelaide and Brisbane, showcasing his adaptability and skill on challenging pitches. However, this resurgence wasn’t always on the cards. Head endured a tough phase early in his career, including being dropped from the Australian squad ahead of the Sydney Test during the BGT 2020/21, after his dismal performance in th Boxing Day Test. Head subsequently lost his national contract. Reflecting on his journey, Head identified his time with Sussex on England's county circuit as a turning point. Playing in different conditions allowed him to refine his approach, leading to a better understanding of his strengths and limitations. ""I lost my (national) contract, and then I went to Sussex and stunk it up there as well...I tried to keep batting the way I was batting and it wasn't working,"" Head said. ""Then in one of my last games at Sussex I got 49 off 46 in the second innings and I thought, 'F**k this, I am just going to slog...And I did well, so I thought, 'Why don't I just do that?',"" he added. Since his return to the Australian side, Head has been a consistent performer, rewriting his narrative as one of the team’s most dependable batters. In 33 Tests since his comeback, he has averaged 46.71 and recorded nine centuries. Furthermore, he has been named Player of the Match eight times during this period, underlining his impact on Australia’s success. In the current Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Head’s contributions have been outstanding. After three Tests, he has compiled 409 runs at an impressive average of 81.80, including consecutive centuries that turned the tide for Australia in Adelaide and Brisbane. His ability to balance aggression with composure has made him a key figure in Australia’s batting lineup. As the series stands level at 1-1, the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne holds immense significance for both sides as they vie for a spot in the World Test Championship Final. For Head, it’s another opportunity to solidify his place as a match-winner. His form and confidence make him arguably Australia’s most pivotal player heading into this crucial encounter. Head’s journey, marked by resilience and self-discovery, epitomizes the value of adaptation and perseverance, ensuring he remains a cornerstone of Australia’s Test aspirations.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Did Ravindra Jadeja snub English questions at MCG?

Notably, Kohli hasn’t been in the best of forms in recent times having scored just 21 runs in the last three innings after his hundred in the first Test against Australia in Perth. The former India captain has suffered a massive decline in his performances since 2020 with just three hundreds to his name in the last four years and has accumulated just 1964 runs from 65 innings at an average of 31.67. Recently, Greg Chappell analyzed Kohli’s recent performances and mentioned that he’s shown signs of EPDS due to the tendency of beginning his innings tentatively.  “The first visible sign of EPDS is a subtle but unmistakable shift in a player’s approach at the crease. Kohli, once renowned for his domineering starts, has in recent years shown a tendency to begin tentatively,” Chappell wrote in his column for The Sydney Morning Herald. Chappell also said that Kohli’s poor form is much like legendary cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting and suggested that he needs a buffer of 20-30 runs to rediscover his flow at the crease. “Much like Tendulkar and Ponting before him, Kohli seems to need a buffer – a score of 20 or 30 – before he can rediscover his flow. Reaching a score of 20 or 30 acts as a psychological turning point, helping them regain the confidence and fluency of their prime,"" he added.Kohli's weakness being exploited by Australian bowlers Kohli’s weakness outside the off stump has been exploited by Australian bowlers throughout the series as he’s constantly got out in a similar fashion. The star batter worked to correct his mistake ahead of the third Test in Brisbane but once again ended up chasing a widish delivery which went straight into Alex Carey’s gloves. Hence, Kohli is yet to put his past mistakes behind him as he heads into the fourth Test in Melbourne. Having not been able to have a massive impact in the series so far, there is massive uncertainty about his future in the Test team and if India doesn’t make it to the World Test Championship (WTC) final, some tough decisions are likely to be on the cards.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja confident India can complete BGT hat-trick in Australia

The Afghanistan team registered their 6th consecutive white-ball series victory this year. Winning the toss, Afghanistan opted to bowl first and their decision paid off instantly. The bowlers struck early, reducing Zimbabwe to 38/3 in the power-play. The hosts showed little intent, which allowed Afghanistan to dictate terms. Zimbabwe's senior players, Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza, tried to stabilise the innings. However, Rashid Khan's introduction proved decisive as he dismissed Raza and further dented the hosts' fragile batting lineup. The star of the innings was Allah Ghazanfar, whose mystery spin left Zimbabwe's batters clueless. Bowling a remarkable ten-over spell, Ghazanfar picked up a five-wicket haul, dismantling the middle and lower order. Only Williams displayed some resistance with a well-made fifty, but his departure, attempting to accelerate, sealed Zimbabwe’s fate.

— Afghanistan Cricket Board (@ACBofficials) December 21, 2024 Chasing a modest target, Afghanistan’s batters displayed maturity and composure. Zimbabwe's seamers, led by Richard Ngarava, started well by exploiting the swinging conditions. Abdul Malik struggled at the crease but managed to hold one end for a while. On the other hand, Sediqullah Atal continued his impressive run of form, playing with confidence and composure. The southpaw rotated the strike well and punished loose deliveries, reaching a fine fifty before falling to a stunning catch by Bennett. By the time Malik was dismissed, Afghanistan were well in control. Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi and Rahmat Shah ensured no further hiccups as they stitched a steady partnership to chase down the target with ease. Afghanistan secured a comprehensive 8-wicket victory, wrapping up the series in style. For Zimbabwe, it was another disappointing outing with the bat. Only four players managed to reach double figures. The hosts need to address their batting woes as they look forward to the upcoming Boxing Day Test in Bulawayo, marking the first such game in Zimbabwe since 1996. Afghanistan’s consistent performances bode well for their preparations ahead of the Champions Trophy, as they continue to uncover exciting talents like Atal and Ghazanfar.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  Jasprit Bumrah and Co. engage in hardcore bowling practice before Boxing Day Test

On the first ball of the 12th over, Thunder captain Moises Henriques charged down the track against Nathan McAndrew and called Jack Edwards for a quick single. However, Warner, who was stationed at cover, quickly ran in and collected the ball and hit the stumps at the striker’s end.

The former India skipper’s weakness outside the off stump has been exposed by Australian bowlers time and again as he’s repeatedly got out edging the ball to slips or to wicketkeeper. Despite Kohli’s woes, Chetan Sharma has backed him to go big in the last two Tests against Australia as he’s expecting two more centuries from his bat. ""He is a player who has achieved so much for us, which raises our expectations. I am confident he will perform well. Let's hope he scores two more centuries in the next two matches.

The India skipper has given up his opening slot to KL Rahul, who performed exceptionally in the series opener in Perth in his absence. However, the sudden shift in the batting order hasn’t worked well for the India skipper, who’s found it hard to get going lower down the order. Recently, Sanjay Bangar came up with an advice for the India captain and suggested that he could come in to bat at number three. ""That is a mantra for any batter. I feel he can do two things. One, can he come to bat at No. 3 because if we have to strengthen our bowling a little and add a little sharpness, he can definitely change his number,"" Bangar told Star Sports. Further speaking ahead, Bangar also mentioned how Rohit looked a bit late to reach the ball, which has averted him to play his favourite pull shot. ""Apart from that, prepare yourself a little early. It seems like he is getting slightly late and he is also getting late because we saw his bat not going forward for his favorite pull shot. He generally doesn't miss the pull shot. It's a signal for every batter whether he is playing his best shot or not,"" he added.Rohit's poor form in current Test season Rohit had a good beginning to 2024 as he scored 400 runs in the five-match series against England. The opening batter scored two centuries and one half century across five games. However, he failed to continue his form in the recent home season and has scored just 152 runs in the last seven Tests at an average of 11.69 with just one fifty to his name.

Nonetheless, the Women in Blue triumphed 2-1, with Smriti Mandhana stepping up as captain and leading the team with three consecutive fifties in Harmanpreet's absence. “Harmanpreet is going to bat today in the nets... a complete, full nets schedule. We’ll take a call once the nets are over, and I’m sure she’ll be fine,” Muzumdar stated during the pre-series press conference. IND-W vs WI-W ODI series: All you need to know The coach acknowledged that the team will feel the absence of young wicketkeeper-batter Yastika Bhatia, who is sidelined due to injury, during the three-match ODI series. However, he assured that the management would focus on selecting the best eleven from the 15-member squad. “Yes, we will feel the absence of some players. Yastika Bhatia is injured, she is doing rehab at NCA. Hopefully, she will be fit and fine very soon.

 Rahul has re-established himself as the first-choice opening batter in Test cricket. The Karnataka batsman was initially picked in the 18-man squad for a middle-order role, but Rohit Sharma's absence in the series opener in Perth forced the management to play Rahul at the top. Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal impressed at the top of the order, combining for a match-winning 201-run partnership in the second innings of the first Test in Perth. Rahul contributed with a gritty 77, playing a pivotal role in India's victory. Even after Rohit Sharma returned for the second Test in Adelaide, KL Rahul continued to open alongside Jaiswal. Rohit moved to No. 6 but has struggled in the lower middle order. Meanwhile, Rahul strengthened his reputation at the top with a match-saving 84 in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Robin Uthappa breaks silence after arrest warrant over PF fraud allegationMust Watch

Notably, Ashwin recently announced his retirement from international cricket after the third Test against Australia in Brisbane. The off spinner finished his career as India’s second-highest wicket taker in both Tests (537 wickets) and overall in international cricket (765 wickets). However, Ashwin’s sudden retirement in the middle of the series raised many eyebrows. Aakash Chopra also shared his opinion on the matter and said that the veteran spinner may have been frustrated by being continuously overlooked in overseas conditions by the team management. ""What exactly has happened? There is a moment in everyone's life, where you think, do I want to do this anymore? Am I OK with it? Ashwin must have had this in his mind for a long time that he does not play much overseas. He is not the no.1 spin option when it comes to overseas games. This was going on for quite some time. He made peace with it. Jaddu was always ahead of him overseas. So, he made peace with it that Jadeja is playing,” said Chopra on his Youtube Channel. Further speaking ahead, Chopra also mentioned that being put even below Washington Sundar in the pecking order might’ve triggered Ashwin’s retirement decision. “But when Sundar played the Perth Test, then he said, that's it, I am done. Ashwin played the Pink-ball Test but when he was dropped from Gabba, he said, he was done. You are not serious in playing me in the XI. I did nothing wrong in Pink-ball Test to be dropped from the Gabba game. In Gabba, Jaddu made runs so Ashwin was unlikely to feature in Melbourne,” he added.Ashwin's dismal show in home series vs New Zealand Sundar played ahead of Ashwin and Jadeja in the first Test against Australia in Perth and picked two wickets along with registering scores of 4 and 29 across two innings. Sundar also outperformed both senior spinners in the recent home series against New Zealand as he scalped 16 wickets from just two matches at an average of 14.12. On the other hand, Ashwin had his second-worst performance in a home Test series with nine wickets from three matches at an average of 41.22 while Jadeja also picked 16 wickets from three matches. Hence, being outperformed by his peers in the conditions he’s dominated throughout his life mustn’t have gone down well with the Indian spinner, which could well have triggered his retirement call.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja confident India can complete BGT hat-trick in Australia

The 13-year-year-old achieved the feat during Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Group E match in the Vijay Hazare Trophy 20234-25 on Saturday, December 21 at NexGen Cricket Ground, Hyderabad. At the age of 13 years and 269 days, Suryavanshi broke the record of Ali Akbar who made his List A debut at the age of 14 years and 51 days for Vidarbha during the 1999/2000 season. He's already the youngest Indian to make his Ranji Trophy debut and also to play at the Under 19 level. However, Suryavanshi didn’t have a memorable outing on his List A debut as he got out on just the second ball of his innings by Aryan Pandey after scoring a boundary off the first one. Being put in to bat first, Bihar were bundled out for 196 in 46.4 overs with Bipin Saurabh (50 off 54) and captain Sakibul Gani (48 off 62) being the top scorers. In reply, Madhya Pradesh comfortably chased down the target in 25.1 overs as Harsh Gawli played a brilliant match-winning innings of 83 off 63 balls. As a result, Madhya Pradesh won the match by six wickets and Suryavanshi didn’t have a great beginning to his List-A career. However, the teen prodigy has been making headlines both on and off the field in recent times as he recently became the youngest player to be sold at the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction. The 13-year-old was bought for Rs 1.10 Crore by the Rajasthan Royals (RR) where he will work under the guidance of the legendary India cricketer and head coach Rahul Dravid.Suryavanshi's marvellous performance in Under 19 Asia Cup After a record-breaking IPL deal, Suryavanshi impressed everyone with his batting exploits in the recent Under-19 Asia Cup, where he finished as the second-highest run scorer for India. The Bihar-born cricketer scored 176 runs from five innings at an average of 44 and a strike rate of 145.45 with two half centuries to his name. Suryavanshi played belligerent innings of 76* (46) vs UAE and 67 (36) vs Sri Lanka as he put his wide array of strokes on display. Meanwhile, the youngster will be eager to bounce back to form in the remaining games of the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy and help his team win the title.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 21, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Ravindra Jadeja confident India can complete BGT hat-trick in Australia

He is expected to return to action in the Boxing Day Test against India, scheduled to start on December 26 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. On December 7, Head dedicated his sensational Adelaide century to Harrison. Scoring a fantastic hundred at his home ground, the southpaw celebrated his milestone in the presence of his wife and kids.

Head's record vs India While concerns arose over a groin injury during the third Test at Gabba, Head assured fans of his fitness for the fourth Test. ""Very pleased with the way I am batting at the moment. Just a little sore, but I should be fine,"" said Head after winning the Player of the Match award in the drawn Brisbane Test. Shastri, who served as India men’s head coach from 2017 to 2021, referred to Head’s “new surname” to describe the form the Australian batter is in. “Because his new surname is Travis Head’ache’. They are looking for balms in India. For foot problems, ankle problems (and) even a headache, they are looking for a balm. He is ideal for that,” Shastri said on The ICC Review. Shastri said that Head has upped his game over the last three years and has transformed himself into someone who is hard to contain. “I think he is very smart. From what I saw of him three years ago, he has improved immensely. Especially with the way he plays the short ball. He prepared to leave it. He has learned to leave it well at times,” Shastri said. “I think he is very smart. From what I saw of him three years ago, he has improved immensely. Especially with the way he plays the short ball.

This victory marks Usyk's second consecutive win over Fury, following his split-decision triumph in May that made him the undisputed heavyweight champion. The 37-year-old Usyk’s performance was a repeat of his May victory over Fury, where he became the undisputed heavyweight champion. Although 36-year-old Fury showed improvement from their first encounter, including a strong start, he could not find a way to solve Usyk's elusive style. Despite giving up advantages in height, weight, and reach to the much larger Fury, Usyk demonstrated exceptional skill and movement throughout the bout. Fury, who weighed in at a career-high 281 pounds (127kg), 55 pounds (25kg) heavier than Usyk, started strong but was ultimately unable to overcome the Ukrainian's strategic boxing. Fury attempted to control the centre of the ring with his jab, but Usyk effectively countered by ducking inside and unleashing combinations. Fury briefly had success in the fifth and sixth rounds, landing hard body shots, but Usyk’s sharp counters and strategic movement took over, particularly in the later rounds. By the 10th round, Fury was noticeably fatigued and struggled to keep up with Usyk’s pace. Usyk closed out the final rounds with precision and intensity to secure the win. Usyk's superior movement and precise punching allowed him to dictate the fight, particularly in the later rounds. Despite a strong start to the tenth round by Fury, Usyk regained control, finishing the frame at a furious pace and cruising through the final two rounds to secure a convincing victory. In his post-fight interview, Usyk remained humble, stating, ""I win, it's good ... I'm not the judges, I'm a sportsman, I'm an athlete."" He also praised his sons, who had participated in judo competitions earlier that day. The victory was followed by a challenge from Britain's Daniel Dubois, who Usyk had defeated in August 2023. Meanwhile, Fury, visibly disappointed by his second professional loss, left the ring without giving an interview, prompting his promoter Frank Warren to express disbelief at the scoring. Warren argued that Fury had won more rounds than the judges' scorecards reflected, saying, ""How can Tyson only get four rounds in this fight? It's impossible.""Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  Liron Jaden wears the overall crown of JK Tyre Novice Cup Momentum Motorsport

Samson spoke highly of the team's tradition of picking young talents and converting them into superstars.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/ipl-2025-sanju-samson-rajasthan-royals-13-year-old-vaibhav-suryavanshi-2653606-2024-12-22,"Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson spoke highly about 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi ahead of the Indian Premier League's 2025 season. Speaking on AB de Villiers' YouTube channel, Samson said that the management watched Suryavanshi bat against Australia in the U19 Test match and wanted to have him on board. Vaibhav Suryavanshi broke into the scene with the fastest hundred by an Indian in the U19 Test, earlier in October. Playing at the MA Chidambaram Stadium smashed his hundred in just 58 balls in his maiden red-ball match for the India Under-19 team. Vaibhav Suryavanshi's 58-ball hundred was only behind former England all-rounder Moeen Ali, who hit a 56-ball hundred for England Under-19 in 2005. Vaibhav hit 14 boundaries and 4 sixes in a destructive knock. He was run out when batting on 104 in just 62 deliveries. On the back of his heroics, Suryavanshi was bought by Rajasthan for Rs 1.10 crore in the 2025 mega-auction. Sanju spoke highly of the player and said that Rajasthan had a verified history of taking in young talent and nurturing them into world-beaters. Samson gave the example of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel as he spoke highly about the team's culture. ""I have seen his highlights. All of the people in the Rajasthan decision-making group saw him bat at the U19 Test match vs Australia in Chennai, where he scored a hundred of 60-70 balls. The shots that he played there, it felt like, that's something special and we felt like we have to have those kind of individuals in the side and see where they go,"" Sanju Samson told AB de Villiers in an interview. ""But Rajasthan Royals have a history of doing this. They find out talents and make them champions. For example, there is a Yashasvi Jaiswal who came to RR as a youngster and now is a rockstar of the Indian team. There is Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel - they all fall under that line. I think RR loves that kind of thing - yes, we want to win the IPL, but we also want to make sure that we are giving enough champions to Indian cricket. It will be exciting to meet him,"" he further added. The 13-year-old Suryavanshi has been doing well in domestic cricket. After making his Ranji Trophy debut with Bihar last season, the batter has now etched his name in record books becoming the youngest Indian player to play List-A cricket. At the age of 13 years and 269 days, Suryavanshi broke the record of Ali Akbar who made his List A debut at the age of 14 years and 51 days for Vidarbha during the 1999/2000 season. He's already the youngest Indian to make his Ranji Trophy debut and also to play at the Under 19 level.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Injury scare for Rohit Sharma after blow to knee in Melbourne netsTrending Reel

But she also heaped praise on the bowlers for defending a low total as India became the champions of the inaugural edition after winning the match by 41 runs at the Bayuemas Oval in Kuala Lumpur. After being asked to bat first, all India could manage was 117 for seven on the back of Gongadi Trisha’s half-century and a 17-run cameo from Mithila Vinod. Thereafter, Aayushi Shukla picked up three wickets as India bowled their opponents out for 76 in 18.3 overs. Prasad, who will play for the Delhi Capitals (DC) in the upcoming Women’s Premier League (WPL), said that staying calm under pressure has helped the Indian team in the tournament. “We felt we were a few runs short, maybe 20 runs short, but scoring 117 on this wicket is good. But we knew that we had a good bowling side and would bowl well. We were trying to stay in the game, have that intent, body language and our bowlers and fielders did a fantastic job,” Prasad said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

Akash Deep was sensational with his bowling, which earned laurels from Australian great Steve Smith during the Test match. The India pacer, who debuted against England in 2024, has only played 6 Test matches so far. The Bengal pacer has never looked out of depth in his short tenure, helping India pick wickets with the new ball. In Gabba, the pacer picked 3 wickets - in his first outing in Australia, and looked like the second-best bowler from the Indian team, only behind Jasprit Bumrah. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Speaking to the press after the nets in Melbourne, Akash Deep explained how senior batters Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli helped the young India pacers prepare for their first tour of Australia. Akash Deep said that the feedback from Rohit Sharma and Kohli aided the likes of Harshit Rana not look like novices in the first overseas Test match. ""This is my first time in Australia. I trust Jasprit Bumrah and the little inputs that he gives help a lot. The things that he says are not complicated and that clarity helps a lot. Like he said that do not get excited by the help in the pitch, and that helped me bowl well,"" Akash Deep said on Sunday. ""The fact that we do not look novices while playing our first match in Australia - a lot of that credit goes to Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who constantly give feedback to the bowlers,"" he further added. Many considered Akash Deep unlucky in the 3rd Test match at Brisbane, as the seamer did not pick wickets despite looking incredibly threatening on the moving day of the game. In fact, Australia batter Steve Smith picked Akash Deep as the standout bowler, stating that the pacer had incredible skills. ""I thought Akash bowled really nicely, particularly that first spell. He was getting the ball to move with pretty significant movement. He bowled a really good length. He's a nice bowler. It was the first time I've actually faced him. He has got some skill there for sure,"" Smith remarked at Gabba.Sticking to Process Did not picking wickets hurt his confidence? Akash Deep does not think so. The pacer said that he trusted his process and that the result was not in his hands. The disciplined bowler, well known for his ability hit a consistent line and length said that he would try to stick to his methods in the upcoming Test matches. ""As a cricketer, we only have process, the result is not in our hand. What I try to do is stick to my discipline, to my lines and lengths and hope that it works out,"" Akash Deep said. ""It is good for us that Australia have made changes. They have brought in a new batter (Sam Konstas) but we have played him. Nothing new for us. We don't think about who comes in, who goes out, our job is to bowl well and I want to do that,"" he added. ""Our mindset is to exploit the new ball. They are facing issues with the new ball. The plan is to attack in the first 30 overs,"" concluded the India pacer on the matter. There were injury concerns for India on Sunday, with Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Akash Deep getting hit by the ball. The seamer allayed those concerns and said that it was a part and parcel of their profession. ""We keep getting hit in the nets. That is fine. I think that the practice pitch was for white-ball, so it was keeping a little low. There is no concern with Rohit Sharma,"" concluded the pacer.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  India high on confidence after Gabba: Series 50-50 going into MCG, says Akash DeepMust Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/delhi-sg-pipers-rajkumar-pal-aiming-for-hockey-india-league-spotlight-2653638-2024-12-22,"For Delhi SG Pipers' Rajkumar Pal, the journey over the past years in hockey has been sensational. After missing the chance to make the trip for the Tokyo Olympics, the midfielder went back to the drawing board and worked hard. This was rewarded in 2024, when he was part of the Indian team that won the bronze medal at the Paris Olympics.  Now, set to be part of the revamped Hockey India League, Rajkumar is hoping to make the spotlight his own with the Delhi SG Pipers. The team made heads turn at the auction table with their eye for young talent and the midfielder feels this will help the side in the long run. Speaking exclusively to Indiatoday.in, Rajkumar was realistic about Delhi's chances in the 2024-25 season and also opened up about being reunited with PR Sreejesh.  The midfielder also gave a sneak peek into his journey so far and his goals going forward. Rajkumar Pal interaction India Today: Let's start with the Hockey India League again. Last time we were here, many stars got a chance to make a name for themselves. People at home started recognising players. Do you expect the same impact from the upcoming league? Rajkumar Pal: Absolutely! In this league, I think three or four players will shine. I also want to give my 100 percent and take the spotlight. Every player wants to be noticed, and everyone will try their best. It's great to be a part of a team. The whole game should be about making an impact, as every team has that one player who consistently scores goals and gets noticed. Scoring gives confidence and motivation and the game continues to improve. I hope that if I start the tournament well, I can aim for better performances throughout the league. India Today: As you mentioned, you are playing for Delhi SG Pipers. What makes the Delhi SG Pipers team special compared to other teams this time? Rajkumar Pal: I think our team has the most number of young players, which is going to be a huge advantage for Delhi SG Pipers. The players are young and fit, and we’ve built a well-balanced team. We have experienced forwards, midfielders, and defenders, and even the juniors are getting the support they need. So, I believe it’s a strong team, and we will all support each other. The more experienced players will guide the younger ones. We have a good balance, and now it’s just about preparing well and putting in our best effort. India Today: You’re a young player yourself, very energetic. Do you think the team will achieve success right away, or will it take time? Rajkumar Pal: I think we will have success, but we might not finish in the top 4 right away. However, we can make it to the finals in the future, and I believe that in the coming seasons, as we gain more experience, the team will become much stronger. After 2-3 years, the team will be much better, with improved confidence and skill from the new players as well. So, success is definitely on the horizon, but it will take some time to reach our peak. India Today: You will reunite with PR Sreejesh at Delhi SG Pipers. What does it feel like to play with him again? Rajkumar Pal: Playing with Sreejesh Bhai is great. He always motivates the players, and that’s important for every team. During our previous time together, he was a huge help, always guiding us, and I’m sure he will continue to do that. It feels good to be with such a player because he understands the game and the mental aspects of it. We can always talk to him about what to do, and his guidance is a big contribution to the team’s success. India Today: Your rise to the top has been challenging. You lost your father, then you didn’t make the Olympic team in 2020. But you kept pushing forward, and eventually, you made it to the Paris Olympics and won a medal. How do you see your journey? Rajkumar Pal: When I look back, I feel there’s been a lot of change in my life. People want to meet me now because of the Olympic medal, but when I didn’t make it in 2020, it was very disappointing. I was sad, but I didn’t let it drag me down for too long. I quickly moved on and kept my mind fresh. Every player has a turning point in their career, and that was mine. If I had kept thinking about not making the team, I wouldn’t have reached where I am today. I continued working hard, and eventually, the opportunity came. When I finally played in the Olympics, my whole journey changed. My family, my village, everything became special. The most happiness came when the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh came to my village to honour me and my family. India Today: Give us a sneak peek into your hockey journey. Rajkumar Pal: I’m from a village called Karmapur in the Ghazipur district, which is near Varanasi. My journey started in 2009 when I began playing. All three of my brothers played too, and I started playing because of them. Initially, my family didn’t approve, but they eventually supported me, and I started practicing at a private academy run by the late Tej Bahadur Singh. Over time, the craze for hockey grew in my village, and people started getting jobs in the army and other departments because of hockey. That’s when things started changing. I later moved to Lucknow, but my family faced a tough time. My father had passed away in 2011, and my mother had to make some very difficult decisions. She was alone at home, and even though it was tough for her, she encouraged me to go pursue my dreams. I can never forget that sacrifice. India Today: It must have been a very difficult decision for your mother. Rajkumar Pal: Yes, it was incredibly difficult for her, especially with no one else at home. She had to manage everything herself. She even had to take care of the cows and handle other household work. But I’m grateful to her for letting me pursue my dreams. I can never forget that time, especially when I had to leave in 2011. India Today: Now that you've won an Olympic bronze and performed excellently well with the national side, what’s your personal goal? Rajkumar Pal: My personal goal is to continue improving my skills. I want to control the ball and positioning better, especially in high-speed situations, and create more scoring opportunities. I hope to show my skills and contribute more to the team. I always strive to be better, and my focus is to help my team win by playing my best.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  HIL is for Indian players to grow: PR Sreejesh on foreign signings pulling outMust Watch

India are playing their 4th Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Melbourne, having drawn the previous Test match at the Gabba. Speaking on Star Sports before the Boxing Day game, Pujara has raised alarms about the depth of the Indian bowling unit. So far, Jasprit Bumrah has been the only consistent performer in the Indian line-up, who has looked threatening in every single spell that he has bowled.  Pujara analysed the Indian team's performance ahead of the 4th Test, and said that while the batting output had improved due to the tail-enders putting up a resilient display at the Gabba, the bowling output however had gone down. ""My first biggest question and slight reason for concern is that the Indian bowling is looking slightly weak. The batting has improved a little. The top five have not batted well but the middle order and lower-middle order have done that,"" Cheteshwar Pujara said on Star Sports. ""Ravindra Jadeja and Nitish (Kumar Reddy), and even the tailenders, (Jasprit) Bumrah and Akash Deep, contributed with the bat. There is a weakness somewhere or the other in bowling. So what team will you play, that's the biggest question,"" Pujara further added. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage India have fielded a different line-up in each of the first three Test matches. The spin bowler's position has been the most fragile, with Washington Sundar, Ravichandran Ashwin and then Ravindra Jadeja playing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Test respectively. Now India are one man short in their squad with R Ashwin retiring from all forms of international cricket after the Gabba Test match. It is expected that India will not change their line-up for the MCG Test match - unless there is a injury in the build-up to the game. India have the back up of Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna in the fast bowling department, while Sarfaraz Khan and Dhruv Jurel are waiting in the ranks on the batting side of things.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  India high on confidence after Gabba: Series 50-50 going into MCG, says Akash DeepMust Watch

She was the second highest run-scorer for her team after Tanisha Singh, having scored 182 runs from nine matches at an average of 26 and a strike-rate of 85.94. In the previous edition of the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy, Rawal was the second-highest run-scorer. In eight matches, Pratika made 411 runs at an average of 68.50 and a strike-rate of 91.94 with two centuries and a top score of 141 to show for her efforts. Rawal also played for East Delhi Riders in the Women’s Delhi Premier League. After the Women’s T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), India handed ODI caps to six cricketers, one of whom was Pratika. The others are Minnu Mani, Tejal Hasabnis, Titas Sadhu, Saima Thakor and Priya Mishra. Saima and Uttarakhand’s Raghvi Bist also made their T20I debuts against the West Indies earlier this month.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  India clinch inaugural Under-19 Women's Asia Cup title after beating Bangladesh

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/ind-vs-aus-what-is-indias-record-in-the-much-coveted-boxing-day-test-2653696-2024-12-22,"The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is 3 Tests down, with India and Australia level at 1-1. After a strong start in Perth, India has slightly mellowed after being hammered in Adelaide and then eking out a tough draw in Brisbane. However, India has taken much confidence from their sensational escape at the Gabba and is looking forward to the penultimate Test match of the series. The Boxing Day Test match is set to be played at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground — popularly known as the MCG or simply as the 'G.' The Test match is expected to shatter all records of attendance for a non-Ashes game. India will be looking to make a strong comeback in the final two games of the series, not only to clinch a 3-peat in Australia but also to keep their hopes of the World Test Championship final alive. India has had a strong record at the MCG in recent years. India has won the Boxing Day Tests in the last two tours and drawn one Test before that. The likes of Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane have put in strong batting performances in recent years, and on the other hand, Bumrah has weaved his magic as usual. Overall, India has played 14 Test matches at the venue, winning only 4 of them. The team has lost 8 Test matches at the MCG and has drawn 2 games. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full CoverageINDIA'S MOST RECENT PERFORMANCES AT THE MCG BGT 2014-15 The only drawn Test match in the last three tours. Bowling first in the game, India was put in trouble by a prolific Steve Smith, who scored 192 runs in the first innings.   India replied with twin centuries from Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane, who helped India score 465 runs in response to Australia's 530. After Australia declared for 318/9, India saw Australia off despite panicking early. Kohli and Rahane once again stabilized the Indian innings, after which Pujara, Dhoni, and Ashwin saw India off to a draw. BGT 2018-19 Under the captaincy of Virat Kohli, India notched up a famous win in the Boxing Day Test match. After a strong batting performance in the first innings by Cheteshwar Pujara (106) and Virat Kohli (82), India put up 443/7d. In response, Australia fumbled in both innings, courtesy of Jasprit Bumrah (9 wickets), and India won by 137 runs. BGT 2020-21 It was once again Jasprit Bumrah and Ajinkya Rahane who showed the way. Bumrah bowled out Australia for just 195 runs in the first innings, after which Rahane added insult to injury with his patient hundred, helping India take a 100+ lead. Australia faltered with the bat once again due to the combined prowess of Mohammed Siraj, Bumrah, and Umesh Yadav, helping India notch up an 8-wicket win. Rahane was named the player of the match for his century and captaincy.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Sam Konstas ready to face Bumrah?

Star batter Joe Root has returned to the ODI setup for the first time since the ODI World Cup 2023. However, all rounder Ben Stokes has missed out from the 15-member squad following a left hamstring injury sustained during the third Test match against New Zealand earlier this month. The ECB medical team will continue to assess the extent of Stokes’ injury as the all rounder will miss the tournament after coming out of his retirement for the ODI World Cup 2023. Jos Buttler will continue to lead both the ODI and T20I teams having recently made his return to the team in the West Indies tour following an injury. The entire squad will leave for India on 17th January where they will play five T20Is beginning from January 22 followed by three ODIs set to begin from February 6. The ODI series will act as the final preparation for both teams for the ICC Champions Trophy. Meanwhile, the schedule for the Champions Trophy is yet to be out as the ICC (International Cricket Council) is yet to decide a neutral venue for the event where India will play their matches after their reluctance to travel to host country Pakistan. However, the tournament is set to be held from the fourth week in February 2025 and will go on until the second week of March. England were knocked out in the semi-final of the last edition of the tournament on their home soil by the eventual champions Pakistan and hence will be eager to win the upcoming edition of the event.

She was dismissed for 91, entering an all-time unlucky list. This marked the fourth time Mandhana was dismissed in the nervous nineties in ODIs, joining West Indies’ Stafanie Taylor as the women’s batter with the most dismissals in the nineties. Mandhana had the chance to achieve a unique milestone, potentially becoming only the second women’s batter after Tammy Beaumont to score consecutive hundreds in ODIs twice. She had smashed a century in the 3rd ODI against Australia, a match India lost, and was in excellent touch heading into this game. Zaida James dismissed Smriti Mandhana, trapping her leg-before-wicket (LBW) to deny the Indian opener a well-deserved century. Mandhana's disappointment was evident as she walked back to the pavilion.  India vs West Indies, 1st Women's ODI Updates The delivery was pitched at a good length outside off and was slightly quicker than expected. Mandhana shuffled across the stumps, attempting a paddle shot, but missed it entirely. The ball struck her front pad near the knee-roll, and the umpire raised the finger.

Notably, Rohit hasn’t been in the best of form in the series so far, having scored just 19 runs from two matches at an average of 6.33. The India skipper has sacrificed his opening slot for KL Rahul, who performed exceptionally in his absence during the series opener in Perth. Speaking about Rohit’s batting position, Shastri said that he would’ve loved to see him opening the batting but now that, since KL Rahul has performed well at the top spot, he should continue playing in that spot. “I would have asked him (Rohit) to open in the last Test match but then the way Rahul has batted, I mean he was a joy to watch and the way he's batting, I believe he struck a purple patch,” Shastri said on the ICC Review. Further speaking ahead, Shastri said that Rohit can still be dangerous at number 6, but he’s got to be clear in his mindset and attack the opposition. “I would like to see Rohit Sharma, his tactics change a bit because he can still be extremely dangerous at that number (six). I think he's got to be very clear in his mindset to go out there and take the attack to the opposition and not worry about anything else,” he added. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage “The last thing you want is him to be in two minds whether to defend or attack. In his case, it should be attack. He picks up length quickly, he should take the opposition on at that number. Because if he gets away in the first 10-15 minutes, in any way, he's not got past that 15-20 minutes, half an hour. So why don’t you play a natural game, go and take the attack to the opposition and take it from there?,” Shastri said.Rohit's poor form in ongoing season Rohit is batting at number 6 after almost six years and has found it tough to adapt to the position. He began his career batting at six only and scored consecutive hundreds in his first two innings. Hence, he has the best record batting at that position with 1056 runs to his name from 18 matches (28 innings) at an average of 48 with three hundreds and six fifties. However, he’s yet to find his mojo back in the ongoing year, having scored just 152 runs in the last seven Tests at an average of 11.69 with just one fifty to his name. Hence, it’s extremely crucial for the India skipper to find his form back as India aim to take a lead in the series in Melbourne.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-sam-konstas-mcg-boxing-day-test-match-2653712-2024-12-22,"Youngster Sam Konstas is ready to get a taste of the Boxing Day Test match against India, set to begin on December 26. Konstas who replaced Nathan McSweeney in the Australian side comes in with a big reputation of being one of the most exciting talents in the Australian domestic competition. Konstas astronomically improved his stocks in Australian cricket when he hit a terrific hundred against India A in the pink-ball tour game before the Adelaide Test match. Konstas was the lone warrior from the side and put every single India bowler in trouble. Speaking on the build-up to the Test match, the youngster said that he was confident and was going to back his skills if he is given a debut in the coveted Boxing Day Test match. ""I'm super confident,"" he told Fox Sports. ""Just backing my skills, I have done all the hard work. Just another game, I guess, and trying to keep it simple. As a kid you have always dreamt of the moment, and it is very rare, getting your baggy green. So it's a huge honour if I do get in."" The batter was specifically quizzed about Bumrah, who has been in sensational form in this series. Konstas said that he was not worried about the star India pacer as he had seen him play so much. ""It was all a bit unexpected but very privileged to get the opportunity,"" Konstas said. ""I just had dinner with the family [to celebrate], pretty chilled. It was emotional, mum was crying ... Everything has happened so fast,"" Konstas said. The batter spoke about his family and how his loved ones reacted to the Test call. Konstas said that everything was sudden and it was quite an emotional moment for his family. ""Mum and dad and my brothers, all their sacrifices, taking me to training, throwing me balls, experiencing the journey through highs and lows. Just to give something back to them was very special. I can't wait to have them in Melbourne for support,"" he added. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full CoverageWHO IS SAM KONSTAS? Sam Konstas was called-up for the pink ball tour game against India on the back of just 5 first class matches. The right-handed rose to fame after his twin hundreds against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield series. Konstas achieved a remarkable feat by scoring twin centuries against South Australia, a performance that has drawn comparisons to some of the greatest names in Australian cricket history. The young batter has already been compared to legendary Ricky Ponting by the New South Wales coach Greg Shipperd. ""I think I might have used that on a couple of players over my journey and called them the 'pint-sized Punter'...It just again references his (Konstas' potential),"" the NSW coach said on the batter. Konstas's innings were nothing short of spectacular. In his first innings, he scored 152 runs, marking his maiden first-class century. This was followed by an equally impressive 105 runs in the second innings, as New South Wales took control of the game at Cricket Central. His aggregate of 257 runs in the match is the highest by a batter under 20 in the Sheffield Shield, surpassing the previous record held by Doug Walters, who scored 253 runs in one innings 60 years ago. This achievement places Konstas in the company of cricket legends. He is the youngest player since Ricky Ponting in 1992 to score centuries in both innings of a Sheffield Shield match. Ponting, who went on to have an illustrious Test career with 168 appearances, achieved this feat at the age of 18 years and 85 days. Konstas's performance has not only highlighted his technical skills but also his mental toughness and adaptability. In his second innings, he faced different bowling plans from the South Australian team, which included wider deliveries, but he adjusted his approach effectively, showing a mix of precision driving and aggressive play when necessary. His innings included 13 boundaries and four sixes, with a notable slog-sweep that took him to his historic hundred.KONSTAS' HUNDRED vs INDIA A 19-year-old Sam Konstas hit a blazing century in Canberra on Sunday in the Australian PM XI's match vs India. Konstas, who opened the innings for his team counter-attacked India's bowlers and hit them predominantly through the leg side as wickets fell on the other end. Konstas, who was pipped as the replacement for David Warner before the start of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, showed his quality against the pink ball. The opener took on Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna, dominating them after the first hour of play. Konstas brought up his century in just 90 balls, as wickets fell from the other end. Konstas slammed 14 boundaries and a six en route his century. The batter opened the innings for Australia in overcast conditions and remained steady at one end while the hosts lost 2 quick wickets of Matt Renshaw and Jayden Goodwin. After a difficult period of first 10 overs, Konstas started cutting loose alongside Jack Clayton and added 100-plus runs. After Clayton fell, Konstas continued his barrage of impressive shots as Australia saw a mini-collapse on the other side. The batter finally got out for 107 off 97 balls in the 38th over of the match with Australia at 205 runs. He was Australia's 78th wicket to fall.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: What is India's record in the coveted Boxing Day Test?

Sam Konstas replaced McSweeney as the opener for the last two Tests of the Border Gavaskar Trophy series. Vaughan acknowledged that McSweeney had one of the hardest starts to his career in the ongoing series between Australia and India. However, he felt that McSweeney could have been given a chance in the middle order, as the batter is, anyway, not a natural opener.  ""I look at McSweeney and think I don't think there's a player who has had a harder start to their career. I feel for the kid, because of all the people that I've seen come into Test cricket over the last 10 years, I don't think anyone's been given a harder challenge,"" Vaughan told Fox Sports. ""To face Bumrah in the conditions that he's had to face now, the pink ball under lights in his second game, in Perth it did all sorts and in Brisbane the ball was moving around,"" he added. McSweeney smacks 4 fours in an over: read hereMcSweeney gets snubbed Despite his challenges, Vaughan remained hopeful of seeing McSweeney feature in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne. ""I thought they'd go with McSweeney for Melbourne, and if he failed again, they'd bring Sam (Konstas) in for his home Test at the SCG."" However, Vaughan felt that the Test snub might act as a blessing in disguise for McSweeney.  ""I don't think in the long run it's going to be a bad thing for McSweeney. I think he will end up being an Australian Test cricketer, but I don't think he'll be up the top of the order; I think it'll be down at four or five,"" Vaughan said.Vaughan suggests middle order role The 25-year-old, who was handed the challenging role of opening the batting despite being a middle-order specialist in domestic cricket, struggled to find form. In his three matches, McSweeney managed just 72 runs in six innings, marking the lowest output for an Australian opener in their first six innings in 50 years.  ""If I was McSweeney, next time I get the chance to wear the baggy green, I'd want him to be in the position that he's played all his life. I feel for Nathan, I think he'll be back - but I totally understand why Australia made this move."" Senior Australian opener Usman Khawaja is facing significant pressure due to his underwhelming performances with the bat. In his six innings so far, he has managed scores of 8, 4, 13, 9*, 21, and 8. ""I do think that Usman needs runs in the next two games; I don't think he can be anywhere near a shoe-in to go to Sri Lanka and the West Indies if he doesn't score runs in this series, because eventually you have to look to the future,"" Vaughan continued.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  Smriti Mandhana misses out on hundred in 1st ODI, enters all-time unlucky list

Notably, Starc didn’t have a memorable outing in the series opener in Perth as he registered match figures of 3/125. India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal also sledged him, saying that he was bowling too slow in the first Test. The comment seemed to awaken the sleeping beast in Starc as he came back to pick 6/48 in the pink ball Test in Adelaide. The left-arm speedster finished with figures of 8/108 in the game, being the best bowler from his team. Commenting on Starc’s form, Pujara said that the Australia speedster has improved his bowling a lot in the past few years. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage ""He has been their best bowler thus far in this series. He has improved his bowling a lot in the last one to one-and-a-half years. If I talk about my personal experience, when he used to bowl in the last two series, we felt we could get runs. However, now it seems like when he comes to bowl, he will pick up wickets,” said Pujara on Star Sports. Further speaking ahead, Pujara called Starc even more dangerous than Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. He also suggested India to see off his first spell to avert his threat.We need to make Starc bowl the second and third spells: Pujara ""He is looking more dangerous than Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. So we will have to manage his bowling, especially with the new ball. He has taken most of his wickets in his first five overs, his first spell. We need to bat well in the first five overs and make him bowl the second and third spells because he gets tired,"" he added. Starc is the joint second-highest wicket taker of the series so far with 14 wickets to his name from three matches at an average of 22.85 and an economy of 3.54. The veteran seamer has had the wood over Jaiswal having dismissed him in the very first over both in Adelaide and Brisbane. Hence, Melbourne will once again treat fans with another mouth-watering clash between the two players, with both teams eager to take a lead in the series. Australia will miss the services of Josh Hazlewood who’s been ruled out of the entire series due to a side strain and will be replaced by Scott Boland.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

In response, Heats lost their openers early and were reduced at 19/3. McSweeney walked into bat and shared a crucial 66-run stand from just 39 deliveries with Matt Renshaw, who scored 27-ball 54.

McSweeney dropped from Test side The 25-year-old, who was handed the challenging role of opening the batting despite being a middle-order specialist in domestic cricket, struggled to find form. In his three matches, McSweeney managed just 72 runs in six innings, marking the lowest output for an Australian opener in their first six innings in 50 years. His difficulties were compounded as he faced some of the most lethal bowlers in India’s lineup, particularly the early brilliance of Jasprit Bumrah. Speaking to 7 News, McSweeney admitted that missing out on the Boxing Day Test was a bitter pill to swallow, but he remained optimistic about a return. ""Yes, I mean devastated. I get the dream come true and then didn't quite work out the way I wanted it, but it's all part of it and yeah I'll get the head down and get back in the nets and work really hard and hopefully be ready to go for the next opportunity,"" Mcsweeney said. ""I think it's the game we're in. if you don't take your opportunity and you're not performing as well as you want to, your position's never safe.

 Jasprit Bumrah is on the cusp of becoming the fastest Indian fast bowler to the landmark of 200 wickets in Test cricket. The speedster has a chance to achieve the feat in India’s upcoming Boxing Day Test against Australia, starting December 26 at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. Kapil holds the record in 50 Tests in the match against the West Indies at Port of Spain back in March 1983. Six wickets away from the record, Bumrah currently has 194 wickets from 43 Tests at an economy rate of 2.75 with six four-wicket hauls and 12 five-wicket hauls to show for his efforts.  If the 31-year-old picks up six wickets in the Melbourne Test, he will also be the joint second-fastest Indian to the 200-wicket landmark along with Ravindra Jadeja. Former spinner Ravi Ashwin is the fastest, having got there in 37 Tests back in September 2016. Bumrah has been solely carrying the weight of the Indian bowling unit in the ongoing series and currently has 21 wickets from three Tests at an economy rate of 2.60.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 22, 2024

Seven players have made debuts for them in international cricket, six of them are in ODIs. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-india-women-vs-west-indies-women-pratika-rawal-debut-world-cup-2653783-2024-12-22,"Since failing to qualify for the semi-final of the Women’s T20 World Cup in the UAE, the Indian women’s team is on an experimentation spree. India have handed international caps to seven of their cricketers in the last two months. In ODIs, Minnu Mani, Tejal Hasabnis, Pratika Rawal, Titas Sadhu, Saima Thakor and Priya Mishra got their maiden India caps. Delhi’s Pratika was the latest to make her debut after Smriti Mandhana handed her the cap ahead of the series opener against the West Indies on Sunday at the Kotambi Stadium in Vadodara. 28-year-old Saima also made her T20I debut in the T20Is against the Caribbean team. Uttarakhand’s Raghvi Bist also had the chance in the second match of the same series. Bist’s domestic teammate Nandini Kashyap, who was the top run-scorer in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy, was also a part of the squad for the West Indies T20Is, but did not get to play. India vs West Indies, 1st Women's ODI Updates It goes without saying that India are trying their heart out to build a pool ahead of the ODI World Cup to be held next year at home. With women’s cricket growing in stature and players prone to injuries due to hectic schedules, India realise the importance of having a large set of cricketers to choose from.In the article, let’s look at how India’s debutants after the T20 World Cup have fared thus far Minnu Mani  Minnu Manu came through the ranks after playing eight matches for the Delhi Capitals (DC) in the Women’s Premier League (WPL). Minnu was also the captain of the India A team on the tour of Australia. She made her ODI debut against Australia in Brisbane, scoring an unbeaten 46 and picking up two wickets. Minnu is also a part of the ongoing ODIs against the West Indies. Tejal Hasabnis  Tejal Hasabnis grabbed the limelight after she scored three fifties on the trot for India A in their One-Dayers against Australia A earlier this year. She scored 42 runs on debut in the ODI series against New Zealand. In the series, she made 57 runs at an average of 28.50. Recently, she went unsold in the WPL auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakhs. Pratika Rawal  Pratika Rawal made her ODI debut on Sunday and had her fair share of trouble while opening the batting, scoring five runs off her first 25 balls. But she found some rhythm to make 40 off 69 before Hayley Matthews dismissed her. Rawal has done well for Delhi in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy. She also played for East Delhi Riders in the Women’s Delhi Premier League. Titas Sadhu  Titas Sadhu has been impressive in T20Is thus far, picking up 13 wickets from 12 matches. But in the two ODIs that she played in Australia where she also made her ODI debut, Sadhu failed to take a wicket and leaked runs at an economy rate of 6.41. The pacer also played only four matches across two seasons for the Capitals in the WPL. Saima Thakor  Saima Thakor has been a big positive for India since she made her debut against New Zealand back in October. In six ODIs, she has taken seven wickets at an economy rate of 5.41. She took a three-wicket in an ODI against Australia at the Allan Border Field in Brisbane. Thakor has also had her role to play for the Alyssa Healy-led UP Warriorz in the WPL. Priya Mishra  Leg-spinner Priya Mishra broke into the Indian team after taking a five-wicket haul and a four-wicket haul against Australia A. She picked up five wickets from her first three ODIs after making her debut against New Zealand. But she also had her troubles after setting the record for most runs conceded by an Indian women’s bowler in an ODI innings when she finished with figures of 10-0-88-1 against Australia in Brisbane.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  India captain Niki elated after historic Asia Cup win: Bowlers did a fantastic job

Harmanpreet Kaur pulled off an absolute stunner to dismiss Alleyne off Renuka Singh’s bowling. Alleyne, looking to clear mid-on, struck the ball well, but Kaur had other plans. Timing her jump to perfection, she extended fully to complete a one-handed catch, showcasing remarkable agility and sharp reflexes. The ball was travelling at pace, but Kaur’s presence of mind and height played a crucial role in pulling off the remarkable grab. It wasn’t just about timing; her stretch and control turned what seemed like a certain boundary into a highlight-reel moment.  This incredible effort from the Indian captain not only sent Alleyne packing but also showed Kaur’s remarkable brilliance as a fielder, leaving her teammates in awe and the crowd buzzing.

She suffered a niggle in her knee while batting during the 1st T20I and made a sensational return in the 1st ODI. The Indian captain added crucial runs to India's mammoth total of 314/9. She scored a quick-fire 34 from 23 deliveries before getting run-out in the 1st innings. Earlier in India's innings, Smriti Mandhana and debutant Prakiti Rawal gave India a flying start with their 110-run opening stand. Mandhana, however, missed out on a well-deserved century as she was dismissed at 91 runs. However, the middle and lower order batters ensured India posted a dominant total on board.

4c031451-1088-4949-89e1-1c02b83911a2,Sanjay Bangar's plan to dismiss Travis Head: Force him to do something differentFormer India cricketer and batting coach Sanjay Bangar has suggested a plan to dismiss India's chief tormentor Travis Head in the upcoming fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-sanjay-bangar-travis-head-aus-vs-ind-border-gavaskar-trophy-2024-25-2653779-2024-12-22,"Former India cricketer and batting coach Sanjay Bangar has suggested a plan to dismiss India’s chief tormentor Travis Head in the upcoming fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne. Notably, Head has been the thorn in India’s flesh since 2023, and has also continued his form in the ongoing series as well. The southpaw is the highest run scorer of the series so far with 409 runs from three matches at an average of 81.80 with two hundreds and one fifty to his name. India have struggled massively to get rid of Head as Australia batter has been successful in taking the game away from them with his aggressive stroke play. Ahead of the fourth Test in Melbourne, Sanjay Bangar has suggested bowling in the corridor of uncertainty from around the wicket to the swashbuckling batter at the start of his innings. ""At the start of the innings, go around the wicket and bowl in the corridor. If it proves successful in the first 10-15 balls, stick to that plan. Plan A is to come around the wicket and make him play at off stump. If there’s no success, shift to over the wicket with more fielders on the on-side and a deep third man,"" Bangar advised on Star Sports. Further speaking ahead, the former India batting coach said that India need to force him into doing something different and put catching men in the deep. ""By sticking to the middle-stump line, you force him to do something different. Against the short ball, his bat always comes into play, making deep third man, deep fine leg, and deep square leg potential catching positions. This approach dries up his scoring opportunities and creates pressure. India needs to persist with this plan and have patience to neutralize the Travis Head threat,"" he added. Head has frustrated India since the World Test Championship final 2023 as his 163 helped Australia clinch the title with a massive 209-run win. The southpaw further scored a magnificent 137 in the final of the ODI World Cup 2023 helping Australia win by six wickets. Head’s love-affair with India has also continued in the ongoing series as well, with back-to-back centuries in Adelaide and Brisbane. Hence, India are desperate to end his golden run against them, which will also help them win the series which is currently tied at 1-1.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

India’s bowling unit maintained relentless pressure, with Titas Sadhu and Priya Mishra also chipping in with crucial wickets.   This emphatic victory showcased India’s all-round dominance. Mandhana’s brilliance with the bat and Renuka’s career milestone with the ball showed their collective effort. The West Indies, on the other hand, will need to regroup quickly and address their batting failures and subpar fielding, as they look to bounce back in the series.  The win gave India a strong start to the ODI series, with the hosts aiming to build on this momentum in the upcoming matches.

Kohli dedicated a full hour to batting, facing a range of Indian bowlers, with a special focus on Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep as they tested him with the new ball. The Indian batter displayed his class against the pace attack, handling the bounce and swing with ease. However, it wasn’t just the pacers who caught his attention—Kohli also faced throwdown specialists, playing some elegant shots with his usual grace. His fluidity and rhythm in the middle were reminiscent of his dominant performance on Day 1 of the practice session, signalling that he was in excellent form and ready for the challenge ahead in the Test. Alongside Kohli, opening batters KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal also went through their paces. Jaiswal, in particular, was the focus of attention during the practice session. At one point, Rahul took some time to speak to Jaiswal in detail, offering guidance and advice on how to approach the challenging conditions at the MCG. It was clear that the senior players were keen to help Jaiswal settle into the Test atmosphere. The young opener, who hasn't been able to get going in recent matches after the Perth hundred, was seen engaging in several in-depth discussions with senior members of the team, such as Rahul, Kohli, and coach Gautam Gambhir. These interactions are part of Jaiswal’s preparation to understand the nuances of the ga,e and adjust his technique to face the best bowlers.

Notably, Pakistan fans have often compared Babar with Kohli as the star batter has managed to break few of his records so far in his career. However, the comparisons have often mounted the pressure on the Pakistan batter which has resulted in his poor form in the past few years. Recently, Amir shared his thoughts on the comparisons of Kohli with the other players in the world and praised the India star as ‘incomparable’, mentioning his ability to win matches across all three formats. ""Virat Kohli is the greatest player of this generation. I laugh when comparisons are made between him and Babar Azam, Steve Smith, or Joe Root. We cannot compare Virat Kohli to anyone because he has won so many matches for India, which seems impossible for any one player. Not just in one format, but in all three formats, Virat is the greatest batsman of this generation,"" Amir said on the Cricket Predicta Show. Further speaking ahead, the former speedster mentioned how Kohli made a remarkable comeback in his career after his disastrous tour to England in 2014. Amir also touched upon their on-field battles and said that his wicket in the 2017 Champions Trophy final played the key role in Pakistan’s victory in that tournament. ""Virat Kohli’s work ethic sets him apart from all players. After his bad phase in England in 2014, the way he made a comeback and then consistently performed brilliantly for the next 10 years was no ordinary feat. His wicket in the 2017 Champions Trophy final was very important for us, which helped us win the final. If Virat had not been dismissed, we would have lost the final because we all know how exceptional Virat’s record is while chasing runs,"" he added.Kohli struggling for runs in Tests Amir managed to dismiss Kohli for just 5 (9) as the former India captain got a leading edge while playing a flick which went straight to Shadab Khan at point. As a result, India were bundled out for 158 chasing a massive target of 339 and failed to defend their Champions Trophy crown. Meanwhile, Kohli has been undergoing poor form in Test cricket for a long time as he continued to register low scores after scoring his long-awaited hundred in Perth.

Notably, Konstas has received his maiden call up to the Australian Test team replacing Nathan McSweeney. Coming into the Test on the back of three fifty plus scores in his last four innings, Konstas is high on confidence. However, he will be facing the menacing India speedster Jasprit Bumrah with the new ball. Speaking about the massive challenge, Konstas said that he wouldn’t be watching too much of the Indian pace ace and expressed his excitement about facing him. ""I won't watch too much [of him]. I have already seen him a lot. But I am excited to challenge myself and face him. Usually, our analysts do a little feedback on each bowler. I might read that, maybe,” Konstas was quoted as saying by the ICC. Further speaking ahead, the 19-year-old said that he will back his skills and treat his debut as just another game. ""I'm super confident. Just backing my skills, I have done all the hard work. Just another game, I guess, and trying to keep it simple. As a kid you have always dreamt of the moment, and it is very rare, getting your baggy green. So it's a huge honour if I do get in,” he added.Konstas' brilliant run of form Konstas didn’t have a memorable outing in his first game after earning his maiden call up as he got dismissed for a three-ball duck. He got dismissed for a three-ball duck in his second Big Bash League match for Sydney Thunder against Sydney Sixers. Konstas has been in magnificent form in the Sheffield Shield being the second-highest run scorer for New South Wales (NSW) with 471 runs from eight innings at an average of 58.87 with two hundreds and one fifty. Earlier, he also scored a magnificent hundred for Prime Minister’s XI against India during the pink-ball warm up fixture. Konstas scored a sensational 107 (97) with the help of 14 fours and a six as he guided his team to a score of 240. He also scored a match-winning unbeaten 73 in the second unofficial Test against India A.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

Notably, Indian batters have been in poor form off late as they were recently whitewashed in the home Test series against New Zealand. The collapses have followed the team to Australia as well, which resulted in the loss in the second Test in Adelaide. Recently, Patel shared his opinion on the matter and mentioned India’s weakness against facing spin on turning tracks at home. ""There is no doubt that collapses have occurred, especially in home series. We have seen collapses on rank turner pitches against New Zealand. When we toured Australia, the collapses continued there,"" Patel said on Cricbuzz. Further speaking ahead, the former wicketkeeper batter highlighted that the batting failures is not the result of extreme aggression and the Indian batters need to apply themselves more. ""I do not believe this has happened due to extreme aggression. If we respect the traditional style of Test cricket and bat with discipline, these are the same batters who have previously performed well. Indian batters need to apply themselves more because they have the ability. If they bat with discipline, they can succeed anywhere,"" he added.India's batting debacles in recent times India were recently bundled out for 46, which was their third lowest score, in the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru. The Indian batting has crumbled in both spinning and swinging conditions in the past few months. They failed to negate the threat of Ajaz Patel and Mitchell Santner in home conditions against New Zealand. In the ongoing series, India have been undone by the Australian pacers as they’ve surpassed the 300-run mark just once in the six innings so far in the series. Indian batters have struggled massively in Tests in the ongoing year with just two players, namely Yashasvi Jaiswal (52.48) and Shubman Gill (43.30) averaging over 40 among batters having over 203 runs to their name. Batting stalwarts Virat Kohli (25.06 avg) and Rohit Sharma (26.39 avg) have also had one of their worst years of the careers forcing the likes of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja have contributing immensely lower down the order. As India head to Melbourne for the fourth Test against Australia, they will desperately need their batters to put up an improved performance as they aim to take a lead in the series which is currently tied at 1-1.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli eyes Sachin Tendulkar's historic Test record at MCG

A reliable source in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that Dubai was chosen as the neutral venue after a meeting between PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Nahyan Al Mubarak on Saturday night.

Sheikh Nahyan, who is currently vacationing in the Ghotki region of Sindh and Naqvi, who is also the country's interior minister, met and finalised the logistical and administrative matters for the mega-event hosted by Pakistan. On Thursday, the deadlock over the hosting of Champions Trophy finally ended when the ICC announced that India will play their matches of the 50-over event at a neutral venue instead of host country Pakistan, which will get a similar arrangement for tournaments to be held in India till 2027.

The ICC is now expected to announce the final schedule of the event with Pakistan expected to host 9 to 10 matches.The final will be in Lahore if India doesn’t qualify for the final, the source said. The hybrid arrangement will apply to the Champions Trophy 2025 (Pakistan), next year's women's Cricket World Cup in India and the T20 World Cup in 2026 in India and Sri Lanka.

India had refused to travel to Pakistan for the event scheduled in February-March due to security concerns. The Indians have not played in Pakistan since the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which 150 people were killed. The two countries' last bilateral engagement was back in 2012. Travelling to Pakistan also requires Indian government's clearance, which has remained firm on the status quo. While BCCI's stance was always clear, the matter got stretched because of PCB's refusal to allow a ""one-sided"" arrangement of neutral venues. Led by Naqvi, the PCB was determined not to lose face in front of the local public. PCB, which had sent its team to India for the ODI World Cup last year, had categorically opposed the hybrid model but eventually agreed to it on reciprocal grounds.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 22, 2024Also Read |  Joe Root named in England's Champions Trophy squad, Ben Stokes misses out

While Virat Kohli confronted a female journalist for taking photos of his family without permission, Ravindra Jadeja was accused by the Australian media of not entertaining questions in English after an MCG net session. Speaking on Channel 7, Katich termed the incidents as 'mind games' and said that they were being done due to the enormity of the series. The former Australian player hit out at the cricketers and said that the media was there to promote the game. “Obviously, there’s been a few things unfolding in the last week or so, that haven’t gone down well at that camp. It’s probably just the mind games being played, given the enormity of this series,” Katich said on Channel 7. “The media are here to promote the game and I don’t know what the Indians are thinking at the moment. That’s their problem,” he added.

The incident occurred when Kohli landed in Melbourne with his wife, actor Anushka Sharma, and their children on Thursday, December 19. A journalist from Australia’s Channel 7 captured a video of the family, which angered Kohli, according to local media. The cricketer was particularly upset about the intrusion into his family’s privacy. He approached the journalist, requesting to view the pictures and videos taken. Kohli then asked her to delete any images or footage of his family, while allowing her to retain any of him alone. Under Australian law, there are no restrictions on photographing or filming celebrities in public places, which likely complicated the matter. ""With my kids, I need some privacy. You can't film without asking me,"" he told the media at the airport. Notably, Virat Kohli had asked the paps not to click photos of his family at the Mumbai airport when he departed for Australia before the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Ravindra Jadeja Runs Out of Time The Australian media has stirred up another controversy just days after Virat Kohli requested an Australian reporter not to take pictures of his family at Melbourne airport. Now the Australian press have accused spinner Ravindra Jadeja of refusing to answer questions in English. Notably, Jadeja addressed the media after India's first practice session at the MCG. The press conference proceeded smoothly until Jadeja concluded the session and decided to return to practice. At this point, an Australian journalist expressed frustration, displaying anger over Jadeja not answering any questions in English. India's media manager attempted to explain that the press conference was organised primarily for the Indian media, but the Australian journalist appeared unwilling to accept this clarification. The reporter was seen lashing out at the India team media manager, further escalating the situation. Australian media: One question in English? Team manager: sorry, we don't have time now. You can see the team bus is waiting. Aussie media: Can't we take one question in English? Manager: This was organised mainly for the travelling Indian media. Aussie media: The organisation is hopeless. An Indian reporter, who was present at the MCG press conference, highlighted that many Indian journalists also missed the opportunity to ask questions but refrained from arguing or causing a scene like the Aussie reporters. ""I was present there, and many Indian touring journalists didn't get the opportunity to ask questions due to time constraints. However, after the press conference ended, a few Australian journalists got annoyed and argued with the Indian team's media manager. They misbehaved as well, which was uncalled for. I cover press conferences regularly, and even during Australian press conferences, many Indian journalists don't get the chance to ask questions due to time shortages, but we have never argued or misbehaved,"" one of the Indian reporters told India Today.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Champions Trophy 2025: Dubai to serve as neutral venue for India matchesMust Watch

Commenting on Shubman's woeful form away from home, Karthik said that Gill is confused about his approach to batting in India vs batting in overseas conditions. Since his heroic Gabba outing in 2021 where he scored 91 runs, Gill's home and away batting form has been of stark contrast. While at home, Gill has scored 1177 runs in 31 innings, his away returns are significantly less - 424 runs from 20 innings. Dinesh Karthik believes that Shubman Gill's trigger of getting on the front foot and pushing at the ball hard has brought his downfall away from home and has resulted in the terrible average 22.31 - since the Gabba Test match in 2021. Speaking on Cricbuzz the former Royal Challengers Bangalore player said that Shubman has to find a way of balancing his methods when he plays in conditions like South Africa, Australia and England. ""I think Shubman Gill definitely has a slight technical error, which is pushing at the ball. When you play a lot of white ball cricket, you tend to do that. Travis Head does that as well, but what he has found is the method of doing that, and I think that players like Shubman Gill are caught in the trap of the way they bat in India and the way they bat outside,"" Dinesh Karthik said on Cricbuzz. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage ""Which is, the moment you see the ball released from the bowler, your mind tells you that this is a full ball you need to go at it. Batsmen who travel abroad to places like Australia, England and South Africa tune themselves in practice when they see a fuller ball like that, especially against a new ball - A) they play with slightly soft hands, or B) they try and focus on playing the ball as close to the body or leave. Shubman Gill is playing like he would play in India, where he sees the release, goes for the ball with hard hands.

Karthik concluded by stating that Shubmam Gill has been around for a very long time and it was not acceptable for him to get out while playing ordinary shots. Gill was dismissed trying to drive a ball on his front foot at the Gabba.

Tania highlighted how support from other state governments has propelled their players to achieve great success in chess and revealed that she has received no recognition for her Olympiad victories in 2022 and 2024. ""Having played for India since 2008, it’s disheartening to see a lack of recognition from the Delhi government for achievements in chess. States that support and celebrate their champions directly inspire excellence and motivate talent. Sadly, Delhi has yet to take this step,"" Tania said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. ""In the 2022 Chess Olympiad, I came back with a historic team bronze and an individual medal. Two years later, in 2024, the historic Chess Olympiad gold, and to date, there has been no acknowledgement or recognition by the state govt,"" she wrote, urging the ruling Aam Aadmi Party to ""see value in supporting their chess players.""

 In the 2024 Chess Olympiad held in Budapest, Tania Sachdev played a pivotal role in the Indian women's team's triumph, securing their first-ever gold medal in the event. Tania, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the winning team, had highlighted that the Olympiad double could prove to be a watershed moment for Indian chess. The seasoned campaigner, who enjoys commentary when not playing, also played a key role in India’s bronze medal-winning campaign in 2018. Tania’s comments come just days after the Tamil Nadu government announced a prize of Rs 5 crore for Gukesh Dommaraju, who won the World Chess Championship in Singapore in December. Gukesh was also felicitated by the state government in a grand ceremony. Tamil Nadu has been a strong backer of chess talent in the state, with the 2022 Chess Olympiad hosted in Chennai after Moscow was stripped of the hosting rights. India’s first World Champion, Viswanathan Anand, spoke about the support for chess from the Tamil Nadu government during the felicitation ceremony. The state has produced two World Champions (Anand and Gukesh) and 31 Grandmasters so far. ""The promising talents here get immediate support right from the grassroots. I have had the privilege of working with Gukesh for the last four years and am happy to have played a small part in this,"" Anand said.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Must Watch

India began training on the practice surface on Saturday, December 21 and continued the following day before taking a break on Monday. While the Test match pitch is expected to offer significant bounce, the practice wickets, which are in the stadium complex, reportedly lacked carry. On Saturday and Sunday, the Indian team was offered used pitches that provided little assistance to their fast bowlers, including Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and Akash Deep. Reports suggest that the ball only bounced waist-high when the bowlers hit the deck hard. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage During Sunday’s session, a delivery from a throwdown specialist kept unexpectedly low and struck captain Rohit Sharma on the knee. Rohit required medical attention and spent 30 minutes off the field with an ice pack applied to his knee. However, pace bowler Akash Deep later assured that Rohit appeared fine by the end of the session, avoiding any serious injury concerns. ""I think this wicket was for white ball which is why the ball kept low at times. But these blows are common in training. There are no major concerns because of that,"" the Indian fast bowler had said.  Adding to the row, fresh practice pitches with more pace and bounce were allocated to the Australian team starting Monday, raising questions about the fairness of preparations.WHY INDIA WERE GIVEN USED PITCHES

Standing at 6ft 5in tall, Webster is a genuine all-rounder, with the ability to clock decent speeds with the ball. The all-rounder spoke to the reporters on the sidelines of the Australian practice and said that he wanted to play the Travis Head brand of cricket. In case Webster make his debut, he is expected to replace Mitchell Marsh. Marsh has struggled throughout the first three Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with just one score in the double digits - 47 in Perth. Webster spoke about the need to keep the scoreboard ticking and said that a counter-attacking innings in the lower-middle order can play a big hand in teams winning a Test match. ""I think certainly here in Australia...we have seen...there's been plenty on offer for the quicks, and if you are standing there and not looking to score, you can be a bit of a sitting duck,"" Webster told the press. ""Travis is obviously a free-flowing player and he's made the most of it and tried to hit these experienced Indian bowlers off their length; and he has done it brilliantly. It's definitely one of those things at No. 5 to sort of No. 7 (batting positions) that you have to have, I think, if you wanna be trying to move the game on...If you counter-punch a quick fifty or a hundred, you can see how it goes in terms of winning a Test,"" he added. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage Talking about his own role in the Australian domestic competitions, Webster said that his strength was to play an aggressive innings with the bat. Webster averages 37.83 with the bat from 93 First Class matches at a healthy strike-rate of 53.72. ""In think in the last 2 to 3 years, I have batted No. 6 for Tasmania in (Sheffield) Shield cricket and come in and do a counter-punching sort of role....to be able to counter-punch our way out of that (trouble) and get us to a total that our quicks can bowl at. I think it's definitely one of my strengths with the bat,"" said Webster. He has scored  5297 first-class runs for Tasmania in 159 innings, including 12 hundreds and 24 fifties. While his record with the ball has been decent - 148 wickets - Webster said that he aimed for more consistency with the ball. ""With the ball, I just aim at consistency...trying to hit the top of off-stump and try to run the ball back into the right-handers. If there's a bit of swing on offer, I think I can take that as well...It's just those simple things done over and over again, I think, is my strength,"" concluded the all-rounder.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Tired pitches for India, fresher ones for Australia: MCG practice row explainedMust Watch

A 12-member National Sports Day committee, headed by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice V Ramasubramam, did not recommend the shooter's name for the prestigious award.  While the Sports Ministry reportedly claimed that Manu Bhaker did not apply for the award, Manu Bhaker's father, Ramakrishna, said they applied for the honour and did not hear back from the committee.  Indian men's hockey team captain Harmanpreet Singh and para-athlete Praveen Kumar were among the nominees for the Khel Ratna award.  Speaking to India Today, Ramakrishna said, “What's the point of getting two medals in a single Olympics if you have to beg for awards?” “One government official is deciding, and committee members are silent, not giving their opinion. I don't understand. Is this the way you are encouraging athletes?” her father added.   ""We applied for the award but have heard nothing from the committee.

Pujara highlighted that the team now faces a dilemma in fielding a balanced bowling attack, especially in the spin department, which has been significantly impacted by Ashwin’s absence. Ashwin’s sudden retirement, announced after India’s hard-fought draw in the Brisbane Test, shocked the cricket fraternity. The experienced spinner’s decision to leave the squad and return home to Chennai the following day has left India with limited options. Pujara, in an interview with Star Sports, emphasised how Ashwin’s exit complicates India’s bowling strategy, making it difficult for the team to tweak their lineup effectively. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""My biggest question and the reason for a little bit of concern is that the Indian bowling is looking a little weak. Batting is a little better, like the top five didn't do well, but the middle order and lower middle order, Ravindra Jadeja, Nitesh, and even tail enders, Bumrah and Akashdeep contributed with the bat. Now, there is a weakness in the bowling, so what will you feed the team? That is the biggest question, because you can't drop Nitish, you can't drop Jadeja, so what will be the team combination? Ashwin has taken retirement, so two spinners, I don't think they will play in Melbourne,"" Pujara said. So, how will you strengthen the bowling? Because the three seamers are very good, but their supporting role, fourth and fifth seamer, Nitesh Kumar is the fourth seamer and Ravindra Jadeja is the fifth bowler. If you add both of them together, the bowling is not that good. We will have to think about that, because if you want to win a test match, then you have to take 20 wickets, and the ability to take 20 wickets is not that good,” Pujara added. The current spin choices, all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, are now under scrutiny as India navigates crucial matches in the series. Additionally, players like Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has been a part-time fifth bowler, and Jadeja are now expected to shoulder greater responsibility. Many fans and former cricketers alike have been consistently highlighting how India's pace ace Jasprit Bumrah has been majorly carrying the bowling responsibility without any sufficient support from the rest of the bowling unit, which only highlights the problem further. India's bowling combinations have fluctuated throughout the series. In the Perth Test, the team deployed Washington Sundar as their primary spinner alongside pacers Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and Harshit Rana, with Reddy providing part-time overs. In Adelaide, Ashwin replaced Sundar but struggled, picking up only one wicket in India’s loss. The Brisbane Test saw another shuffle, with Jadeja replacing Ashwin and Akash Deep coming in for Harshit Rana. While Jadeja and Akash Deep didn’t excel with the ball, their batting contributions played a crucial role in securing a draw. As India approaches the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, known for its seam-friendly conditions, captain Rohit Sharma faces a challenging decision. Should he stick with the in-form players like Nitish Reddy, Jadeja, and Akash Deep, or experiment with a new combination to strengthen the bowling attack? The outcome of this decision could prove pivotal in India’s quest to gain an upper hand in the series and secure a spot in the World Test Championship Final.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Pujara suggests game plan to tackle 'dangerous' Mitchell Starc threat

The Test specialist highlighted why the left-arm pacer has found more success this year. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-4th-test-mitchell-starc-lethal-cheteshwar-pujara-2654002-2024-12-23,"Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara said Mitchell Starc is looking more dangerous than ever and has been threatening the Indian batters more than his captain Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Pujara highlighted a major difference in the way Starc was bowling in the 2018-19 and 2020-21 series and the ongoing five-Test series Down Under.  Mitchell Starc is the leading wicket-taker for Australia after the first three Tests of the series with 14 wickets in six innings. Starc has conceded at 3.54 runs per over. On the other hand, Pat Cummins has 14 wickets at an economy rate of 3.74 while Josh Hazlewood took six wickets in two matches before suffering an injury in the third Test.  Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Starc inspired Australia to a 10-wicket win in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, taking eight wickets, including a six-wicket haul in the first innings. The left-arm fast bowler has been lethal with the new ball, troubling the Indian top-order.  Speaking to the broadcaster in the lead-up to the Boxing Day Test, Pujara said Starc has vastly improved his lines and lengths in the ongoing series. ""Mitchell Starc has played in the last 1-1.5 years, he has brought a lot of improvement. And he has a lot of ability. If I talk about my personal experience, when he used to play in the last series in 2018 or 2021, I used to feel that if he played against me, I would get runs. And now, when he is playing in this series, it feels like he will take wickets,"" Pujara said. ""So what is the difference? The difference is that his line length, his accuracy have increased a lot. He is bowling very less loose deliveries. He is playing on the stump. Every ball is hitting on the good length spot. He is getting swing. So the change he has brought in his game has made him a different player. ""And he is looking more dangerous than Cummins and Hazlewood,"" he added. PUJARA'S ADVICE TO INDIA BATTERS Cheteshwar Pujara, meanwhile, urged the Indian batters to see off the new ball threat from Starc, highlighting that the top-order batters have done enough to give themselves the time to play second and third spells from Starc.  Pujara said Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah relatively found it easier to face Starc with the old ball during their crucial partnership in the rain-affected Brisbane Test.  ""So we will have to take care of his game, especially with the new ball. In the first 5 overs, his first spell, he has taken the most wickets there. So if there is a good batting in the first 5 overs, bring him for the 2nd or 3rd spell. Because he gets tired. So the batting of the top order so far, our top order has never played in the 3rd or 4th spell. The ones who have played are the lower middle order and the tail-enders. ""And there we saw that when Bumrah and Akash were batting, when Mitchell Starc was bowling, he was not that effective. So they will have to play their new game well,"" he added. Mitchell Starc will be raring to have a go at the Indian batters when the two sides meet in Melbourne in the Boxing Day Test. Starc and Cummins will likely be joined by Scott Boland, who will replace the injured Josh Hazlewood in the line-up.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  6ft 5in tall Beau Webster wants to counter-punch India if given a chance in MCGMust Watch

Amidst a season of struggling form, this decision reflects the team’s commitment to regaining momentum after a series of underwhelming performances. Their most recent setback came with a narrow 2-1 loss to Aston Villa on December 21, further emphasising the need for intense preparation as they face a struggling Everton side. Manchester City players have had Christmas Day off during previous campaigns. However, the current schedule, combined with their inconsistent results, has prompted a stricter approach. The defending champions are keen to use every available opportunity to rectify their issues on the field, particularly with defensive lapses and midfield inefficiencies coming under scrutiny. ""We're gonna train on Christmas Day this season, we've got Everton at 12:30 on Boxing Day...But the last couple of seasons we've had Christmas Day off, which has been very nice,” Walker said. The upcoming Boxing Day fixture against Everton is crucial for City’s Premier League campaign. Everton, battling to avoid relegation, will view the game as an opportunity to secure much-needed points, ensuring that City must be at their best to secure a victory. This match is part of a critical phase for Manchester City, with tough clashes against Leicester City and West Ham United also on the horizon in January. The congested football calendar has increased the stakes for Guardiola’s side, who now find themselves under pressure to close the gap at the top of the league table. Criticism surrounding the demanding football schedule this season has been widespread, but City’s commitment to training through the festive period highlights their determination to overcome their challenges. Christmas Day for the squad will not be about celebration but about working towards reestablishing their dominance in the league. With several key players needing to find their rhythm and the team looking to avoid further slips in form, this unusual approach could be pivotal in their quest to maintain their status as one of England’s top teams.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 23, 2024

While Virat Kohli confronted a female journalist for taking photos of his family without permission, Ravindra Jadeja was accused by the Australian media of not entertaining questions in English after an MCG net session.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-4th-test-melbourne-pitch-curator-matt-page-2654051-2024-12-23,"The centre pitch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) had a tinge of green on Monday, three days ahead of the fourth Test between India and Australia. After three fast-paced pitches in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, attention turned to the green tinge covering the 22 yards in Melbourne during Australia's first training session at the venue.   India will head into the Boxing Day Test with confidence, having won their last two Tests in Melbourne in 2018-19 and 2020-21. The Asian giants have not lost a Test at the iconic venue since 2012. While India played two spinners on the 2020-21 tour, they relied on part-time off-spinner Hanuma Vihari during the 2018 Test, in which Ravindra Jadeja was the sole spinner.   Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage As India prepare for the all-important fourth Test in the five-match series, currently tied at 1-1, it remains to be seen whether they opt for two spinners. Notably, R Ashwin, who has enjoyed success at the venue, retired after the third Test in Brisbane, and India now have off-spinner Washington Sundar as a potential replacement.   However, MCG curator Matt Page downplayed the likelihood of the pitch breaking down significantly as the game progressed. The forecast of temperatures reaching 40 degrees on Boxing Day adds further intrigue to how the surface might behave.   ""Spinners? Oh, it doesn't really break up and spin here,"" Page said. ""If you look at our long-format games over the last four or five years, they've been more seam-friendly than spin-friendly. So I don't see that changing here,"" he added. Since 2010, off-spinner Nathan Lyon has picked up the most wickets at the MCG, with 45 -- 10 more than Pat Cummins, who is second on the list. Ashwin, too, has enjoyed success here, taking 14 wickets in three Tests and making good use of the extra bounce.6MM Of GRASS COVERINGPage also explained the grass covering, noting that his team aims to leave 6mm of grass in the lead-up to the Test to ensure lively pitches that assist fast bowlers with the new ball.  ""Seven years ago, we were quite flat. We want to create exciting contests and exciting Test matches, so we leave more grass-that brings the bowlers into the equation,"" Page said. ""But it's still good for batting once the new ball goes off. We keep 6mm grass and monitor that as we go.""  When asked if the pitch will match the pace of those at the Gabba or Perth, Page replied: ""You can't compare. Every pitch in Australia is so different these days. Perth has pace and bounce, and you get cracks if it's hot. Adelaide, with the pink ball, swings around at night. Gabba is quick, bouncy, and seams around. We're not like that.  advertisement""We don't have the extreme pace of Perth or Brisbane, and we don't have the pink ball. For us, we'll get as much pace and bounce as we can.

No team managed to score more than 250, and Victoria fell short of a 273-run target by 24 runs.  Page clarified that the Boxing Day Test pitch will not be as spicy as those used for Shield games.  ""There won't probably be as much seam as in the Shield games. In Shield games, bowlers get a bit more out of it. The preparation is similar, but we tend to pull back slightly because the quality of players goes up,"" he said. ""We make sure it seams around the whole day with the new ball,"" he added.  After receiving criticism for producing a dull, lifeless pitch during the 2017 Ashes Test, the MCG underwent a significant transformation in pitch preparation. The surface for that match was labelled ""poor"" by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after a high-scoring draw that offered little assistance to either pace bowlers or spinners.  advertisementCurator Matt Page, who joined the MCG from the WACA in 2016, played a pivotal role in addressing these issues.

After his Player of the Match performance in the series opener in Perth, the Australian media claimed that the India fast bowler has got inside the head of Australian batters. Ahead of the fourth Test in Melbourne, Katich acknowledged Bumrah’s threat and mentioned how the Indian pace spearhead doesn’t bowl too many bad deliveries. ""I know all the talk is around having more positive intent, and I think that’s all well and good and it is certainly something they have to be mindful of. But against someone like Bumrah intent is not about just blazing him for fours, because he doesn’t bowl many bad balls,"" Katich told SEN 1116. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Further speaking ahead, the former batter said that Australian batters need to keep rotating strike and defend well against Bumrah with a sole focus on staying at the crease.Bumrah: The best ever Asian seamer in Australia ""So a lot of that intent has to be about rotating strike and being able to defend really well, because you’re not gonna be able to play with any intent if you aren’t there after the tenth over. That’s the challenge for all of these guys,"" Katich added. Bumrah already has the most wickets by an Asian fast bowler in Australia with 53 scalps from ten matches at an average of 17.15 and an economy of 2.50. He played a key role in India’s victory in Melbourne 2018 as he registered his career-best figures of 9/86 and was adjudged Player of the Match.

Mbappe's contribution—a goal and an assist—played a pivotal role in Real Madrid's 4-2 victory on Sunday, December 22. The French star opened the scoring at the Santiago Bernabeu against Sevilla with his 14th goal of the season across all competitions, marking his sixth goal in the last month. A long-range screamer in the 10th minute mark of the match ensured a strong start for Los Blancos. Despite his consistent scoring, Mbappe has faced scrutiny for his overall gameplay this season, with many suggesting it stems from the sky-high expectations surrounding him. Ancelotti, however, has continuously supported the forward and expressed confidence in his ability to deliver under pressure.  Following the Sevilla win, Ancelotti emphasised that Mbappe is now operating at ""top gear"" for Los Blancos.

He needed his adaptation period, like everyone, and that’s over now,"" Ancelotti said.  Mbappé must improve his consistency, making the plays that only he can do as often as possible. I don’t ask him to be heavily involved in the build-up; his specialty is breaking away and attacking the line, and he needs to do that more frequently,"" he added. Mbappe’s journey with Real Madrid has not been without challenges. His debut El Clásico against rivals FC Barcelona was marred by a series of offside calls, and his struggles continued in Madrid's 2-1 loss at San Mamés on December 4, where he missed a crucial penalty. These moments highlighted the transitional phase Mbappe had to endure, even as he remained a vital scorer for the team. The victory over Sevilla was a turning point not just for Mbappe but also for Real Madrid’s campaign. With the win, Madrid now sits second on the La Liga table, trailing leaders Atletico Madrid by just one point. Atletico’s own statement victory over FC Barcelona on the same day has intensified the title race, making Mbappé’s resurgence even more crucial for Madrid’s ambitions. As the season progresses, Real Madrid’s form appears to be stabilizing, with Mbappé emerging as a decisive figure in their quest for domestic and European glory. For the fans and the club, his growing synergy with Ancelotti’s system is a promising sign that the French star has truly arrived on the grand stage of the Bernabeu.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  No Christmas off for Manchester City: Kyle Walker amidst club's tough form

The left-hander, who has been striving to make a comeback to the Indian national side, showcased his class and determination with a match-winning performance on Monday, December 23. Manipur batted first and posted a modest total of 253/7 in their 50 overs. In response, Ishan opened the batting and took charge from the outset.

— Pocket Dynamo ðŸ’£ (@AS30703) December 23, 2024 Kishan has been out of the Indian team since the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023, where he featured in only two matches. His last ODI appearance came against Afghanistan during the tournament, where he scored a quickfire 47. However, he failed to make a significant impact in the competition and was dropped from the playing XI thereafter. Since making his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2021, Kishan has played 27 matches in the format, amassing 933 runs at an impressive average of 42.40 and a strike rate of 102.19. His record includes one century and seven half-centuries, showcasing his ability to perform in critical situations. Despite his obvious talent, inconsistency has hampered his progress in securing a permanent spot in the Indian lineup. However, his stunning knock in the Vijay Hazare Trophy is a strong statement of his intent to return to the national fold. As Kishan continues to lead Jharkhand in the tournament, his focus will undoubtedly be on maintaining this rich vein of form. With consistent performances, he could soon find himself back in contention for the Indian team, ready to prove his mettle once again on the international stage.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Must Watch

Under the leadership of new manager Ruben Amorim, Rashford's time at Old Trafford appears to be ticking down to its final moments. The 27-year-old forward, who burst onto the scene as a fearless teenager, has seen his star dim in recent seasons, with his exclusion from the squad for United’s 3-0 loss to Bournemouth serving as a glaring indication of his fall from grace. What’s most striking is the muted reaction to Rashford’s omission, both from Amorim and the club’s fanbase. Once a talisman, his absence no longer inspires significant debate, reflecting the diminishing faith in a player who was once a cornerstone of United’s future. “It’s my decision, and it always will be. It is selection. I want to see the best in my players and I try different things with different players. That’s my focus,” Amorim said after United's 0-3 loss to Bournemouth.A Combination of Poor Form and Off-Field Issues Rashford’s struggles on the pitch have been evident, with just 11 goals in his last 48 Premier League appearances. However, it’s not just his performance that has raised eyebrows; his off-the-field behaviour has also come under scrutiny. From inconsistent training attitudes to disciplinary lapses, Rashford has increasingly alienated himself from the trust of the club’s hierarchy and fans. Perhaps the most damaging blow to his United career was his public admission of wanting a ""new challenge."" While Rashford later clarified his commitment, the timing of his comments, combined with Amorim’s repeated emphasis on attitude and effort, painted a troubling picture of a player seemingly at odds with his environment.Amorim’s Tough Love Amorim has not shied away from making bold decisions as he seeks to rebuild United. Leaving both Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho out of the squad for the Manchester derby was a clear statement of his expectations regarding discipline and attitude. Garnacho, to his credit, has since returned to the fold, but Rashford remains sidelined, with a reported fever cited as the reason. Behind the scenes, whispers of Rashford’s lackluster training performances have emerged, suggesting a player struggling to match Amorim’s standards. For someone who has been at the club since the age of seven, such reports signal deeper issues.Recurring Off-Field Controversies Rashford’s recent history has been marked by controversies that have overshadowed his footballing contributions. During Erik ten Hag’s tenure, Rashford faced criticism for his behaviour, including a drinking spree in Belfast that saw him miss training ahead of an FA Cup match. While United defended him at the time, citing a legitimate day off, the incident added fuel to the narrative of a player losing focus.A High Wage, Low Returns Dilemma Rashford’s 315,000 pounds-a-week contract, signed last year, has also drawn criticism. As one of the highest earners at the club, fans and pundits alike expect a greater level of effort and output. Yet Rashford’s performances have been characterised by a lack of urgency, whether in making attacking runs or pressing defensively. This disparity between earnings and results has only heightened frustrations amongst supporters, many of whom feel Rashford has failed to justify his lucrative deal.A Question of Maturity As Rashford’s chapter at United seems poised to end, a poignant question lingers: did glory come too soon? His meteoric rise, punctuated by memorable goals and moments of brilliance, once seemed to herald a player destined for greatness. But as his career at Old Trafford falters, it’s worth pondering whether early success clouded his focus and hunger. For Rashford, the challenge now is to rediscover the spark that once made him indispensable. Whether at United or elsewhere, only time will tell if he can reclaim his place amongst football’s elite.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  No Christmas off for Manchester City: Kyle Walker amidst club's tough form

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-mohammed-shami-fitness-update-border-gavaskar-trophy-melbourne-sydney-2654161-2024-12-23,"The Indian cricket board (BCCI) said on Monday, December 23 that Mohammed Shami will not travel to Australia for the last two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The board's update comes after captain Rohit Sharma addressed the speculation about his availability and urged the National Cricket Academy experts to update the status of the fast bowler's fitness.  Shami was not picked in the 18-man squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy as he picked up a knee injury concern following recovery from a heel injury, which put him on the sidelines for close to a year. The senior fast bowler's fitness was monitored by the BCCI medical team and the senior selection committee as he played domestic cricket.  Shami hasn’t played any form of international cricket since India’s ODI World Cup final last year against Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. ""The BCCI Medical Team at the Centre of Excellence has been working closely with Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami on his recovery and rehabilitation after his right heel surgery. Shami has completely recovered from this heel problem,"" the BCCI stated on Monday. ""Shami bowled 43 overs in the Ranji Trophy match for Bengal against Madhya Pradesh in November. Following this, he played in all nine games of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT), where he also engaged in additional bowling sessions on the sidelines to build his bowling volume in order to get ready for the Test matches. ""However, his left knee has exhibited minor swelling due to increased joint loading from his bowling workload. The swelling is on the expected lines, owing to the increased bowling after a prolonged period. ""Based on the current medical assessment, the BCCI Medical Team has determined that his knee requires more time for controlled exposure to bowling loads. Consequently, he has not been deemed fit for consideration for the remaining two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy,"" the board added. VIJAY HAZARE PARTICIPATION IN DOUBT Shami was rested for Bengal’s Vijay Hazare Trophy opener against Delhi last week. The BCCI confirmed that the medical team will continue to monitor the fast bowler's workload and his participation in the domestic 50-overs tournament would depend on his recovery.  ""Shami will continue to undergo targeted strength and conditioning work under the guidance of the medical staff at BCCI’s Centre of Excellence and build his bowling loads needed to meet the demands of the longest format of the game. His participation in the Vijay Hazare Trophy will depend on the progress of his knee,"" it added.  Earlier, Rohit Sharma humorously sidestepped questions about the pacer and stated that only the NCA could provide clarity on his fitness. Rohit emphasised that the NCA would need to certify Shami’s readiness before any decision could be made about his inclusion in the Test squad. Shami, fresh from a post-surgery recovery, showcased impressive performances during the domestic season by claiming seven wickets in the Ranji Trophy and nine in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. However, lingering knee troubles prompted selectors to exercise caution in view of forthcoming international tournaments.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Must Watch

Tanush Kotian, 26, will be added to India's 18-man squad as R Ashwin's replacement, India Today has learnt. Ashwin retired from international cricket midway during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, announcing his decision after the end of the third Test in Brisbane on December 18. Ashwin returned home, deciding against staying with the rest of the squad for the remainder of the series.  Tanush Kotian played a domestic 50-over game as recently on Monday, December 23 in Ahmedabad. The off-spinner bowled 10 overs and took 2 wickets while conceding just 38 runs in Mumbai's Group C game against Hyderabad in the west Indian city.

He came into the rubber in brilliant form, having finished as the highest run scorer in the three-match series against New Zealand with 261 runs. Earlier, he also scored a remarkable century on his Test comeback after 21 months with an innings of 109 against Bangladesh in Chennai. However, he hasn’t been able to continue his form as the Australian bowlers have come well-prepared to counter him. Australia captain Pat Cummins in particular seems to have the wood over him, having dismissed Pant thrice out of five innings so far. With India going to Melbourne for the fourth Test, they will require Pant to go big and help them take a lead in the series. With a win in Melbourne, India will also ensure that they retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy, having won the last four series against Australia.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: What to expect from the MCG pitch for the Boxing Day Test

Manjrekar pointed out that Rohit's struggles could stem from his fragile defence, which was exposed during the home Test series against New Zealand. Rohit, who missed the first Test against Australia in Perth, has failed to make an impact in the next two Tests. In his three innings on Australian soil, he has registered scores of 3, 6, and 10. According to Manjrekar, the Indian captain appeared to be low on confidence. “He is short of confidence, with self-doubts,” Manjrekar told ESPNcricinfo. “It was a bit of a rude shock when he played in that home series against New Zealand, and his defense was getting breached on Indian pitches. For someone who, in 2021, had that terrific series in England and scored at a strike rate of 42—which is a bit Pujara-like—and batted for about 21 hours in the entire series, this was a new discovery for all of us. Now, when he has to bring that game back, he just can’t find his defensive rhythm. That’s where the problem lies—his defence has just gone to pieces,” he explained.Rohit's recent dip in form Manjrekar believes that Rohit needs to rediscover the batting form he showcased during the England series in 2021. “I remember commentating on that series (2021 England) and kept saying, ‘This is Pujara-like,’ the way he was grinding away. I thought it was the rebirth of Rohit Sharma, the Test cricketer, who got those two centuries in his first two Tests. I also felt that this was his true calling—what he loves to do—playing for time, like a typical Mumbai batter,"" Manjrekar added. The Indian captain pushed himself lower down the order at No. 6, giving his opening spot to KL Rahul.

Notably, Jaiswal began the rubber on a great note with a magnificent century in the first Test in Perth. He scored a sensational 161 in the second innings which helped India win by a massive margin of 295 runs. However, since then, Jaiswal has failed to emulate his heroics and has only scored 32 runs in the next four innings. The southpaw has been tormented by Mitchell Starc, who’s dismissed him thrice out of the five innings, including twice in the first over. Analysing Jaiswal’s performances in the series so far, Pujara mentioned that the young opener is just trying to rush things and is looking in a hurry. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""He needs to give himself a bit more time, the way he is playing, he is trying to rush things, he is trying to play shots a bit more. He should only play shots if he is quite sure about it, especially in the first 5-10 overs because it seems that he is in a hurry to score runs, he wants a quick start, and he wants to score those first 15-20 runs quickly,"" Pujara told Star Sports. Further speaking ahead, Pujara advised Jaiswal to not go searching for runs giving Virender Sehwag’s example. ""When you are an opener in Test cricket then you don't go out searching for the ball, you play the deliveries on merit. Even if you are an aggressive player, even Virender Sehwag was an aggressive player but he used to play shots only when the ball was pitched in his zone,” he added. Ahead of the series, several experts had predicted Jaiswal to finish as the leading run scorer. The youngster came into the rubber under massive expectations, being the second-highest run scorer in Tests in 2024, but has failed to score consistently. Hence, it’s crucial from India’s perspective that Jaiswal gets them off to a good start and shields the rest of the batting order from the new ball.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: What to expect from the MCG pitch for the Boxing Day Test

Last Sunday was special for Rizwan, who became the first captain to whitewash South Africa in an ODI series in their own backyard. Pakistan won the third and final T20I by 36 runs (DLS Method) at the Wanderers in Johannesburg to claim the three-match series 3-0.  In fact, Pakistan are on a five-match winning streak in ODIs, having also won the series on Australian soil. Under Rizwan, the Men in Green have won seven out of nine ODIs thus far. Apart from taking down the Proteas and Australia, Pakistan also got the better of Zimbabwe. Even as the series win against South Africa was pretty straightforward, against Zimbabwe and Australia, Pakistan won the series after initially going 0-1 down. Rizwan has made sure that Pakistan do not throw in the towel easily despite having their backs against the walls. After a hat-trick of ODI series wins against Australia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, Rizwan and Pakistan will be brimming with confidence. With the Champions Trophy to be held next year, Pakistan cannot be undermined by any stretch of the imagination given their current form. Pakistan are also the defending champions after they last won the title by beating India in the final at the Kennington Oval in London.Saim Ayub comes of age

 One of the massive reasons behind Pakistan’s dominance in ODIs is a young Saim Ayub, who doesn’t have the words fear and inhibition in his dictionary. The southpaw made his debut against Afghanistan last year in Sharjah after his impressive performances for Peshawar Zalmi in the Pakistan Super League (PSL). But consistency eluded him as he struggled for runs most times. During this while, he played for Pakistan across all three formats. But in the last two months, Ayub has turned it around for himself. The southpaw has been in spectacular form and played a huge part in all their series wins. In nine ODIs, the 22-year-old Ayub has smashed 515 runs at an average of 64.37 with three hundreds to show for his efforts.   He also became the sixth batter to score multiple hundreds in a bilateral series in South Africa. The others are Kevin Pietersen, Virat Kohli, Joe Root, David Warner and Fakhar Zaman. In all three ODIs, Ayub looked at his very best, although he departed cheaply in the second game.In-form players, collective efforts

 During the South Africa ODIs, the likes of Kamran Ghulam and Salman Agha also showed their calibre, playing match-winning knocks. Babar Azam, who was not at his best, also chipped in with a couple of handy knocks. Batter Rizwan did not let his team down either. In the bowling department, Shaheen Shah Afridi has been the most productive pacer with 15 wickets from six ODIs at an economy rate of 5.09. Shaheen was also the top wicket-taker in the South Africa ODI series. Haris Rauf was incredible in the ODI series in Australia. Agha Salman, who’s flourished with the bat of late, also has 11 wickets from the six innings that he has bowled in. Left-arm wrist spinner Sufiyan Muqeem also took a four-wicket haul in the Johannesburg ODI. Abrar Ahmed and Naseem Shah have also been amongst the wickets, showing that Pakistan have put in collective efforts and hardly has it been a one-man show. With the Champions Trophy ahead, Pakistan have most of their bases covered. They will also be looking to make use of the tri-series with New Zealand and South Africa. Pakistan are the defending champions of the Champions Trophy and would be looking to take the field as one in the multi-nation tournament.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  Babar Azam smashes Chris Gayle's T20 record, completes 14K runs for PakistanMust Watch

According to the board, using residential land for non-residential purposes violates its regulations. Board Chairman Sanjay Lal Paswan stated that residential plots allocated by the board can only be used for residential purposes, and any deviation from this is deemed illegal. The controversy arose when reports surfaced of a diagnostic centre being set up at Dhoni's Harmu residence. Following this, the board has ordered an investigation to determine the purpose for which the plot was originally allotted and whether it is being used in accordance with the rules. If it is confirmed that the residential land is being used commercially, strict action will follow. Dhoni, who currently resides in his new home on Simaliya’s Ring Road, previously lived at the Harmu Road residence. Reports suggest that the diagnostic lab has been established at the older property, prompting the housing board to keep a close watch on the developments. It is noteworthy that the residential plot was awarded to Dhoni by the Jharkhand government during Arjun Munda's tenure as Chief Minister, recognising his stellar achievements in cricket. The plot, measuring approximately 10,000 square feet, now hosts a lavish residence. Interestingly, similar allegations of misuse of residential plots have also been levelled against the BJP’s state office on Harmu Road. The Housing Board had earlier issued notices in this regard. Investigations into both cases are ongoing, and appropriate action will be taken following their conclusion.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  Mohammed Shami deemed not fit for Melbourne, Sydney Tests vs Australia: BCCIMust Watch

Kotian’s inclusion follows Ravichandran Ashwin’s recent retirement after the Brisbane Test. The 26-year-old earned his spot in the team through consistent and standout performances in domestic cricket. Kotian, an off-spinner and right-handed batter, has been a standout performer for Mumbai in recent years. Known for his ability to deliver under pressure, he has consistently proven his mettle in India’s premier red-ball competition. Kotian made his first-class debut in 2018 and has since played 33 matches, scoring 1,525 runs at an average of 41.21, including two centuries and 13 half-centuries. With the ball, he has picked up 101 wickets at an average of 25.70, including three five-wicket hauls.advertisementTanush Kotian earns maiden India call-upHis journey to the national side has been a story of resilience and hard work. After being dropped from Mumbai's senior squad during his maiden Ranji campaign, Kotian returned to the Under-23 team to refine his skills. He worked relentlessly to make his comeback in 2022, a turning point in his career. His contributions in the 2023-24 Ranji Trophy campaign were particularly notable, where he tallied 29 wickets and 502 runs, helping Mumbai clinch the title.

His contributions in the 2023-24 Ranji Trophy campaign were particularly notable, where he tallied 29 wickets and 502 runs, helping Mumbai clinch the title. Kotian’s bowling style is often compared to that of Ravichandran Ashwin. He relies on pace, delivering in the 85-90 kph range, which generates extra bounce and turn. This skill, coupled with his knack for breaking partnerships, makes him a valuable asset. Growing up in the bustling streets of Vikhroli, Mumbai, Kotian honed his skills playing gully cricket. His father, a semi-professional cricketer turned coach, has been instrumental in shaping his career.From Vikhroli to Melbourne Apart from his domestic success, Kotian has also impressed in the India A setup. He was part of the squad that toured Australia ahead of the Border Gavaskar Trophy and later showcased his all-round abilities in the Duleep Trophy and Irani Cup. His quick-fire century in the Irani Cup, rescuing Mumbai from a precarious position, highlighted his temperament and ability to thrive under pressure. As Kotian joins the Indian squad, he aims to fill the massive void left by Ashwin. With his all-round abilities and fighting spirit, he brings fresh energy to the team. His selection is not just a reward for his consistent performances, but also a reflection of India’s robust domestic cricket system.

 R Ashwin surprised many by retiring midway through the all-important Border Gavaskar Trophy. Minutes after India drew the third Test in Brisbane, Ashwin announced his retirement during a press conference alongside captain Rohit Sharma at the Gabba. Rohit revealed that Ashwin had discussed his retirement plans at the start of the Australia tour and that he had convinced the off-spinner to play the second Test in Adelaide. When asked if Ashwin should have continued until the end of the series, Rohit defended the spinner's decision, emphasising that Ashwin had every right to choose when to step away. Ashwin also shared that he never expected to pick so many wickets in his career. “But if somebody had told me in 2011 that I would be getting so many wickets, I'd be retiring in 2024 on December the 18th. I wouldn't have believed them because I knew that this is a game that I loved, but I never did expect that I would get so much love and so many wickets and so many runs as well. I'm very glad, deep sense of gratitude for everyone that supported me, everyone that's challenged me. So happy today.

Let us have a closer look at the timeline of Shami's injury, alongside the entire rehabilitation and comeback process. November 2023: Heel Injury During ODI World Cup Mohammed Shami played a pivotal role in India's ODI World Cup campaign, finishing as the tournament's highest wicket-taker with 24 wickets in just 7 matches. Despite his remarkable performance, Shami battled through a chronic heel issue, requiring injections to manage the pain. This injury eventually necessitated surgery on his Achilles tendon in February 2024. February 2024: Achilles Tendon surgery Following the World Cup, Shami underwent surgery on his Achilles tendon to address the persistent heel problem. The surgery marked the beginning of a long rehabilitation process, keeping him away from international cricket for a whole year.  October 2024: Knee swelling during rehabilitation As Shami increased the intensity of his rehabilitation, he encountered swelling in his knee, which slowed his recovery. India captain Rohit Sharma confirmed the setback, while Shami expressed hope of playing domestic cricket before making a full comeback. November 2024: Side Strain Rules Him Out of Border Gavaskar Trophy While preparing to test his fitness in Bengal’s Ranji Trophy matches, Shami sustained a side strain. However, he continued to star with his performance preventing him from being included in Bengal’s squad. This ruled him out of the much-anticipated Border Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia. December 2024: Domestic cricket return After missing a majority of international matches and the 2024 IPL, Shami gradually returned to cricket by participating in Bengal’s Ranji Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy matches. These appearances marked a significant step in his recovery and a hopeful return to full fitness. Late 2024: Knee Injury Confirmed by BCCI The BCCI officially ruled Shami out of the final two Tests of the Border Gavaskar Trophy due to a knee injury. This was attributed to the workload from his return after the Achilles surgery.

Notably, Marsh hasn’t had a memorable series so far, having scored just 69 runs from three matches and has only bowled 23 overs, picking up three wickets. Analyzing his performance in the series so far, Katich said that Marsh hasn’t been bowling the amount of overs  that was expected of him so far. He recalled his spell in the first Test in Perth where he bowled five overs and dismissed Dhruv Jurel and Washington Sundar. ""I've been saying for a couple Tests, Mitch Marsh has not been able to bowl the volume of overs that everyone expected of him. Given the conditions and given he is a wicket taker. We saw that in Perth, he bowled well on day one. Took some key wickets and then struggled to back up,” Katich said on 'SEN Breakfast'. Further speaking ahead, Katich highlighted how Marsh didn’t bowl enough overs in Brisbane after Josh Hazlewood got injured. The former batter felt that there was something not right with him and suggested replacing him with Beau Webster.Beau Webster deserves to be in that squad: Simon Katich ""I mean obviously the Aussie hierarchy know better then we do around where his fitness is at. But for him to bowl two overs the other day after Josh Hazlewood went down, that to me indicates something's not 100% right with him. At the end of the day, Beau Webster deserves to be in that squad. He’s done very well for Tassie in the last few years, he’s a genuine all-rounder given what his role is for Tassie and he plays that dual role with bat and ball,” he added. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Webster has played 93 first-class matches in his career so far and has scored 5297 runs at an average of 37.83 with 12 hundreds and 24 fifties. Apart from that, he’s scalped 148 wickets at an average of 37.39 with two five-wicket hauls to his name. It remains to be seen whether the Australian team management drops Marsh for the upcoming Test. They will already be bringing Scott Boland into the team in place of Josh Hazlewood.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 23, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: What to expect from the MCG pitch for the Boxing Day Test

Arjun’s situation gained widespread attention when he took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his predicament. He revealed that his passport had been submitted for visa stamping on December 13 after completing his biometrics and visa interview in late November.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-australia-vs-india-ricky-ponting-on-shubman-gill-overseas-test-record-2654425-2024-12-24,"Australia legend Ricky Ponting has weighed in on India opener Shubman Gill's poor overseas Test record, explaining how the Indian batter could improve his performances in challenging conditions like Australia. Since his heroic 91 at the Gabba in 2021, which helped India secure a historic series victory, Gill has scored only one Test century outside India, in Bangladesh in 2022.  Across nine Tests in England, Bangladesh, West Indies, South Africa, and Australia, Gill averages a modest 23.8. In contrast, he has amassed 1177 runs at an average of 42.03 with four centuries across 17 Tests at home. ""I love watching him play. When you're watching him bat and bat well, he looks as good as anyone in world cricket.“But the numbers don't really stack up, do they, away from home?” Ponting said while speaking to ICC Review. Ponting noted that Gill's inconsistent overseas performances might stem from overcomplicating his batting approach. Citing Gill's recent outings in Australia, he said, ""I watched him a little bit in Adelaide, and it almost looked like he changed things up too much. Scott Boland was bowling, and he changed his guard, moved across to the off stump, presented his front pad to Boland, and got out to a full straight one."" However, rather than making any major changes, Ponting said Gill could improve his returns by trusting his instincts. ""If anything, he needs to back himself a little bit more, needs to back his defensive technique a little bit more here in Australia, and still find a way to be able to score and score quickly,"" Ponting advised. He emphasised the importance of Gill adopting a positive mindset, akin to his approach at home. ""When he's generally scored runs anywhere around the world, he scores them in a nice, attacking mode. He's almost to the point where he's not thinking about getting out-he's only thinking about scoring runs."" With India set to face Australia in the fourth Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test on Boxing Day in Melbourne, Gill has an opportunity to apply Ponting's advice. India will need Gill's contributions as they chase a critical win to boost their chances of qualifying for the ICC World Test Championship Final.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Read More |  England Test captain Ben Stokes out for three months due to torn hamstring

The 33-year-old all-rounder will undergo surgery in January, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed in a statement on Monday. Stokes initially tore the hamstring during The Hundred in August, forcing him to miss four Tests. Despite a partial recovery, the injury resurfaced in the third Test of England’s 2-1 series victory over New Zealand. Stokes bowled extensively in the match, delivering 36.2 overs, the most he has bowled in a Test since 2022. Stokes' Determination and Resilience
In a message on his social media account, Stokes expressed his determination to overcome the setback, saying: “I’ve got so much more left in this tank and so much more blood, sweat, and tears to go through for my team and this shirt. There’s a reason I have a Phoenix permanently inked on my body.” The injury marks another challenge in Stokes’ career as he balances his dual role as a leader and all-rounder. His heavy workload in New Zealand included spells of eight, eight, and seven overs in a single day, highlighting his commitment despite England’s struggles in the match. The injury has already affected England’s plans, with Stokes omitted from their squad for the Champions Trophy in February on medical grounds. This continues a challenging period for Stokes, who had missed parts of the season due to knee surgery in October 2023 and was absent from England’s ODI setup during their early exit from the 2023 Cricket World Cup. Looking ahead, England’s Test schedule resumes in May with a one-off Test against Zimbabwe, followed by a high-profile five-match home series against India in July and August. Stokes’ availability for these fixtures remains uncertain, as he focuses on recovery and rehabilitation. Stokes’ recent form had shown glimpses of his all-round prowess, with a batting average of 52.66 and seven dismissals at 36.85 during the New Zealand series. However, the physical toll of fulfilling the all-rounder role has been evident, with Stokes admitting to having “physically drained and ruined himself” in his quest for fitness.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

The teenage sensation will become the youngest-ever man to open the batting for Australia in Test cricket. The 19-year-old batter was included in the squad in place of Nathan McSweeney, following struggles by Australia's top order in the first three Tests of the series, which is currently tied 1-1 with two matches remaining. Konstas will also join the elite ranks as the fourth-youngest Test cricketer for Australia and the youngest since current captain Pat Cummins debuted in 2011.  Speaking to the media, McDonald praised Konstas' temperament and ability to counterattack. ""He's composed, relaxed, and has shown an array of shots. What stood out was his ability to put pressure back on opponents,"" McDonald said. While Konstas’ debut has dominated headlines, the Australian camp faces other key decisions ahead of the fourth Test. Travis Head, the standout player of the series, is under an injury cloud due to a quad strain sustained during the third Test at the Gabba. Although McDonald remains optimistic about Head's fitness, reserve batter Josh Inglis and all-rounder Beau Webster are on standby. ""He's in a good place with his game at the moment, so he'll play on Boxing Day,"" McDonald told reporters at the MCG. ""What he's demonstrated is a wide range of shots and the ability to put pressure back on the opposition. He gets his opportunity, and we're really excited for him. Boxing Day, the biggest stage—he might as well get that one out of the way early."" McDonald also expressed confidence that Travis Head would be fit to bat despite dealing with a quad issue and that all-rounder Mitchell Marsh would be available to bowl. The coach added that captain Pat Cummins would announce the rest of the Australian line-up for the match on Wednesday. The Boxing Day Test is pivotal in the high-stakes series, with Australia leading 2-1. Konstas will be under the spotlight as he steps onto the MCG pitch, which has seen cricketing legends make history.

Discussing his form and the team's plans for the much-anticipated Boxing Day Test, Rohit was at his inimitable best, fielding questions from reporters with enthusiasm. When asked if he had spoken to Virat Kohli about his much-discussed weakness with deliveries outside the off-stump, Rohit Sharma said: ""You only said he is a modern-day great. Modern-day greats will figure out their way or the path (to overcome issues).""  Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage The Indian captain expressed his unwavering support for his long-time teammate, who has struggled to resist the temptation to poke at deliveries in the uncertainty corridor outside the off-stump. Kohli had scored a century in the second innings of the first Test in Perth but has otherwise fallen victim to Australia's off-side trap on several occasions.   In the three Tests so far, Kohli’s scores read 5, 100 not out, 7, 11, and 3. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood have exploited the former Indian captain’s vulnerability by luring him into playing at deliveries outside the off-stump. Kohli had shown greater discipline in this area during last year’s tour of South Africa but appears more susceptible during the ongoing series in Australia.ROHIT TIGHT-LIPPED ON HIS BATTING SPOT Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma downplayed concerns about his own form, stating that he has been focusing on the basics during training sessions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.   Confirming he is 100 per cent fit to play in the Boxing Day Test after overcoming a knee injury scare, Rohit remained tight-lipped about his batting position in the playing XI.   Since his arrival in Australia, Rohit has been batting at No. 6, having sacrificed the opening spot to accommodate KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal. The new opening pair impressed in Rohit’s absence in Perth. However, Rohit has not made significant contributions from the No. 6 position so far.   ""Let's not worry about that. I think 'who bats where?' is something that we need to figure out within ourselves. It's not something I should be discussing at every press conference. Whatever it takes for our team to look good or gives the best chance to succeed, we will do that,"" Rohit said.   KL Rahul, selected for a middle-order role, has excelled in the series, scoring 235 runs, including two fifties. Meanwhile, Yashasvi Jaiswal, who scored 161 in Perth, has struggled against the new ball in Adelaide and Melbourne.   Addressing concerns regarding the form of younger players such as Yashasvi, Shubman Gill, and Rishabh Pant, Rohit said: ""See, as I told you, all these youngsters - Rishabh, Gill, Jaiswal, all these youngsters are in the same boat. We don’t want to complicate what they are doing. They know what they are expected to do.   ""Our job here is to keep talking to them about small, small things like match awareness. I don’t think we need to tell them more and complicate stuff,"" he added.

Speaking ahead of the Boxing Day Test, Rohit jokingly remarked that Kuldeep Yadav didn't have a visa, which expedited the decision to call up Kotian. However, he quickly clarified that Kotian's inclusion was based on his performance and readiness to step into the role. ""Yeah, Tanush was here a month back. Kuldeep, I don't think has a visa. We wanted somebody to get here as quickly as possible. Tanush was the one who was ready. That's just a joke. He played here. He is good enough. He has shown what he has done in the last 1–2 years in domestic cricket. And we really wanted a back-up in case we need two spinners playing here or Sydney, you need a back-up option,"" Rohit explained during the pre-match press conference. Kotian, 26, was playing for Mumbai in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy before being called up. A versatile off-spinner and a dependable batsman, Kotian has been one of Mumbai's standout performers in domestic cricket. Notably, he was instrumental in Mumbai reclaiming the Ranji Trophy last season, contributing 502 runs at an average of 41.83 and picking up 29 wickets at an impressive average of 16.96. Rohit highlighted Kotian's recent exploits and his ability to adapt, making him a valuable backup option. The decision to bring in Kotian also addressed potential gaps in the squad caused by Kuldeep Yadav's ongoing recovery from hernia surgery and Axar Patel's unavailability following the birth of his child. ""Kuldeep, obviously, he is not 100 percent fit, he went through hernia surgery. And the other options like Axar, Axar recently had a baby, he was not going to travel. Tanush was the right option for us. He has certainly shown in the domestic level what he is capable of. He is probably one of the reasons why Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy last year. He played a major role as an all-rounder. Very good option for us, all areas are covered,"" Rohit added. Kotian had recently represented India A during their tour of Australia, performing decently in the red-ball matches. His familiarity with Australian conditions and readiness ensured there were no visa complications, allowing him to join the squad in Melbourne quickly. Rohit hinted at India possibly fielding two spinners in the later Tests of the series, particularly in spin-friendly conditions such as Sydney. However, the decision also raised questions about Ravichandran Ashwin's recent retirement after the third Test in Brisbane. Ashwin's presence could have provided stability in the spin department, but the management opted to respect his decision to step away from international cricket. With 101 wickets in 33 first-class matches at an average of 25.70 and a batting average of 41.21 from 47 innings, Kotian's all-round skills make him a promising addition. His ability to contribute both with the ball and the bat bolsters India's options, particularly in the absence of experienced spinners.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Tune InRead More |  Australia vs India: Travis Head under injury cloud ahead of Boxing Day Test

After facing throw-downs for just 20 minutes, Head had a lengthy conversation with team physiotherapist Nick Jones, sparking further worry over his fitness. His brief stint in the nets, coupled with minimal running during a fielding drill, left some onlookers questioning whether he would be fit to play. Head, however, reassured fans and teammates with an optimistic message following his discussions with coach Andrew McDonald and the team's physio. McDonald was quick to allay fears, confirming that while Head had yet to fully prove his fitness, he would ""pretty sure"" be available for the Boxing Day Test. ""He's been doing everything he can to be ready, and while there are a few boxes to tick, we expect him to play,"" McDonald said after Australia's first full training session at the MCG. ""The chat was mostly about his fielding position and what he can do there,"" McDonald added, hinting that Head's role in the field might be slightly adjusted depending on his recovery. The 30-year-old has been in sensational form, scoring 409 runs at an average of 81.80 across the first three Tests. Head's two centuries, including a match-winning knock in Adelaide, have been pivotal to Australia's success in the series, which is currently tied at 1-1. His dynamic batting has made him one of the most sought-after targets for India's bowlers, particularly pacer Jasprit Bumrah. Australia's batting lineup is already under pressure, and with the series at a critical juncture, Head's availability is crucial. Should he be unable to take the field, Australia will likely turn to uncapped wicketkeeper-batter Josh Inglis as a potential replacement.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Read More |  AUS vs IND: Australian teenager Sam Konstas to debut in Boxing Day Test vs India

The 33-year-old all-rounder is set to undergo surgery after tearing his left hamstring during England's recent series victory over New Zealand.  Stokes is expected to be out until spring, ruling him out of England's T20 and ODI tour of India as well as their Champions Trophy campaign in Pakistan—matches that could have marked his return to one-day cricket. ""Something else to overcome...go on then!!!!!!!!,"" Stokes wrote on X after the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed his injury. ""I've got so much more left in this tank and so much more blood, sweat, and tears to go through for my team and this shirt. There's a reason I have a Phoenix permanently inked on my body. See you on the field to f*** some s*** up."" Stokes underwent knee surgery in November 2023 to prepare for England's five-match Test series in India earlier this year. However, he later missed four Tests in the autumn after sustaining an injury during The Hundred. Stokes' fitness remains a major talking point ahead of the next Ashes, especially with fast-bowling duo Jofra Archer and Mark Wood also battling long-term injuries as they aim to secure spots in Brendon McCullum's red-ball squad. The ECB provided an update on Stokes’ condition: ""England Men's Test captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out of all cricket for at least three months after further assessments confirmed he has torn his left hamstring. The Durham all-rounder will undergo surgery in January. The injury occurred during the third Test in Hamilton, during England's recent 2-1 Test series victory in New Zealand."" The injury forced Stokes to relinquish the captaincy to Ollie Pope during the match after bowling a grueling 37 overs and experiencing discomfort. Despite his efforts in the New Zealand series, the 33-year-old all-rounder, who has not played an ODI since the 2023 World Cup, was omitted from England's squad for the Champions Trophy in February and March. Stokes’ ongoing hamstring issues have disrupted his playing schedule throughout 2024. He missed the summer series against Sri Lanka and the first Test against Pakistan due to similar concerns. Nevertheless, Stokes remains resolute, expressing his determination to recover fully and return to the field with his characteristic grit. ""There will be no holding back,"" Stokes declared, reaffirming his commitment to giving his all for England.

Rashford's remarks have fuelled speculation about his future at Old Trafford after being dropped for several key matches. Rashford, 27, made the statement two days after being excluded from United's 2-1 derby win against Manchester City on December 15. The England international has since missed the Carabao Cup quarterfinal defeat to Tottenham and United's 3-0 Premier League loss to Bournemouth, intensifying rumours of a January departure. Speaking to Sky Sports, Amorim expressed his concerns about external influences on the player. ""It is a hard situation,"" Amorim said. ""These players have a lot of people around them, making choices that are not always the player's first idea. The interview decision wasn't just Marcus's."" READ MORE: Marcus Rashford's Decline: 'Generational talent' nears Manchester United exit Rashford, who has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances since debuting for United in 2016, has struggled to maintain consistency in recent seasons. Although he netted 30 goals during the 2022-23 campaign, his form has dipped, drawing criticism from fans and pundits alike. Despite the controversy, Amorim emphasised his commitment to helping Rashford regain form. ""I am focused on improving Marcus,"" he said. ""We need a talented guy like him. I forget the interview now and concentrate on what I see on the pitch."" Rashford has three goals since Amorim took over last month, but he was substituted in the 56th minute of their 2-1 Europa League win over Viktoria Plzen on December 12, with fans booing the striker as he departed the pitch. The Portuguese manager acknowledged the complexity of the situation but stressed that decisions about Rashford's future would be addressed internally. ""For now, it's better for me and the club to deal with that when the time comes,"" he added. United's loss to Bournemouth left them in 13th place heading into Christmas, their lowest position at this stage since 1986. Amorim's side faces a challenging festive schedule, with a Boxing Day trip to Wolves followed by a home match against Newcastle on December 30. The club's precarious position has only heightened the spotlight on Rashford's form and future, with Amorim keen to balance player management and squad performance amid mounting pressure.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Read More |  Raphael Varane attends Lens vs PSG in disguise, spotted among fansMust Watch

The iconic 'G' has been a traditional stronghold of Australia, but the hosts have struggled against India at the venue in the recent past. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/ind-vs-aus-bgt-australia-record-boxing-day-test-match-melbourne-2654080-2024-12-24,"Pat Cummins-led Australia would be raring to go in the Boxing Day Test match against India. Set to be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Australian team would like to dish out another strong performance after their dominance in Adelaide and Brisbane. Things will not be easy though, as India have time and again come back from adversities. Take the Brisbane Test for example. After nearly conceding follow-on on Day 4, India hit back with a tremendous bowling performance reducing Australia down to 89/7 in the second innings. India once again showed, even when down they cannot be counted out. And the fiery build-up to the Boxing Day Test match has mimicked that attitude. While Australian players have been shifting between national team and family duties, the Indian stars have been hounded by the home media. Star India batter Virat Kohli got into a confrontation with a female journalist at the Melbourne airport and just days later Ravindra Jadeja found himself in the boiling pot after the Australian media alleged that the all-rounder refused to take questions in English. This mood might further intensify if a packed crowd of 100,000 people are present at the MCG on days 1 and 2 of the Test match. Traditionally a strength of the Australian cricket team due to the environment it produces, the MCG might play the role of the 12th man for both teams. There is a big South Asian population that lives in Australia, which might come out in numbers to support the visiting team. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage So, what is Australia's record at the MCG? Australia have played a total of 116 Test matches on the venue, with the first Test match being played in 1877. The hosts have won 67 matches out of the 116, lost 32 and drawn 17. In more recent times, since 2010, Australia have played 14 matches, out of which they have won 9, lost 3 and drawn 2 Test matches. And here's where things get a little interesting. In the last 14 years, where they have played one Test match a year, Australia have lost only 3 Test matches. Out of the three, Australia have lost two games against India - once in 2018, and the other in 2020. Their one loss before that came way back in 2010, when they lost to England by an innings and 157 runs.

 



Australia's recent record at the MCG.
INDIA'S MOST RECENT PERFORMANCES AT THE MCG BGT 2014-15 The only drawn MCG Test match in India's last three tours. Bowling first in the game, India was put in trouble by a prolific Steve Smith, who scored 192 runs in the first innings. India replied with twin centuries from Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane, who helped India score 465 runs in response to Australia's 530. After Australia declared for 318/9, India saw Australia off despite panicking early. Kohli and Rahane once again stabilised the Indian innings, after which Pujara, Dhoni, and Ashwin saw India off to a draw. BGT 2018-19 Under the captaincy of Virat Kohli, India notched up a famous win in the Boxing Day Test match. After a strong batting performance in the first innings by Cheteshwar Pujara (106) and Virat Kohli (82), India put up 443/7d. In response, Australia fumbled in both innings, courtesy of Jasprit Bumrah (9 wickets), and India won by 137 runs. BGT 2020-21 It was once again Jasprit Bumrah and Ajinkya Rahane who showed the way. Bumrah bowled out Australia for just 195 runs in the first innings, after which Rahane added insult to injury with his patient hundred, helping India take a 100+ lead. Australia faltered with the bat once again due to the combined prowess of Mohammed Siraj, Bumrah, and Umesh Yadav, helping India notch up an 8-wicket win. Rahane was named the player of the match for his century and captaincy.AUSTRALIA'S MOST RECENT PERFORMANCES AT THE MCG Since their last loss at the MCG, Australia have hammered England, South Africa and Pakistan.  In 2021, Scott Boland's iconic 6/7 spell destroyed England - helping Australia win by an innings and 14 runs. In 2022, Australia rolled over South Africa owing to a double century from David Warner. Australia won that game by a massive margin of an innings and 182 runs. In their last match vs Pakistan at the venue, Australia were given close competition by Pakistan but the hosts ended up winning the game by 79 runs.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  Tired pitches for India, fresher ones for Australia: MCG practice row explainedMust Watch

Rohit backed Pant, highlighting his success with the bat in the recent past and on the previous tours to Australia when he addressed the press ahead of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.  Rishabh Pant, who was India's hero in the 2020-21 tour, has struggled to live up to expectations, managing just 96 runs in three Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy so far. Pant has been targeted with short deliveries and Australia captain Pat Cummins's ploy has worked against him.  ""There is no pressure. He has played just three Tests here. He has scored runs in India. He has been in good form. If two or three Tests go up and down, too much of judgement is not right. He knows what he has to do,"" Rohit said.  ""See, as I told you, all these youngsters - Rishabh, Gill, Jaiswal, all these youngsters are in the same boat. We don’t want to complicate what they are doing.

I don’t think we need to tell them more and complicate stuff.  ""Rishabh Pant knows what he has to do. He himself has a lot of expectations from him. He is working hard. I hope he clicks in the last two matches,"" Pant added.  India's young guns in the batting unit have flattered to deceive so far in the series. While Yashasvi Jaiswal began the series with a second innings hundred in Perth, the opening batter has struggled for consistency.  Shubman Gill has managed to get starts, but has not managed to convert them.INDIA'S YOUNG IN BGT 2024-25

 Rohit Sharma, however, backed the youngsters, saying the team management has been keen on not putting pressure on the likes of Pant, Gill and Jaiswal and letting them play freely in the remainder of the series.  ""Look, Jaiswal, he is coming here for the first time. He has already shown what he is capable of. when you have a guy like that in your team, you don't want to tamper too much with his mindset. Let him be as free as possible. We try not to overburden him with too many thoughts regarding his batting. He understands his batting more than any one of us. That's how he has played his cricket, scored all of his runs. We want to ensure he goes out there and plays his game freely. He has got the ability to play all sorts of games -- whether it's the holding game or dominating the game. It's just about trying to figure out certain areas of his game. I am sure he is doing that along with the other guys. Guys who have played here before share their knowledge,"" Rohit said.  ""You don't want to be telling him too many things about his batting. if he gets going, he can be very, very dangerous,"" he said.  The skipper also had a message for Shubman Gill.  ""Talking about Gill, he is quality. It's just about backing that quality and making sure we give clear messaging to him. Like Jaiswal, we don't want to complicate too many things with him. He understands his batting really well. He knows how to score big runs.  ""It's just about making sure that when you get 30s, 40s, you have to convert that into big runs. Getting in is the toughest part here, so when you get in, you have to try and score big runs,"" he added.

Fakhar was removed from the Pakistan Central Board contract after a controversial tweet supporting Babar Azam during the team's home Test series against England. Ahead of the 2nd Test of the series against England, speculations were rife that Babar would be dropped from the Test team. At the time, Fakhar came out in support of the former captain and said that dropping Babar would send a poor message to the Test side. The left-hander had also name-dropped Virat Kohli in the tweet comparing the lows of both players. Understandably, the PCB were not happy with the tweet, and after the conclusion of the England Test series, dropped Fakhar Zaman from the central contract list. Speaking to PAK TV in December, Fakhar clarified his stance and said that he did not criticise the Pakistan Cricket Board. The batter argued that his tweet was made before Babar got dropped and he was merely expressing his opinion as a cricketer. Asked if he regretted his decision, Fakhar said that now when he rethinks the events, he feels that ideally he should have stayed away from the matter. ""I thought about it later and felt that I should not have tweeted. But people got the tweet completely wrong. They thought that I was criticising the decision of the board, but this is 100 per cent wrong. If you see the timing of the tweet, it was done before the board made its decision. I saw in the news for 2-3 days that journalists and former players were criticising him (Babar Azam). And I thought to myself, Babar has done so much for the team, but they still wanted him to be dropped,"" Fakhar said in the interview.  ""I saw that and tweeted my opinion out. But I understand that no one is bigger than the board. I will even tell my junior cricketers that however big you become, you are not bigger than the board and you should not be criticising them during your playing days. But ya, my clarification is that I made my tweet before the team was announced,"" he further added. Fakhar's tweet garnered varied responses from fans and former players. While many supported Fakhar for his honesty, others thought it was immature for a current player to voice his opinions.Mohsin Naqvi's Response Safe to say that the PCB did not take the tweet kindly as it was perceived as a criticism of the board. PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi sent out a strong message and said that the tweet was one of the main reasons behind Fakhar getting dropped from the central contract. Mohsin Naqvi said that apart from the tweet issue, Fakhar was not up to the mark with his fitness, which was the main reason behind dropping the player from the contact. ""Tweet was one issue, but the bigger matter was that of fitness. There is a show-cause notice pending against him, and we will see about that. He would need to prove his fitness, his point of view was valued in the Connection Camp and I am very thankful to him for that but you cannot go around commenting on the selection committee over selection calls. But ya, the bigger issue is of selection,"" Mohsin Naqvi said in the press conference while announcing fresh contracts. Notably, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) released the list of contracted players for 2024-25 season on Sunday, October 27.

Welcomed with loud cheers from fans, Kohli quickly requested silence, prioritising complete concentration on his preparations. The India No. 4 batter faced Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, and a local left-arm pacer in the nets, appearing rock solid in his approach. Standing a step outside the crease, Kohli displayed impeccable defence and confidently left back-of-a-length deliveries. Later, he engaged in discussions with Rana and Prasidh, advising them on ideal lengths to bowl to him, reflecting on his leadership and keen understanding of the game. Kohli's form in the ongoing series has been a mix of highs and lows. On the Indian stalwart's form and his alleged weakness outside off-stump, Rohit said Kohli would find a way out of his rut. ""Kohli's off stump... you only say modern-day great. Modern-day greats figure out their own path,"" said the skipper. While his century in Perth propelled India to a memorable victory in the first Test, his overall returns—126 runs across six innings at an average of 30—have been underwhelming.  Kohli hit a century in the second innings of the Perth Test, which India won after being bowled for 150 in the first. He was removed for 7 and 11 in the second Test, which Australia won by 10 wickets to tie the series, and he scored 3 in the drawn third Test at Brisbane. The MCG, however, has been a happy hunting ground for Kohli. With 316 runs at an average of 52.66, including a sensational 169 in the 2014 Boxing Day Test, the venue holds fond memories for the Indian skipper. As the team eyes a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) finals, Kohli will aim to rediscover his form and make a match-winning contribution. Meanwhile, there was a brief injury scare for Shubman Gill, who had returned after missing the Perth Test due to a finger injury. Gill was struck on his right hand by a Mohammed Siraj delivery, momentarily halting his practice. However, after medical attention and reassurance from Siraj, Gill resumed batting and appeared in good spirits, much to the relief of Indian fans.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Tune InRead More |  Fakhar Zaman breaks silence on contract snub, clarifies controversial Babar tweet

Shami's absence will further mount the pressure on pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who has lacked the support from other bowlers. Will other bowlers finally step up in the remaining two Tests?",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-jasprit-bumrahs-workload-mohammed-shamis-injury-border-gavaskar-trophy-aus-vs-ind-2654376-2024-12-24,"The Indian team management received a massive setback as their star speedster Mohammed Shami failed to recover fully in time for the last two matches of the ongoing Test series against Australia. Notably, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) informed that Shami’s left knee has exhibited minor swelling due to increased joint loading from his bowling workload in domestic cricket. Hence, he has not been deemed fit for consideration for the remaining two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The news comes as a massive setback for the team management, who were eagerly waiting for Shami to regain his fitness and support pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in the remaining two Tests. Bumrah has been India’s lone warrior with the ball in the ongoing series with 21 wickets from three matches at an average of 10.90 with two five-wicket hauls to his name. However, despite his remarkable performance, India have struggled with the ball in the last two Tests, as Bumrah hasn’t got the support from the other bowlers.Indian bowling sans Bumrah: A major problem Bumrah’s new-ball partner, Mohammed Siraj, has looked off-colour in the last two matches, picking eight wickets across four innings, out of which four have been tailenders and one was Travis Head on 140. His stats have been completely contrasting from Perth when he registered figures of 5/71 in the match, out of which just one wicket was of the tailender. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Apart from Siraj, Akash Deep showed great heart in his first Test of the series in Brisbane. However, his first innings figures of 1/95 in 29.5 overs, don’t show how unlucky he was when the ball went past the outside edge of the batters more often than not. Akash finished the match with figures of 3/123 and failed to impress after replacing Harshit Rana in the playing XI. On the other hand, Rana made headlines on his Test debut as he registered figures of 3/48 in the first innings. The 23-year-old also got the prized scalp of India’s chief tormentor, Travis Head, with a peach of a delivery. However, Rana failed to continue with the same intensity in the second innings, leaking 69 runs in 13.4 overs. He further didn’t have a memorable game in Adelaide going wicket-less in 16 overs and giving away 86 runs. Apart from the trio, Nitish Kumar Reddy has served as the fourth seam option in the series. He has been promising as a batter, scoring crucial runs lower down the order, but hasn’t been that good with the ball, having taken three wickets at an average of 41 and a high economy of 4.55.Bumrah being pushed beyond his limits As a result, Bumrah has had to do much of the heavy lifting in the series with the captain Rohit Sharma bringing him on, every time the team has been in desperate need of a breakthrough. However, the heavy workload has taken a lot of toll on Bumrah’s body already as he’s played seven out of the last eight Tests in the ongoing season. Bumrah has bowled the second most number of overs amongst seamers in world cricket in the ongoing year (303.4) and has also bowled in the most number of innings (24). The Indian vice-captain has already played 12 Tests in the ongoing year, the most in his career so far, and also featured in the T20 World Cup 2024 where he bowled 29.4 overs collectively. Hence, with two more matches to go against Australia, Bumrah still has a lot of work left to do, and constant Indian batting collapses have meant that he hasn’t got enough rest between the innings. The speedster has already scripted history having become the most successful Asian fast bowler in Australia and has joined several legends in the list. However, he desperately seeks support from his teammates as with every Test, his body is pushing its limits, which could further invite more misery for India with the World Test Championship (WTC) final qualification on the line.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: What to expect from the MCG pitch for the Boxing Day Test

The two were seen attending an event honouring their childhood coach, Ramakant Achrekar. Observers were shocked by Kambli’s frail appearance and visibly poor health. Dr Vivek Trivedi, who is treating Kambli (52), said the Mumbai-based former India batter initially complained of urinary infection and cramps following which he was admitted to the hospital in the Kalher area of Bhiwandi town on Saturday. However, after a series of examinations, the medical team supervising him at Akruti Hospital found clots in his brain, according to PTI news agency.  Kambli's health was being constantly monitored with more medical examinations scheduled for Tuesday, December 24.  Several former cricketers, including ex-captains Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, have offered to help Vinod Kambli. Gavaskar, speaking to India Today, said the 1983 World Cup-winning team discussed Kambli's health struggles and that the entire group of players was willing to help the former left-handed batter. ""The 1983 team is very conscious of the younger players. For me, they are like grandsons. If you see their age, some are like sons. We are all very concerned, particularly when fortunes desert them. I don't like the word help. What the 83 team wants to do is take care of him.

Rajkot's Niranjan Shah Stadium witnessed a masterclass in explosive batting as India Women's rising star Navgire once again proved why she's becoming the go-to six-hitter for Indian cricket.  The right-handed batter dismantled Railways' bowlers with sheer power, including an unforgettable over in which she hit five sixes, leaving the opposition in disbelief. Out of her 64 runs, a staggering 8 were sixes, with only one boundary to her name. Her explosive knock not only showcased her prowess as a big-hitter but also bolstered her position as a key contender for a spot in the Indian Women's ODI World Cup squad.

— BCCI Domestic (@BCCIdomestic) December 24, 2024 Navgire's ability to dominate spin was on full display as she targeted Railways' bowlers, particularly Sneh Rana, whom she pummelled for 22 runs off 6 balls. She also struck two sixes off Anusha's over, adding 14 runs, and against left-arm spinner Preeti Bose, she smashed a six and added 19 runs in just 6 balls. However, despite Navgire's incredible knock, Maharashtra was all out for 254 in 48.4 overs, falling short of their 50-over target. Meghna Magre (54) and captain Patil (50) contributed well, but Maharashtra's batting depth was unable to withstand the pressure as they lost wickets in quick succession. Known for her remarkable six-hitting ability, Navgire has been a force to reckon with in domestic cricket and has also impressed during her time with the UP Warriorz in the Women's Premier League. As she continues to make her mark, she's becoming an increasingly important name in Indian women's cricket, and her performances are sure to have the selectors keeping a close eye on her ahead of the next Women's ODI World Cup. In the second quarterfinal, Mumbai's opener Vrushali Bhagat played an outstanding knock, scoring 134 runs off 124 balls against Delhi. While she didn't hit a single six, her bat was peppered with 21 boundaries. Bhagat's century helped Mumbai post a formidable total of 321 runs in their 50 overs, setting a challenging target for Delhi in the ongoing Senior Women's One-Day Trophy.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Read More |  Boxing Day Test: Virat Kohli looks rock solid in nets, urges fans not to make noise

Speaking to the Times of India, Ram Kishan Bhaker said that he regretted putting Manu in the sport of shooting. He hit out at the government and asked what more could have her daughter done to deserve recognition for her efforts. ""I regret putting her in the sport of shooting. I should have instead made her a cricketer. Then, all the awards and accolades would have come her way. She won two Olympic medals in a single edition, no one has ever done that.

A 12-member National Sports Day committee, headed by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice V Ramasubramam, did not recommend the shooter's name for the prestigious award. While the Sports Ministry reportedly claimed that Manu Bhaker did not apply for the award, Manu Bhaker's father Ram Kishan said that they applied for the honour and did not hear back from the committee. ""Manu said she had applied on the portal. If that was the case, then the committee must have considered her name. Whatever the situation, the federation has approached the ministry and requested the officials to include her name,"" the source said. Ram Kishan said that Manu was disheartened after the reports and claimed that she regretted going to the Olympics and winning medals for India. ""I spoke to Manu, and she was disheartened by all this. She told me 'I shouldn't have gone to the Olympics and won medals for the country. In fact, I shouldn't have become a sportsperson',"" Manu's father told TOI.

The Indian team, fresh from securing a gritty draw in the Brisbane Test, is gearing up for the high-stakes third match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Manu won two bronze medals in shooting at the Paris Olympics. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/shooting-manu-bhaker-khel-ratna-snub-coach-jaspal-rana-reaction-2654715-2024-12-24,"Decorated shooter and coach Jaspal Rana criticised the Sports Ministry, the Sports Authority of India, and the National Rifle Association of India after his protege, Manu Bhaker, was excluded from the list of nominees for the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award. Rana argued that it should not be the player’s responsibility to apply for such honours, emphasising that national sports bodies should ensure recognition for a double Olympic medallist. The controversy arose when it was revealed that Manu Bhaker’s name was missing from the initial list of Khel Ratna nominees, India’s highest sporting honour. The omission has sparked a debate, but sources from the Sports Ministry clarified that the final list of nominees has not yet been drafted. The list will only be released after approval from Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, based on recommendations from a 12-member committee chaired by retired Supreme Court judge Justice V Ramasubramanian. The ministry reportedly claimed that Manu Bhaker, who won two bronze medals at the Olympics, did not submit her nomination. However, Bhaker’s father, Ram Kishan, refuted this claim. Breaking her silence on Tuesday, Manu Bhaker acknowledged the possibility of an oversight on her part regarding the nomination process. ""I will hold all of them responsible. How can anyone even say Manu did not apply? She made history by becoming the first Indian to win two Olympic medals in the same Olympics. Her name should have been there automatically. Don't the people at the helm know who Manu Bhaker is and what are her credentials? This humiliation might just affect her progress,"" Rana told PTI news agency.WRONG PRECEDENT IS BEING SET: RANA Rana, the personal coach of Manu Bhaker, played a key role in helping the young shooter recover from the lows of Tokyo 2021 and become the first Indian athlete in independent India to win more than a medal in a single edition of the Games.  ""I can say that a wrong precedent is being set. Things like this can destroy an athlete's confidence."" ""What is their job otherwise? Isn't it to go through the performance of the athletes over the last cycle and then arrive at a conclusion and recommend the names. According to me this is not a mistake and this is not an oversight,"" Rana said. Rana also criticised the self-nomination process, pointing out that not all athletes are familiar with the rules and regulations. He stressed that sports federations and governing bodies should assist athletes in such matters. ""It's really appalling. Why should a top sportsperson apply or request for an award? Awards should come naturally and automatically. How can it be ignored? There has to be some system in place,"" Rana observed. ""Does every athlete know how to apply? Does it make sense that only an athlete can apply? Why not the federation, Sports Authority of India (or the) ministry,"" the coach asked. The ministry norms allow athletes to self-nominate instead of relying on federations and other institutions for it. The selection committee is, however, allowed to consider names which may not be among the applicants. Notably, Mohammed Shami was honoured with the Arjuna Award last year despite the Indian cricketer not applying for the award. Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

Supported by Jemimah Rodrigues, who contributed a brisk 42, Harleen accelerated the innings during the middle overs. Her confident footwork and precise timing helped her dismantle the West Indies bowling attack, as India posted a mammoth total, their highest-ever ODI score against the Caribbean side. Harleen’s century placed her in elite company, becoming only the fifth Indian No. 3 batter to score an ODI hundred for the national side, joining legends like Anjum Chopra and Mithali Raj. Her achievement is a testament to her growing stature in Indian cricket and her ability to step up when the team needed it most. Harleen was finally dismissed on 115, but had already done what was required by her team from her by that time.

If India don't reach the final, then the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore will host the title match. Pakistan will host 11 out of the 15 matches in the tournament.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-champions-trophy-schedule-format-final-options-reserve-days-hybrid-model-2654752-2024-12-24,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday, December 24, announced the complete schedule for the Champions Trophy 2025, which will be held across four venues in Pakistan and the UAE from February 19 to March 9. Pakistan have the hosting rights for the 50-over tournament, which returns to the cricket calendar for the first time since 2017, but India's games will be held in Dubai. Notably, after extensive deliberation, the ICC, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), and the Indian cricket board (BCCI) agreed upon a hybrid model. India's matches will be played in Dubai, while the rest of the tournament will take place across Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi in Pakistan. The final of the Champions Trophy is scheduled to be held at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, provided India do not qualify. If India reach the final of the eight-team tournament, the title match will instead be held in Dubai on 9 March. Full Schedule: Champions Trophy 2025 Additionally, India have been designated to play the first semi-final if they qualify for the last-four stage, while Pakistan are slotted to play in the second semi-final if they advance from the group stage. This arrangement ensures India play their semi-final in Dubai and Pakistan in front of their home crowd in Lahore. Regardless of India’s qualification, the first semi-final will be held in Dubai. IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE ASIA CUP HYBRID MODEL? The schedule for the hybrid model of the Champions Trophy is significantly different from the arrangement used for the Asia Cup 2023—a 50-over tournament also played under a hybrid model after India refused to travel to Pakistan. In the Asia Cup, the final was directly scheduled in Colombo, and there was no provision for two host cities. India reached the final and defeated Sri Lanka in the 2023 edition. Notably, only four matches were held in Pakistan, who had the hosting rights, while nine matches were hosted by Sri Lanka in the hybrid model. This time, Pakistan will host as many as 11 out of the 15 matches. If India qualify for the final, Pakistan will host 10 matches. WHAT ARE THE GROUPS FOR THE CHAMPIONS TROPHY 2025? Group A: Bangladesh, India, New Zealand, Pakistan
Group B: Afghanistan, Australia, England, South Africa ARE THERE RESERVE DAYS? Both semi-finals will have reserve days. The final will also include a reserve day, the ICC confirmed. WHY HYBRID MODEL? The hybrid model came into the scene after India decided not to travel to Pakistan, citing security reasons. The ICC ensured an agreeable solution was reached after months-long discussion with the two cricket boards.  The ICC, on December 19, confirmed that the Champions Trophy would be conducted in a hybrid model that will see India's matches in the eight-team event taking place at a neutral venue. In a statement released by the ICC, it confirmed: ""India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC Events during the 2024-2027 rights cycle will be played at a neutral venue"". This will mean that Pakistan will not travel to India for their matches during the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2025 and the T20 World Cup in 2026. Additionally, Pakistan were awarded the hosting rights for the Women's T20 World Cup in 2028. FULL SCHEDULE: ICC CHAMPIONS TROPHY 2025

The BCCI cited Shami's ongoing recovery from a knee injury as the primary reason behind the decision. As India gears up for the Boxing Day Test, starting December 26, many fans and former players had speculated about Shami’s potential inclusion to support Jasprit Bumrah in the bowling department. However, the BCCI and the National Cricket Academy (NCA) confirmed that Shami is not fully fit to rejoin the squad. In his recent YouTube video, Chopra emphasised that it was prudent not to rush Shami back into action after such a prolonged absence from international cricket. ""It's been confirmed that Shami is not going. An update has finally come from the NCA about Mohammed Shami. Rohit Sharma had also spoken about it that they need news from the NCA because those people are monitoring his fitness. So an update has come from there that they have been following his progress and seeing his workload and that they are not convinced yet,"" Chopra said. ""The verdict that has come from there is Mohammed Shami is not ready to become a part of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, and you can't grudge that either. You and I read the scorecard. There he bowled and took wickets, so we assumed that he would be fine. However, it's a Test match after 13 months,"" he added. While domestic hero Tanush Kotian was given a nod, Shami was initially omitted from the 18-man Border-Gavaskar Trophy squad due to a knee injury that surfaced following his recovery from a heel injury. The latter had sidelined him for nearly a year. The BCCI medical team has been closely monitoring the senior pacer’s fitness, with his progress evaluated through domestic matches. Shami hasn’t played any form of international cricket since India's ODI World Cup final against Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Despite his absence, India’s bowling unit, led by Jasprit Bumrah, has managed to hold its own in the series. The BCCI further clarified that Shami’s participation in domestic cricket, including the Vijay Hazare Trophy, remains subject to his fitness. He was rested for Bengal’s opening match against Delhi, and his workload continues to be assessed by the NCA medical team. While Shami’s absence leaves a void in India’s pace attack, the decision underscores the BCCI’s commitment to managing player workload and ensuring long-term fitness, especially with key international tournaments looming on the horizon.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also Read |  Boxing Day Test: Virat Kohli looks rock solid in nets, urges fans not to make noise

Singh, who made history by clinching gold in the Men’s Individual Recurve Open at the Paris Paralympics, expressed disappointment over the disparity in honoring achievements from the Paralympics compared to the Olympics. Singh highlighted how all gold medallists from the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, including Avani Lekhara, Sumit Antil, and Pramod Bhagat, were awarded the Khel Ratna in 2021. However, the same level of recognition has not been extended to Paris Paralympians despite their historic achievements. Singh’s flawless performance in Paris, where he defeated Poland's Lukasz Ciszek with a commanding 6-0 scoreline in the final, made him the first Indian para-archer to win gold at the Paralympics.

Same Competition, Same Gold, same pride, why not same award?"" Harvinder wrote on his post. Adding to the controversy, Paris Olympics double-bronze medallist Manu Bhaker’s exclusion from the Khel Ratna nominations has raised eyebrows. Bhaker, who scripted history with her performances in shooting at the Paris Olympics, has been overlooked by the National Sports Awards selection committee. Instead, other Paris Olympics achievers, like bronze-winning shooters Swapnil Kusale and Sarabjot Singh, and wrestler Aman Sehrawat, have been recommended for the Arjuna Award, which is considered a step below the Khel Ratna. While Singh and others voiced concerns over these omissions, the nominations for Indian men’s hockey team captain Harmanpreet Singh and para-athlete Praveen Kumar have been welcomed. Yet, these announcements have done little to quell the ongoing debate about fairness in recognizing sporting achievements across disciplines and platforms. The disparity has sparked a broader conversation about equal recognition for Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Singh’s criticisms, along with the controversy surrounding Bhaker and others, have highlighted the need for greater inclusivity and fairness in the selection process for India’s highest sporting honours. The absence of Paris Paralympics stars from the Khel Ratna list is a glaring oversight that has put the spotlight on the award's selection criteria.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also Read |  Should have made Manu Bhaker a cricketer, not shooter: Father on Khel Ratna snub

Uncapped all-rounder Corbin Bosch will be getting his maiden Test cap, a decision influenced by the team’s injury concerns in the pace department. The two-match series holds significant importance as its outcomes will play a major role in determining the finalists of the 2023-25 ICC World Test Championship. Corbin Bosch, son of former Test cricketer Tertius Bosch, has edged out fellow uncapped pacer Kwena Maphaka to secure his place in the XI. Bosch showcased his abilities in a recent match against the England Lions, delivering an impressive spell of 1/21 in five overs for the South African Invitational XI.Corbin Bosch makes debut The 30-year-old has been a consistent performer in domestic cricket, featuring in 34 first-class games and accumulating 1,295 runs at an average of 40.46. He has ten half-centuries to his name and has also contributed with the ball, making him a valuable all-round addition to the squad. South Africa’s pace options have been severely impacted by injuries. Gerald Coetzee (groin), Nandre Burger (lower back stress fracture), Lizaad Williams (knee), and Lungi Ngidi (hip) have all been ruled out until early next year. Despite these setbacks, the Proteas had opted not to include a spinner in their XI, leaving senior spinner Keshav Maharaj out of the side. Bosch would join forces with frontline pacers Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen, and Dane Paterson to lead South Africa’s bowling attack. The Proteas have retained the same batting lineup from their last Test series against Sri Lanka. The top seven includes Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma, David Bedingham, and Kyle Verreynne. This stable batting core will be expected to anchor the team’s performance in the series. The series kicks off at Centurion on December 26, with the second Test scheduled for January 3. Both matches are pivotal in the ongoing WTC cycle, as South Africa and Pakistan aim to improve their standings and keep their hopes alive for a spot in the final.South Africa's Playing XI for 1st Test against Pakistan: Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne, Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada, Dane Paterson, and Corbin Bosch.South Africa's Playing XI for 1st Test Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne, Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada, Dane Paterson, and Corbin Bosch.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also Read |  Christmas 2024: Santa Claus is on his way with gifts.

Ahead of their Boxing Day clash against Fulham on December 26, Maresca expressed satisfaction with Chelsea’s overall progress but reiterated that they are not yet ready to challenge leaders Liverpool, who hold a four-point lead at the top. Maresca’s tenure at Chelsea has been a tale of two halves. When he arrived, the team struggled to find form and languished in the bottom half of the table. However, an inspired turnaround saw the Blues surge up the standings with 10 wins in their last 17 matches, collecting 35 points in the process. Despite this resurgence, Maresca remains realistic about their title prospects, noting the consistency and dominance of Liverpool as a benchmark Chelsea is still working towards. ""We are ahead of our expectation in terms of the way we are playing and points. For us, the main focus is to see how we can improve the players and how we can improve the team,"" Maresca told reporters. ""It's the reality for me, not about the pressure (of going for the title). I would like that kind of pressure. I say we are not there because that is the reality for me. The main point is to continue to improve and to win games,"" he added.

With seven of the top 10 teams in action on the same day, Chelsea’s match against Fulham offers a critical opportunity to close the gap on Liverpool. Meanwhile, the league leaders will take on Leicester City later in the evening, looking to extend their lead at the summit. Maresca has emphasised the importance of consistency and team cohesion as Chelsea prepares to face Fulham. Fulham, currently mid-table, will pose a stern test, but Chelsea’s recent form and tactical adaptability under Maresca provide optimism. While the title may seem out of reach for now, Chelsea’s transformation under Maresca is undeniable. The Boxing Day fixture will not only test their mettle but also provide insight into how close they are to truly challenging for domestic supremacy. For now, Chelsea is building, not sprinting toward the crown.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also Read |  Manchester United boss Amorim questions Rashford camp over new challenge comments

Rohidas, who has been signed by Tamil Nadu Dragons for Rs 48 lakhs, highlighted the league’s potential to provide a crucial platform for young talents to showcase their skills and gain invaluable experience. The return of the HIL is being seen as a significant development for Indian hockey. Rohidas pointed to his own journey, recalling how the league had a transformative impact on his career. After making his debut for the Indian national team in 2013, he faced a setback when he was dropped in 2014. However, his participation in the HIL turned the tide in his favor. Representing the Kalinga Lancers in the 2017 season, Rohidas played a key role in their title-winning campaign, which eventually paved the way for his return to the national team later that year. ""From 2013 to 2017, HIL was a great experience. Going from the juniors to the seniors' side was a great experience. Making a comeback after 7 years, I want to thank Hockey India League. This will give a lot of young players a chance to play with national team seniors and foreigners. It's a great opportunity, especially for youngsters, to showcase their talents. This is an opportunity for them to make a place for themselves, that will help them get a chance in the junior core group, specially with the junior World Cup coming up,"" he said. The league, which is set to resume with the men’s edition starting on December 28 in Rourkela and the women’s edition beginning on January 12 in Ranchi, has a history of fostering grassroots talent. It offers players exposure to high-stakes competition alongside seasoned national and international stars. Such experiences often prove vital in bridging the gap between domestic and international hockey. Rohidas’ career resurgence serves as an example of the HIL’s impact. Playing alongside top-tier players in the league allowed him to sharpen his defensive skills, improve his game awareness, and regain his confidence. Since then, he has become a cornerstone of India’s defensive lineup, contributing significantly to the team’s success, including their historic Olympic bronze medal in Tokyo. ""The journey was tough. Everyone has a tough journey, no one has it easy. Playing in the junior setup since 2009, and then moving forward was a big journey. Not getting picked for the senior team in the 2014 HIL was a big shock for me. I was out for three years, but my mindset was clear to perform in HIL and earn my way back. I continued on my fitness training and then finally got a comeback in 2017. That was a big moment. Then I got a test match straight to Europe, along with 8–9 others, and we all performed well. It taught me the value of fitness, which is the most crucial for playing for a long run,"" he said. The league’s focus on grassroots development and nurturing homegrown talent is expected to strengthen the pipeline for the national team. For aspiring players, it provides a rare chance to compete at a higher level, learn from experienced professionals, and make their mark on the hockey landscape. ""My mindset is simple, perform good in this HIL and then move forward. This has been my mindset for every tournament I play and that will remain the same for this Hockey India League,"" he added. As the countdown begins for HIL’s revival, players and fans alike are optimistic about its potential to reinvigorate Indian hockey and produce the next generation of stars. For veterans like Amit Rohidas, the league remains a testament to the opportunities it can create for players to rise to the occasion.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 24, 2024Also Read |  Paralympics gold-medalist Harvinder Singh adds to burning Khel Ratna controversy

Kambli (52) is responding to the treatment for urinary tract infections for which he was admitted at Akruti Hospital near Bhiwandi town on Saturday (December 21), Dr Vivek Trivedi told PTI.

Trivedi is heading the medical team that is supervising the former cricketer's health.

Doctors were planning to do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on the former India batter, but since he has developed a fever, a decision on the non-invasive medical procedure will be taken later, he said.

The MRI procedure has been necessitated after a series of medical examinations conducted earlier revealed clots in his brain, Trivedi said.

Kambli is likely to be shifted out of the ICU within a day or two and discharged after about four days, he said.

He said the condition of the Mumbai-based former cricketer was critical four days back when he had an extreme urinary infection as puss had got collected in his bladder. The puss was removed when he was admitted to the hospital.

Remaining at home for some more days would have complicated his condition, Trivedi opined, adding his blood pressure was also fluctuating when he was brought to the hospital.

His condition was stable at present, the doctor added.

""His condition will be closely monitored for the next 24 hours and a decision taken on shifting him out of the ICU,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and the Shrikant Shinde Foundation, run by his MP-son, have stepped forward to assist Kambli.

On the instructions of Eknath Shinde, his Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Mangesh Chiwte visited the hospital to enquire about the former cricketer's health condition, said an official release issued by the deputy CM's office in Thane on Tuesday night.

Chiwte also engaged with the hospital's medical staff to ensure Kambli receives the best possible care during his treatment.

Kalyan Lok Sabha MP Shrikant Shinde, the son of Eknath Shinde, announced a financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh for Kambli. The assistance will be provided through the Dr Shrikant Shinde Foundation next week, the release said.

Additionally, Shrikant Shinde has assured Kambli and his family of further support in the days to come, according to OSD Chiwte.

Kambli expressed heartfelt gratitude to the state's sensitive leadership, particularly Eknath Shinde, who is an MLA from Thane district, and Shrikant Shinde, for their support and concern for him. The former cricketer also expressed a desire to personally meet the Deputy CM to thank him for the support extended during his time of need, said the release.

As the crucial fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy looms, India faces the challenge of addressing their bowling concerns despite Jasprit Bumrah’s outstanding form. Bumrah has been the standout performer, claiming 21 wickets at an astonishing average of 10.90. However, the rest of the bowling attack has struggled to offer consistent support. Pujara, speaking to ESPNcricinfo, emphasised that, alongside Bumrah, India should consider bringing in Harshit Rana or Prasidh Krishna to bolster the pace unit, complementing the existing options of Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""I think the bowling lineup is something which India needs to work on. I feel that Bumbrah, Siraj and Akash Deep, they are doing a good job. Jadeja and Nitish both have contributed well with the bat, but we are lacking one bowler and India will have to add another bowler if possible and maybe try and reduce a batter. I don't know. I'm unable to find the right 11 at the moment because I don't see a lot of changes going into the next Test match,"" he said. The team’s spin department has also come under scrutiny following Ravichandran Ashwin’s shock retirement after the Brisbane Test. Currently, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar lead the spin attack, but the pace-friendly conditions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground may limit their impact. While the inclusion of domestic talent Tanush Kotian adds depth to the squad, his role in Melbourne appears uncertain. Nitish Kumar Reddy, a part-time fifth bowler and in-form batter, alongside Jadeja, provides a safety net with the bat, making the decision to include an extra pacer a complicated one. Pujara acknowledged this dilemma, suggesting that India must weigh the balance between maintaining their batting strength and addressing their bowling vulnerabilities. India’s skipper Rohit Sharma and head coach Gautam Gambhir now face a critical decision. Should they rely on their current form players like Nitish Reddy and Jadeja, or take the risk of experimenting with a new combination by adding a pacer? The outcome of this call could prove decisive as India looks to gain an upper hand in the series. With a place in the World Test Championship Final at stake, the Boxing Day Test will be pivotal. The strategy adopted for this match might not only determine the result in Melbourne but also shape India’s journey in this high-stakes series.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  Travis Head treated Jasprit Bumrah like any regular bowler: Greg Chapell

While both Kohli and Smith have scored a century each in the ongoing series, they have struggled to maintain consistency across the three matches. The Indian maestro showcased his brilliance with a century in the second innings at Perth but faltered in the subsequent three innings, repeatedly falling to the same error—chasing deliveries outside the off-stump and getting caught behind. Shastri noted that while Williamson and Root have enjoyed a stellar run in 2024, with six and four Test centuries respectively, Kohli and Smith have managed just one each, both in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Shastri believes this inconsistency, coupled with competition from emerging players like Harry Brook, has momentarily pushed Kohli and Smith down the Fab Four hierarchy. Acknowledging the struggles, Shastri emphasised the hunger and resilience that make players like Kohli and Smith so dangerous. He pointed out that these champions thrive under pressure and often bounce back stronger when their form is questioned. ""I think they (Kohli and Smith) will have slipped down the ranks on current form because you know you've got the likes of Root taking off, there's Williamson doing well, Harry Brook has come onto the scene, you know there are a lot of other young players pushing but these are class players. In a situation like this, you know they'll be dangerous because they'll be hungry,"" Shastri said, stressing the mental strength required to succeed in Test cricket.  Using Smith as an example, Shastri lauded his patience and discipline in grinding out runs despite challenging conditions. Smith's willingness to wait for opportunities has helped him maintain his status as one of the best. ""What's needed you saw from Smith. It might have been a struggle early on but he was prepared to play the waiting game and be disciplined,"" Shastri noted. For Kohli, Shastri highlighted the importance of applying discipline early in his innings. The Indian superstar has struggled against deliveries outside the off-stump, often falling to the same mistake of edging behind. However, Shastri remains confident that Kohli is not out of form and can turn things around with focused effort. ""I think the same with Virat,"" Shastri added. ""If Virat gets over that first 30, 40 minutes, with serious application and discipline, I don't think he's (out of form), none of these guys are out of form.""

Cummins, who burst onto the scene at just 18 with a stunning 6 for 78 against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2011, knows better than most the unique pressures and opportunities a teenage debutant faces. Speaking ahead of the pivotal Border-Gavaskar Trophy match, Cummins revealed the a hilarious 'selectors' advice he shared with his fellow New South Welshman. ""I think you always want to do well (but) I was saying this to Sam the other day, I remember that as an 18-year-old, I was thinking I got a lot more leeway because I was young,"" Cummins said on Christmas Day. ""It almost felt like if I didn't have a great game, it wasn't my fault. It was the selectors' fault for picking me. I was like, 'Well, they're the idiots who picked an 18-year-old.' ""You're so young starting out your career (and) it's Boxing Day. It doesn't get any better than this, so just enjoy the moment."" ""Sammy just needs to go out and play like he's in the backyard,"" Cummins said. ""There's a level of naivety that can work in your favor. When I debuted, I didn't overthink things-I just saw the ball and tried to hit it. I remember taking on Dale Steyn, trying to hit him over his head. At the time, it felt completely logical, but looking back, I think, 'What was I doing?'"" Konstas will face India's Jasprit Bumrah, one of the most formidable bowlers in the world, on what is arguably the biggest stage in cricket—the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. Cummins believes the scale of the occasion could be liberating rather than daunting for the 19-year-old. ""I told him, 'You're young, so people cut you a bit more slack. If things don't go perfectly, it's not your fault-it's the selectors' fault for picking you,'"" Cummins said with a grin. ""But seriously, it's a once-in-a-lifetime moment. Just enjoy it and play with freedom."" Reflecting on the similarities between his debut and Konstas's upcoming challenge, Cummins highlighted the benefits of youthful inexperience. ""There's so much value in just playing the game without overcomplicating things. While experienced players like Usman [Khawaja] bring wisdom to the team, there's also a freshness in seeing the ball, hitting the ball, and not worrying about what comes next."" The match will also see Scott Boland return to the XI, replacing the injured Josh Hazlewood. Known as a specialist at the MCG, Boland's inclusion was widely expected, and Cummins expressed confidence in his ability to shine once again. ""He's a world-class bowler, especially here at the MCG, and we know he'll deliver."" In keeping with the festive spirit, the Australian team spent Christmas morning with their families on the hallowed turf of the MCG before a training session. Children ran around the ground, some even joining in for a hit, while Cummins lightened the mood by bowling leg breaks in the nets. ""It was chaos out there, but it's all part of the tradition,"" Cummins said with a laugh.AUSTRALIA PLAYING 11 FOR BOXING DAY TEST Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott BolandPublished By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Read More |  AUS vs IND: Australia make Travis Head call, announce playing XI for Boxing Day Test

In a big boost to their hopes of dominating the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, Head was passed fit after concerns over his groin injury.  Travis Head picked up an injury during the third Test in Brisbane and the superstar batter conceded that he had been feeling gingerly about his quad. He participated in a running fitness test and net session on Christmas Day, with captain Pat Cummins confirming his availability. ""Trav (Head) is good to go, he'll play. He just kicked off some final things today and yesterday. But no worries about injury with Trav. He'll go into the game fully fit,"" Cummins said during his interaction with the press on Wednesday morning. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Cummins also confirmed that Head will be ready to go full throttle on the field, but Australia will be keen on managing him while fielding.  ""I don't think you'll see too much management of him throughout the game. He just kind of plays as is. Maybe around fielding, if he's a bit uncomfortable, we will (manage him), but he's fully fit,"" he added.  Travis Head has been Australia's main man with the bat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. With a hundred each in Adelaide and Brisbane Tests, Head has punished Indian bowlers, denying advantage to the touring team.  Meanwhile, Mitchell Marsh was also confirmed in the playing XI with the Australian team management backing the all-rounder once again. Despite poor outings and speculation of an injury, Australia have picked the senior all-rounder despite the presence of Beau Webster in the side. AUSTRALIA PLAYING 11 FOR BOXING DAY TEST Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland. As expected, Australia made two changes, including a forced one, to their XI, bringing back Scott Boland to replace injured Josh Hazlewood.  19-year-old Sam Konstas is set to become the youngest-ever Australian opener when he makes his debut on Thursday.  Konstas will replace Nathan McSweeney, who was dropped after just three Tests. Konstas will become the youngest debutant for Australia in Tests since 18-year-old Pat Cummins in 2011.  Australia are hoping Konstas and senior campaigner Usman Khawaja deliver a solid opening stand for them in the Boxing Day Test. Australia hope to inject aggressive intent at the top of the order by including the teenager. Konstas enters the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with an impressive record across formats. In December 2024, Konstas debuted for the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League. Opening alongside David Warner, he smashed a blistering 57 off 26 balls, marking the fastest half-century in Sydney Thunder’s history. His innings included eight boundaries and two sixes, playing a key role in the team’s victory over the Adelaide Strikers. Konstas also featured for the Prime Minister’s XI in a pink-ball warm-up match against India at Manuka Oval. He scored an outstanding 107 off 97 balls, including 14 fours and a six, against a formidable Indian bowling attack featuring Mohammed Siraj and Ravindra Jadeja. This performance further solidified his reputation as a rising star in Australian cricket. In October-November 2024, Konstas was selected for Australia A in their series against India A. In the second unofficial Test, he played a crucial role with an unbeaten 73 in the second innings, helping secure a victory for his team.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 25, 2024

From Virat Kohli to Ravindra Jadeja, Indian players were targeted by a section of the Australian media, who are known for making it difficult for touring sides. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-australia-12th-man-media-controversies-boxing-day-test-2655046-2024-12-25,"The Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground is one of cricket’s most iconic fixtures, steeped in tradition and history. As expected, the tickets for one of the biggest fixtures of the Australian summer have been sold out. Packed stands with close to 90,000 people are expected on Boxing Day, highlighting the hype for the fixture between Australia and India. However, the build-up to the potential blockbuster has been overshadowed by off-field controversies. The off-field battle led by the Australian media has added an unnecessary edge, targeting Indian players with baseless criticisms and unwarranted scrutiny.THE EASY TARGET? Indian cricket star Virat Kohli became the focus of controversy when an incident at the Melbourne airport was sensationalised by sections of the Australian media. Kohli, who had landed with his wife Anushka Sharma and their children, confronted a journalist from Channel 7 who had captured video footage of his family. Concerned about privacy, Kohli requested the journalist delete images or footage of his family but allowed her to keep content featuring him alone. Under Australian law, photographing celebrities in public spaces is legal, which likely complicated the situation. Despite Kohli’s polite but firm request, a section of the media reported it as a heated confrontation. Later, it became evident that the matter was a minor misunderstanding, but the damage was done. Kohli’s legitimate concerns as a father were overshadowed by sensational headlines.RAVINDRA JADEJA CRITICISM Shortly after the Kohli incident, Ravindra Jadeja found himself in the media’s crosshairs. Following India’s first practice session at the MCG, Jadeja addressed the press primarily in Hindi. This sparked frustration amongst some Australian journalists, who accused Jadeja of refusing to answer questions in English. An Indian team media manager explained that the press conference was primarily arranged for the Indian media. However, the clarification didn’t sit well with one Australian journalist, who lashed out at the media manager, calling the arrangement ""hopeless."" Indian journalists present noted that many of their own questions went unanswered due to time constraints, but they refrained from creating a scene. ""I was present there, and many Indian touring journalists didn't get the opportunity to ask questions due to time constraints. However, after the press conference ended, a few Australian journalists got annoyed and argued with the Indian team's media manager. They misbehaved as well, which was uncalled for. I cover press conferences regularly, and even during Australian press conferences, many Indian journalists don't get the chance to ask questions due to time shortages, but we have never argued or misbehaved,"" one of the Indian reporters told India Today. WHA T THE PUNDITS SAID Former England captain Michael Vaughan offered a colourful perspective on the drama. Speaking on the Club Prairie Podcast, he said, “India are a powerhouse. They clearly feel that the cameras at the airport, filming families, is just a step too far. This adds more intrigue. If Jadeja isn’t willing to speak in English, there are AI systems to translate Hindi to English. It might not be the same, but it will be funny.” Vaughan acknowledged the Indian team’s media manager’s firm approach, quipping, “I like the press officer from the Indian side. He’s a guy who just tells them ‘go away’ with hand gestures.” For Vaughan, the media skirmishes only added spice to an already dramatic series. Simon Katich, speaking to Channel 7, took a more critical stance: “There’s been a few things unfolding in the last week that haven’t gone down well at that camp. It’s probably just the mind games being played, given the enormity of this series.” Katich dismissed the Indian team’s concerns, adding, “The media are here to promote the game, and I don’t know what the Indians are thinking at the moment. That’s their problem.”ALL PART OF THE PLAN? The timing of these media narratives is curious. Australia entered the series with a clear plan: dominate at venues like Perth, Adelaide (under lights), and Brisbane --- grounds specifically chosen to exploit their strengths and India’s perceived weaknesses. The expectation was a commanding 3-0 lead by now. Instead, the series is tantalisingly poised at 1-1, with India showing remarkable resilience and adaptability. With the Boxing Day Test now carrying significant weight, one can’t help but wonder: is the media’s relentless scrutiny an orchestrated ploy to rattle the Indian camp? After all, while the headlines swirl with controversy, the Australian players themselves have been notably quiet, focused solely on the task at hand. Unlike their media counterparts, the Australian team under Pat Cummins has been measured and respectful in their approach. Cummins’ men seem to understand that winning the mental battle is as much about composure as it is about aggression. India, too, appear unperturbed, with their players focusing on cricket rather than the noise surrounding it. The Australian media’s role as an unofficial 12th man is neither new nor surprising. For decades, they have been an active participant in shaping the psychological landscape of cricket series, particularly against teams touring Down Under. While their tactics may create momentary distractions, the true battle will always be fought on the pitch. As the Boxing Day Test approaches, one hopes the focus shifts back to the game itself. For now, it remains to be seen whether this latest media blitzkrieg will have any bearing on the series. What’s clear, however, is that both teams are well aware of the stakes and they’re ready to let their cricket do the talking.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 25, 2024

His consistent form and past heroics in these iconic matches make him India's key player in the 4th Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy series.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/kl-rahul-chases-boxing-day-test-special-hat-trick-ahead-of-mcg-contest-2654983-2024-12-25,"Star Indian wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul is on the verge of creating history as the Indian team gears up for the fourth Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25 at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. Renowned for his performances in Boxing Day Tests, Rahul stands on the cusp of achieving a rare feat never achieved by any Indian batter. While the ongoing series against Australia has tested many Indian batters, Rahul has been one of the bright spots. The 32-year-old is currently the second-highest run-scorer in the five-match series, amassing 235 runs at an impressive average of 47.00. His form and temperament have made him a key player for India, particularly in challenging overseas conditions. These iconic matches, beginning on December 26, hold a special place in Rahul's career. He has already scored two centuries in his last two Boxing Day appearances, both against South Africa. The first came in 2021 at Centurion, where he scored a magnificent 123 runs, leading India to a memorable victory. He repeated the feat in 2023, registering another hundred (101) against the Proteas.History awaits Rahul If Rahul manages to score another century in Melbourne, he will become the first Indian batter to score three consecutive centuries in Boxing Day Tests. This achievement would place him in a league of his own, surpassing cricketing legends like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, and Ajinkya Rahane, each of whom has two Boxing Day centuries. Rahul's journey in Boxing Day Tests began in 2014 when he made his Test debut against Australia at the MCG. It was a challenging start. He managed only three and one runs in his two innings. However, the experience laid the foundation for his growth into one of India's most reliable batters. Rahul's breakthrough came in the following Test at Sydney, where he scored his maiden international century. Since then, he has established himself as a dependable performer for India in crucial matches, particularly overseas. The MCG holds both bittersweet memories and great potential for Rahul. Having faced initial struggles at this venue, he now has the opportunity to rewrite history. A third consecutive Boxing Day century would not only cement his place in the record books but also reinforce his reputation as a big-match player.Can Rahul hit a hat-trick of hundreds? Rahul's performances in the Boxing Day Tests exemplify his ability to adapt and thrive under pressure. His technique and ability to play both pace and spin with equal ease make him a vital cog in the Indian batting lineup. As India prepares for the Melbourne Test, the spotlight will undoubtedly be on Rahul.

Expressing his relief, Cummins remarked that he was glad to have Head in the Australian lineup rather than facing him as an opponent. Head's fitness had been a topic of speculation following visible discomfort during the second innings of the Brisbane Test and his absence from the field on the final day. Head currently leads the scoring charts in the ongoing Border Gavaskar Trophy, having amassed 409 runs in five innings at an average of 81.80, including two centuries. ""Travis is good to go. So he'll play. He just ticked off some final things today and yesterday, but yeah, no stress, no kind of worries about injury,"" Cummins assured reporters. ""He'll go into the game fully fit. I don't think you'll see too much management of him throughout the game."" Cummins did note that while Head is fit to bat, there might be some adjustments regarding his fielding if discomfort arises. ""Maybe around [his] fielding, if he's a bit uncomfortable, we will look at that,"" he added. Cummins praised Head's consistency and ability to shift pressure onto the opposition, describing his current form as one of the best he's ever seen. ""It feels like the last 12 months, he's been in this unbelievable vein of form, and he just keeps going on with it,"" said Cummins. ""He's hitting the ball really cleanly. You can see the pressure that he shifts back onto the opposition, literally from the first ball that he walks out there."" After experiencing tightness in his quadriceps following the heavy workload in Brisbane, Head spent recent days preparing at the MCG. He skipped a non-compulsory training session earlier in the week but has been active in the nets since. On Christmas morning, he was seen conducting sprints and batting practice, even as some observers speculated about lingering discomfort. ""I keep saying I'm loving that he's in our team and [that I] don't have to try and set a field and bowl to him,"" he said. ""He's hitting the ball as well as I've ever, ever seen anyone. Long may it continue."" Head's blistering form has been pivotal for Australia, and his presence is expected to bolster their batting lineup as they face India in the highly anticipated Boxing Day Test.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Read More |  Virat Kohli, Smith have slipped down: Shastri hopes 'hungry' duo will bounce back

Pakistan will host an ICC event after 28 years, with the last global tournament held here being the 1996 World Cup. ""As a cricket-loving country, we are all very excited to host the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. It is a great occasion as Pakistan welcomes the first ICC event to its shores in 28 years, especially as we are the defending champions,"" Rizwan said in a PCB media release. ""We eagerly look forward to playing in front of our home crowd,"" he added. The eight-team tournament will feature 15 matches, played across Pakistan and Dubai. In Pakistan, Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Karachi will serve as the three venues hosting tournament matches. Each venue in Pakistan will host three group games, with Lahore also hosting the second semi-final. Lahore is set to host the final on March 9, unless India qualifies, in which case the final will be held in Dubai. Both semi-finals and the final will have reserve days. The three group matches involving India, along with the first semi-final, will be played in Dubai. The Dubai leg of the tournament begins the following day, with India taking on Bangladesh. Naqvi expressed his delight at Pakistan hosting a part of the tournament under the hybrid system. ""We are pleased that an agreement has been reached based on the principles of equality and respect, showcasing the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that defines our sport,"" Naqvi stated in the release. The tournament opener will take place in Karachi on February 19, with Pakistan facing New Zealand, and the final is scheduled for March 9. Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Karachi will serve as the three hosting venues in Pakistan. ""Hosting the Champions Trophy is a significant milestone for Pakistan, highlighting our commitment to promoting cricket at the highest level and showcasing our capabilities as a premier event organiser,"" Naqvi noted. ""We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the ICC members who played a constructive role in helping us achieve a mutually beneficial solution.""

United will visit Wolverhampton Wanderers on Boxing Day, aiming to bounce back from two consecutive defeats. Amorim has overseen six Premier League matches since taking over as Manchester United manager, managing just two wins alongside three losses and a draw. This inconsistency left United in 13th place on Christmas Day—their lowest position at this point of the season since 1986. A dramatic comeback victory against rivals Manchester City was overshadowed by consecutive defeats-a 3-0 loss to Bournemouth in the league and a 4-3 exit to Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals.PREMIER LEAGUE: BOXING DAY PREVIEW Marcus Rashford's absence from United's last three games has intensified scrutiny. Rashford, now 27, hinted at a possible departure, stating he was ""ready for a new challenge"" in a recent interview. Amorim, however, made it clear that his stance remained unchanged. ""Some guys have a big responsibility here because they have been here for a long time,"" Amorim said, emphasising the need for key players like Rashford to step up. ""If you have big talent, we need big performance, big responsibility, big engagement to push everybody forward in this moment."" Acknowledging the gravity of United's situation, Amorim described the current period as ""one of the lowest moments in our club."" Yet, he remains confident in his ability to guide the team through these challenges. ""I know what I am going to do. That is so clear for me,"" Amorim told reporters. ""I will not say I am feeling relaxed because I am really frustrated. It is a very difficult moment, but we will solve problems step by step and find answers for everything."" Looking ahead to the Boxing Day clash with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Amorim stressed the importance of securing a win to lift the spirits. ""I just want to win. I don't care about Christmas. I'm just focused on what we need to do for the next match,"" he said. The Portuguese manager also confirmed ongoing injury issues, with Matthijs de Ligt and Victor Lindelof remaining sidelined. Amorim emphasised the need to manage player workloads carefully to avoid further setbacks. Despite the immediate struggles, Amorim reaffirmed his commitment to a long-term rebuild at United. ""We are trying to address everything. I know there is a long-term project, and we are focused on that. If we have injuries, it's a big problem,"" he admitted.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Read More |  Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca says Chelsea' not part of Premier League title race'Must Watch

The Melbourne Cricket Ground has been the fast bowler's favourite hunting ground. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-jasprit-bumrah-malcolm-marshall-ravi-shastri-melbourne-2655083-2024-12-25,"Former India head coach Ravi Shastri heaped praise on Jasprit Bumrah's ability to quickly read an opposition batter's strengths and weaknesses as well as the playing conditions, likening the fast bowler to the legendary Malcolm Marshall. Bumrah has been leading India's charge in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, breaking records at will in Australia. Bumrah has taken 21 wickets in three Tests at a staggering average of 10.90. No other bowler in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has managed to claim more than 15 wickets so far after three Tests. The Indian pace-bowling spearhead has been head and shoulders above the rest with his remarkable ability to adapt to the conditions in Australia. Bumrah also stood in for Rohit Sharma in the series opener, leading the team to a commanding 295-run victory in Perth. “He’s a terrific reader of the game when it comes to batsmen. I thought when I played the best bowler I played against was Malcolm Marshall, because of his ability to suss out conditions, read batsmen’s strengths and weaknesses. I think Bumrah is in that category. He’s so quick to suss the strengths and weaknesses of a player,"" Ravi Shastri told Fox Cricket.  Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “He’s taken close to 200 wickets and close to a hundred in India, and he’s taken those at 17. In India, you must realise the ball starts reversing, because of the rough conditions. So if he doesn’t take wickets with the new ball, he’s dangerous at the end.” Bumrah, with 53 wickets, is already the leading wicket-taker for India in Australia in Test cricket, going past Kapil Dev's tally of 51 in the third Test in Brisbane. The Indian fast bowler needs one more wicket to become the most successful in the country at Melbourne Cricket Ground in Tests. With 15 wickets, he is currently tied with Anil Kumble.  Bumrah will be key to India's success in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. With Mohammed Shami ruled out, Bumrah will hope for better support from fellow pacers, including Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep.HE IS ABSOLUTELY RELENTLESS: SHASTRI  Meanwhile, Ravi Shastri said he expects a baptism by fire for teenage opener Sam Konstas, who is all set to make his Test debut in Melbourne on Thursday.  Bumrah made life difficult for Nathan McSweeney, who was dropped after the first three Tests of the series.  ""Bumrah is up for the challenge, he loves bowling at the MCG. I remember his six-wicket haul when I was a coach when he just dismantled Australia,"" Shastri said.  “He’s in that kind of form, he just takes wickets for fun in Australia. It’s ridiculous. There’s no respite because he’s at the peak of his powers and what he does with the new ball makes it difficult for any batsmen. He swings it and seams it both ways, he’s absolutely relentless,"" he added.  With the series tied at 1-1, both India and Australia will be keen on landing the first punch when they meet in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.

With table-toppers Liverpool, second-placed Chelsea, and a rejuvenated Manchester United among the teams in action, fans can expect a day of intense drama and high-quality football. Adding to the intrigue are Aston Villa, the resurgent Nottingham Forest, and Pep Guardiola's faltering Manchester City, all eager to make a statement. Here’s why the Boxing Day fixtures could prove decisive.advertisementA Decisive Premier League Boxing DayThe Race to the TopThe battle between Liverpool and Chelsea takes centre stage.

The battle between Liverpool and Chelsea takes centre stage. The Reds, with a four-point cushion over Chelsea, will look to consolidate their position when they face Leicester City. Meanwhile, Chelsea must overcome Fulham to keep the pressure on Liverpool. A Chelsea victory, coupled with a Liverpool loss, would narrow the gap at the top to a single point, though Liverpool still have a game in hand. Conversely, a Liverpool win and a Chelsea defeat could see the gap widen to seven points—likely an unassailable lead heading into the New Year.Manchester United’s Resurgence Manchester United, under Ruben Amorim, have shown flashes of brilliance, particularly in their victory over rivals Manchester City. However, their momentum was disrupted by a shock 0-3 loss to Bournemouth. Amorim’s side will now face Wolves, who are undergoing a transition. A win is imperative for United to maintain their upward trajectory and establish themselves firmly in the top-four conversation. A Boxing Day victory would also restore confidence as the second half of the season approaches.Manchester City’s Fight for Redemption Defending champions Manchester City find themselves in unfamiliar territory, sitting seventh on the table. Pep Guardiola’s men have struggled for form, leading to their decision to train even on Christmas Day. City’s clash against struggling Everton presents an opportunity to regain momentum. With just 29 points from 17 games, Guardiola will hope his side can secure a much-needed win and begin their climb back up the table.The Nottingham Forest Revival Nuno Esp­rito Santo's Nottingham Forest have been a revelation this season, climbing to fourth place and aiming for European competition qualification. Their Boxing Day fixture against Tottenham Hotspur is crucial in maintaining their impressive run. A win could solidify their position in the top four, keeping them ahead in the race for a European spot. With these high-stakes matchups, Boxing Day promises to be a turning point in the Premier League season.

e203d757-41f1-4272-8a2a-a8583d7937a6,"How MCG, India's favourite hunting ground, has changed since their last visitAustralia vs India, 4th Test: The much-awaited Boxing Day Test match is here with India level with Australia at 1-1 in the five-Test series. Can India continue their dominant run at the Melbourne Cricket Ground?",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-4th-test-melbourne-pitch-change-boxing-day-test-2655116-2024-12-25,"India have traditionally enjoyed the Boxing Day Test match in Australia. In the last decade, India have been unbeaten at the MCG after playing three Test matches. They have drawn once in 2014 and secured dominating wins in 2018 and 2020 at the ‘G’. India’s sensational performances have come at the G when their backs were against the wall. Back in 2018, India entered the game after being outplayed in Perth. However, the hero of that series, Cheteshwar Pujara, batted for 11 hours to help India rack up 443/7 in 169.4 overs before Jasprit Bumrah delivered a bowling masterclass to guide India to a 137-run victory. The 2020 Boxing Day Test was even more special. In the previous game, India had been bowled out for 36 runs in their final innings at Adelaide, but stand-in captain Ajinkya Rahane stood up to play a knock for the ages, guiding India to an eight-wicket win.CHANGE OF BALLS The losses at the iconic venue hurt Australia’s ego. Multiple changes were made by Cricket Australia (CA) to bolster their traditional strength – fast bowling. The MCG surface was already undergoing a five-year transformation process since 2017, and in 2020, Cricket Australia decided to alter the nature of the red Kookaburra balls. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage The new set of balls featured a more pronounced seam and an extra layer of lacquer. This helped the fast bowlers thrive, as the ball remained fresh for longer periods. The spice was added by the MCG wicket under the watchful eyes of curator Matt Page. “We sat down seven years ago, after 2017, and discussed where we wanted to go as an organisation and what we wanted to be renowned for – producing Test matches that are going to provide a thrilling contest,” Page said ahead of the Boxing Day Test. Also Read: India's record in Boxing Day Tests “It gives the bowlers an opportunity at various points in the game, but it also gives the batters a chance if you play well. We then tried and experimented with our grass lengths, compaction levels, and moisture levels, which probably took us three years to where we wanted to get to. I’d say the last two or three years, we’ve been quite consistent in what we’ve rolled out. We now leave a bit more grass on the pitches than we used to, and it has provided thrilling contests – that’s what we want to do,” he further added. This directly impacted the amount of runs scored at the MCG.DIPPING TOTALS AT THE G The Melbourne and Sydney wickets are traditionally known for aiding batters. This is attested by the top score of 624/8d in 2016, when Australia drubbed Pakistan. The formula at the MCG was simple: put up a massive total while batting in the first innings – regardless of the toss – and then let the pitch’s inconsistent bounce impart its magic to bowl out the opposition. It essentially became a mental battle between the two sides about who would crumble first under scoreboard pressure. However, recent records at the MCG have been different. Only once in the last four years has an innings total of 400+ been breached at the venue. In fact, in the last four Tests, teams have struggled to breach the 200-run barrier at the G. ESPN reports that since 2018-19, the MCG has had the lowest bowling average of all major venues in Australia, at 26.57. Pace has dominated, averaging 24.50.MORE GRASS ON THE PITCH

 



India head coach Gautam Gambhir inspects the pitch at the MCG (AFP Photo)
 The key reason behind the more result-oriented, low-total Tests has been the amount of grass left on the pitches at the G. For the 2021 Boxing Day Test against England, Page left 10mm of grass on the surface. This resulted in Australia winning inside seven sessions, with Scott Boland starring with his iconic 6/7, as England lost by an innings and 14 runs. For this game, Page has decided to leave 6mm of grass on the pitch – deemed standard across Australia in Tests against India. This is akin to what the hosts did against South Africa in 2023. In that game, Cameron Green ran through South Africa on Day 1, picking up 5/27. Later, on the second day of the Test, David Warner scored a double century on a baking hot day, with temperatures soaring around 40 degrees Celsius.WHAT SHOULD INDIA DO? The South African context is important, as Australian coach Andrew McDonald has said that with temperatures expected to soar above 40 degrees during the Boxing Day Test, the pitch could end up being more batter-friendly. “This wicket might offer the batters a little bit more in terms of the surface as the game progresses. If we didn’t pick Scotty (Boland) here – and I know I’m not allowed to declare the team because that’s Pat’s (Cummins) job tomorrow – but I don’t think I’m coming to the ground on Boxing Day if Scotty’s not in the XI,” McDonald said. “We’ve got great depth in our bowling, and (all-rounder) Mitch Marsh is fully fit and able to bowl. But he (Boland) is ready to go, and he’ll play a role in this Test match with the ball more so than in the previous ones,” he added. RECENT SCORING TREND AT THE MCG  While McDonald feels that batting will be easier as the game goes on, that has not been the case at the MCG in the past few years. Only once in 2023 has the highest total being scored by the team that batted first in the match. In fact, in 3 out of the 4 cases, it has been the team that bats second on the MCG surface - on days 2 and 3 - has scored the biggest innings totals in the match. India’s 326 in 2020, Australia’s 267 in 2021, and once again, Australia’s 575 in 2022 - all of those totals have come with teams batting second on the pitch. Another interesting trend has been the dwindling overs of spin at the MCG. 2020 is the only MCG Test match where more than 2 spinners operated at the Boxing Day Test. It is also the only Test match in the last 4 years that more than 100 overs of spin was bowled in the Boxing Day Test. Here are the numbers: In 2020, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Nathan Lyon bowled a total of 107.5 overs of spin out of 306 overs. That is nearly 35 per cent of the total overs bowled in the Test match. That number drastically comes down in the next three Test matches at the venue, where: 

 In Australia vs England - 29.1 overs of spin are bowled out of 179.


 In Australia vs South Africa - 75.5 overs of spin are bowled out of 281.


 In Australia vs Pakistan - 48.5 overs of spin are bowled out of 321.

 This reflects a dwindling proposition for spin at the venue. Where in 2020, more than a third of the overs were of spinners, last year spin only accounted for 15 per cent of the overs. There might be merit in the argument that both teams should play with a lone spinner. And it rings true, especially for India, since they have more options in hand.KEY LEARNINGS FOR INDIA India need to understand that while the MCG has been their stronghold in the past decade, the 2024 Test may not follow the same script. There is more than enough evidence that the track has changed into a seaming one with the batters majorly enjoying on Day 2 and Day 3 of the game. Australian coach Andrew McDonald’s warning about high temperatures should not hold much water too as Melbourne is known for its drastic weather changes. Ideally, India should play one spinner and four pacers. With the ground exhibiting variable bounce, there is an argument to play an out-and-out pacer in Prasidh Krishna, who has the ability to exploit the bounce of the track.  If India see Ravindra Jadeja as a pure batter in these conditions, there is an argument for Washington Sundar to play as a lone spinner alongside, Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep and Mohammed Siraj. In case India win the toss, they might opt to bowl first, to ensure that they enjoy the majority of Day 2 and 3 - the flattest conditions in Melbourne. However, in case it is an unnaturally hot day, they might be swayed towards batting first. All in all, India would need luck to go their way. If Rohit Sharma manages to get it right at the toss, India have the ability to make life hell for Australia at the G.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Tune InMust Watch

If India win, they will seal the series and retain the coveted trophy, while a victory for Australia would keep them on course for their first series win over India in a decade.  For the hosts, a defeat would invite sharp scrutiny, while for India, a loss would leave their World Test Championship (WTC) fate hanging by a thread, though retaining the series trophy would remain a possibility. With favourable weather predicted and the MCG’s recent track record discouraging draws, a result seems almost certain. The iconic venue, expected to host over 90,000 fans, will set the stage for what promises to be a thrilling contest, with both teams seeking to take a decisive step toward glory.advertisementWILL ROHIT OPEN?Rohit Sharma is reportedly likely to open for India against Australia in the Boxing Day Test, starting on Thursday. This would mean KL Rahul might drop to the No. 3 spot in the batting order. Rohit played as a middle-order batter in the Adelaide and Brisbane Tests but could well return to the top of the order for the fourth Test. When asked about the batting order for the MCG Test during the pre-match press conference, Rohit, unlike his candid remarks before the Adelaide game, chose not to reveal anything. Rohit Sharma is reportedly likely to open for India against Australia in the Boxing Day Test, starting on Thursday. This would mean KL Rahul might drop to the No. 3 spot in the batting order. Rohit played as a middle-order batter in the Adelaide and Brisbane Tests but could well return to the top of the order for the fourth Test. When asked about the batting order for the MCG Test during the pre-match press conference, Rohit, unlike his candid remarks before the Adelaide game, chose not to reveal anything. Since taking up the opening role in 2019, Rohit has been one of India's top-performing players in Test cricket. In 42 Tests as an opener, he has scored 2,685 runs in 64 innings at an average of 44.01, with nine centuries and eight fifties to his name. His best score is 212. Rohit has also been India's standout performer in the history of the ICC World Test Championship, amassing 2,704 runs at an average of 42.25, including nine centuries and eight fifties in 39 Tests and 67 innings. If Rohit opens the batting and Rahul takes the No. 3 spot, India might have to drop Shubman Gill. They have the luxury of an in-form Ravindra Jadeja, who can bat at No. 6. Nitish Kumar Reddy might still retain his place in the XI. The all-rounder has been a revelation in the 2024 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, contributing significantly with both bat and ball. With 179 runs and key wickets at crucial moments, the Hyderabad-born all-rounder has firmly established himself as an invaluable asset. Dropping him from the XI would seem unjustified, especially considering the need for India to manage their bowlers' workload in Melbourne's searing heat. Meanwhile, Gill has struggled in the ongoing series, scoring only 60 runs at an average of 20. His prolonged rough patch in overseas Tests might lead to his omission from the Boxing Day Test. Additionally, Gill, who copped a blow on his finger in the nets, has never batted in the middle order in Test cricket. Meanwhile, Virat Kohli will bat at No.4, followed by Rishabh Pant at No. 5. In Nos. 6 and 7, you will see Ravindra Jadeja and Nitish Reddy. WILL SUNDAR PLAY? India has prioritised batting depth over bowling depth on this tour, yet they’ve been bowled out for under 200 in three of their five completed innings. Melbourne’s weather has been unpredictable, with showers, heavy winds, nippy mornings, and harsh afternoons since the team’s arrival. The forecast for the opening day isn’t favourable, which might prompt the Indian think tank to consider an extra spinner for the Test.  India may opt to play two spinners in the fourth Test, considering the possibility that the Melbourne pitch may slow down over the last 2-3 days of the match after enduring wear and tear in the first two days. Captain Rohit Sharma hinted at the possibility of including a second spinner for the Boxing Day Test, but the decision is still pending from the Indian team management. If Rohit and chief coach Gautam Gambhir opt for an additional spinner, it is likely to be off-spinner Washington Sundar, who would partner left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja. And then there would be the three pacers: Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep, and Mohammed Siraj. Pat Cummins expects Nathan Lyon to play a key role at the MCG, but Rohit remained tight-lipped about India’s strategy when asked about the possibility of fielding an extra spinner. “Whatever we have to do to make the best possible XI for these conditions, we will do—whether that involves playing an extra spinner or not,” Rohit said on Tuesday. With the series level at 1-1, both sides will head into the much-anticipated Boxing Day Test aiming to secure a crucial series lead to strengthen their bid for the ICC World Test Championship final.

Bumrah consolidated his position at the top of the ICC rankings following his stellar performances in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia. After taking nine wickets in the third Test in Brisbane, Bumrah gained 14 rating points. With a total of 904 points, he matched R Ashwin's peak tally achieved in December 2016. Jasprit Bumrah is at the top of the pile with 48 more points than second-placed Kagiso Rabada. Josh Hazlewood, who will miss the last two Tests of the series against India with an injury, is at the No. 3 spot. Australia captain Pat Cummins is in the fourth spot while R Ashwin, who retired after the Brisbane Test, holds the fifth spot.  Meanwhile, Ravindra Jadeja dropped four spots to No. 10 after an ordinary showing with the ball in Brisbane. Mohammad Siraj has inched up one place to 24th and Travis Head is in the top 100 of the bowlers’ list. Bumrah has taken 21 wickets in three Tests at a staggering average of 10.90. No other bowler in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has managed to claim more than 15 wickets so far after three Tests. The Indian pace-bowling spearhead has been head and shoulders above the rest with his remarkable ability to adapt to the conditions in Australia. Bumrah also stood in for Rohit Sharma in the series opener, leading the team to a commanding 295-run victory in Perth. ICC TEST BOWLING RANKINGS - AS OF DECEMBER 25

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-australia-vs-india-ricky-ponting-teenage-sam-konstas-boxing-day-test-2655164-2024-12-25,"Australia great Ricky Ponting has backed talented debutant Sam Konstas to seize any opportunity that comes his way during the remainder of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against India. 19-year-old Konstas will make his Test debut in the Boxing Day Test after replacing Nathan McSweeney in the Australian squad. With the Border-Gavaskar Series tied at 1-1, both teams vie for an unassailable lead and crucial ICC World Test Championship points. ""I've seen a lot, there's a lot of talent there, no doubt about it,"" Ponting told The ICC Review. ""The way he played in the PM's XI game (he scored 107 against the Indians), the way that he was able to approach his first BBL game the other night ... I know it's different formats, but you can see that the talent is there and there's also a bit of an attitude to go with it. ""And not a bad attitude, (but) an attitude that he knows that he's good, and he wants to show the world that he's good."" Playing for the Prime Minister's XI in a two-day match against the touring Indian team after the Perth Test, Konstas captured attention with a stunning century. In his 11 first-class matches, he has amassed 718 runs at an impressive average of 42.2, including two centuries and three half centuries. Despite his early success, Ponting noted that the uncapped batter would undoubtedly feel the pressure on his debut, particularly when facing the top-ranked ICC Test bowler, Jasprit Bumrah. ""There's still a challenge there,"" he said. ""It's a Test match. It's your first Test match. You're playing against some of the best bowlers in the world. ""It probably doesn't get any bigger in world cricket right now. It's like any other country debuting an opening batsman against our bowling attack, when you've got Starc, Cummins and Hazelwood there. ""Bumrah has obviously been the standout and probably the leading fast bowler in Test cricket at the moment. So Konstas will have a great challenge there, no doubt about it."" But Ponting has backed Konstas, saying the teenager will be up for the fight. ""I don't think he's the sort of guy who'd be too worried about it,"" Ponting said. ""I think he'll be excited by it. He'll want to try and put some pressure back on with the way that he plays. ""Like he's not anyone that's going to sit there and be five off 50 balls. He's either going to be up and going or he's going to be out a bit earlier on than that. He'll try and find ways to impose himself on the contest, which is one of the things I think everyone likes about him.""

The boxing bout between India and Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy will resume at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day. It can't get bigger than this. A packed crowd of close to 90,000 will witness the opening day of one of the most-anticipated fixtures of the Australian summer, adding to the hype around the big-ticket clash.  Australia were hammered by 295 runs in the series opener in Perth, but Pat Cummins-led team bounced back to beat India by 10 wickets in the second Test, a pink-ball match in Adelaide. Australia had the upper hand in the third Test in Brisbane after India's batting failed in their first innings and Australia rode on a Travis Head special, his second straight hundred in the series. However, rain and a determined batting effort from India's last-wicket pair of Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah ensured India escaped the follow-on and secured a draw.  Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Not many would have expected the series scoreline to read 1-1, especially after Australia picked Perth, Adelaide (pink-ball) and Brisbane as the venues for the first three Tests of the five-match series. India certainly seem to be the happier of the two sides ahead of the Boxing Day Test. The visiting team also stole some momentum when Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep ran through Australia's batting in their second innings in Brisbane. Head-to-head record at the MCG India also have a favourable record at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  India have won four Tests in Melbourne in 14 Tests. While they have lost eight, the winning record is the best for India at an Australian venue.  Also Read: How the MCG, India's favourite hunting ground, has changed since their last visit The record is spot-free in the last decade. India have not lost to Australia at the G since 2011. In 2014, India held Australia to a draw and won their Boxing Day Tests in 2018-19 and 2020-21. When and where will the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia be played?  The fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy will be played from December 26 to 30 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The toss on Day 1 is scheduled at 10 am local time, 4:30 am IST.  Session Timings in IST First session: 5 am to 7 am  Lunch: 7 am to 7:40 am  Second session: 7:40 am to 9:40 am  Tea: 9:40 am to 10 am  Third session: 10 am to 12 pm The day's play can be extended until 12:30 pm if overs have to be completed.How have the two teams been shaping up for the 4th Test?  Australia announced their XI on the eve of the Boxing Day Test. All eyes will be on 19-year-old Sam Konstas, who is all set to open the batting along with Usman Khawaja. The Australian selectors dropped Nathan McSweeney, who was dropped after the first three Tests of the series. Konstas is set to become Australia's youngest opener and the youngest debutant since Pat Cummins in 2011.  On the other hand, Travis Head, Australia's main man with the bat, was declared fit after he overcame a groin injury scare. Head has been in prime form, hitting back-to-back hundreds in the Test series. Also Read: What is India's record in the coveted Boxing Day Test? Australia were forced to make one change, bringing back Scott Boland in place of injured Josh Hazlewood, who will take no further part in the series. Boland has an envious record at the MCG, his home ground.  Meanwhile, India haven't answered any questions about their combination for the big-ticket Test. Rohit Sharma, who spoke to the press on Christmas eve, remained tight-lipped about the combination, days after R Ashwin's sudden retirement.  ""Let's not worry about that. I think who bats where, we should be discussing that within ourselves and I shouldn't be answering this question in every press conference,"" Rohit had said when asked about his batting position for the MCG Test.  However, Rohit Sharma, according to reports, is expected to open the batting alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal. KL Rahul, who has been solid as an opener, is likely to drop to No. 3. It remains to be seen if Shubman Gill will retain his place in the side or Nitish Kumar Reddy will make away for a second spinner.  Speculation is also rife that India might play Washington Sundar as an extra spinner in the XI. Also Read: India's predicted XI for Boxing Day TestWhat's the news about the Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch? Curator Matt Page, speaking to the press on Monday, confirmed that Melbourne will assist pacers more than spinners. However, he stressed that the MCG pitches are not as lively as the ones in Perth and Brisbane. Page also confirmed that 6mm of grass will be left on Day 1 of the Test. Nathan Lyon's impressive numbers also suggest that there will be help for spin in the latter stages of the Test. A lot will depend on how the weather plays. Day 1 is expected to be hotter than normal.  MCG had been batter-friendly in the past, but recent trend suggests that the bowlers will enjoy the conditions in the Boxing Day Test.  Only once in the last four years has an innings total of 400+ been breached at the venue. In fact, in the last four Tests, teams have struggled to breach the 200-run barrier at the G. Since 2018-19, the MCG has had the lowest bowling average of all major venues in Australia, at 26.57. Pace has dominated, averaging 24.50, according to ESPN.What's the prediction for the Boxing Day Test?  India will look to take confidence from their recent record in Melbourne. Having sealed a bit of momentum in Perth, expect the visitors to step up to the challenge. If India's batting clicks, then they are well-placed to complete a hat-trick of Boxing Day Test wins Down Under.

Harleen won the Player of the Match award as India completed back-to-back series wins over Hayley Matthews and Co. But 2024 also saw Harleen go through tumultuous times. Back in March, Harleen sustained a knee injury during the Women’s Premier League (WPL) while playing for the Gujarat Giants (GG) in their match against UP Warriorz. She was subsequently ruled out of the remainder of the tournament, where the Giants finished at the bottom of the table. Harleen made her comeback in the ODI series on Australian soil where she scored 70 runs at an average of 23.33. On Tuesday, the 26-year-old got to her fifty off 62 balls, after which she notched her century off 98 balls, helping India post their joint-highest ODI score of 358.‘Mom never got irritated’ Recalling the times when she was off the park, Harleen said that she found it tough to walk and pick up water bottles, crediting her mother for being by her side through thick and thin. “When I was there I was only thinking how happy my mother would be. When I was going through the injury, there were many around me, but my mom never got irritated as I could not walk. If I wanted to pick up a bottle of water, I could not,” Harleen said in a video on BCCI Women.

All she had to do was get her legs straight for her rehabilitation. I remember sitting there and saw tears falling down Harry’s face.

In 2018, Virat Kohli’s India hammered Tim Paine’s men by 137 runs after Jasprit Bumrah’s six-wicket haul in the first innings. In 2020, Ajinkya Rahane’s 112 guided India through to an eight-wicket win in the Boxing Day Test. MCG has been India’s happy hunting ground by a distance, although they have lost eight Tests at the venue.

 As the festive mood continues, cricket fans eagerly anticipate Dhoni’s next appearance on the field in the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL). The Chennai Super Kings (CSK) talisman remains an irreplaceable figure for the franchise. Under his leadership, CSK secured a record-equaling fifth IPL title in 2023, reinforcing Dhoni's stature as one of the greatest IPL captains. Ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction, Dhoni was retained by CSK as an uncapped player for a mere Rs 4 lakh, a testament to his unwavering commitment to the team and his humility. While speculation about Dhoni's retirement has been rife since he handed over CSK's captaincy to Ruturaj Gaikwad before IPL 2024, the ""Thala"" of Indian cricket has yet to announce a definitive decision. Dhoni’s potential retirement has been a topic of debate amongst fans and cricket pundits alike. Many anticipated that the 2024 season could mark the end of his illustrious career after CSK’s triumphant IPL 2023 campaign. However, with no official word from the legend, the possibility of witnessing another “Thala” season in 2025 remains alive. For now, Dhoni’s festive celebration as Santa Claus has brought smiles to his fans worldwide, showcasing the softer side of a cricketing icon whose influence transcends the sport.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  ICC Test Rankings: Jasprit Bumrah equals Indian record with career-high rating

He emphasised that he did not want a grand send-off and reiterated that he has no regrets about his international career.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-ashwin-retires-farewell-match-kapil-dev-comments-gobinath-interview-2655231-2024-12-25,"Ravichandran Ashwin reiterated that he harbours no regrets about his international career and that he does not believe in the concept of grand farewells. The off-spinner, who retired from international cricket on December 18, responded to Kapil Dev's remarks suggesting Ashwin deserved a ceremonious exit from the sport at the highest level. While expressing gratitude for the legendary Indian all-rounder's sentiments, Ashwin firmly opposed the notion of grand send-offs.   Ashwin retired midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, announcing his decision minutes after the conclusion of the third Test between Australia and India in Brisbane. His announcement came as a surprise to many within the cricketing fraternity. Some of his teammates, including Ravindra Jadeja, revealed they were unaware of the decision until just moments before the official statement was made public.   Former World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev commented that Ashwin appeared unhappy at the time of his decision and opined that the off-spinner ""deserved a much better, fitting farewell.""   ""As far as I am concerned, grand farewells are wrong. I don't think you should give grand farewell ceremonies to anyone. Especially, I firmly believe that you shouldn't give me a grand farewell. I don't want anyone shedding a drop of tear for me. I think grand send-offs are part of a super celebrity culture,"" Ashwin said during a conversation with television presenter Gobinath on a YouTube show.   ""Why should we run behind someone? I understand we run behind someone for the love we have for them. But I feel that people should get inspired by one's achievements, the legacy that one leaves behind, the way one left the game, and the way one has spoken about the game. But farewells are wrong, I think. If there is a match that has been organised just to celebrate me, I think it’s a disservice to the game,"" Ashwin added.   ""I don't have any regrets about it. Zero regrets. If I am not happy with 537 wickets, then for what will I be happy? Why should I be sad about something that's not there? There is great joy in acceptance. You chase something that you don't have. But don't regret something that you don't have. Don't crib about it.""  I DIDN'T CRY ONE BIT AFTER RETIRING: ASHWIN Ashwin emphasised that retiring was entirely his decision and marked only the end of his international cricket journey. The Tamil Nadu cricketer said he has no doubts he would remain connected with the game in various capacities.   ""I quit this part of my life. It was a full stop to that part of my life. I can talk cricket, I do YouTube, I love coaching. I can keep myself happy around cricket. I will stay connected with cricket.   ""I don’t have any regrets; I am not angry at anyone. I didn’t cry even one bit. No one else is responsible for my retirement. If there’s someone, I am not aware of it,"" he added.   Ashwin returned to India a day after announcing his retirement in Brisbane. The off-spinner received a warm welcome from fans and well-wishers who had gathered outside his residence.   India's most successful off-spinner is already looking forward to his next major assignment—the return to the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025. Ashwin was bought by CSK for â‚¹9.75 crore in the IPL auction held in November. The 2025 season will mark his return to the franchise for the first time since 2015.

They will carry happy memories heading into the fixture having won the last two Test matches played at the venue. However, despite a good past record, all is not well for India heading into the Melbourne Test as they have a lot of problems to address. Ever since the second innings of the Perth Test, Indian batters have collectively failed to put up a good show with the bat as they haven’t been able to cross the 300-run mark. The famed Indian batting line up has failed to put up runs as senior pros Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have struggled massively with the bat. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage Furthermore, youngsters Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant have also failed to impress in the series so far bringing all the pressure on the lower order where Nitish Kumar Reddy and Ravindra Jadeja have added some crucial runs. With the ball, the story has been the same for the Asian Giants with Jasprit Bumrah taking the majority of the workload while others have failed to support him. Hence, India have a lot to work on in terms of both batting and bowling as they aim to continue their love affair with Melbourne. The biggest question mark heading into the fourth Test is the batting position of captain Rohit Sharma. There have been some reports doing rounds which claim that Rohit could well be opening the innings while KL Rahul is likely to bat at number three. It remains to be seen whether the team management will re-shuffle their batting order in the all-important fixture with the series on the line as Rahul has been India's best batter on the tour so far.HEAD-TO-HEAD RECORD India have played 14 Tests against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and have won four out of those, while two have been drawn. Moreover, the MCG has been the happy hunting ground for India since the last three tours as they haven’t lost at the venue since 2012. Hence, India will look to continue their love affair with the venue in the upcoming fixture and take a lead in the series.Will Nitish Kumar Reddy get the axe? Ahead of the fourth Test, there have been some discussions about dropping Nitish Kumar Reddy and bringing in a genuine fast bowling option due to the lack of support for Jasprit Bumrah. While Reddy has been promising as a batter, scoring crucial runs lower down the order, but hasn’t been that good with the ball, having taken three wickets at an average of 41 and a high economy of 4.55.Pitch and Conditions The centre pitch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) had a tinge of green on Monday, three days ahead of the fourth Test. MCG curator Matt Page downplayed the likelihood of the pitch breaking down significantly as the game progressed. The forecast of temperatures reaching 40 degrees on Boxing Day adds further intrigue to how the surface might behave. The pitch is expected to have a good covering of grass on Day 1 which could heavily influence what the captain decides to do after winning the toss.TEAM NEWS: IND VS AUS, 4th TEST Australia announced their XI for the fourth Test as they brought in Sam Konstas in place of Nathan McSweeney who was dropped from the side after his poor outing in the last three Tests. On the other hand, they also brought in Scott Boland in place of Josh Hazlewood who’s been ruled out of the series due to a side strain. On the other hand, India are also likely to make a few changes to the Playing XI with reports of India captain Rohit Sharma opening the innings doing rounds. India could also be tempted to bring in Washington Sundar in the XI given how spinners have performed traditionally in Melbourne. Notably, since 2010, off-spinner Nathan Lyon has picked up the most wickets at the MCG, with 45 -- 10 more than Pat Cummins, who is second on the list.

Currently without a club, Alli will be assessed by the Como coaching staff, including head coach and former football star Cesc Fabregas, who holds a high opinion of the player. Should he impress, the newly-promoted Serie A side may offer him a contract. Fabregas, known for his tenure at clubs like Arsenal and Chelsea, has taken a personal interest in Alli’s potential. Como's sporting director has also spoken positively about the midfielder’s prospects, emphasising Fabregas's admiration for the former England international. The club has created an ideal environment for Alli’s transition, signalling their intent to support his resurgence in the sport. Alli has struggled with form and injuries over recent years, leading to his departure from Everton in June 2024, when his contract expired. His last competitive game dates back to February 26, 2023, during a loan spell with Turkish club Besiktas, where he faced Antalyaspor. Once a rising star in English football, Alli is now focused on making a comeback and reclaiming the form that once made him a key player for Tottenham Hotspur. Aged 28, Alli’s career highlights include 37 international appearances for England, during which he scored three goals. In the Premier League, he was a standout performer, recording 51 goals and 34 assists across 194 appearances. Alli was recently seen at the Stadio Sinigaglia, supporting Como during their 2-0 win over Roma. His presence at the game fueled speculation about a potential move to the Italian club. Now training with the team, Alli has a chance to work closely with Fabregas and prove his worth in Serie A. For Como, currently battling relegation, Alli's signing could be a game-changer. For the player, it’s an opportunity to rebuild his reputation and return to competitive football at the highest level. Fans and pundits alike will be watching closely to see if Alli can reignite his once-promising career in Italy.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  Ruben Amorim vows to revive Manchester United: One of lowest moments in our club

 India Today recently caught up with Niki Prasad after the Indian captain returned from Malaysia. The right-handed batter spoke about the Asia Cup triumph, the WPL deal, her desire to meet DC skipper Meg Lanning and her goals for the upcoming World Cup, scheduled to start on January 18. Here are some excerpts from India U19 women’s captain Niki Prasad’s interviewHow did you and the team celebrate after the victory, and how has the reception been? We are happy and proud that we could give our best and win the Asia Cup for India. There was also a lot of support from the fans on the ground and all of us were really happy to see that even in Malaysia, there were Indian fans who came and watched the matches and supported us. Players are very excited about the upcoming matches in the World Cup, and we want to go with confidence and win the trophy.When India scored only 117, did the girls in the dressing room feel that they could pull it off? Definitely, with the way we had been bowling, we knew that we were in a good position even though we were 25 runs short. Our bowlers and fielders were confident that they were going to go out there and win the game.

G Trisha was a part of the World Cup-winning team last year, and she also played a huge role in the Asia Cup. How would you define her role and experience in the setup? Having an experienced batter like G Trisha in our team (helped). We had confidence in her that no matter how tough the situation is, we knew that if she was there in the middle, everything would be good for the team. All of us were trying to make sure that whenever we went to bat, we put up a good score for our team and that’s what Trisha did and batted brilliantly throughout the tournament.Aayushi Shukla looks a special prospect after how she stepped up in the crunch matches. What’s your take on her? She bowled really well throughout the tournament and knows what her role is and very clear about it. She took up the responsibility of coming and bowling those overs and picking those wickets. She did really well for the team.December 15, Asia Cup win against Pakistan and then a WPL deal. Best day or amongst the best days for you this year? It was definitely one of the best days, but I think the best day would be today (December 24) when I got to know that I have been selected for the World Cup and also leading the side. This is what my goal has been and I want to win the trophy. That day is also very memorable for me because of a win against Pakistan in India’s first match and later in the day, getting to know that I have been picked by DC.

Since you are taking responsibilities as captain, who are your idols and inspiration as far as captaincy is concerned?

And that’s what I have been doing whenever I am in the park.

Head is the leading run scorer of the series so far with 409 runs from three matches.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-michael-clarke-travis-head-aus-vs-ind-border-gavaskar-trophy-2024-25-2655291-2024-12-25,"Former Australia cricketer Michael Clarke feels Travis Head is playing smart cricket in the ongoing Test series against India. Notably, Head is the highest run scorer of the series so far with 409 runs to his name from three matches at an average of 81.80 and a strike rate of 94.23. The southpaw has scored back to back centuries in the last two Tests in Adelaide and Brisbane to go with his 89 in Perth. Ahead of the fourth Test in Melbourne, Akash Deep pointed out Head’s weakness against the short ball and mentioned how India will plan to unsettle him with such deliveries. Akash’s statement drew a response from Clarke, who mentioned that the Indian team wanted to put it inside his mind. The former Australia captain also mentioned how Head is playing smart cricket by making full use of the old ball by playing aggressive cricket. “I don’t mind Indians coming out and saying that. They want to put it in Travis Head’s mind. Head is playing smart cricket. He is making full use of the old ball and is playing aggressive cricket. He is backing himself and is confident playing his brand of cricket,” Clarke said on the Wicket Podcast. Further speaking ahead, Clarke praised Head’s ability to make big hundreds after getting himself set at the crease. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage “If Travis Head scored 40 off 10 or 20 deliveries, I wouldn’t be concerned if he is dismissed. However, if he touched the 40-50 run mark, he knows how to make big hundreds,” he added.Head's phenomenal record against India in recent times Head has been India’s nemesis of late as he scored a scintillating 163 during the World Test Championship (WTC) final in 2023. He further scored a match-winning 137 during the ODI World Cup 2023 final, crushing the dreams of over a billion Indian fans. Since March 2023, Head has scored 712 runs from five Tests against India at an average of 79.11 with three hundreds and two fifties to his name. The Indian team management is desperate to find his weakness and exploit it in the remaining two games as India aim to win their third consecutive series in Australia.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Boxing Day Test could be make or break for Team India.

The reunion brought together players who once shared the Santiago Bernabeu stage and contributed significantly to Real Madrid's legacy. Nacho Fernandez, who ended a remarkable 23-year association with Real Madrid, moved to Saudi Pro League side Al-Qadsiah earlier this year. Joselu, another product of Madrid's youth system, joined Qatar Stars League club Al Gharafa in 2024, seeking new challenges in his career. Despite leaving the Bernabeu, both players maintained strong ties with their former clubmates, particularly Vazquez and Carvajal, with whom they also shared moments in Spain's national team setup.

 Dani Carvajal, one of Real Madrid’s current captains, is sidelined for the 2024-2025 season due to an ACL injury. His absence has left a significant void in the team’s defensive lineup. Meanwhile, Lucas Vazquez has stepped up as a senior figure at the club, taking on greater leadership responsibilities alongside veterans like Luka Modric. The reunion served as a testament to the camaraderie and respect shared among these players. Vazquez, who continues to play a pivotal role at Real Madrid, has become instrumental in guiding the team through a challenging season in La Liga and the UEFA Champions League. While Real Madrid battles for domestic and European glory, the sight of Nacho and Joselu reuniting with their old teammates provided a poignant reminder of the enduring bonds formed during their time at the club. Both players left an indelible mark on Real Madrid’s illustrious history and remain cherished figures among the club’s fans. This Christmas reunion not only rekindled memories of past triumphs but also highlighted the deep connections these players share, transcending their current professional commitments. For Real Madrid supporters, the gathering was a celebration of the spirit of the club—a legacy of excellence, unity, and cherished friendships.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  Dele Alli comeback?

Notably, Boland had a phenomenal debut as he scalped his career-best figures of 6/7 during the third Test of the Ashes 2021-22 in Melbourne. The right-arm seamer helped bundle out England for just 68 and helped his team win by an innings and 14 runs despite having taken just an 82-run lead in the first innings. Recently, Boland recalled his ‘unbelievable’ dream debut and mentioned how things worked out for him on that particular day. “I thought it was going to be a bit of a slog that day. I still can’t believe it, really. I only bowled 24 balls or something like that. I guess it was all those years I’d put in playing for Victoria on wickets out there that weren’t in my favour as much. It all sort of worked out on that one day,"" said Boland to The Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage Further speaking ahead, Boland expressed his desire to play every game for Australia but also revealed that he’s satisfied with his place in the team.I’m comfortable with my position in the squad: Boland “I’d love to play every game. But I’m comfortable with my position in the squad. I know that in front of me are three of the best fast bowlers Australia’s ever had. Test cricket is hard on your body. I feel like there’s always going to be a bit of natural rotation through people picking up little niggles or just a bit sore from having bowled a lot,” he added. Boland is all set to replace Josh Hazlewood in the Australian bowling attack for the Melbourne Test. Hazlewood has been ruled out of the series due to side strain and hence the Australian team management has once again put their faith back in Boland. The right-arm seamer earlier also played the pink ball Test in Adelaide in Hazlewood’s absence and registered figures of 5/105 across two innings, helping Australia win by ten wickets. The 35-year-old will look to continue his marvellous form in the upcoming fixture and help Australia take a lead in the series which is currently tied at 1-1.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Boxing Day Test could be make or break for Team India.

The young all-rounder's selection could determine India's balance in Melbourne's seam-friendly conditions.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-cannot-drop-nitish-kumar-reddy-sunil-gavaskar-melbourne-test-2655309-2024-12-25,"Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has strongly advocated for all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy’s inclusion in India’s playing XI for the upcoming Boxing Day Test against Australia in Melbourne. Praising the 21-year-old's consistent batting performances throughout the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Gavaskar firmly stated that India should not consider leaving him out of the crucial match. Reddy has been a standout performer with the bat, providing stability and vital contributions in the lower-middle order. Speaking to Star Sports, Gavaskar emphasised that the youngster's presence in the lineup is indispensable, especially given the balance he brings to the side amidst a period of hit-and-miss form of the rest. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""They can't drop Nitish Kumar Reddy. He is the fourth seamer. I can't see India going in with just two pacers and Nitish. For me, it is pretty much this XI that plays in Melbourne,” Gavaskar said. The Indian squad has seen significant changes after Ravichandran Ashwin’s surprising retirement following the hard-fought draw in the third Test in Brisbane. Ashwin’s exit has left a gap in the spin department, and the inclusion of domestic spin star Tanush Kotian as his replacement has intensified debates around India’s bowling combination for the Melbourne Test. Also Read: Can Rishabh Pant deliver Melbourne miracle for India in Boxing Day Test? Melbourne's seam-friendly conditions could influence the team’s decision-making. Reddy's ability to contribute as a seam option, alongside probable starters Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and Akash Deep, makes him a valuable asset. However, Reddy has not been particularly effective with the ball in the ongoing series, serving primarily as a supporting bowler rather than a strike option. India is likely to field two spinners—Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar—given their versatility with the bat and ball. This dual-spin strategy could limit the slots available for seamers, raising questions about whether Reddy will find a place as the fourth pacer or if the team will prioritize a more experienced bowler. As the Boxing Day Test approaches, head coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Rohit Sharma face the challenging task of finalizing the perfect XI. With Reddy’s performances and potential weighing heavily in his favor, Gavaskar’s endorsement adds to the growing support for the young all-rounder. The highly anticipated fourth Test begins on December 26, with fans eagerly awaiting India’s squad announcement and the tactical approach they’ll adopt to regain the series lead.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Can Rishabh Pant deliver Melbourne miracle for India in Boxing Day Test?

However, this time, he has struggled. Pant has played five innings without crossing the 40-run mark. Can the Indian wicketkeeper deliver a Boxing Day miracle?",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-rishabh-pant-melbourne-test-miracle-boxing-day-2655306-2024-12-25,"I wish he was Australian,"" said Mitchell Marsh when asked about Rishabh Pant before the start of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. And why did Marsh say that? Because Australia is where Rishabh Pant worked his magic—a land that shaped his legend. Before this series, Pant had a sensational record with the bat in Australia. In the seven matches he had played down under, Pant scored 624 runs against the Aussies at an average of 62.4. The 27-year-old had scored a hundred and two fifties during this time. Yet this time, the magic has eluded him. Pant has failed to breach the 40-run mark in the five innings of the ongoing series. This is a far cry from the Rishabh Pant who carved his name into history with an unbeaten 89 at Brisbane's Gabba in 2021. Pant was 23 at the time, just 15 Tests old, and his knock helped India end Australia's 32-year undefeated streak at the ground. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Before the series began, Pat Cummins was clear about Australia’s intentions: ""He is someone who has had a big influence on a couple of series. Got to try to keep him quiet.” And the Australians, led by Cummins, have devised a simple yet effective strategy to keep Pant quiet. Keep the ball outside off-stump, exploit Pant’s instinct to reach for the ball, and let the angles do the rest. And it’s worked. The flamboyant left-hander has been subdued, forced into shots he’d rather not play, and dismissed before he can truly unfurl his attacking repertoire. With precision and discipline, Cummins and Mitchell Starc have turned this plan into Pant’s kryptonite. Yet, there’s a silver lining—Pant has consistently managed starts, passing the 20-run mark in three of his five outings. The challenge now lies in converting these starts into something monumental, and who better than Sunil Gavaskar to offer some sage advice? “Respect the first half-hour,” Gavaskar urged, emphasizing the importance of soaking up pressure before counterattacking. India captain Rohit Sharma, meanwhile, has backed the young wicketkeeper, highlighting his resilience and work ethic. “He knows what he has to do,” Rohit declared, dismissing concerns about Pant’s recent form.PANT: INDIA'S X-FACTOR But the larger context makes Pant’s resurgence crucial. India’s top order has floundered more often than not, leaving the team’s middle and lower order to pick up the pieces. However, context matters. Unlike Australia’s Travis Head, who often enters the fray against a softened Kookaburra ball, Pant has been thrust into challenging situations. In Perth, Adelaide, and Brisbane, he has walked in early, facing a ball still brimming with menace. Delaying Pant’s arrival at the crease might just be the key to unlocking his full potential. Even amid his struggles, glimpses of Pant’s brilliance have been visible. His 37 in the first innings at Perth was a reminder of his capacity to dominate. He has done it before—in Cape Town, Sydney, Birmingham, and even recently against New Zealand. Each time, Pant has proven that when he finds his rhythm, he can dismantle any bowling attack.MELBOURNE FACTOR The Boxing Day Test at the MCG offers Pant another shot at redemption. It’s the same venue where, in 2020, he made his way back into the playing XI, replacing Wriddhiman Saha and reigniting India’s fortunes. And the rest is history. The stakes are even higher this time. With India’s top order faltering and veterans like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli struggling for consistency, the team needs Pant’s spark more than ever. Pant’s journey has always been one of defying odds. From Brisbane to Cape Town, his career has been punctuated with moments of audacity and brilliance. His miraculous century in September 2024, in his comeback Test after a life-threatening car crash, is a testament to his unyielding spirit.THE GRAND STAGE The MCG, with its 90,000-strong crowd, could be the perfect stage for a Pant special. A cheeky skip down the track to Cummins, a reverse sweep off Lyon, or an audacious pull-off Starc could all signal that Pant is back. And if he is, it’s not just a game-changer for India but a morale-shattering moment for Australia. So, can Rishabh Pant deliver a Melbourne miracle? Well, he’s done it before. And as every Indian cricket fan will tell you, there’s something about Pant, Australia, and improbable comebacks. All eyes are on the MCG—let’s see if the magic strikes again.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  No farewell match, no problem: R Ashwin says he doesn't believe in grand send-offs

Notably, Kohli has been dismissed multiple times chasing deliveries outside off stump since the post-co-era, as the bowlers have exploited his weakness time and again. The star India batter started off the ongoing series against Australia on a good note, scoring a brilliant hundred in Perth. However, he failed to continue his form in the next two Tests, registering scores of 7, 11 and 3 in the next three innings as he kept on edging the ball outside off stump. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage Analysing Kohli’s performance in the series so far, Manjrekar said that if Kohli were to find a solution to his weakness on his own, he would’ve done it by now. He further blamed the Indian coaching staff for not being able to help the star batter to counter his weakness. “But that is not true where a modern-day great will find his own way out. If that was the case, then he would have. That is why I'm no longer focussing on Kohli's problem, but on the guy who was supposed to solve the problem, that is the batting coach. And if he can't address these chronic problems that some of our batters have had, and these are mostly technical battles. So it is pretty obvious to everyone that Kohli needs outside help because he, on his own, hasn't been able to solve it,” said Manjrekar on ESPNCricinfo. Since 2020, Kohli has gone through his worst phase in Test cricket, having scored 1964 runs from 37 matches at an average of 31.67 with three hundreds and nine fifties to his name. Kohli’s poor form has also seen his career average drop from almost 55 to 47.49. Hence, there are widespread questions on his place in the team especially after India’s 0-3 whitewash at home against New Zealand. With two more matches remaining in the series, India would want their star batter to find his mojo back and help them complete a hat-trick of series wins in Australia.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Boxing Day Test could be make or break for Team India.

Pakistan have included the 34-year-old fast bowler in their playing XI for the Test starting December 26 at SuperSport Park in Centurion. Abbas, who last featured in Test cricket in 2021, brings a wealth of experience and precision to Pakistan's pace attack. Alongside him, Khurram Shahzad also makes his comeback, having recovered from a rib injury sustained in August 2024. The duo's inclusion bolsters Pakistan's bowling options as they prepare for a challenging encounter against a confident South African side.

The inclusion of Abbas, known for his control and ability to exploit swing, is seen as a key factor in Pakistan's strategy for the match. Shahzad's return adds further depth, especially after his absence during the series against England. Historically, Pakistan have struggled in South Africa, losing 12 of their 15 Tests in the country and managing just two victories.

They need someone who will take to the attack and that’s where Australia miss David Warner in a big way. This is where Australia will realise the impact Warner had on oppositions in the decade he played,” Shastri said, as quoted by Fox Cricket. Warner is ranked amongst the all-time greatest opening batters to play Test cricket for Australia. He finished his career with 8786 runs from 112 matches at an average of 44.59 with 26 hundreds and seven fifties to his name. The southpaw was instrumental in getting Australia off to a rollicking start with the bat more often than not.Konstas high on confidence ahead of his Test debut Meanwhile, coming into the Test on the back of three fifty plus scores in his last four innings, Sam Konstas is high on confidence ahead of his Test debut. He has been in magnificent form in the Sheffield Shield being the second-highest run scorer for New South Wales (NSW) with 471 runs from eight innings at an average of 58.87 with two hundreds and one fifty. Earlier, he also scored a magnificent hundred for Prime Minister’s XI against India during the pink-ball warm up fixture. Konstas scored a sensational 107 (97) with the help of 14 fours and a six as he guided his team to a score of 240. He also scored a match-winning unbeaten 73 in the second unofficial Test against India A. However, he will be facing the menacing India speedster Jasprit Bumrah with the new ball during the Boxing Day Test, who was an absolute nightmare for his predecessor Nathan McSweeney.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Boxing Day Test could be make or break for Team India.

Notably, the young Indian opener got the ongoing series off to a roaring start with a magnificent century in the first Test in Perth. The southpaw scored a magnificent 161 in the second innings which helped India win by a massive margin of 295 runs. However, since then, he’s failed to replicate his heroics, having scored just 32 runs in the next four innings. Analysing his performance in the series so far, Chopra highlighted Jaiswal’s problems against left-arm fast bowling as he has been dismissed three out of five times by Mitchell Starc. ""The truth is that Yashasvi Jaiswal is having problems against left-arm pace, and this problem has not started now. It's been happening regularly. This was happening in the IPL as well, which means it is not a format-specific problem. It is not a Mitchell Starc problem,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel. Jaiswal has been dismissed six times by a left-arm fast bowler averaging just 9 with two ducks to his name in Test cricket. Further speaking ahead, Chopra mentioned how Mitchell Starc finding his form back has also brought down Jaiswal’s debacle.Onus on Jaiswal to get India off to good start in Melbourne ""His numbers against left-arm pace are not that good and that is getting exploited because, for some strange reason, Mitchell Starc is back to his best. We felt there was a slight slide in his career but he has again started to bowl with the same rhythm,"" he added. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage Ahead of the series, several experts had predicted Jaiswal to finish as the leading run scorer. The youngster came into the rubber under massive expectations, being the second-highest run scorer in Tests in 2024, but has failed to score consistently. In the series so far, he’s scored 193 runs from six innings at an average of 38.60 with one century and one duck to his name. Hence, it’s crucial from India’s perspective that Jaiswal gets them off to a good start in Melbourne and shields the rest of the batting order from the new ball.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Boxing Day Test could be make or break for Team India.

Reports of his conversation with Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez highlight his resolve to justify the club’s trust in him. Mbappe's form has seen a notable upswing in recent weeks, with the forward appearing more composed in front of goal and more clinical with his chances. This turnaround comes after what has been a challenging start to life in Madrid. “No one will regret my signing,” Mbappe told Florentino Perez.as per Marca The French superstar's debut season with Los Blancos has been far from ideal, with early struggles including missed penalties against Athletic Club and Liverpool marking low points in his campaign. To date, Mbappé has scored 13 goals and provided three assists in 23 appearances across all competitions for Real Madrid. These numbers, while respectable, pale compared to his dazzling final season with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). During the 2023-24 season, Mbappé netted an astounding 45 goals and delivered 11 assists in 49 matches. He finished as the top scorer in Ligue 1 (27 goals), the UEFA Champions League (eight goals), and the Coupe de France (eight goals). However, recent performances suggest Mbappé is regaining his rhythm. In his last six outings, he has contributed four goals and two assists, a marked improvement and a sign of his potential resurgence. While he is still short of his peak form, there is growing optimism that the 24-year-old is on track to becoming the attacking force Madrid hoped for when they signed him. For Real Madrid, Mbappe's gradual improvement is a promising development. As the season progresses, the club will look to him to deliver in key moments, particularly in high-stakes competitions like La Liga and the UEFA Champions League. While the start to his Madrid career has been uneven, Mbappe’s recent form indicates he is determined to silence his critics and prove his worth on the grandest stage. With his immense talent and growing confidence, Real Madrid fans can anticipate brighter days ahead as Mbappé inches closer to his best version.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 25, 2024Also Read |  Dele Alli comeback?

Konstas, the youngest player ever to open the batting in a Test match for Australia, struck two boundaries and a six using reverse ramp shots against Bumrah. Bumrah conceded a six after 4,483 deliveries and three years since Cameron Green hit him for one in Sydney in 2021. Remarkably, Konstas achieved this feat with a reverse ramp just 23 balls into his debut innings. The Indian pacer, who has dominated Australia’s top order throughout the series, could only laugh as Konstas flicked him over the wicketkeeper’s head for back-to-back boundaries. Konstas sprinted to the wicket with infectious energy and completed his first national anthem as a Test cricketer with a smile and a musical flourish. He then survived a challenging opening over from Bumrah, who beat his bat four times. Not since records began in 2006 has there been as many play-and-misses in the first two overs of a Test match. IND vs AUS 4th Test, Day 1 Live However, Konstas had vowed not to ""die wondering,"" and after keeping his plans against Bumrah under wraps, he took the attack to the Indian pacer. He attempted reverse ramps off the 11th and 14th balls he faced before successfully executing three more. His bold stroke play had Seven Network analyst Ricky Ponting speculating about whether it was a premeditated strategy. “I wonder if he sat back last night and said, ‘You know what, boys? I’m going to reverse sweep him all day here,’” Ponting quipped. Konstas' daring approach to Bumrah contrasted starkly with the Indian bowler’s typically dominant performances. Despite the initial misses, the young opener’s persistence paid off, unsettling Bumrah and setting the tone for a brisk start to the innings. His unorthodox methods drew comparisons to his explosive performances in recent matches, including a century against India for the Prime Minister’s XI and a quick-fire half-century for the Sydney Thunder. Adding to the drama, Konstas later walked down the pitch to a delivery from Mohammed Siraj, engaging in a heated exchange with the fiery Indian pacer. His aggression complemented his partner Usman Khawaja's steadier approach, with Khawaja surviving an early lbw review to anchor the other end.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Read More |  AUS vs IND, 4th Test: Shubman Gill dropped, Rohit Sharma confirms return to top order

Kohli has managed to score 126 runs at an average of 31.50.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-australia-vs-india-virat-kohli-reaction-poor-run-boxing-day-test-2655403-2024-12-26,"Star India batter Virat Kohli has made a bold admission regarding his inconsistent run with the bat in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. Speaking ahead of the Boxing Day Test, Kohli acknowledged that he had not been disciplined enough with his batting on the livelier pitches in Australia, which has been reflected in his inconsistent performances this series. Kohli, who began the series with a spectacular century in the second innings in Perth, has struggled since, managing just 26 runs in his last four innings across the Adelaide and Brisbane Tests. His scores of 5, 100 not out, 7, 11, and 3 left him with a total of 126 runs at an average of 31.50. Kohli reflected on India's position in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, expressing satisfaction with the series being level at 1-1 heading into the crucial Boxing Day Test.  ""Well, expectations are always going to be there, I guess, playing for your country firstly and then having performed for that long a period, the expectations are always going to follow. I think what's important is to make sure you understand your own plans and you understand the space you are in. If you start focusing on the expectations, then you drift away from what you need to do. The idea is just to follow the game plan that I have. To stay very disciplined in my in my approach, just understand the situation of the game. That's something that's brought me success over so many years and really focus on what the team needs from me out there. If there's, you know, I walk in early, then it's a different situation. If there's a partnership then capitalise and stretch that good period for the team. So I think it's just looking at situations and making sure you have your own game plan set,"" Virat Kohli told the broadcasters ahead of the Boxing Day Test.  IND vs AUS 4th Test, Day 1 Live  ""I mean, if you would have told us we're gonna be one all heading into Boxing Day Test, we would have taken it with both hands. Yeah I agree last 2 or 3 innings hasn't gone the way I wanted to. I haven't been disciplined enough to stick in there and really grind it out and that's what the challenge that Test cricket brings. Obviously these pitches are, are much more livelier than the last time that we played here, so there's a different approach that's required, but that's something that I've taken a lot of pride in to go out there and encounter different conditions and step up when the team wants me to or needs me to. So yeah, the idea is to get stuck in, as I said. Go in there, get your eyes set in, play enough number of balls that you start playing your game afterwards but respect the conditions foremost,"" Kohli added. India have won four out of 14 Tests at the MCG, having also won back-to-back matches in 2018 and 2020. Reflecting on India's superb Test record at the MCG, Kohli highlighted the character they showed to avoid a follow-on in Brisbane, which ultimately led to a crucial draw.  ""Yes, we played some really good cricket here, as I said last time around when we played. We won the year before that we won as well. So I think it's just about understanding where the series is placed and that takes away all the pressure on individuals. Now it's all to play for. We want all, we want to have a strong Test match here. Try to go up in the series heading into SCG, um, and yeah it's gonna be a cracker of a Test match. Both teams really want to win this one, and Australia is going to bring the A game and so are we, um, but yeah, the opportunity is in front of us to avoid the follow-on in Brisbane and the way the, the tail got stuck in. And to make sure that we're not batting again under pressure was massive. And in the end it ended out to be a draw when the situation was looking bleak for us. So yeah, we have really got stuck in the shown character at the right stage and that has given us another chance to start afresh and approach this game like we approached the first one,"" Kohli further said.

— 7Cricket (@7Cricket) December 26, 2024 According to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the custodians of the laws of the game, ""making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with another player"" constitutes a Level 2 offence. This falls under chapter 42.1 of the MCC laws – Unacceptable Conduct. The on-field umpires must report any player they believe has breached the code of conduct, after which the match referee makes the final decision. Should the umpires and match referees determine that Kohli’s contact was deliberate, he could face strict sanctions from the International Cricket Council (ICC). Level 2 offences carry a penalty of three to four demerit points, with corresponding punishments as follows:
50% to 100% match fee fine or 1 suspension point for three demerit points
Two suspension points for four demerit points
 The demerit points will stay in a player's record for a period of 24 months. Virat Kohli hasn't received any demerit point since 2019.  If the match referee assigns four demerit points to Kohli, it would result in a suspension – either for one Test or two limited-overs matches. This means Kohli risks missing the fifth Test in Sydney, which begins on 3 January. However, the Indian team management or Kohli himself can appeal against any sanctions imposed. Notably, South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada was initially handed three demerit points for making contact with Steve Smith during the 2018 series. Rabada’s sanction, however, was overturned on appeal.WHAT EX-UMPIRE SIIMON TAUFEL SAID Former umpire Simon Taufel explained the incident and said both Kohli and Konstas might get away with a lighter sanction.  “We don’t want to see any physical contact during the game. It tends to get out-of-control,”Taufel told Channel 7.  “A lot of adrenaline flowing. Sam Konstas holding his ground. Virat Kohli did the same thing. It’s something out of nothing. We don’t want to see it continue. “It’s something they’ll have a look at during maybe a lunch break or even at the end of the day’s play. I tend to think they’ll let that one go.

Bumrah conceded a six after 4,483 deliveries and three years since Cameron Green hit him for one in Sydney in 2021. Remarkably, Konstas achieved this feat with a reverse ramp just 23 balls into his debut innings. Physical altercations like shoulder bumps have historically invited scrutiny from match officials. Andy Pycroft, the match referee, may review the incident to determine if it warrants penalties. Previous infractions of this nature have resulted in reprimands and demerit points under the ICC Code of Conduct.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also Read |  Brave Sam Konstas reverse scoops as Jasprit Bumrah concedes first Test six in 3 years

Pundits react to Virat Kohli's confrontation with Sam Konstas Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Sunil Gavaskar and Michael Vaughan were among the many who criticised Virat Kohli after the former India captain was involved in a physical altercation with 19-year-old debutant, Sam Konstas in Melbourne.

Gavaskar noted that the physical contact between the two players was entirely avoidable, while foreign cricketers were harsher in their assessments. Virat Kohli made headlines for the wrong reasons on Boxing Day morning after making deliberate physical contact with the young opener, who was on debut. Kohli appeared to try to intimidate Konstas but seemingly crossed a line when he collided with the opening batter, who had been dominating the Indian bowling attack. Tempers flared as Mohammed Siraj attempted to unsettle the 19-year-old, who was playing fearless cricket just hours after receiving his maiden Baggy Green. Konstas surprised the Indian players with his unorthodox approach, attempting to reverse scoop the world’s No. 1 fast bowler, Jasprit Bumrah. During the change of ends between the 10th and 11th overs of the Australian innings, Kohli escalated the situation by walking directly into the young batter. While Konstas was looking at his bat, replays indicated Kohli was fully aware of his actions. IND vs AUS 4th Test, Day 1 Live Responding to the incident, Sunil Gavaskar said it would be intriguing to see how the match referee sanctioned the two players at the end of the day’s play. ""It’s the heat of Test match cricket. But, this can be avoidable. I mean, you are walking in a busy street, you see somebody coming towards you, you sway away. There’s nothing. It doesn’t make you smaller if you sway away. You don’t want to see things on the field of play. Definitely not,"" Gavaskar told the broadcasters. ""My first instance of this, without seeing the replay, was both were looking down. I thought both didn’t see each other coming. I thought Konstas was looking at his bat, Kohli was looking at the ball. But, I think that footage will tell you. We will see this evening who gets fined more,"" he added. Also Read: Will ICC ban Virat Kohli?HEALY AND VAUGHAN SLAM VIRAT KOHLI Former England captain Michael Vaughan stated that the fault lay entirely with Kohli, suggesting that the 19-year-old's fearless batting had unsettled the 'King' of world cricket. Konstas scored 60 off just 65 balls, smashing two sixes and six boundaries. His audacious reverse scoops off Bumrah resulted in three boundaries, including a six in the 11th over, leaving the Indian bowlers demoralised. “He’s completely acted wrong,"" Vaughan told Fox Cricket. “I don’t know why a senior pro who’s played for so long – he’s a King – why’s he’s been rattled by a 19-year-old. Sam Konstas did absolutely nothing wrong there. Virat veered towards him. You can’t do that, you’re just not allowed to do that.” Ravindra Jadeja eventually ended the debutant’s brave innings in the 20th over, but Konstas had already inflicted significant damage, giving Australia a strong start. Meanwhile, Australian batting star Alyssa Healy condemned Kohli's behaviour, saying it was unbecoming of a player of his calibre and experience. “It is probably more disappointing than anything else that an experienced player, one of your best players in the country, is quite visibly looking at the wider picture and made a beeline for the youngest player on the opposition,” Healy said.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

The former Indian star is widely regarded as one of the batters who revolutionised Test cricket with his aggressive strokeplay, and Langer believes Konstas displayed a similar level of confidence. The 19-year-old Konstas (60 off 65 balls) demonstrated why he is so highly rated after Australia chose to bat on a favourable surface. Konstas shared an 89-run opening stand with veteran Usman Khawaja (38*), who had the opportunity to regain some form. By the break, Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne (12*) were still at the crease. IND vs AUS 4th Test, Day 1 Live ""That's the word (awe). Before the game, Sam Konstas was very confident, had been speaking a lot. He has backed it up with his actions, has been incredible to watch. He reminded me of Virender Sehwag back in 2003, when he scored 195 off 233 balls on Day 1. He blew us away, we couldn't believe the confidence,"" Langer said during his commentary stint on Star Sports. Konstas also demonstrated his ability to take on experienced bowlers, smashing Mohammed Siraj for boundaries and unsettling the Indian attack. His innings included six boundaries and two maximums, as he formed an 89-run partnership with veteran Usman Khawaja. Langer noted that Konstas' aggressive approach eased the pressure on Khawaja, who had struggled for form throughout the series.""We also see that the way Konstas has played on debut, he has freed up Usman Khawaja. He has looked at ease, he was used to batting with David Warner, who played with an aggressive approach. Now, he's playing with a partner with a similar approach, and that takes a lot of pressure off,"" Langer added. The debutant's confidence wasn't limited to his batting. A verbal exchange with Virat Kohli after a mid-pitch collision demonstrated Konstas' spunk, while his unconventional tactics drew both sledging and applause. Despite the fiery atmosphere, he stood firm, delivering a promising start to his Test career. India's bowlers found it challenging to contain Konstas early on, with Bumrah and Siraj struggling with their lengths. Only Akash Deep managed some consistency, while Ravindra Jadeja provided the breakthrough. Introduced in the 16th over, Jadeja dismissed Konstas with a skidding arm ball that trapped him in front, ending a memorable debut innings.

Kohli appeared to deliberately bump into the young Sam Konstas, who had been aggressively taking on the Indian fast bowlers after Australia won the toss and chose to bat in Melbourne.  During the break between the 10th and 11th overs of the Australian innings, Konstas and Usman Khawaja were switching ends when Kohli walked toward the young batter and collided with him. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, commentating at the time, remarked that he believed Kohli had made deliberate contact. Replays revealed that Kohli was fully aware of his trajectory, while Konstas, with his head down and adjusting his gloves, unintentionally walked into the Indian batter. IND vs AUS 4th Test, Day 1 Live According to a senior source within the ICC, the incident has not gone unnoticed and could lead to disciplinary action against the veteran Indian batter. ""It is now up to the match referee and umpires to review the footage and assess the situation. They may call the players involved for explanations,"" the source revealed. The clash occurred in the heat of the game as Konstas, making his debut for Australia, was involved in a routine exchange on the field. Kohli's apparent shoulder nudge was captured by cameras, sparking immediate reactions from fans and pundits alike. ""If the explanation provided by Kohli does not satisfy the officials, he could face punishment in the form of demerit points,"" the source added.

On Thursday, December 26, Kohli was seen shouldering the Australian debutant in the first session of the opening day’s play. Virat Kohli's meeting with match referee Andy Pycroft lasted just 10 minutes. The former India captain accepted the breach of the International Cricket Council code of conduct and was charged with a Level 1 offence -- the mildest sanction for physical contact on the field. It was widely speculated that Virat Kohli would be handed a one-match ban after it appeared he made deliberate contact with the 19-year-old. A deliberate physical contact is often classified as a Level 2 offence, which can lead to three or four demerit points. If a player receives four demerit points in a 24-month cycle, then he can be banned for a Test match or two limited-overs matches.  However, Kohli was handed just one demerit point for the on-field bust-up on Boxing Day.  During the break between the 10th and 11th overs of the Australian innings, as Konstas and Usman Khawaja were switching ends, Kohli walked toward the young batter and collided with him. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who was commentating at the time, suggested that Kohli had made deliberate contact.

Jasprit Bumrah-inspired India took 4 wickets in the final session to script a small comeback after Sam Konstas's special hammering in the fourth Test against Australia.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-australia-vs-india-boxing-day-test-day-1-report-konstas-bumrah-2655518-2024-12-26,"Jasprit Bumrah's knack for delivering magical balls in high-pressure moments kept India in contention after Australia’s top order, led by teenage debutant Sam Konstas with a fluent half-century, steered the hosts to 311 for 6 on the opening day of the fourth Test on Thursday. Konstas, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith hit fluent fifties after Pat Cummins won the toss and opted to bat first. Australia vs India, 4th Test, Day 1 Updates Australia, at one point, were cruising at 237 for 2, but Bumrah's late burst in the final session helped India get four wickets and script a small but morale-boosting comeback at the MCG. Marnus Labuschagne fell right after the drinks break, triggering a mini-collapse that saw India pick up 3 wickets in the space of 9 runs. India fought back in the final session but another solid 50-plus stand between Smith and Alex Carey took Australia close to 300. Khawaja (57), Labuschagne (72), and Smith (68 not out) all contributed with fifties on a good batting surface. KONSTAS SHOW Australia's 19-year-old debutant, Konstas, showed why he is regarded as one of the brightest young talents in world cricket after Australia opted to bat on a pitch conducive to batting. With a quick-fire 60 off 65 balls, Konstas displayed remarkable composure and skill, particularly in his 89-run opening stand with veteran Usman Khawaja (38 not out). The teenage debutant didn't care about Bumrah's stature or his excellence and simply took him down, even managing to hit a reverse-lap six off him, a six that Bumrah conceded after 4484 balls in Test cricket. After a few play-and-misses off Jasprit Bumrah's first over, the teenager found his rhythm, playing a series of audacious shots. Konstas's reverse lap-scoop against Bumrah was followed by a six over mid-on, and another reverse lap-scoop brought a boundary wide of third man. The teenager's boldness drew attention, particularly as Bumrah, usually a difficult bowler to handle, had never been hit for two sixes in his first spell of a Test match morning. Konstas even had an on-field altercation with Virat Kohli, who appeared to deliberately bump into the young opener, who had been aggressively taking on the Indian fast bowlers after Australia won the toss and chose to bat in Melbourne. Konstas' confidence didn't go unnoticed, as the young opener engaged in a verbal exchange with Virat Kohli after the Indian batting star shouldered the Australian on the field. Despite the pressure from experienced bowlers like Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, who tried to unsettle him with short-pitched deliveries, Konstas remained undeterred. He hit six boundaries and two sixes before Ravindra Jadeja broke the partnership, trapping Konstas in front with a clever arm ball.  INDIA'S MINI COMEBACK Khawaja played his usual steady game, observing the young gun go about his business at the other end and scoring his fifty of the series. Konstas's debut special allowed his veteran opening partner, Khawaja (57 off 121 balls), the opportunity to find some form with a patient half-century. Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne then switched gears to traditional Test cricket, building a 50-plus stand, with Khawaja reaching his first half-century of the series.  Bumrah dismissed the left-hander with an innocuous delivery, leaving Labuschagne and Steven Smith to accumulate runs with ease. The pair attacked the spinners effectively, stitching together an 83-run stand for the third wicket. Both batters reached their respective fifties and appeared set for big scores. However, just after the drinks break, Washington Sundar removed Marnus, who chipped a catch to mid-off, falling short of a century. After an uncharacteristically quiet first session, during which Konstas took the attack to the Indian pacers with a barrage of boundaries and sixes, Bumrah returned to his best, picking up three crucial wickets, including the quick dismissals of Travis Head (0) and Mitchell Marsh (4).  The Indian pace spearhead was reintroduced as soon as Travis Head walked in, and the Indian spearhead turned the tide with two crucial strikes in quick succession. He knocked over Head for a seven-ball duck and followed it up by dismissing Mitchell Marsh. Alex Carey joined ""Smudge"" (Smith) to weather the storm. Smith continued his love affair with the MCG. The Australian star hit his sixth Test fifty at MCG and shared a 53-run stand with Carey to take hosts near the 300-run mark. However, relief came for India when Akash Deep dismissed Carey with a peach of a delivery. Smith and Pat Cummins then saw out the remainder of the day, taking Australia to stumps at 311/6 in 86 overs. Smith was unbeaten on 68, while Cummins was battling on 8. Bumrah was once again the standout bowler, claiming three wickets, while the rest of the attack, except for Siraj and Nitish Kumar Reddy, chipped in with one wicket each.

Konstas, however, highlighted that the spicy nature of the first session fired him up for his first-ever knock for Australia in Test cricket.   Virat Kohli created a stir when he appeared to deliberately bump into the 19-year-old opener, who was trying to put pressure on the Indian bowlers after Australia won the toss and opted to bat. Konstas was taking down Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj with his audacious reverse scoops when the latter exchanged words with him.

Tension escalated when Kohli shouldered Konstas during the drinks break at the end of the 10th over of the Australian innings.   ""I was just doing my gloves. I think he accidentally bumped me. I think that's just cricket, just the tension,"" Konstas told the press after a blazing 65-ball 60 on his debut.   It was widely speculated that Virat Kohli might be handed a one-match ban for deliberate physical contact with the opposition player. However, Kohli escaped suspension and was fined 20 percent of his match fee for the incident, sources told India Today..   ""For me, I was just trying to get into the contest. I was just trying to bring the best version of myself against whoever I was facing. It got heated at times, that's good for me. I feel it brings the best out of me.

He tore into the World No. 1 fast bowler in the 11th over, hitting him for two boundaries and a six.   Konstas collected 34 runs in Bumrah's first spell – the most by any batter against the in-form bowler in the history of Test cricket.   Speaking about his ramp shots against Bumrah, Konstas said they were all premeditated in a bid to throw Bumrah off his rhythm. Konstas struggled to put bat to ball in the first over of the match bowled by Bumrah. The youngster, however, altered his approach and took the unorthodox route to find success.   ""I think I was getting used to the wicket. It was the first time I was facing him. I was getting used to his action. He beat my bat a few times, I was lucky enough to get a few away. But, it was a great contest,"" Konstas said.   ""Yeah, definitely premeditated. But, I was trying to keep my head still and watch the ball until it went off my bat. Got a few away today,"" he added.   Konstas's bold approach at the top of the order seemingly gave confidence to the rest of the Australian batting unit.

Nayar confirmed the same in the press conference after the first day’s play of the Boxing Day Test. Australia vs India, 4th Test, Day 1 Updates After missing the Perth Test due to personal reasons, Rohit batted in the middle order for the first time in six years. But the tactic backfired as the veteran could only score 19 runs from three innings in the Brisbane and Adelaide Tests at an average of 6.33 with a top score of 10. “Rohit will come up in the order and more likely than not he will open the innings for us,” Nayar said to the reporters on Thursday, December 26. Rohit is most likely to open the batting with Yashasvi Jaiswal, with KL Rahul dropping to No.3. Rohit is also under pressure as captain as India haven’t won a Test match under him since the series win over Bangladesh earlier this year. India are also fighting to seal their spot in the top two of the points table and qualify for the World Test Championship final to be held next year. Nayar also put forth the rationale behind leaving Shubman Gill for the Boxing Test. “I feel for Shubman but he understands. He’s not really dropped, just couldn’t find his way in the combination,” Nayar said. After missing the Perth Test due to injury, Gill got scores of 31 and 28 in the Day-Night Test at the Adelaide Oval. In Brisbane, Gill could only manage a solitary run in the first innings before Mitchell Starc got the better of him.Australia with their noses ahead At Stumps on Day 1, Australia would feel that they are slightly ahead in the Boxing Day Test after finishing at 311 for the loss of six wickets. Sam Konstas laid the platform with a 60-run knock off 65 balls with six fours and two sixes. Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith scored 57, 72 and 68 not out respectively.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-border-gavaskar-trophy-virat-kohli-sam-konstas-mcg-test-2655661-2024-12-26,"Virat Kohli has been fined 20 percent of his match-fees after the controversy he was involved in on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Kohli, who is amongst the four Indians along with Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja in the Grade A+ category in the BCCI central contract, gets a match fee of Rs 15 lakh in Test cricket. Hence, Kohli needs to pay Rs 3 lakh from his match fees. The match fees for Indian cricketers in ODIs and T20Is are Rs 6 lakh and 3 lakh respectively. On Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test, Kohli was seen shouldering Sam Konstas, who became amongst the youngest debutants for Australia in Test cricket. During the break between the 10th and 11th overs of the Australian innings, as Konstas and Usman Khawaja were switching ends, Kohli walked toward the young batter and collided with him. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who was commentating at the time, suggested that Kohli had made deliberate contact. Australia vs India, 4th Test, Day 1 Updates However, replays showed that while Kohli appeared aware of his path, it was Konstas, distracted by adjusting his gloves with his head down, who unintentionally walked into the Indian batter. Apart from the fine, Kohli was also handed one demerit point for the on-field bust-up.Who will pay Virat Kohli’s fine?  Last year in the Indian Premier League (IPL), Kohli got into a heated argument with Gautam Gambhir, the then mentor of the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), after which he was fined 100 percent of his match fees for breaching the Level 2 of IPL’s code of conduct. But as per reports in Cricbuzz, it wasn’t Kohli who paid the fine and rather, the RCB management that did. ""Players put their bodies on the line for the team, and we respect that and, as a culture, we don't cut the fine from their salaries,"" an RCB source was quoted as saying. However, the system isn’t the same for all 10 teams. Hence, there’s a possibility that the BCCI may pay the fine and not Kohli. But there’s no confirmation as to who will pay the fine.

He would not be proud of the man who shoulder-barged a 19-year-old batter playing his first Test for Australia. That man was Kohli himself. He made a beeline for the youngest player on the field, in front of close to 90,000 spectators at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The on-field altercation, instigated by Kohli, was unbecoming of a player of his stature. It was inappropriate for the occasion, as thousands of passionate fans had turned up to witness a good contest between bat and ball. AUS vs IND, 4th Test Day 1: Report | Highlights Virat Kohli has never shied away from confrontation. He thrives on competition, and verbal duels often fired him up. Australians learnt this the hard way.
His first two tours Down Under epitomised his combative spirit. Ridiculed as a ‘spoilt brat’ by Australian players and subjected to relentless sledging in 2014, Kohli did not back down. Instead, he channelled the animosity into some of his finest performances, scoring four centuries in the series. Also Read: Think Virat Kohli bumped into me accidentally, says Sam Konstas ""I like playing against Australia because it is very hard for them to stay calm,"" Kohli had said at the time. ""I don’t mind an argument on the field. It really excites me and brings the best out of me."" Even then, Kohli made it clear that he had limits. When Mitchell Johnson hit him with a throw during that series, he snapped, saying: ""I told him that's not on and to 'try and hit the stumps next time, not my body.'"" Kohli did not hesitate to show the middle finger to an allegedly abusive group of spectators in Sydney in 2012 -- a moment he later came to regret..  He never shied away from being the villain or speaking his mind. He didn’t think twice before calling out unfair play in his inimitable style. When Steve Smith sought the dressing room’s help for a review call in 2017, Kohli stopped just short of calling him a cheat. Yet, two years later, Kohli would defend Smith when he was booed by the English crowd over the Sandpaper Gate scandal. Kohli has always worn his heart on his sleeve, engaging in verbal duels and celebrating his personal milestones and the success of his teammates with unmatched fervour. “I don't play for people, perceptions or reputations. I only play for the team to win,” Kohli had famously said in 2018. Yet, his recent altercation with Australia’s 19-year-old debutant Sam Konstas on Boxing Day has left a bad taste, raising questions about whether he momentarily crossed the fine line he has so deftly walked throughout his career.WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MCG Teenage opener Sam Konstas, the youngest-ever Australian opener on debut, was putting on a show on Boxing Day. He took on the world’s best fast bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, attempting to reverse scoop him to the boundary. The audacity with which he sought to transfer the pressure onto Australia’s nemesis was a treat to watch. Meanwhile, Mohammed Siraj was doing his best to unsettle the young opener, engaging in a sledging duel to break Konstas’s rhythm – a tactic well within the norms of the game. During a drinks break after the 10th over of the Australian innings, as Konstas and Usman Khawaja switched ends, Kohli appeared to shoulder the teenager, who was adjusting his gloves with his head down. It seemed to be deliberate physical contact, which is punishable under the laws of cricket, as the sport is not a contact game.

— 7Cricket (@7Cricket) December 26, 2024 Yes, Virat Kohli escaped a strict punishment. Speculation was rife that he might be banned for the next Test match in Sydney, but the ICC fined him and gave him a demerit point after he accepted the sanctions proposed by match referee Andy Pycroft. Yet, Kohli would know that he let himself down in front of thousands who idolise him. Ironically, the man he shouldered – Konstas – is also one of his biggest fans.
Even Ravi Shastri, who worked closely with Kohli and understood him better than most, could not defend the MCG bust-up. “The stature Virat has in the game; he has captained the side for many years, and in the heat of the moment, things do happen. But on reflection, I would say, it was unnecessary. There is a line, and you don’t want to overstep that line,” Shastri said, adding to the criticism of Kohli’s act.

However, Nayar emphasised that experienced players like Kohli and Sharma often need some time at the crease to settle and find their rhythm. He revealed that several discussions took place before the 4th Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with a focus on how they could maximise their time at the crease. “Often, for an experienced player—although Virat scored a hundred in the Boxing Day Test—discussions are focused on the specific challenges of that game. Every player has a weakness, and they will inevitably get out in some way or another. The key is to stay in the zone where you can score runs. I feel it’s about confidence and getting a good start.

This is a game of confidence. The more you practice and discuss, the better prepared you are. It is crucial to survive those initial 25–30 balls.

Konstas made a remarkable debut in the Boxing Day Test, by scoring an impressive 60 off 65 balls at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. His fearless approach against India's premier pacer, especially with the new ball, showcased his natural talent and composure under pressure. “What you could also say is that this is the future of opening batting in Test cricket. We’ve already seen England employ similar tactics, but they hardly ever play a reverse shot. They play attacking strokes. Now, this is something that a lot of batters will look to do because it’s very similar to batting in limited-overs cricket. There are only two fielders outside the circle in limited-overs cricket, but here in Test cricket, if you’ve got three slips, a gully, a forward short leg, a leg slip, and two fielders in the deep, there are wide-open spaces. You need to take advantage of that, and that is what Sam showed by playing unorthodox shots and throwing a bowler like Bumrah off his rhythm,” Gavaskar exclusively told India Today. Australia vs India, 4th Test, Day 1 Updates The 19-year-old's bold shot-making disrupted the bowler's rhythm and took advantage of open spaces in the field, setting a new example for opening batters in the longest format of the game. Gavaskar praised Konstas and called it the 'fearlessness of youth' as the 19-year-old demonstrated how batters can succeed by blending traditional and innovative methods.

Australia vs India, 4th Test, Day 1 Updates The 36-year-old Kohli was greeted with backlash for his actions, after which the ICC slapped him with a demerit point and a 20 percent fine of his match fee. Gavaskar said that Kohli needs to form a legacy as one of the greats of the game rather than being remembered as someone who was punished for unnecessary aggression on the field. “I am not sure what the reason was, but there really was no need for that. We don’t need to have this in any grade of cricket, certainly not at the highest level. You can play very, very competitive cricket without getting physical. And we all want to remember Kohli as one of the greatest cricketers in the game and not as somebody who was fined by the ICC,” Gavaskar said in an interview with India Today. “Hopefully, he will learn and not want to repeat this again. Competitiveness is inbuilt in him, we have always seen how he celebrates every wicket and there’s nothing wrong with that. But one should not be getting physical,” Gavaskar added.Sam Konstas shines at MCG  Even as Kohli had a tough day in the office, Konstas had a day to remember. Replacing Nathan McSweeney in the Australian playing XI, the 19-year-old came out firing on all cylinders, taking on Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and other bowlers. Fresh from scoring the fastest fifty for the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League (BBL), Konstas made his half-century off 52 balls. Konstas made 60 off 65 before Ravindra Jadeja accounted for his wicket. Australia finished Day 1 at 311 for the loss of six wickets.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: What are India's chances of winning Boxing Day Test after Day 1?Must Watch

The opening day of the 1st Test between Pakistan and South Africa delivered plenty of drama, with Kamran Ghulam and Kagiso Rabada at the centre of it all. The fiery on-field exchanges and their aftermath became the talking points of the day. Ghulam, known for his aggressive demeanour, allegedly directed abusive language toward Rabada, despite struggling to survive the South African pacer’s lethal deliveries. Rabada’s relentless pace and precision seemed to unnerve the Pakistani batter, but Ghulam’s response only added fuel to the fire. The tension didn’t stop there, as Ghulam also had a heated exchange with South African wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne. The verbal volleys between the players highlighted the intensity of the contest and the high stakes of Test cricket.Ghulam vs Rabada

Kamran Ghulam said ""F**K YOU"" to Rabada and Verreynne.

— Abdullah (@abdullahhammad4) December 26, 2024 The drama began when Kamran Ghulam appeared distracted while facing Rabada, pulling out of his stance at the last moment. Live visuals showed two spectators casually walking past the sight-screen, triggering boos from the crowd. After a brief discussion between the umpires, play resumed, but the tension was palpable. Rabada, unperturbed, delivered a fiery spell that kept Ghulam on his toes. One ball, in particular, saw Ghulam beaten by a delivery he poked at loosely, earning a wry smile from Rabada, who walked towards the batter. Ghulam responded in kind, leading to a moment of banter that amused the crowd. The duel continued as Ghulam edged a fuller delivery from Rabada, which was dropped by Marco Jansen at gully. It was a tough chance, but the crowd groaned at the missed opportunity. Ghulam capitalised on his luck, reaching his fifty shortly afterward. He acknowledged the milestone with a raised bat and a playful flex of his biceps, drawing cheers from the audience. However, Ghulam's entertaining but risky knock came to a disappointing end. Daryn Paterson set up the dismissal with a clever delivery after noticing Ghulam's premeditated charge. Dragging the ball short, Paterson forced a wild swipe from Ghulam, resulting in a massive top-edge. Rabada, stationed at deep backward square leg, ran to his left and completed a composed two-handed catch.Rabada gets the better of Ghulam Ironically, it was Rabada who had the last laugh after enduring Ghulam's antics and exchanges. The South African pacer's persistence and discipline troubled Ghulam throughout his innings, and while Rabada didn't claim the wicket directly, his involvement in the dismissal capped off a memorable contest. Ghulam walked back after scoring 54 off 71 balls, including eight boundaries and a six. Despite his valiant effort, his dismissal left Pakistan in a precarious position and highlighted the need for their batters to show greater temperament against a relentless South African attack.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also Read |  Usman Khawaja offers ringside view of Virat Kohli vs Sam Konstas at MCG

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-border-gavaskar-trophy-australia-vs-india-boxing-day-test-2655750-2024-12-26,"India do not have much room for complacency in their ongoing Boxing Day Test against Australia. At Stumps on Day 1, the Aussies got themselves up to 311 for six in 86 overs. Although Travis Head, the top run-scorer of the series, perished for a seven-ball duck, the other batters stepped up at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Australia vs India, 4th Test, Day 1 Updates For the first time in 10 years, the top four batters in an Australian XI scored fifties in an innings against India in Tests. Sam Konstas laid the platform with a thunderous 60-run knock on Test debut. Usman Khawaja, who was going through a rough patch, returned to form after making 57 runs off 121 balls. Marnus Labuschagne chipped in with 72 runs at No.3, after which Steve Smith notched his 10th fifty plus score at the MCG. Alex Carey also impressed with a 31-run knock. At no point did Australia find themselves under a lot of pressure. For India, Jasprit Bumrah picked up three wickets and again shouldered a chunk of the workload. Akash Deep, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar took one wicket apiece. With four days left in the Boxing Day Test, India have plenty to work on if they are to come out victorious.India with the need to script history  Australia have lost only five times at the MCG after putting up a score of more than 300 runs in the first innings. Even as England beat them thrice in 1895, 1928 and 1962, South Africa beat them in 1953 and 2008. It’s pertinent to note that no Asian team has beaten Australia at the MCG after conceding over 300 runs in the first innings. Hence, it goes without saying that India need to pull a rabbit out of the hat to come trumps.Instances when Australia lost at MCG after 300 plus in first innings 
 


Not impossible by any means  Out of the 10 Tests that India won, two of them came when Australia scored in excess of 300 in their first innings. Back in 2003, Rahul Dravid’s 233 and 72 guided India home in Adelaide despite Australia’s mammoth 556 in the first innings. In the historic Gabba Test where Rishabh Pant’s 89 not out stole the limelight, India won after conceding 369 in the first innings. Therefore, the ongoing MCG Test isn’t completely out of their reach.Instances when India have won in Australia after conceding 300 plus in first innings

The fiery exchange occurred when Kohli appeared to shoulder-bump Konstas, the Australian debutant. While opinions on the incident continued to circulate, Khawaja, who was present on the field, shared his perspective. “At the moment, I didn’t see what happened. I was walking the other way, and I just looked back—woah! As I turned around, I saw them collide and thought, ‘What’s going on here?’ Sammy was going; he was on fire. There was a bit of chirp going on between Sam, Bumrah, and Virat the whole time, but I didn’t want any physical contact to taint the situation,” Khawaja told ABC Sport.Watch the video here

He came to the academy when I was 19, so I’ve known him a long time. I told Sam to chill out and assured him I’d talk to Kohli. I said, ‘Leave it, it’s fine. What happens on the field stays on the field,’” Khawaja added. The altercation occurred during the break between the 10th and 11th overs of the Australian innings as Konstas and Khawaja were switching ends. Kohli approached Konstas and collided with him. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, commentating at the time, suggested the contact was deliberate. However, replays revealed a different story. While Kohli appeared aware of his trajectory, it was Konstas, distracted by adjusting his gloves with his head down, who unintentionally walked into the Indian batter. Despite the clarification, Kohli was fined 20 percent of his match fee and handed one demerit point for the incident. Khawaja’s attempt to downplay the episode and his camaraderie with Kohli highlights the high emotions that often come with competitive cricket. Nonetheless, the incident has reignited debates about on-field conduct and sportsmanship.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also Read |  How Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma geared up for MCG Test: Abhishek Nayar reveals

Konstas, 19, grabbed the attention of cricket fans and experts alike with his bold approach, leaving the Indian team and commentators in disbelief. Former India coach Ravi Shastri was particularly impressed, comparing the young batter to cricketing great Virender Sehwag. Konstas’ performance was nothing short of stunning as he took on Bumrah, renowned for his deadly fast bowling. The teenager played a series of bold shots, including ramp shots, off Bumrah’s pace, which left even Shastri in awe. “I don’t think anyone has taken or treated Bumrah like that in any format, let alone red-ball cricket,” Shastri told Star Sports. Australia vs India, 4th Test, Day 1 UpdatesFearless batting by Sam Konstas “For him to go out there with that swag and attempt some outrageous shots—it was something else. He tore that MCC coaching manual to shreds.” Shastri went on to describe how the Indian players initially thought they could get Konstas out quickly, as he missed a couple of shots. However, as the teenager continued to take risks and succeed, India’s confidence seemed to fade. “They actually didn’t know what hit them. Initially, he missed the first two shots, and there was a smile on the faces of the Indian players. They thought, ‘If he takes chances, we’ll get him quickly.’ But as soon as this started happening, all the smiles disappeared,” Shastri added. Shastri drew comparisons between Konstas and Sehwag, the former India opener, who is known for his fearless attacking style. He predicted a bright future for Konstas in Australian cricket, saying, “He’ll entertain when he gets going, and he’s born to entertain. If he plays for any length of time for Australia, he’ll do exactly that.” Watch: Konstas' reverse scoop vs Bumrah Former Australian cricketer Justin Langer also praised Konstas’ boldness and execution. ""It’s not easy to attack Bumrah, even in T20 cricket. But the kid was bold, playing a good game, and then he came and put it into action. "" That’s what great players do,” Langer said. He also mentioned that the Indian team did not expect Konstas to bat in such a fearless manner, adding that even KL Rahul had been surprised by the young batter’s audacity. As the match unfolded, Konstas’ bold approach continued to steal the spotlight, though India managed to fight back.

This light-hearted moment had the commentators in splits, but Labuschagne, recalling his Gabba experience, refused to engage and focused on his batting.

After a fiery start by debutant Sam Konstas, who smashed 60 off 64 balls, and a solid 89-run opening partnership, Australia looked set to dominate. Khawaja and Labuschagne further consolidated with a 65-run stand before Bumrah’s short ball broke the partnership, giving India a much-needed opening. With newfound momentum, India struck again. Bumrah returned to dismiss Travis Head for a duck and then removed Mitchell Marsh, bringing India back into contention.

It’s a tactic Siraj uses to unsettle the batters, and though playful in nature, it has coincided with game-changing moments.

Australia ended Day 1 at 311/6, with Smith holding fort.

 Kamran Ghulam provided some resistance with a gritty 54, showing patience and skill against South Africa’s disciplined attack. However, he too succumbed, triggering another collapse. Pakistan lost five wickets for just 52 runs in the middle session. Mohammad Abbas and Khurram Shahzad frustrated the South African bowlers with a spirited last-wicket stand, adding valuable runs to push Pakistan past the 200-mark. Dane Paterson spearheaded South Africa’s attack with figures of 5/61, showcasing impeccable line and length. He was well-supported by debutant Corbin Bosch, who claimed four wickets despite occasional waywardness. Kagiso Rabada bowled brilliantly without luck, building pressure that allowed his fellow bowlers to thrive.South Africa's domination with bat In reply, South Africa had a shaky start as Khurram Shahzad dismissed Tony de Zorzi and Ryan Rickelton early, leaving the hosts at 24/2. Mohammad Abbas then trapped Tristan Stubbs lbw to put South Africa in a precarious position at 66/3. However, Aiden Markram, batting with remarkable composure, steadied the innings. His unbeaten 47 off 67 balls, laced with seven boundaries, was a masterclass in adapting to conditions. Temba Bavuma, the skipper, was cautious during his brief stay at the crease, remaining not out on 4 at stumps. With the pitch still offering assistance to the seamers, Pakistan will hope to make early inroads on Day 2 and limit South Africa’s lead. On the other hand, the hosts will rely on Markram and the lower order to build a substantial first-innings advantage. At stumps, the match is delicately poised, but South Africa’s disciplined bowling and steady batting tilt the scales in their favour. Day 2 promises to be a fascinating battle as both teams vie for control.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also Read |  Marnus look at that: Siraj's bail switch does the trick for Bumrah at MCGMust Watch

The experienced batter played a pivotal role, crafting his fifth Test century to keep the hosts on top throughout the day. After winning the toss and opting to bat, Zimbabwe started positively. Ben Curran, making his Test debut, impressed with a brisk 68, including 11 boundaries. He set the tone, adding 43 runs with Joylord Gumbie for the opening stand. Gumbie departed early for 9, caught behind off Naveed Zadran. Curran continued confidently, forming a 49-run partnership with Takudzwanashe Kaitano.

 Williams entered at No. 4 and immediately took charge. His aggressive approach kept the scoring rate high as he built crucial partnerships. He added 78 runs with Kaitano (46), who fell just short of a fifty after being caught off Zahir Khan’s bowling. Dion Myers then joined Williams for a 50-run stand, but Myers was dismissed for 27, giving Ghazanfar his second wicket. Williams remained unshaken, finding excellent support from skipper Craig Ervine. The pair combined for an unbroken 143-run partnership that frustrated Afghanistan's bowlers. Williams was fluent, hitting nine fours and three sixes to bring up his century off just 114 deliveries. He remained unbeaten at stumps, closing in on his career-best Test score of 151. Ervine also played a composed knock, reaching 56 not out. Afghanistan’s bowling attack lacked discipline, struggling with line and length. Ghazanfar (2/83) was the standout bowler, while others failed to build pressure. The fielding further compounded Afghanistan’s woes, with a dropped catch late in the day adding to their frustration. With a strong foundation laid, Zimbabwe will look to build on their dominance on Day 2 and post a big first-innings total. Afghanistan, on the other hand, will need early wickets to claw their way back into the contest.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 26, 2024Also Read |  South Africa in charge after Day 1 as Dane Paterson picks 5 wickets vs PakistanMust Watch

Security personnel quickly intervened, escorting the intruder off the field and allowing play to resume shortly after. The intruder, who initially sprinted towards Rohit Sharma standing in the slip cordon, managed to evade security momentarily before targeting Kohli. The invader attempted to hug Kohli but was quickly intercepted by the stadium's yellow-clad security personnel and escorted off the ground. The interruption caused a brief halt in play, but the game soon resumed without further incident. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 2 Live The incident followed a charged atmosphere at the MCG, where Kohli became a focal point for the crowd's reaction. The 36-year-old was booed repeatedly by the home fans after his aggressive shoulder barge on Australia's 19-year-old Sam Konstas on Day 1 of the fourth Test. The encounter sparked controversy, as Kohli responded defiantly to the jeers, underscoring the intensity of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. Meanwhile, on the field, India hoped for breakthroughs with the fresh second new ball on Day 2, but their efforts were undermined by inconsistent bowling and lackluster fielding. Australia's Steve Smith and Pat Cummins capitalized on these lapses, quickly building a solid partnership that crossed the 50-run mark within the first hour. The iconic Boxing Day Test, part of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, lived up to its reputation for drama and competitive cricket. A packed MCG, hosting over 87,000 fans, witnessed a gripping exchange between two cricketing giants. Both teams ended the second day with opportunities and challenges as the Test match unfolded with intriguing subplots both on and off the field.

The 92-year-old renowned economist was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi on Thursday evening following a ""sudden loss of consciousness,"" the hospital said in a statement. Sporting icons such as Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag led the tributes to Manmohan Singh, joined by Vinesh Phogat, Dodda Ganesh, Gutta Jwala, and others, remembering him as a leader whose wisdom and humility inspired many.

Steve Smith remained unbeaten on 68, with tailender Pat Cummins on eight. Despite sailing past 150 for the loss of just one wicket, Australia found themselves only narrowly ahead by stumps.

Khawaja pulled a delivery from Jasprit Bumrah straight to KL Rahul at midwicket, departing for 57 before tea. Labuschagne followed, caught for 72 while attempting to slog all-rounder Washington Sundar over mid-off.

The incident occurred after the 19-year-old Konstas stunned India with his sensational stroke play, taking on Jasprit Bumrah and scoring a quickfire 65-ball 60. In the 10th over, while crossing paths, Kohli and Konstas bumped shoulders, exchanged glances, and engaged in a brief but heated verbal exchange.  Australian opener Usman Khawaja immediately intervened, placing his arm around Kohli to separate the two. The on-field umpires also stepped in, calming the situation quickly. After the incident, Kohli was charged with breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct and accepted the sanctions proposed by match referee Andy Pycroft. The Indian batting star was also fined 20% of his match fee. ""Not a great look I mean you know physical contact on the cricket field is a complete no-no, so it wasn't great,"" Hockley told SEN Radio. ""I think clearly Virat in accepting the charge has taken responsibility,"" he added. Konstas downplayed the incident, explaining that Kohli had accidentally bumped into him, a response Hockley considered remarkably mature for a teenager. ""I actually thought Sam showed maturity beyond his years and was actually very kind of gracious to brush it off,"" Hockley said. ""What it does is it highlights just the intensity of the competition but also just how much is at stake in this series but yeah not a great look,"" he added. Kohli also received one demerit point from the ICC. When asked whether the penalty was sufficient, Hockley left it to the officials. ""I think that’s for the for the officials.

Shastri noted that the over-the-top reaction reflects the desperation of the home side, given their winless run against India in the high-stakes Boxing Day clashes. A clip of the sports page from a popular Australian newspaper went viral on social media on Friday morning. The headline of the piece read 'Clown Kohli', accompanied by a photo of the Indian superstar with a 'clown's nose'. It also stated, ""Indian sook slammed for pathetic bump in teen's dream Test debut,"" referring to Kohli's shoulder contact with the young Konstas. Former Australian cricketers also criticised Virat Kohli, condemning the senior batter's gesture, which led to sanctions from the International Cricket Council. While it was speculated that Kohli might face a Test ban for a Level 2 offence, the Indian batting star avoided suspension and was fined 20 per cent of his match fee by match referee Andy Pycroft on Thursday. ""You expect that in a home country. I wish our country would stand up for our players in situations like this in a bigger way. I am not surprised by this at all, simply because Australia hasn’t won here in 14–15 years. The last time they won a Test match at the MCG was in 2011. So, when they get an opportunity to go berserk, they will go berserk,"" Ravi Shastri told Star Sports. ""In many ways, it’s a little bit of desperation. You know, you are three matches into the series, the scoreline is 1–1, and you have still not won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. ""You know, you’ve got to win at Melbourne. So, all these things creep in. ""I’ve been to Australia many, many times. It’s like the whole country comes behind the team—not just the crowds, but the media as well. I am not surprised because I see that sense of desperation. If Australia had already been 3–0 or 2–0 up, the headlines might have been different.

Shastri recalled the 2018 incident involving Kagiso Rabada and Steve Smith, highlighting how the South African pacer’s one-match ban was overturned and the punishment reduced to a 25 per cent match fee after appeals. Shastri noted that precedents have been set for such breaches of the code of conduct. ""Like I said, the match referee has done his job; the fine has been set at 20% of his match fee,"" Shastri said.  ""There's a precedent. You know, there was a confrontation between Kagiso Rabada and Steve Smith that was more physical. Rabada was charged with a Level 3 punishment, and then he went and appealed. It was brought down to Level 1 and a 20% fine. ""So, there's a benchmark set. The umpires have a record of the players over the last few years regarding how often players have offended the laws. There are some points given there. A voting process takes place, and then they come up with a decision. Then it goes to the ICC technical committee, which makes the final call. ""So, they would have gone through all that. As I mentioned, there must be a benchmark somewhere, and a lot would have had to do with the Steve Smith and Rabada confrontation to bring it down to Level 1 and impose the punishment. ""It’s been handed over to the match referee, and you can do nothing about it,"" Shastri added.

Kohli walked up to the former Australian captain and patted him on the back after Smith scored his 34th Test hundred on Day 2 at the MCG. Kohli's sportsmanlike gesture came after the Indian star was booed by the crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Currently, Kohli is facing a challenging time in Australia. His batting form has dipped, and controversies have added to his woes. With this potentially being Kohli's last tour of Australia as an Indian cricketer, it's imperative for him to regain his form and contribute to his team's success. The International Cricket Council (ICC) fined Kohli 20% of his match fees and handed him one demerit point for shoulder-charging Australian youngster Sam Konstas during the opening day of the Test. The ICC's Code of Conduct, specifically Article 2.12, emphasises that cricket is not a contact sport and prohibits such physical nudges. Meanwhile, Smith capitalised on a lacklustre Indian performance, cruising to his 34th Test century and guiding Australia to a commanding 454 for 7 at lunch on the second day of the fourth Test on Friday. Smith, unbeaten on 139 off 194 balls, resumed the day on 68 from 111 balls. He needed just 56 deliveries in the morning session to reach his century, equalling the legendary Sunil Gavaskar's record of 34 Test hundreds. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 2 Live The Australian stalwart registered his 11th Test century against India—the most by any batter—during the fourth match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the MCG on Friday. Smith achieved this feat in 167 balls, hitting two sixes and nine fours. Notably, it was his fifth century at the iconic venue, where his highest score remains 192 against India. Smith's 34th Test century places him amongst the elite in cricket history. He is now tied with legends like Sunil Gavaskar, Mahela Jayawardene, Brian Lara, and Younis Khan in the list of top Test century-makers.

Rohit was dismissed for 3 as early as the second over of the Indian innings. He did not appear fully focused, falling to a loose shot on Day 2 of the Test match. The poor run of form with the bat continued as the Indian captain's return to the top of the order ended in disappointment. Rohit played a tentative half-pull to a delivery from Pat Cummins that pitched short and held up slightly on the surface. AUS vs IND, 4th Test Day 2 Updates The India captain has managed only 22 runs in four innings so far in the series, with scores of 3, 6, 10, and 3. Rohit appeared low on intensity, and his shot lacked conviction, ending his five-ball stay at the crease.

— GANESH (@TheWorldlyO) December 27, 2024 Questions have been raised about Rohit Sharma's contributions to the Test team, particularly after he moved down to the middle order and failed with the bat in Adelaide and Brisbane. Rohit had opted not to open the innings to allow KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal to play at the top of the order. However, in Melbourne, the batting order was reshuffled after India dropped Shubman Gill, and Rohit returned to the top of the order, only to fail to make an impact.

Since Rohit returned to the side in Adelaide, things have not worked out in India's favour.  Earlier in the day, Rohit Sharma's captaincy was questioned over his usage of bowlers as Australia went on to make a massive total of 474 in their first innings. India conceded 143 runs in the first session, taking the attack to the Indian attack that looked hapless.  ""All the way, Australia. I think India ran out of ideas. There is absolutely no doubt about that. Australia came in with a game plan -- 'let us try and don't lose any wicket in the first 45 minutes and score 50-60 runs'. They were 311 for 6. Their first aim would have been 350. But, the rate at which they scored runs, it made their job far easier,"" Ravi Shastri said on Friday, criticising Rohit's captaincy.  Rohit's numbers with the bat in 2024 in Test cricket has been far from impressive.

Rohit's ongoing struggles with form were evident, and his dismissal epitomised a batter desperately searching for answers. Facing a short-of-length delivery outside off, Rohit attempted an awkward pull shot. It was a half-hearted effort, resulting in a mistimed top-edge that ballooned towards mid-on. Scott Boland made no mistake, completing a straightforward catch to send Rohit back to the pavilion. This experiment of opening alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal, seemingly an effort to revitalise his approach, failed to bear fruit for Rohit as his series scores now read a disappointing 3, 6, 10, and 3. Rohit's struggles against Cummins in Test cricket have become a recurring theme, with the statistics painting a stark picture of his challenges. Rohit has faced 199 deliveries, scoring just 127 runs while being dismissed seven times by Cummins in 13 innings. ""That's just a lazy, not switched on, not up for the moment type of shot,"" Ricky Ponting said on Seven Cricket.

It's not committed, not really looking to be aggressive, he's just looking to tap it on the head. ""Might have held in the wicket yes, it might have seamed away from him a  fraction. But if you're going to survive against this Australian attack, you've got to be switched on. ""You've got to be making good decisions. If you're not, they'll knock you over every time."" Earlier on Day 2, Rohit was slammed for his puzzling captaincy strategies and selection decisions during the Melbourne Test. The Indian captain's choice to bring Washington Sundar back into India's playing XI for the Boxing Day Test—at the expense of Shubman Gill—has been repeatedly questioned. From the utilisation of his bowlers to the match-ups deployed against various Australian batters, Rohit struggled to maximise India's bowling potential over the first two days. Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri criticised both Rohit and head coach Gautam Gambhir for including two spinners in the playing XI, as their lack of faith in the spinners was evident. Steve Smith's century powered Australia to a commanding 474 in their first innings on Day 2 of the Boxing Day Test against India. The Indians, who had clawed their way back into the game during the final session of Day 1, failed to dislodge the overnight pair of Smith and skipper Pat Cummins (49 off 63 balls). The duo added 112 runs for the seventh wicket, nullifying the slight advantage Jasprit Bumrah had provided his team earlier.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Tune InRead More |  Virat Kohli depicted as clown in Australian newspaper, Ravi Shastri reacts

""It doesn't matter who you are; that sort of behaviour is unacceptable,"" Waugh said on Fox Cricket. ""He's extremely lucky the penalty was so lenient ... it could easily have been deemed a Level 2 offence. ""The fine should be at least 75% of the match fee if you're going to impose a monetary penalty. Incidents like this could escalate, involving players or even the crowd, especially in hostile environments. Physical contact of this nature is simply not acceptable."" ICC match referee Andy Pycroft classified the incident as a Level 1 offence, resulting in a 20 percent fine on Kohli's match fee and the addition of a demerit point. Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand and a maximum penalty of 50% of the player's match fee, along with one or two demerit points. On-field umpires Joel Wilson and Michael Gough, third umpire Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid, and fourth umpire Shawn Craig brought the charge against Kohli. Kohli was found to have breached Article 2.12 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which pertains to ""inappropriate physical contact with a Player, Player Support Personnel, Umpire, Match Referee, or any other person (including a spectator) during an International Match."" The incident occurred at the end of the 10th over of Australia's innings on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne when Kohli walked up to batter Sam Konstas and negligently bumped shoulders with him. Kohli admitted to the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Andy Pycroft of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees, eliminating the need for a formal hearing. Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, speaking on the same pre-match show, expressed hope that Kohli would not be remembered for this incident. ""That's just a slap on the wrist. These players are highly paid professionals, so any fines must serve as a deterrent. I understand the ICC match referee followed the rulebook and the playing conditions, but I hope Kohli, one of the greatest players in the world, is remembered for his incredible achievements with the bat, not for this,"" Gavaskar said.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Read More |  Rohit Sharma, please retire: Fans hurt after India captain fails in MCG Test

Gavaskar quoted instances of players getting similar sanctions for physical contact on the field, stressing that protocols were followed in Kohli's case as well. Speculation was rife that Virat Kohli would be handed a one-match ban for shouldering 19-year-old Sam Konstas at the MCG in a heated on-field moment. However, Kohli escaped a suspension and was fined 20 percent of his match fee. Match referee Andy Pycroft charged him for Level 1 offence, the lowest level of punishment for physical contact on the field.  A section of the Australian media, however, hit out against the governing body, accusing it of being lenient towards Virat Kohli. Former cricketers Ricky Ponting and Mark Waugh lashed out at the authorities for not handing Kohli a harsher punishment for the Boxing Day act.  ""Yes, you would say that the punishment may be light, considering the experience that he has had. But, that’s the maximum punishment that is decided by the ICC, He has not been done any favour,"" Sunil Gavaskar told Star Sports.  ""If, for example, the fine was 10 percent, then you could have said ‘ah, he has been done a favour’. But, the fine for a Level 1 offence is maximum a 20 percent. I am not 100 percent on that, but I am given to understand that there is one demerit point and a fine. That’s the maximum allowed, that’s what has been levied on him. ""No special favours have been done to him. You can’t hang a man for picking someone’s picket. That’s what the Australian media is asking for. ""The Australian media think they got away because he is Kohli. But, that is not the thing,"" he added.  Virat Kohli was handed a demerit point for the offence. It was the former captain's first ICC sanction since 2019. GAVASKAR CITES PREVIOUS INSTANCES Gavaskar highlighted how Ireland fast bowler Josh Little and Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah received similar fines for making deliberate physical contact with opposition players in the last 12 months.  While Josh Little was handed a 15 per cent match fee for making contact with Zimbabwe's Sikandar Raza in a T20I game in Harare last year, Bumrah was just reprimanded for physical contact with England batter Ollie Pope in a Test match earlier this year.  ""I know in this particular year, there have been four such incidents in which there have been fines. Last December, Ireland bowler Josh Little was fined 15 percent for a physical contact with a batter, a Level 1 offence. In that game, Andy Pycrot was the match referee.

United suffered their fourth loss in five matches to languish in 14th place, just eight points clear of the relegation zone. The Portuguese manager, who replaced Erik ten Hag six weeks ago, pointed to limited time to train with his players as a key reason for the team's struggles. Amorim has become the first United boss since Walter Crickmer in 1932 to lose five of his first 10 games across all competitions. ""I manage, but I didn't train [the players],"" Amorim said. ""They need time to adapt to the new style of play. Without results, it's even harder for them to believe in the process. Right now, we just have to survive and win time to work on the team. It's a long journey."" Wolves took the lead through Matheus Cunha's 58th-minute corner, which curled over United goalkeeper André Onana and into the net-a strikingly similar mistake to one made during United's Carabao Cup exit against Tottenham. Wolves manager V­tor Pereira, who has now overseen back-to-back wins since succeeding Gary O'Neil, credited tactical planning for the goal. ""We analysed their weaknesses,"" Pereira said. ""Cunha is a special player who made the difference."" United's task was made even harder when captain Bruno Fernandes received a second yellow card two minutes after halftime. Despite their numerical disadvantage, Amorim noted moments of promise but admitted the team lacked potency even before the red card. ""With 10 men, we were near the goal, which is a positive, but we lost,"" he said. Marcus Rashford was left out for a fourth consecutive match, with Amorim reiterating that the forward is not in his plans. The England international has reportedly sought a ""new challenge,"" and Amorim's post-match comments suggest little chance of reconciliation. ""It's always the same reason,"" Amorim said. ""If he's not here, you can make your mind up."" When asked about qualifying for European competitions, Amorim dismissed such aspirations, stressing the need to focus on rebuilding.

Australia broke the 102-run stand between Jaiswal and Kohli to make a vital breakthrough at a critical juncture of the game. It was a rush-of-blood moment for Yashasvi Jaiswal on the last ball of the 41st over, bowled by Scott Boland. Facing a full-length delivery on off-stump, Jaiswal drove it crisply to Pat Cummins at mid-on and immediately set off for a run. At the non-striker’s end, Virat Kohli stood his ground, shouting against the single as he watched the fielder. But by then, it was too late—Jaiswal had already reached the other end. Although Cummins’ attempted direct hit missed the striker’s stumps, wicketkeeper Alex Carey showed sharp reflexes, collecting the ball and breaking the stumps to complete the run-out. AUS vs IND, 4th Test Day 2 Updates It was a disastrous moment for India, occurring just 20 minutes before stumps. Jaiswal and Kohli had rebuilt India’s innings from a precarious 51/2 to 153/2.

Jaiswal expertly handled the new ball and shifted gears seamlessly against Nathan Lyon and Mitchell Marsh. Missing out on a century after such an impressive knock would undoubtedly leave him disappointed.

Prasad also drew a link between Rohit's individual batting performance and the team's performance. Rohit managed scores of 6, 3, and 10 in his first three innings batting in the middle order. Rohit's return to the top of the order in Melbourne brought no improvement, as he was dismissed for just 3. His captaincy has also come under scrutiny, with questions raised about his field placements and bowling rotations. Rohit Sharma missed the first Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test, which India won by 295 runs in Perth, led by Jasprit Bumrah. Since Rohit returned to the side in Adelaide, things have not gone well for India. As Australia continued to pile on the runs, with Steve Smith reaching his 11th Test century against India, former BCCI chairman of selectors MSK Prasad voiced his frustration during commentary. Prasad strongly criticised Rohit’s captaincy, batting, and overall demeanour, describing him as seemingly clueless. AUS vs IND, 4th Test Day 2 Updates ""You really raised the topic of Rohit Sharma's captaincy. Heading into this series, you know, we had our 3-match series against New Zealand. It was pathetic. It never happened in the history of Indian cricket that we lost back-to-back 3 games. Rohit got absolutely no runs in that series, so he comes into this series. He didn't play the first game. Bumrah led the side very well, so Rohit comes after the backdrop of continuous failures,"" MSK Prasad said while speaking on commentary on Day 2 of Boxing Day Test. The former India wicketkeeper also highlighted Rohit's recent poor track record as a captain. After leading India to victory in the T20 World Cup, the team suffered a historic bilateral ODI series defeat to Sri Lanka after 28 years. This was followed by a painful 0-3 whitewash against New Zealand, marking India's first home series loss in 12 years. According to Prasad, Rohit's lack of innovative ideas is affecting the team, as reflected in the players' body language. Moreover, his inconsistent form with the bat has only compounded the issue. ""I personally feel that has got a direct impact, you know, if you see that, you know, captain, you know, if he comes with some sort of form that has direct impact on the side and he comes after a series of failures and that has clearly shown the way he led the side also he's not proactive on many occasions. If you see in this Test match itself, you know, he had 11 over bo bowled by Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah on a trot, especially when Sam Konstas was going tongs and tongs and that's has been the case with his captaincy. He's been struggling a bit both with his bat and also in captaincy,"" the ex-India selector added.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Read More |  Sunil Gavaskar defends Virat Kohli's fine: Can't hang a man for picking a pocket

Mohammed Siraj took 14 wickets in the first three Tests of the series, but he was guilty of lacking control and not being potent enough with the new ball. The Hyderabad fast bowler struggled to replicate his heroics from the previous tour of Australia, failing to give Jasprit Bumrah the necessary support with the red cherry. Siraj, however, got the backing of the team management to play in the fourth Test, the crucial Boxing Day affair.  However, Siraj looked far from impressive with the ball in the much-talked-about contest in Melbourne. While there was no let-up in aggression, Siraj failed to walk the talk. The fast bowler was taken to the cleaners by the Australian top order and the middle order. Melbourne Test, Day 2: Highlights | Report Siraj conceded 122 runs at a rate of 5.30 in 23 overs. He was wayward toward the end of the Australian innings, conceding two five wides, which added to the frustration of the Indian side. Siraj has conceded at 4.07 runs per over in the series, the most for a frontline pacer from both sides.  ""I think Siraj, perhaps, needs a little bit of a break.  In the sense, I am not saying a break, he needs to be told that he is left out of the team for non-performance. There has to be a situation where you can’t beat around the bush. You need to be brutally upfront and say ‘look, your performance has not been up to scratch and therefore you are being dropped’. When you start talking about ‘rest’, players get wrong ideas. They feel they don’t need to up their game,"" Sunil Gavaskar told Star Sports.  ""But I think Siraj needs te be told ‘look, you are not bowling as well as we expected you to on pitches that have been helpful’. That is something that needs to be told.  ""If you want to make two changes. Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana to support Jasprit Bumrah. By all means, do that,"" he added. India conceded a mammoth first-innings total of 474 to Australia in Melbourne. Jasprit Bumrah also looked shaken on Day 1 after 19-year-old opener Sam Konstas took him by surprise with an unorthodox assault. Bumrah, however, recovered well and finished with 4 for 99 in 28.4 overs.

3a0c1293-9a4b-4a2d-a6bc-5cd7412e4f0c,How 30 minutes of madness spoilt Virat-Yashasvi's hard-work on Day 2A late batting collapse in the final session of Day 2 spoilt all the hard work done by Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli during their 102-run stand for the third wicket. India were 164 for 5 against Australia on day two of the fourth Test on Friday.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-yashasvi-virat-hard-work-spoilt-late-india-collapse-mcg-test-2656155-2024-12-27,"India's late batting collapse in the final session undid all the hard work put in by Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli to hand Australia the advantage on Day 2 of the Boxing Day Test. Kohli looked in good form from the outset, showing excellent judgment in leaving balls outside off and playing late. Jaiswal struck a fluent fifty and shifted gears as the runs began to flow for India. The 100-run partnership between the duo brought the visitors right back into the contest, but then the momentum shifted. At one stage, India were cruising at 153 for 2, with Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli adding a solid 102 runs for the third wicket. However, 30 minutes of madness led to India staring down a barrel at 164 for 5 as the tourists lost three wickets in the next 11 runs. India are still 310 runs behind Australia's first-innings total of 474 and need another 111 runs to avoid the follow-on—a scenario that should never have been a concern on such a placid batting track. Melbourne Test, Day 2: Highlights Gautam Gambhir's decision to send in Akash Deep as a nightwatchman proved to be one of several questionable calls the head coach made during this game. It was a rush-of-blood moment for Yashasvi Jaiswal, who got dismissed for 82 after an unfortunate mix-up with his senior partner Kohli. Cricket's unpredictability was on full display in a matter of moments. Jaiswal pushed a ball towards mid-on and called for a quick single, with an assured Kohli (on 36) at the other end. Kohli took a step and a half forward before retreating. Pat Cummins pounced on the ball and threw accurately to the striker's end, leaving a frustrated Jaiswal visibly mouthing ""my call"" to his idol. The incident might go down as a defining moment, with Kohli later reflecting, perhaps, that a loud ""No"" could have allowed Jaiswal to return safely. After Jaiswal's dismissal, the MCG crowd rallied fervently behind Australia and their hometown hero, Scott Boland, who capitalised on India's nervousness in the final half-hour with an inspired spell. The run-out appeared to break Kohli's focus.After 85 assured balls, he poked at one delivered in the corridor of uncertainty, ending his promising 36-run innings. Boland then struck, exploiting a recurring weakness, while Akash Deep, lacking the technique to survive, fell soon after. The day, which began in Australia's favour, ended in much the same way. The Jaiswal-Kohli partnership had added a solid 102 runs and looked as composed as they had in the second innings at Perth, but it was not enough to steer India clear of trouble.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Read More |  Watch: Nathan Lyon sledges KL Rahul after batter drops to No.3 for Rohit Sharma

The incident happened on Day 2 of the Boxing Day Test match when Virat Kohli was walking back to the pavilion after getting dismissed by Scott Boland. Kohli was booed by a section of the MCG fans, which triggered the senior batter. Kohli turned around after entering the MCG tunnel and proceeded to stare down the people that were jeering him. Fortunately, before things got out of hand, a member of the MCG security arrived at the place and calmed Virat Kohli down - taking him through the tunnel. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 2 Highlights | Full Scorecard
 
 The home fans at the MCG Stadium have been boing Kohli from Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test match. The jeering started after Virat Kohli shouldered 19-year-old Sam Konstas, who was making his debut for Australia on Boxing Day in Melbourne. Many argued that Kohli's act was unbecoming of a player of his stature and inappropriate for the occasion. The incident happened in the first hour of play between India and Australia on Day 1 of the MCG Test.  After Konstas targetted Jasprit Bumrah early in the innings, hitting him for multiple sixes, Kohli proceeded to rile up the young batter. The duo crossed paths between the 9th and 10th over of the Australian innings.  Walking in opposite directions near the pitch, neither gave way, resulting in a deliberate shoulder bump. Kohli stopped and turned, seemingly challenging the young batter, while Konstas did not back down. A verbal exchange ensued, drawing the attention of Usman Khawaja, who diffused the situation with a smile and an arm around Kohli. Match officials intervened to calm things further. ""Have a look where Virat walks. Virat walked one whole pitch over to his right and instigated that confrontation. No doubt in my mind whatsoever,"" Ricky Ponting said in the commentary.Virat Kohli's Terrible Final Half Hour on Day 2 Virat Kohli batted really well with Yashasvi Jaiswal in the final session of the Test match. However, they were not able to close the day on a strong note. After completing a 100-run partnership, Kohli was involved in a terrible mix-up with Yashasvi Jaiswal which resulted in a run-out of the young left hander. Only 7 balls later, Virat Kohli also went back to the pavilion after edging Scott Boland to the keeper. As Kohli was going out, he got involved in one more incident with fans, mentioned above.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also Read |  https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-day-2-score-melbourne-virat-kohli-yashsavi-jaiswal-late-collapse-rohit-2656124-2024-12-27Must Watch

Manjrekar pointed out that Rohit’s decision to promote himself to the opening slot disturbed the chemistry of the in-form duo, KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who had opened for India in the first three Tests of the series. Rahul and Jaiswal showed glimpses of promise as openers in Perth, Adelaide, and Brisbane, but their rhythm was interrupted when Rohit returned to the top of the order. While commentating the match on Star Sports, Manjrekar emphasised that this tactical shift backfired as Rohit managed just 3 runs in his return to the role. In contrast, Rahul and Jaiswal displayed greater stability, scoring 24 and 82 runs, respectively, in the first innings. Melbourne Test, Day 2: Highlights ""When you play well against Australia, you are respected a lot. KL Rahul, who has been India's best batter in this series, has scored runs at the top, put on a record stand as well. India moved him out of his preferred position just so that Rohit Sharma can get an opportunity to return to form This is the wrong way of thinking,"" Sanjay Manjrekar said on Star Sports during commentary ""Rohit Sharma had said in the press conference that he does not wish to disturb the positions of Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul. But, when the match began, he certainly disturbed it,"" he added. India’s bowling unit once again shouldered the responsibility of containing Australia, with Jasprit Bumrah delivering a stellar 4/99 spell and Ravindra Jadeja contributing 3/78. Despite their efforts, Australia posted a formidable 474, leaving India’s batting lineup with a daunting task. Rohit’s early exit placed additional pressure on Rahul and Jaiswal. After Rahul was dismissed by Pat Cummins, Jaiswal formed a crucial 102-run partnership with Virat Kohli. However, their efforts were undone by a disastrous mix-up that led to Jaiswal’s run-out on 82. The dismissal marked a turning point, with Kohli falling soon after for 32, edging a delivery outside off stump to the wicketkeeper—a recurring issue in his recent form. India’s batting woes deepened as nightwatchman Akash Deep failed to contribute, departing for a duck. At stumps on Day 2, India found themselves in a precarious position at 156/5, still trailing Australia by 310 runs. The onus now lies on Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja, the unbeaten batsmen at the crease, to mount a recovery on Day 3. With the series on the line, Manjrekar’s criticism underscores the challenges India faces in striking the right balance and overcoming key tactical missteps.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also Read |  Virat Kohli depicted as clown in Australian newspaper, Ravi Shastri reacts

Australia edged ahead and seized control of the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, outplaying India with both bat and ball on Day 2. After posting a mammoth total of 474, Australia had India struggling at 164 for 4 at stumps, still trailing by 310 runs. India collapsed late in the day's play, losing control. They lost three wickets, including the well-set Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli, for just 11 runs. Yashasvi was run out for 82, a moment that could prove to be a turning point in the series. India appeared poised for a strong fightback with the bat at 153 for 2, but a chaotic 40 minutes saw the visitors take two significant blows and retreat to the dressing room deflated. Melbourne Test, Day 2: Highlights India had a forgettable first two sessions as their bowling unit's over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah was exposed once again. Steve Smith smashed his second successive hundred of the series, lighting up the Boxing Day Test crowd at one of his favourite hunting grounds. Captain Pat Cummins rubbed salt into India's wounds, chipping in with 49 before the lower-order batters chipped in to stretch the Australian first-innings total to a potentially match-winning zone - Australia last lost a Test match at the MCG after posting 400 or more in the first innings in 1953!  India did all the hard yards to recover from the horror bowling show and the early dismissal of their captain Rohit Sharma, who was clueless both with his tactics and with the bat in hand. Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul led India's resistance with the bat, seeing off a fiery new ball spell from the three quicks - Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland.SERIES-DEFINING RUN-OUT? However, all the hard work went down the drain after a moment of madness in the field -- Yashasvi Jaiswal's run-out in the last 45 minutes. Just after Jaiswal and Virat Kohli stitched a 100-run stand, Yashasvi was run out for 82.

— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) December 27, 2024 The young opener, who showcased a lot of grit and determination after successive failures in Adelaide and Perth, called for a quick single, but his partner -- Kohli -- did not respond to the call. Yashasvi and Kohli were at the same end after a horrible mix-up following which the former was run out at the striker's end.  Virat Kohli looked gutted for not responding to the call, but he gestured to Yashasvi Jaiswal that there was no real chance of stealing a run there as the ball was hit straight to Pat Cummins at mid-on.  Following Jaiswal's exit, the MCG crowd got fully behind Australia and the local hero, Scott Boland, who charged in and made the most of India's nervousness in the last 30 minutes.  Kohli, who appeared to put behind his troubles against the deliveries in the uncertainty corridor, paid the price for a moment of lapse in concentration. The former captain poked at one bowled in the sixth stump line to depart for 36. Boland's plan worked and Australia rejoiced the big wicket, which signalled the complete shift in momentum.

Steve Smith, Australia’s batting maestro, lauded the young batter’s courage and poise, particularly for his handling of India’s formidable bowling attack led by Jasprit Bumrah. Konstas, replacing Nathan McSweeney for the 4th Test, made an immediate impact with a blistering 60 off 65 balls. Opening the innings, he showcased remarkable intent, even reverse-scooping Bumrah for six—a shot that left Smith on edge in the dressing room. Smith himself played a pivotal role in Australia’s commanding first-innings total of 474, scoring a masterful 140, but he didn’t shy away from crediting Konstas for setting the tone early in the innings. Melbourne Test, Day 2: Highlights ""I don't think much fazes the young kid, as so we saw yesterday. He was reverse ramping Bumrah for a six and I was having a heart attack up in the box. But look, I thought it was all good. No stress,"" Smith said. The debutant's maturity extended beyond his batting, as he navigated a fiery moment with his cricketing idol, Virat Kohli. During the first session, Kohli shouldered Konstas in an altercation that resulted in the Indian batter being fined 20% of his match fee by the ICC. Despite the heated exchange and subsequent media attention, Konstas remained composed, focusing on his game and contributing significantly to Australia’s dominant position. India’s response with the bat was far from ideal. Rohit Sharma, returning to the opening spot, departed cheaply, adding to the pressure on KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal. Rahul fell to Pat Cummins for a modest score, but Jaiswal steadied the innings, forming a crucial 102-run partnership with Kohli. However, a mix-up between the two led to Jaiswal’s unfortunate run-out on 82—a turning point in India’s innings. Kohli, who had looked promising, soon fell for 32, edging a delivery well outside off-stump to the wicketkeeper, continuing his struggles with the same dismissal pattern.

Rohit, returning to the opening role, continued to face mounting scrutiny over his form in Test cricket. Rohit’s decision to open alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal, relegating KL Rahul to number 3, backfired as he managed only 3 runs before falling to Australian captain Pat Cummins. Gavaskar, speaking to Star Sports, pointed out Rohit’s diminishing reflexes, particularly evident in his ill-timed dismissal. Facing a short-of-length delivery outside off, Rohit attempted a pull shot, resulting in a mistimed top-edge caught comfortably by Scott Boland at mid-on. Melbourne Test, Day 2: Highlights ""That's a shot that he normally plays. The half-pull off the front foot. I think he probably got in two minds whether to go for the proper pull shot or not and then ended up just trying to tap it like catching practice. But that's what happens when you have a gap, when you're 36, 37-years-old and you have a long gap between playing cricket,"" Sunil Gavaskar said on Rohit's dismissal. ""That is the reason why you're seeing that there is probably not the same sort of footwork as you would expect, because your body is such as you get older. It reacts just a little bit slower. You know, the mind is there. Everything the mind tells you, but the body just doesn't do that. So, if you're being continuous at the age of 37, regularly, no problem. Because you know your bat-speed, everything. The moment you have a break, you must be very, very careful, very, very mindful,"" he added.

""Fortunately, Boland got one to straighten off the line from that fifth-sixth stump line and it was only one of the only ones he played at. Fortunate to catch the edge,"" Smith explained, saying Kohli got out due to a momentary lapse in concentration. Kohli's wicket came moments after he was involved in a horrible mix-up with Yashasvi Jaiswal that saw the young opener getting run out for 82. Jaiswal tapped a delivery from Boland towards mid-on and set off for a single—a dangerous one. He made the call, but Kohli was not interested, leading to the disastrous run-out. Kohli, who had looked focused and in the zone before the run-out, poked at one outside the off-stump towards the end of the day's play. India lost three wickets for just 11 runs as they went from 153 for 2 to 164 for 5 at stumps on Day 2. Forty minutes of madness meant India conceded the momentum they had managed to build. With three more days to go in the Test, India are 310 runs behind. A Kohli masterclass could have made it look different.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Tune InTrending Reel

Deepti became the first Indian woman cricketer to take two six-wicket hauls in ODIs, joining South Africa's Sune Luus as the only other woman to achieve this feat.   West Indies, electing to bat first, collapsed to a modest total of 162 in just 38.5 overs. The Indian bowling attack, spearheaded by Renuka Singh Thakur, started strong. Renuka struck on the first ball of the match, dismissing Qiana Joseph with a gloved strangle down the leg side. In the same over, skipper Hayley Matthews was bowled by a nip-backer.

However, their aggressive approach against the spinners backfired, with Campbelle falling to Deepti. Henry reached her half-century but was also undone by Deepti's brilliance. The Indian all-rounder spun a web around the lower order, ensuring West Indies folded with just two bowlers - Deepti and Renuka - sharing all 10 wickets.Deepti's all-round show Chasing 163, India's batting lineup faced some hiccups but remained in control. Deepti, continuing her all-round display, top-scored with an unbeaten 39 off 48 balls, ensuring the hosts crossed the finish line in 28.2 overs with five wickets to spare.   Deepti's heroics not only sealed the victory but also elevated her career tally to 123 wickets in 98 ODIs, including three five-wicket hauls, two of which are six-wicket performances. Her previous best of 6 for 20 came against Sri Lanka in 2016.   This series offered valuable preparation for India as they gear up to host the ODI World Cup 2025. Contributions from Smriti Mandhana, Renuka Singh, Richa Ghosh, Harleen Deol, and Jemimah Rodrigues have added to the team's momentum. For West Indies, however, their batting frailties were once again exposed, leaving much to ponder.  Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Must Watch

Notably, Rohit was dismissed for 3 (5) on Day 4 in Melbourne as he miscued a pull shot against Scott Boland which was safely caught by Pat Cummins at mid wicket. As a result, his prolonged poor form continued in the series as he’s scored just 22 runs from four innings so far at an average of 5.50. Analysing his performance at the end of the day, Waugh mentioned that if the opening batter doesn’t do anything in the remaining matches, his career will definitely come to an end. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 2 Highlights | Full Scorecard “Unless Rohit Sharma can do something in the last three innings, I think his career could certainly be coming to an end,” Waugh said on Fox Sports. Another former Australia cricketer Kerry O Keefe also criticised Rohit’s shot and mentioned that it was too early in his innings to play that. “That was a really big mistake from Rohit Sharma. It is a nothing shot. It is one of his favourite shots, Rohit Sharma, the swivel-pull. It was too early in the innings. He has not got used to the pace or the bounce. It is a sad state for the Indian captain,” said Kerry O’Keeffe.Rohit demoted KL Rahul to make himself open Rohit promoted himself to open the innings in Melbourne after struggling to score at number six in the last two matches. As a result, India had to make multiple changes in the batting lineup as KL Rahul, who had been exceptional at the top of the order, demoted himself at number 3. The shift didn’t help Rahul at all as he also had to return to the pavilion after scoring just 24 (42). Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage As a result, India were left reeling at 51/2 when Virat Kohli joined Yashasvi Jaiswal at the crease. The duo added 102 runs for the third wicket before Jaiswal was unfortunately run out due to a miscommunication between both batters. The dismissal triggered another collapse as Kohli (36) and Akash Deep departed cheaply. Courtesy of some late wickets, India finished the day on 164/5 with Rishabh Pant (6*) and Ravindra Jadeja (4*) at the crease.Published By: Published On: Dec 27, 2024Also Read |  Angry Virat Kohli confronts booing MCG fans, calmed by security officer

With the hosts in control, the batter flipped the bails in an attempt to change his team’s fortunes. While the move did not yield an instant wicket, it added a moment of levity to an otherwise challenging day for the visitors. The Proteas dominated the opening two days of the match, courtesy of Dane Paterson’s five-wicket haul and debutant Corbin Bosch’s four scalps. Despite a fighting 51-run knock from Kamran Ghulam, Pakistan’s batting lineup faltered. South Africa’s Aiden Markram capitalised on the conditions, crafting a fluent half-century to help his team surpass the 150-run mark with ease. While the bail-switching trend may and may not have a proven impact on results, it highlights the lighter side of the intensely competitive Test arena. For Babar Azam, it was a playful nod to an emerging cricketing ritual.

Notably, the duo looked solid at the crease, having added over 100 runs for the third wicket. However, their partnership came to an unfortunate end due to a terrible miscommunication which led to Jaiswal getting run out for 82. The incident left the cricketing fraternity divided with one section of fans blaming Kohli while the others blamed Jaiswal. Sunil Gavaskar also weighed in his opinion and mentioned that, given Virat Kohli’s fitness, he would’ve definitely made it to the striker’s end. However, he maintained that there was no need for a risky run at that stage. ""It would have been a quick run, and somebody like Virat Kohli would definitely have made it. But the thing was, he looked at the fielder. When you look at the fielder, when you turn, you've lost that vital second. And so naturally, you then think, 'No, I want to be able to make it.' Your balance is completely off. And it would have been a tight run. I think at that stage, why do you need to take a run that carries an element of risk? You're batting well, runs are coming. At that stage, the risk was not really necessary. But it could have been completed only because Kohli is such a fantastic runner between the wickets,” said Gavaskar on Star Sports. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 2 Highlights | Full Scorecard Justin Langer also agreed with Gavaskar and said that Jaiswal should not have taken on a brilliant athlete of Pat Cummins’calibre.As fast as Kohli is, I thought it was too risky a run to take: Langer ""I thought it was a risky run because Pat Cummins is a brilliant athlete. Even if he hadn't picked it up, in the head of Pat Cummins, he would have gone for the non-striker. It would have been close, but I thought it was a risky run. At that stage of the game, there was no need for it. They were on top. They had it absolutely under control. As fast as he is, I thought it was too risky a run to take. I love seeing guys drop and run hard, but that was a risky run. I think that's what Virat was saying,” he added.

 ""18 years ago today I batted at the MCG with my best mate wearing our baggy green caps for Australia. He made his first test 100!

Konstas joined an elite group of Australian cricketers who debuted against India and scored fifty-plus runs. His brisk half-century, achieved in just 52 balls, made him the youngest Australian in over seven decades to accomplish such a feat, cementing his name in the history books alongside legends like Michael Clarke and Darren Lehmann.Symonds’s Memorable MCG Knock in 2006 Symonds’s maiden Test hundred in 2006 was a career-defining moment. Recalled midway through the Ashes series, Symonds delivered a match-winning 156 off 220 balls in front of an electrified MCG crowd. Known for his explosive batting, he brought up his hundred with a stylish six off none other than Paul Collingwood, showcasing his signature flair. The innings, which came during a game remembered for Shane Warne’s 700th Test wicket, marked the turning point in Symonds’s career, as he went on to average over 60 for the remainder of his 26-match Test career.India’s Struggles in Melbourne In response to Australia’s imposing 474, India’s batting lineup faltered under pressure.

Khurram Shahzad and Mohammad Abbas bowled with precision, sharing key wickets, while Naseem Shah chipped in despite looking slightly off-colour. However, the inability to finish off the tail hurt Pakistan’s chances. Fatigue among their specialist bowlers was evident as Bosch capitalised on loose deliveries to steer South Africa into a position of strength. Bosch’s heroics placed him atop an illustrious list of No. 9 batters who have made a mark on their debut. He surpassed Sri Lanka’s Rathnayake, who scored 72 against England earlier this year, and India’s Balwinder Sandhu, who hit 71 against Pakistan in 1983. The innings came to an end when Paterson mistimed a shot off Saim Ayub, leaving Bosch stranded on 81. Nevertheless, his efforts ensured South Africa entered the second innings with momentum. With a 90-run lead on a pitch showing uneven bounce, South Africa now have a significant edge. Pakistan’s batters will need to regroup quickly in their second innings to stay in the contest. Bosch’s all-round show, combining historical batting with key contributions on the field, set the tone for an exciting conclusion to this Boxing Day Test.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also Read |  Feels like grade cricket: Nathan Lyon reveals Sam Konstas' debut verdict vs India

The scoreboard, weighed down by another underwhelming display from the top order, now rests on the broad shoulders of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja. At stumps, India stood at 164/5, their position largely owing to Yashasvi Jaiswal’s resilient 82 during a 102-run partnership with Kohli. However, a disastrous mix-up saw Jaiswal run out, leaving the team in deeper trouble. Kohli soon followed, falling to a familiar pattern of edging a delivery outside off stump. Melbourne Test, Day 2: Highlights With the likes of Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, and Virat Kohli faltering yet again, Pant and Jadeja hold the slimmest hope of steering India out of the quicksand they find themselves sinking into. But while the situation looks grim, history has proven that these two are no strangers to improbable recoveries. While the odds now heavily favour Pat Cummins-led Australia, Indian fans can draw hope from Pant and Jadeja’s history of defying the odds. Their remarkable 222-run partnership at Edgbaston in 2022 stands as a testament to their ability to perform under pressure.Jadeja-Pant’s Heroics at Edgbaston In the 2022 Edgbaston Test against England, India found themselves reeling at 98/5 after James Anderson’s brilliant opening spell. However, Pant’s aggressive counter-attack and Jadeja’s steady support turned the game around.  Pant unleashed a flurry of boundaries, including audacious shots off pacers and spinners alike. The left-hander danced down the pitch, taking on James Anderson and Jack Leach with fearless abandon. His partner, Jadeja, stood resolute at the other end, providing a much-needed anchor with his first and only century in SENA countries during his 104 off 194 balls. At Edgbaston, Pant’s 146 off 111 balls was a masterpiece of controlled aggression, while Jadeja’s unflappable demeanour complemented him perfectly. The duo added 222 runs for the sixth wicket—the highest sixth-wicket partnership by an Indian pair in England. Pant’s sensational 146 off just 111 balls ended when he was dismissed by Joe Root, but his innings had already shifted the momentum. That partnership may not have secured a victory, but it showcased a template of resilience and counterattack—a blueprint Pant and Jadeja will aim to replicate in Melbourne. Melbourne Test So Far India’s bowling unit, led by Jasprit Bumrah’s 4/99 and Jadeja’s 3/78, worked hard to restrict Australia to 474. However, the batting lineup faltered once again, with Rohit Sharma dismissed cheaply for just 3 runs. KL Rahul also failed to capitalize, leaving Jaiswal and Kohli to anchor the innings briefly. Jaiswal’s run-out and Kohli’s soft dismissal compounded India’s woes. Nightwatchman Akash Deep added no runs, leaving India in a precarious position. With Pant and Jadeja unbeaten at the crease, Day 3 offers a slim window for India to stage a comeback. Their partnership will need to channel the spirit of Edgbaston to overcome a challenging Australian attack in this Test match and keep India in the fight for their spot in the World Test Championship Final.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also Read |  Age making Rohit Sharma slower: Sunil Gavaskar decodes India skipper's struggles

The India speedster has been the standout bowler on the tour so far across both teams, having picked up 25 wickets from four matches (7 innings) so far at an average of 13.12 and a strike rate of 28. However, Bumrah hasn’t got any support from the rest of his bowlers apart from the Perth Test and has fought a lone battle against the Aussies. Even on Day 2 of the ongoing Test in Melbourne, the pace spearhead was constantly building pressure with his tight line and length. But at the other end, Akash Deep and Mohammed Siraj continued to leak runs allowing Australian batters to release the pressure. On Day 1 as well, when Bumrah was taken to the cleaners by Sam Konstas, no other seamer rose to the occasion and could dismiss the debutant. The most disappointing amongst the Indian bowlers was Mohammed Siraj, who has looked like a pale shadow of himself. Siraj has picked up 13 wickets from four matches so far at an average of 33.30, economy of 4.07 and a strike rate of 49. In the Melbourne Test, Siraj remained wicket-less in the first innings, leaking 122 runs from 23 overs. His performance even made legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar ask for his removal from the team. ""I think Siraj, perhaps, needs a little bit of a break. In the sense, I am not saying a break, he needs to be told that he is left out of the team for non-performance. There has to be a situation where you can’t beat around the bush. You need to be brutally upfront and say ‘look, your performance has not been up to scratch and therefore you are being dropped’. When you start talking about ‘rest’, players get wrong ideas. They feel they don’t need to up their game. But I think Siraj needs te be told ‘look, you are not bowling as well as we expected you to on pitches that have been helpful’. That is something that needs to be told,” Sunil Gavaskar told Star Sports. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 2 Highlights | Full ScorecardAkash Deep's strike rate a major issue Apart from him, Akash Deep picked up 2/94 in 26 overs. However, Gavaskar was displeased with the right-arm seamer as well and highlighted his poor strike rate. Notably, Akash has a strike rate of 43.40 and an economy of 3.56 in the series so far. “Harshit Rana bowled well at Perth, then he just went off the ball at Adelaide, and then he was left out of the team. Akash Deep came in, rescued you at the Gabba with his batting, but it's his bowling for which he's been picked in the team. His figures look good because he gets the ball to be a little bit outside the off stump and the batters leave it. So the figures look good, but in test cricket, you're not looking at economy, economy in test cricket, you're looking at strike rate, and the strike rate is not good,” Gavaskar told India Today in an exclusive conversation. As a result, Bumrah once again finished as the pick of the bowlers from India with figures of 4/99 in 28.4 overs. Only Ravindra Jadeja broke dangerous stands by dismissing Sam Konstas and Pat Cummins. However, the lack of support for Bumrah from other seamers meant that Australia posted a humongous score of 474.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also Read |  Angry Virat Kohli confronts booing MCG fans, calmed by security officer

Speaking to De Telegraaf on December 27, Dursun labelled such reports as ""rubbish,"" reiterating the Dutch midfielder's commitment to succeeding at Barcelona despite a season marred by injuries. De Jong's 2024/25 campaign has been far from ideal, with recurring injuries limiting his impact. Out of 13 appearances across all competitions, only two have been as a starter, and he was an unused substitute in Barcelona's last two matches before the winter break—both defeats against Leganes and Atlético Madrid. Despite these challenges, Barcelona coach Hansi Flick remains determined to reintegrate De Jong into his plans, frequently expressing his faith in the midfielder’s abilities. ""The stories about a possible move to Saudi Arabia are total nonsense...""They only distract from Frenkie's real ambition: to shine at Barça, the club he loves and where he feels at home. Both parties are happy with each other and, who knows, maybe we can stay together for a longer time..."" Drasun said. The Dutch international’s injury woes have forced Flick to explore alternative options in midfield. La Masia product Marc Casad³, alongside established talents like Pedri and Gavi, has stepped up to fill the void. Additionally, Barcelona’s new signing Dani Olmo, another promising creative force, has faced his own challenges with registration, complicating Flick’s squad rotation further. While De Jong’s potential has never been in doubt, his injury setbacks have sparked questions about his long-term role at the club. The January transfer window looms as a pivotal period, with speculation that the club might need to make a decisive call on his future. De Jong, however, remains determined to prove his worth at Barcelona. His resilience and work ethic have earned him Flick’s backing, even as the club navigates a challenging season compounded by financial pressures and squad instability. Barcelona’s next game in January 2025 offers De Jong another opportunity to reclaim his place and demonstrate why he was once considered one of Europe’s most promising midfielders. For now, both the player and his representatives are clear—his focus remains on reviving his fortunes at Camp Nou and contributing to Barcelona’s success. Whether January will bring a turning point in his career or a fresh chapter elsewhere remains to be seen.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also Read |  Manchester United just have to survive: Ruben Amorim on Boxing Day loss vs Wolves

Saim Ayub and Shan Masood put on 49 runs for the opening stand, playing aggressively against the new ball. However, the introduction of Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen turned the tide. Rabada produced a gem to dismiss Ayub, while Jansen accounted for Masood and Kamran Ghulam in quick succession. By stumps, Pakistan were 88 for 3, still trailing by two runs. Saud Shakeel (8*) and captain Babar Azam (16*) were left to anchor the innings. The pitch showed signs of variable bounce, with some deliveries keeping low, adding to the challenges for batters. Pakistan’s inability to build partnerships remains a concern, as highlighted by their poor record of opening stands. With South Africa’s bowlers finding rhythm and Pakistan’s batters under pressure, Day 3 promises to be decisive. Pakistan will need their middle order to step up if they are to set South Africa a challenging target, while the hosts will aim to exploit the conditions further.

Manjrekar’s comments come in the wake of Rohit Sharma promoting himself up the order after failing at number six in the last two Tests against Australia. Rohit’s promotion meant that KL Rahul, who had been India’s top performer after the first three Tests, had to push himself down to number 3. However, the move didn’t work well for the team as the India captain once again failed with the bat scoring just 3 while Rahul was dismissed for 24 on the brink of tea. Manjrekar expressed his disappointment on the entire matter and said that the move didn’t meet any cricketing logic. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 2 Highlights | Full Scorecard ""It's a comment that I think I've made before as well. I mean, this is something that happens a lot in the Indian cricket culture. A big-name player just to get him on track, we often sacrifice a lesser or a smaller name, and it doesn't ever make cricketing logic, or it's never best for the team. KL Rahul has been India's most consistent batter. He stitched a record partnership in Australia with Yashasvi Jaiswal,"" Manjrekar told ESPNCricinfo. Further speaking ahead, Manjrekar also recalled how a similar thing happened with Sachin Tendulkar and urged the team management to end such partial treatments emphasising how unfair it was for KL Rahul. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""Just because Rohit Sharma is out of form and is a senior player just to get him back into form and give him something different, you can't be making these kinds of changes that just reflect poorly on Indian cricket as to what is a priority for Indian cricket, and it's happened in the past as well with Tendulkar. It's time India moved away from, you know, the big-name players. Just clearing up all the space like VIP arrives, you know, so that just wasn't the right call and KL Rahul didn't get too affected by it. It was just unfair on him,"" he added. Rohit is in the worst form of his life in Tests as he’s scored just 155 runs from eight matches (14 innings) since September 2024 at an average of 11.07 with just one fifty to his name. The India skipper is under immense pressure to improve his performance and make a valuable contribution to the team as Pundits are asking him to retire from the longest format.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 27, 2024Also Read |  Angry Virat Kohli confronts booing MCG fans, calmed by security officer

However, a run-out triggered a collapse, with Kohli and night watch-man Akash Deep falling to Scott Boland late in the day. India's follow-on target remains 111 runs away, putting them under pressure heading into Day 3. The weather forecast for Day 3 in Melbourne presents mixed conditions that could impact the day's play. Here's a detailed breakdown of what to expect and whether rain might disrupt the action.Morning Session (8 AM to 12 PM) The morning begins mostly sunny, with temperatures starting at 14°C and gradually rising to 21°C by noon. Temperatures will be slightly higher, making conditions comfortable for players and fans. Rain chances remain minimal at 2%, ensuring uninterrupted play in the early hours. However, the wind, blowing from the north-west at 13-19 km/h, could aid bowlers looking for movement.Afternoon Session (12 PM to 4 PM) As the afternoon progresses, cloud cover increases. By 2 PM, rain chances rise significantly to 49%, accompanied by stronger winds from the southwest at 24-28 km/h. Showers are forecast by 3 PM, with a 57% chance of rain, and temperatures peaking at 23°C before cooling slightly. This period may see interruptions, with covers potentially coming on and off the pitch.Evening Session (4 PM to 5 PM) The final session faces lingering rain threats, with a 52% chance of showers at 4 PM and 49% at 5 PM. Temperatures will dip to around 19°C, and cloudy skies are expected to dominate. Winds will ease slightly, but conditions may remain damp, which could limit play toward the end of the day. Morning play should proceed smoothly under mostly sunny skies. Afternoon sessions could see interruptions due to increasing cloud cover and showers starting around 2-3 PM. Evening play is likely to be affected, with rain persisting late in the day. Fans can hope for uninterrupted cricket in the morning but should brace for potential delays as the weather changes. Whether rain will decisively impact the game remains to be seen, but the afternoon and evening hours pose the greatest risk.

Notably, India left out Gill to bring in all-rounder Washington Sundar in the playing XI for Melbourne. Moreover, Gill would’ve had to bat at number five or six in the batting order as Rohit decided to promote himself to open and pushed KL Rahul at number 3. However, the move didn’t work well as the India captain once again failed with the bat, scoring just 3 as he skied a pull shot straight to Pat Cummins at mid-wicket. On the other hand, Rahul was dismissed for 24 on the brink of tea. Commenting on India’s playing XI, Gavaskar said that he was left baffled as Gill was dropped as India hadn’t done well with the bat in the series so far. He further said that the selections left the team handicapped. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 2 Highlights | Full Scorecard “No, it hasn't worked for India because I think the decision for you to drop Shubman Gill when you're batting has let you down and you go into a test match with just 5 regular batters. With due respect to Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar and Nitish Reddy, they are all-rounders, but when your batting is not producing the runs then you go in with 6 batters and then you include the all-rounders, that didn't happen. So already you are handicapped, and if you were to include an extra bowler in place of a batter, that bowler, we didn't see the bowler,” Gavaskar told in an exclusive conversation with India Today. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Further speaking ahead, the legendary batter said that just to accommodate Rohit at the top of the order the entire balance of the team got upset. He also mentioned how the next three innings could well decide Rohit Sharma’s future in the Indian Test team.Rohit in the worst form of his life in Tests “So, I think that the whole selection was not correct from the beginning and now we're seeing the result of that. So basically, trying to accommodate one person, what has happened is the whole balance of the team has got upset.

Rohit is in the worst form of his life in Tests having scored just 155 runs from eight matches (14 innings) since September 2024 at an average of 11.07 with just one fifty to his name. He began the year on a great note scoring 400 runs in the five-match Test series against England on home soil which included two centuries and one fifty.

Soon after, Kohli fell victim to Scott Boland, dismissed for 36 after chasing a delivery outside off-stump. The Melbourne crowd, known for its passion and occasional hostility, booed Kohli as he walked back. An altercation with a spectator further intensified the atmosphere, with Kohli visibly reacting before being guided away by a security official.

La Liga’s Financial Fair Play restrictions, enforced by its Budget Validation Body, were instrumental in the rejection, which was upheld by several regulatory committees, including the Spanish Football Federation and UEFA Licensing Committee. ""LaLiga has today learned of the ruling... rejecting the request for the provisional registration of Dani Olmo until June 30, 2025, on the grounds that none of the necessary conditions for the adoption of an interim measure have been met,"" their statement said.Barcelona’s Financial Struggles with La Liga Barcelona is facing severe constraints due to their spending cap, which La Liga has set at 426 million euros for this season. The club’s inability to stay within this budget has resulted in restrictions on registering new players. Under La Liga’s rules, Barça can only reinvest a fraction of revenue generated from transfers or wage reductions to comply with these limits. This situation mirrors past challenges, such as their failed attempt to secure Gavi’s registration with the first team in 2023. Despite presenting a similar argument for Olmo, La Liga upheld its stance, emphasizing the importance of adhering to financial compliance.Exploring Possible Solutions To retain Olmo’s eligibility, Barcelona is working on two potential solutions. The first involves generating additional revenue through presales of VIP seating at the under-renovation Spotify Camp Nou. The second option requires a board member to provide a financial guarantee, a method previously used to register players like Jules Koundé and Jo£o Cancelo in earlier seasons. Another player in a similar situation is Pau V­ctor, a forward signed from Girona, who also faces registration issues under the same financial restrictions. Barcelona now faces a race against time to resolve their financial hurdles. Without a resolution, losing Olmo midseason could impact the team’s ambitions, leaving them with fewer options to navigate the ongoing campaign successfully.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Frenkie de Jong wants to shine at FC Barcelona: Agent brushes off Saudi links

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-rishabh-pant-dismissal-boxing-day-test-2656524-2024-12-28,"Rishabh Pant has once again become a topic of intense debate among cricket fans after his reckless dismissal on Day 3 of the Boxing Day Test against Australia at the MCG. With India in dire straits, Pant's decision to play an unorthodox scoop shot off Scott Boland's bowling has left many fans and experts questioning his temperament and approach in high-pressure situations. Known for his aggressive style and penchant for unconventional shots, Pant has delivered memorable innings in the past by playing boldly. However, in this instance, he was batting fluently with conventional cricket and had no need to take unnecessary risks. The left-hander was batting on 28 off 37 balls with three boundaries when he attempted a scoop shot against Boland's full delivery from around the wicket.AUS vs IND, Boxing Day Test: Day 3 Updates The shot resulted in a top-edge, comfortably caught by Nathan Lyon at third man. At a time when the bowlers posed no significant threat, Pant had survived the challenging early overs but inexplicably threw away his wicket. This was a turning point as Pant had just weathered 45–50 minutes of disciplined bowling, only to throw his wicket away in a moment of audacity. 

This is the sort of pitch where you get yourself out - and India are obliging. Rishabh Pant's given Scott Boland a late Christmas gift - with a ribbon on top as well. ?? #AUSvIND

— Dipanjan Chatterjee (@I_am_DipCh) December 28, 2024 This was only the second instance since June 2021 of Pant being dismissed by a right-arm pacer bowling around the wicket in Test cricket. In this innings, he faced 28 deliveries from Boland and Cummins, of which only five were bowled from that angle. It was one such delivery that led to his downfall. Pant had previously attempted a similar scoop shot and missed, despite the presence of fielders at fine leg, deep backward square, and third man. His ill-timed and poorly executed shot left him off-balance and on the ground, indicating that he was never in control. This dismissal, a mix of poor execution and questionable judgment, has sparked discussions about his approach to high-pressure situations. India began Day 3 with Ravindra Jadeja and Pant resuming at 164 for 5, facing an uphill battle to avoid the follow-on. Pant's dismissal left India reeling at 191 for 6, with Nitish Reddy joining Jadeja in the middle. Washington Sundar, the only remaining recognised batter, had yet to bat. Meanwhile, Australia, having won the toss and amassed a massive 474 in their first inning, remained firmly in control of the game.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Tune InRead More |  Sunil Gavaskar highlights Rohit Sharma's selection blunders in Melbourne Test

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/football-vinicius-jr-deserved-ballon-dor-over-rodri-cristiano-ronaldo-2656525-2024-12-28,"Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo said on Friday that it was ""unfair"" for Real Madrid's Vin­cius Jºnior to miss out on this year's award. Manchester City midfielder Rodri claimed the Ballon d'Or 2024 in October, with Vin­cius, the favorite, finishing in second place. Speaking at the Globe Soccer Awards on Friday, Ronaldo argued that Vin­cius was the rightful recipient of football's most prestigious individual honour. Vin­cius, along with his Real Madrid teammates, boycotted the Paris ceremony hosted by France Football magazine in protest of the Brazilian star's omission from the top spot. Throughout October, Vin­cius had been widely regarded as the favourite to claim the 2024 Ballon d'Or. However, on the eve of the ceremony, reports emerged indicating that the award would instead go to Rodri, whose instrumental performances had propelled Manchester City to a historic treble. This decision reportedly led the Real Madrid contingent to cancel their trip to Paris, expressing their discontent with the outcome. ""In my opinion, he [Vin­cius] deserved to win the golden ball [Ballon d'Or award],"" Ronaldo stated. ""It was unfair in my opinion. I say here in front of everybody. They give it to Rodri, he deserved it too, but they should have given it to Vin­cius because he won the Champions League and scored in the final."" Despite missing out on the Ballon d'Or, Vin­cius was not without accolades. Earlier this month, he was named FIFA's The Best Men's Player and, more recently, received the Best Men's Player prize at the Globe Soccer Awards. At the same event, Barcelona's Aitana Bonmat­ secured the Women's Player of the Year award, continuing her streak of individual honors. Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon d'Or winner who was not shortlisted this year, expressed his dissatisfaction with France Football magazine. ""You know these galas, they always do the same thing,"" he commented, suggesting recurring issues with the award's selection process. Ronaldo praised the Globe Soccer Awards, which recognised him as the Best Middle East Player of 2024. The Portuguese forward has been in scintillating form since joining Al-Nassr in January 2023, scoring an impressive 74 goals in 83 matches. Ronaldo also took the opportunity to reflect on his former club, Manchester United, highlighting what he perceives as systemic problems within the organisation. ""The problem of Manchester United is the same,"" he said. ""The problem is not always the coach. It's much more than that.

Ronaldo has remarkably positioned himself as the person to resolve United's ongoing issues while discussing his ambition to one day become a club owner.  Amorim has lost five of his 10 games in charge of United, including four of the past five in the Premier League, and stated ahead of the next game against Newcastle United that his job is not secure. However, Ronaldo, who scored 145 goals over two spells at United and has been critical of the club's ownership in recent years, maintains that his countryman is not to blame. ""The Premier League it's the most difficult league in the world,"" Ronaldo, now playing for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia, said at the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Friday. ""All the teams are good, all the teams fight, all the teams run, all the players are strong. Football is different right now. There's no easy games anymore. ""I said this one and a half years ago, and I will continue to say it: The problem is not the coaches. ""It's like an aquarium. If you have the fish inside and he's sick and you take him out and you fix the problem and you put him again in an aquarium they will be sick again. ""The problem of Manchester United is the same. The problem is not always the coach. It's much more than that. If I will be the owner of the club, I will make things clear and adjust what I think is bad there."" Ronaldo was especially critical of the Glazers in his 2022 interview, accusing them of failing to invest in the club. He highlighted the subpar facilities at Manchester United, which he claimed were far inferior to those of other top European clubs. Since then, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken control of football operations after becoming co-owner in February. Ratcliffe has reportedly made ""big changes"" off the pitch, including establishing a clearer hierarchy above the head coach and implementing significant cost-cutting measures. Ronaldo's comments followed him hinting at ownership of a ""big club"" in the near future. ""I'm not a coach. I'm never going to be a coach, president of the club? No. Maybe owner of the club,"" he said.

I just barely had time to go to my room and change, so I put on a shirt and a jacket. Honestly, I didn't even think about the jeans. ""I even changed my shoes but didn't consider the jeans. When I arrived, I don't remember if it was after the first or second game, but I got a warning. First, I was fined, and then I was told I wouldn't be paired if I didn't go change my jeans immediately. They said I could do it after the third round. ""I said I'd change tomorrow if that's okay, as I hadn't even realized it today. But they insisted I change immediately. At that point, it became a matter of principle for me."" When asked if he had appealed the decision, Carlsen replied: ""No, I haven't appealed. Honestly, I'm too old at this point to care too much. If this is what they want to do, I guess it goes both ways, right? Nobody wants to back down, and this is where we are. It's fine by me. I'll probably head somewhere with nicer weather than here."" Carlsen confirmed that he would also skip the Blitz Championship. ""I mean, no,"" he stated simply. The Norwegian also criticised FIDE for enforcing its rules rigidly: ""I don't know if this has happened in the past, but there was this whole thing where FIDE actively went after players, threatening them if they signed with Freestyle. They essentially warned that players wouldn't be allowed to participate in the World Championship cycle if they did. ""Honestly, my patience with them was already thin. They can enforce their rules, and that's fine by me. My response is, 'Fine, then I'm out. F*** you.' I don't think anything more needs to be said.""Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/manmohan-singh-dies-at-92-yuvraj-vinesh-phogat-lead-tribute-to-former-pm-2655923-2024-12-26Must Watch

While commentating for the host broadcaster, Gavaskar called Pant stupid after the keeper-batter was dismissed for just 28 runs in India's first innings at the Boxing Day Test match. With India in dire straits, Pant's decision to play an unorthodox scoop shot off Scott Boland's bowling left many fans and experts questioning his temperament and approach in high-pressure situations. Gavaskar hit out at Pant and used some harsh words for the batter after his dismissal. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 3 Live Updates | Full Scorecard Pant had looked jittery from the very start of his innings on Day 3. He nearly got caught twice at the slip cordon in the first hour of play and then survived 2 run-out attempts due to on-field mix-ups with Ravindra Jadeja. After settling down his nerves near the hour mark, Pant decided to scoop Scott Boland's full-length delivery behind the keeper. The batter did not get the ideal connection and was caught at deep third man after top-edging the ball. ""Stupid, stupid, stupid! You have two fielders there, you still go for that shot. You have missed the previous shot and look where you have been caught. You have been caught at deep third man. That is throwing away your wicket. Not in the situation that India was. You have to understand the situation as well. You cannot say that that's your natural game. I'm sorry that is not your natural game. That is a stupid shot that is letting your team down badly,"" Sunil Gavaskar fumed while commentating on the match. ""He should not be going in that dressing room. He should be going to the other dressing room,"" he further added.

Speaking ahead of Day 3 of the 4th Test match between India and Australia, Langer rated Virat Kohli ahead of Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara for his gladiatorial attitude and incredible fitness. Langer said Kohli would be the one player he would watch if he was given a choice between the greats of the game. Langer, who has played 105 Test matches for Australia, rated the former India captain ahead of the legendary Ricky Ponting. ""You asked me Mark why I said yesterday that Virat Kohli is the best player that I have ever seen. There were a few raised eyebrows, but he actually is. We talk about Sachin, what a player. It was one of the privileges of my life to play against Sachin Tendulkar and, of course, with Ricky Ponting and Brian Lara. If I had my last rupee or my last dollar, I would pay to watch Brian Lara bat, but if I had my life and my last dollar, and both of them together, I would have Virat Kohli batting for me,"" Langer said during commentary on Day 2 of the Boxing Day Test. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 3 Live Updates | Full Scorecard ""The reason why I say that is not because of the expansive shots, his cover drives or his hook shots. But you just saw, the way he is watching the ball, his running between the wicket, his fielding, his gladiatorial style of leadership. His elite fitness level, everything that he's brought to the table. His numbers speak for themselves. You can never argue with data. Those are the reasons, why he is the best player I have ever seen. And we have seen a lot of them. But he is the one player, I think; if I had to put my money on, he would be the one,"" he further said. Kohli has had a difficult time in the Boxing Day Test match so far. After a bust-up with debutant Sam Konstas, Kohli was booed by the MCG crowd. The batter looked in exceptional touch in India's first innings, but later was involved in a mega mix-up with Yashasvi Jaiswal, resulting in a run-out of the youngster. The incident flustered Kohli, which resulted in the batter getting dismissed for 36 off 86 balls.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Jasprit Bumrah breaks silence on Sam Konstas' onslaught from Day 1 of MCG TestMust Watch

Nitish was batting at 85 unbeaten in the post-lunch session on Day 3. 
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-australia-vs-india-melbourne-test-nitish-reddy-no6-ravi-shastri-2656571-2024-12-28,"Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has strongly advocated for young all-rounder Nitish Reddy to move up the batting order, stating that his MCG knock warrants a promotion to No. 6 in India's Test lineup. Shastri's remarks came after Nitish played a fearless, unbeaten 85-run knock in the post-lunch session on Day 3.  The SRH all-rounder was beautifully complemented by Washington Sundar's steady 40 not out as the visitors reached 326 for seven before a light drizzle brought an early tea on the third day of the fourth Test against Australia. The two young all-rounders shared a record 105-run stand for the eighth wicket, not only avoiding the follow-on but also justifying their selection in the playing XI. Head coach Gautam Gambhir's decision to back them was validated as both Reddy and Sundar provided crucial stability in a challenging situation. ""I feel that the way he's batted, this is the last time he will bat at 7. To get the balance of the side, you need him to go higher up the order, either 5 or 6 and then you have the opportunity of playing 5 bowlers to take the 20 wickets, and he's given that kind of confidence to the selectors and the team management and the captain,"" Ravi Shastri said during the tea break on Day 3. Australia vs India, 4th Test, Day 3 Updates Shastri highlighted that promoting Reddy would not only strengthen the batting lineup but also allow the team to field an extra bowler, a critical factor in achieving success in Test cricket. ""Reddy is fully capable of batting in the top 6. Then it changes the whole balance of the game,"" he added. ""You go to Sydney with him batting in the top 6, and you're playing five bowlers."" Despite India's fightback, Australia, who scored 474 in their first innings, are still leading by 148 runs. However, the placid Melbourne track suggests that the match is likely heading for a fifth-day finish, as taking 20 wickets seems a difficult task for either side. Nitish after a string of near-misses, finally crossed the elusive fifty-run mark to the delight of his fans and teammates. The 21-year-old reached the milestone with a boundary off Mitchell Starc and celebrated with a gesture inspired by the movie Pushpa: The Rise. Reddy's innings came at a crucial juncture, with India under pressure after a batting collapse late on Day 2, which saw them lose three key wickets, including Yashasvi Jaiswal (82) and Virat Kohli (36). On the third day, the early dismissals of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja further compounded the team's woes. However, Reddy and Sundar's partnership steadied the ship, helping India avoid the follow-on and reduce the deficit. Reddy also climbed to the fourth spot amongst the highest run scorers in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His maturity and composure under pressure have drawn widespread praise, especially given that this is his maiden appearance in the longest format of the game.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Tune InRead More |  Stupid, Stupid, Stupid: Furious Gavaskar slams Rishabh Pant for reckless dismissal

However, the placid Melbourne track suggests a fifth-day finish, as taking 20 wickets appears to be a challenging task for either side. The morning session was overshadowed by Rishabh Pant's poor shot selection, but the afternoon belonged to Reddy. His counterattacking approach put the pressure back on Australia, featuring eight boundaries and a six off Nathan Lyon. The highlight of his innings was a gorgeous off-drive off Pat Cummins. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 3 HIGHLIGHTS Reddy, India's most consistent batter this series, brought up his maiden Test fifty at a crucial moment, and at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground no less. At the other end, Washington Sundar grew in confidence, displaying solid defence and punishing loose deliveries. The drop-in pitch at the MCG has noticeably improved for batting as the game progressed, further aiding the duo. Earlier in the day, Pant's reckless dismissal left India in a tough spot. The MCG pitch, with its green grass now giving way to a brownish hue, was arguably at its best for batting, making Pant’s inability to capitalise even more frustrating. After starting positively with a few boundaries, Pant attempted a risky lap shot over fine leg off Scott Boland. Having been struck in the abdomen attempting the same shot earlier, Pant failed to learn from his mistake. Pat Cummins had cleverly set the field, and the extra bounce caused Pant to top-edge the ball for a straightforward catch.

Senior Reddy was overjoyed with his son's performance and thanked Mohammed Siraj for surviving the nervy Cummins over. ""For our family, it's a special day and we cannot forget this day in our life. He has been performing well since the age group of 14-15 and now in international cricket, it's a very special feeling. (On what were his emotions when Nitish was on 99 with one one wicket remaining) I was very tensed. Only the last wicket was remaining.

When Nitish played the lofted on-drive to go past the three-figure mark, 60,000 fans erupted, but one man among them couldn't hold back tears. His father, man who had swapped his own dreams for his son's, watched with pride swelling in every beat of his heart. Let's set the stage. India was teetering, trembling at 191/6, staring down the barrel of an Australian bowling assault on Day 2. Nitish walked in at No. 8 - not to applause, but to anxiety. The stakes couldn't have been higher. A new ball snarled, Pat Cummins roared, and Nathan Lyon spun webs of deceit. By stumps, India had clawed its way to 358/9, and the boy with a willow had grown into a man for the ages. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 3 HIGHLIGHTS

— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) December 28, 2024 There were smiles too. Nitish's celebration - a nod to his roots with the ""Pushpa"" movie gesture - brought a slice of home to a foreign land. It wasn't just a cheeky tribute; it was a reminder of the kid who once danced around in gully cricket, dreaming big. His father's story adds another layer of poignancy. Mutayala Reddy had left his job at Hindustan Zinc in 2016 to shepherd Nitish's talent. It wasn't an easy path. There were sleepless nights, missed meals, and countless compromises. But when Mutayala stood in the stands, watching his son's bat kiss the century mark, every sacrifice suddenly felt like destiny. “To be honest, I was not serious when I was young. My father left his job for me and there has been a lot of sacrifice behind my story. One day, I saw him crying because of financial problems we were facing and I was like this is not how you can be that my father made the sacrifices and you play cricket just for fun. At that time, I became serious and I got the growth, I worked hard and it paid off,"" Nitish said. “As a son from a middle-class family, I am so proud that my father is happy now. I gave my first jersey to him and saw happiness in his face and I feel very proud,"" he added.

 For Nitish, the journey to the MCG was meteoric. From Kurnool's cricket fields to IPL stardom with Sunrisers Hyderabad, his rise was paved with runs, wickets, and a hunger to prove doubters wrong. A breakout IPL season in 2024 catapulted him to the national side, and receiving his Test cap from Virat Kohli was a dream come true. ""Everyone wants to be a hero in their cinema but when it comes to Nitish's story it is Mutyala who is the hero,"" Nitish Kumar Reddy’s childhood coach Kumar Swamy had told IE. ""It is his father's hard work which fuels Nitish to achieve something in life. He witnessed everything his father had undergone. Especially there was a lot of criticism even from his close family members about him not having a job and wasting his time, but the father never gave up."" Now, the world watches. Is Nitish Kumar Reddy just a flash in the pan, or is he the new jewel in India's cricketing crown? As the sun sets over Melbourne, one thing is clear: this young man, with a father's dreams stitched into his jersey, has arrived. The MCG roared for Nitish Reddy. But above all, it roared for a father and son who dared to dream.Nitish's matured MCG rescuing act Nitish's 105 off 171 balls wasn't just a rescue act; it was a masterclass. It was the kind of innings cricketing folklore loves. Batting with Washington Sundar, their 127-run stand was nothing short of defiance personified. Together, they dragged India back into the contest. But the numbers tell only half the story. Nitish's century wasn't just a statistical anomaly - the first No. 8 batter to score a ton at the MCG - it was a mosaic of resilience painted against the vast canvas of the Australian sun. When he reached 99, a hush fell over the MCG. The drama, the anticipation, the collective holding of breath. And then, a drive, sweet as summer rain. Boundary! Century! The crowd erupted. Nitish knelt down, eyes closed, bat raised to the heavens. Somewhere in that moment, his father's sacrifices were silently honored.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Justin Langer picks 'gladiatorial' Virat Kohli over Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara

Russians Volodar Murzin and Alexander Grischuk, along with Duda Jan-Kryzstof of Poland, share the lead with Arjun on seven points after the end of the second day and round 9 of the championship, which will decide the best player on the planet after 13 games. The day was marred by the fine and disqualification of five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen for his refusal to comply with FIDE's dress code after turning up in jeans. Defending champion Carlsen was fined USD 200 for wearing jeans, which are ""explicitly prohibited"" under tournament regulations, and when he refused the request to change his attire immediately by chief arbiter Alex Holowczak, he was disqualified and was not paired for Round 9 of the Rapid championship taking place at Wall Street. With Carlsen's withdrawal, Arjun's chances have increased dramatically as the Norwegian is known to win anything and everything that comes under the faster version. In the 10th round the Indian will take on Grischuk. The Indian scope of a medal seems brighter in the women section as well, where Koneru Humpy put aside her first-round loss and won four games on the trot to find herself in lead on 6.5 points with compatriot D Harika and Wenjun Ju of China. However, the day belonged to Arjun who defeated Robson Ray of the United States and later won against Shant Sargsyan of Armenia. His two draws against Murzin and Duda earned him the spot to be on top with just four rounds to go. Humpy gave lessons to her opponents while Harika was at her best.

That just tells you that here is a young man who's got a very good cricketing head on his shoulders and I pray to God that it always remains so,"" Gavaskar said. Nitish demonstrated resilience during a tense phase, spending considerable time in the nervous 90s. With Washington Sundar and Jasprit Bumrah departing in quick succession, the pressure intensified.

On Saturday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Reddy got to his century off 171 balls, bringing down India’s trail to 116 runs at Stumps on Day 3. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 3 HIGHLIGHTS At the close of play, the 21-year-old Reddy stayed not out on 105 off 176 balls, laced with 10 fours and a six. Sundar, who made 50 runs before Nathan Lyon dismissed him, said that Reddy is mentally strong and prefers putting in his best efforts on the field. “Nitish Reddy is an unbelievable player. Mentally very strong. This century here at MCG will be remembered forever. Nitish is someone who gives 100% in everything. That's his motive in life. It is very pleasing for us to watch,” Sundar said in the press conference after the day’s play. Sundar also talked about how Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma’s words of wisdom motivated India to not give up the ghost in the Melbourne Test. “One thing about Gauti bhai, Rohit bhai is they always tell us to keep fighting.

Sunday shared a 127-run stand with the centurion Nitish Kumar Reddy in Melbourne.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-aus-vs-ind-washington-sundar-boxing-day-selection-mcg-test-50-2656635-2024-12-28,"When the scoreboard read 221 for 7 after Ravindra Jadeja's dismissal, the Indian dressing room must have felt the Boxing Day blues creeping in. Enter Washington Sundar with his combative spirit and knack of delivering with the bat in pressure situations. Partnering with the fearless Nitish Kumar Reddy, Sundar delivered a performance soaked in grit, determination, and a dash of Boxing Day drama to justify the selection gamble that had cricket fans buzzing. Nitish, with his fluent strokes, was the aggressor, but it was Washington's resilience that anchored India's 127-run eighth-wicket stand. Together, they did more than save India from a potential follow-on; they injected hope into a day that began under the shadow of a batting collapse. Their stand, reminiscent of that famous Thakur-Sundar resistance at the Gabba in 2020-21, grew from careful defiance into something more substantial. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 3 HIGHLIGHTS Speaking to the press, Sundar was characteristically humble, crediting his captain and mentors for instilling a never-say-die attitude. ""One thing, especially with Rohit bhai and Gauti bhai, is that they keep telling us to fight no matter what. For India, in a ground like the MCG, we will do everything,"" Sundar said. Reflecting on his performance, he added, ""They believed in me and my capabilities in this format. I'm happy about my contribution, but it would have been better to score more and not get out. Still, we are in a good position."" Through 47 overs of intense cricket, they constructed a partnership of 127 runs, each delivery a small battle in itself. While the pitch remained true, Australia's relentless pressure after the rain break created periods where runs came at a premium as Australia tried to press on the opposition. It was because of Sundar and Nitish that India managed to avoid the follow-on and end Day 3 at 358 for 9. Sundar's approach wasn't flashy, but it was precisely what the situation demanded. Watchful and measured, he left, blocked, and occasionally frustrated Pat Cummins & Co. His first and only boundary—an elegant drive-through point off Mitchell Starc's 103rd delivery—came with the patience of a monk waiting for his moment. As with every epic, there were moments of fortune. In an almost comical twist, Sundar, attempting to flick Starc off his pads, managed to send the ball flying off the back of his bat towards the second slip. Steven Smith, diving to his right, couldn't cling on. It was the sort of reprieve that adds an extra layer of intrigue to an innings that already had drama written all over it. India's decision to field two all-rounders—Sundar and Reddy - at the expense of a specialist batter raised eyebrows. But Sundar's gritty half-century and his pivotal role in the eighth-wicket partnership silenced critics. Mitchell Marsh tried to halt the pair with his medium pace around the tea break, but Sundar and Reddy refused to budge. Marsh dried up the runs briefly, but it was Nathan Lyon who finally broke through. A sharply bouncing delivery kissed the shoulder of Sundar's bat, and Smith, determined not to miss this time, completed the catch. However, Sundar had played one of India's most underrated yet important Test knocks till then.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Tune InRead More |  Dreams come true at MCG: How father's sacrifice fuelled Nitish Reddy's journey

Boland, who has had figures of 27-7-57-3 in the first innings, said that Starc is in decent shape as he generated speeds in the 140s. “He’s okay. He just had a bit of a niggle somewhere in his back or rib, I don’t know, somewhere back there, but he came out after the break and was bowling 140km/h, so I think he’s going to be fine,” Boland said in the press conference after the day’s play.‘Starc is underrated for his toughness’  Boland also recalled the Boxing Day Test against South Africa back in 2022 when Starc managed to bowl his heart out despite injuring his finger on the left hand. Boland said that the quality that sets Starc apart from the rest is his ability to bowl well despite nursing an injury. “I think he is underrated for how tough he is. A couple of years ago here at the MCG, he had a broken finger and we’re pretty much planning for him not to bowl at all and then he came out and bowled 140km/h swingers,” Boland said. “He’s someone who can play through a lot of pain, and you can probably tell (that because) he’s played close to 90 Test matches now. And as a fast bowler, there’s not many games where you do play without any niggle at all. He’s someone who can still bowl at the same pace even when he is really sore, which is a great trait to have,” Boland added. Australia have their noses ahead in the ongoing Melbourne Test with India trailing by 116 runs.

The duo forged a remarkable 127-run partnership for the eighth wicket, pulling India out of a precarious position and giving their team renewed hope.  The partnership began with India in deep trouble at 191 for six after Rishabh Pant’s dismissal for 28 in the 56th over. The situation worsened when Ravindra Jadeja was trapped lbw by Nathan Lyon, leaving India at 221 for seven and trailing by 253 runs. Enter Sundar and Reddy, who steadied the innings with grit and determination. Speaking at the post-day press conference, Sundar emphasised the importance of fighting for the team, a sentiment instilled in the side by head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma during dressing room discussions. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 3 HIGHLIGHTS ""The intent was definitely to fight no matter what the situation is. I mean, the way things turned out was really heartening. I mean, me and Nitish kept telling each other that we're going to fight no matter what... The message was quite clear from the dressing room. We just needed to play time no matter what. Because runs were coming in, and they were also getting quite tired as well. So runs were going to come at some stage. "" So it was just important for us to spend a lot of time out there in the middle,"" Washington Sundar said.  ""Gauti Bhai has helped me a lot because he's trusted in me a lot. And he's kept telling me how much my batting skill set is going to be important for the team. And even the batting coach, Abhishek Nair, he's worked a lot in my game. And he's always made sure tactically I'm always there. And no matter, we knew Australians are going to try out different things in different phases of the game,"" he added. By the time Sundar departed, India had climbed to 348 for eight, reducing the deficit to 126 runs The partnership wasn’t just vital—it was historic. Nitish and Sundar recorded India’s second-highest eighth-wicket stand in Australia, surpassing the 107-run partnership between Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh in 2008. Their efforts showcased resilience and skill under pressure, with Sundar’s calm approach perfectly complementing Reddy’s composed aggression. Reddy, who scored a magnificent maiden Test century during the stand, had earlier impressed in the IPL 2024 season and in his debut series for India. His knock of 105 off 171 balls was a testament to his maturity and skill. Sundar, meanwhile, played the anchor’s role to perfection, ensuring India avoided another collapse. Their stand not only narrowed Australia’s lead but also reignited hopes for the visitors in the Boxing Day Test. Sundar’s innings highlighted his value as a dependable all-rounder, while Reddy’s heroics further established him as a rising star in Indian cricket. The partnership embodied the team’s spirit and the belief that no situation is too dire to fight back.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Dreams come true at MCG: How father's sacrifice fueled Nitish Reddy's journey

His maiden Test century rescued India from a precarious position after a disastrous Day 2 batting collapse. The 21-year-old displayed remarkable maturity, earning widespread acclaim and cementing his status as a rising star in Indian cricket. Reddy etched his name in the history books, becoming the first No. 8 batter to score a Test century at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Earlier in the day, he reached his half-century off 81 balls, continuing an impressive run on the Australian tour. Reddy came to the crease with India struggling at 191 for six in the 56th over, following the dismissals of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja. His celebration of the fifty with a gesture inspired by the movie Pushpa delighted fans and added a personal touch to the moment. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 3 HIGHLIGHTS Former Indian cricketers Dinesh Karthik, Irfan Pathan, and Wasim Jaffer heaped praise on Reddy’s knock, predicting a bright future for the young all-rounder.

However, his determination shone through as he pierced the field with a glorious boundary to bring up his maiden Test century, a moment of pure elation for him and Indian fans.  Reddy’s rise has been meteoric. After impressing as the Emerging Player for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024, he earned a spot in India’s T20I side against Bangladesh before making his way into the Test squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Following his innings, the 22-year-old has become the highest run-scorer for India in the series so far with 284 runs from four matches (six innings) at an average of 71 with one century to his name. Following his sensational performance, Ravi Shastri said that it would be the last time that he would be batting at number 7 and suggested the management to promote him up the order and play five bowlers in the next game. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Day 3 Highlights | Full Scorecard ""I feel that the way he's batted, this is the last time he will bat at 7. To get the balance of the side, you need him to go higher up the order, either 5 or 6 and then you have the opportunity of playing 5 bowlers to take the 20 wickets, and he's given that kind of confidence to the selectors and the team management and the captain,” Shastri said on Star Sports.

Cummins, with his sharp bouncers and deceptive in-cutters, tested the young batter’s technique and resilience.  Cummins mixed bouncers with fuller in-cutters, forcing Reddy into tricky decisions. He couldn’t just lean forward or rely on backfoot punches—strategies that have troubled players like Shubman Gill before.   Reddy’s compact technique, however, shone through. He adjusted swiftly, punching the ball past the bowler and avoiding weak prods or reckless shots. His footwork and timing helped him counter Cummins’ relentless attack.  Cummins tried to unsettle him further with bouncers aimed at his body. A fiery delivery struck Reddy’s arm, but the youngster stayed composed, showing grit and determination.   The battle reached a high point when Reddy charged at Cummins, who responded with another sharp bouncer. Both exchanged smiles, acknowledging the intensity of their duel.   This gripping face-off showcased Reddy’s mental toughness against one of the world’s finest bowlers, marking a standout moment in his young career.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Nitish Reddy impressed me from 1st Test: Sachin Tendulkar praises MCG starMust Watch

After India's batting collapse on Day 2, which left them reeling at 164/5 with Rishabh Pant and Jadeja at the crease, many had hoped for a revival akin to their 2022 Edgbaston heroics. However, both batters fell early on Day 3, leaving India in a precarious position. Manjrekar, speaking to Star Sports, noted how Jadeja seemed tentative against Lyon despite showing confidence against the Australian pacers. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 3 HIGHLIGHTS ""He played the fast bowlers a lot and played them very well. He didn't make even a slight mistake against the fast bowlers. However, once Nathan Lyon came, he was expecting off-spin, that the ball would turn. His bat came for the off-spin and the ball was not turning at all. So he played with that mindset,"" Manjrekar said. ""It seems like Jadeja needs to practice a little more against spin because he is looking absolutely comfortable against seam. He used to play very well against spin earlier but it happens that when you play overseas, you start playing fast bowling well and your focus is slightly removed from spin. If only fast bowlers had been there, Jadeja would have played a big knock,"" he added. Jadeja managed only 2 runs off 14 deliveries from Lyon before being trapped lbw, a dismissal that left India at 221/7, trailing Australia by 253 runs. The lack of assertiveness in Jadeja’s approach against spin became a talking point, with Manjrekar emphasizing the need for the all-rounder to regain his confidence against such bowlers.India's turnaround ft Nitish-Washington duo The tide turned for India when Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy came together for a resilient eighth-wicket stand. Their partnership of 127 runs not only steadied the innings but also marked India’s second-highest eighth-wicket stand in Australia, surpassing the 107-run effort by Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh in 2008. Nitish Reddy’s magnificent maiden Test century, a composed 105 off 171 balls, was a standout moment. His performance built on his stellar IPL 2024 season and debut series for India, establishing him as a promising talent. Sundar, on the other hand, played a pivotal anchoring role, ensuring India avoided a total collapse and reduced the deficit to 126 runs by the time he was dismissed. The partnership between Sundar and Reddy not only showcased resilience under pressure but also reignited India’s hopes in the Boxing Day Test. While Jadeja’s dismissal highlighted areas for improvement, the efforts of Sundar and Reddy embodied the team’s fighting spirit and the potential of its emerging stars.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Dreams come true at MCG: How father's sacrifice fuelled Nitish Reddy's journey

Chasing Australia’s first innings score of 474, the visiting team had brought down the deficit to 116 runs at the close of play. After losing three quick wickets at the fag end of the day’s play on Friday, it seemed that India were staring at a defeat at the iconic venue. AUS vs IND 4th Test, Day 3 HIGHLIGHTS But Nitish Reddy’s unbeaten 105 off 176 balls with 10 fours and a six made sure that India stayed afloat in the Melbourne Test. Reddy was also involved in a partnership of 127 runs for the eighth wicket with Washington Sundar, who also chipped in with a handy 50-run knock. For now, with over 100 needed for India to reach Australia’s total and a solitary wicket in hand, there’s a high probability that they will concede a lead after both teams' innings. Has India ever won a Test on Australian soil after handing a lead to the opposition?43 years ago It happened only once that India conceded a lead at the end of the first innings and went on to win a Test on Australian soil. Back in February 1981, India beat Australia by 59 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Sunil Gavaskar’s men were bowled out for 237, after which Allan Border’s century helped the Aussies take a massive 182-run lead. But Kapil Dev’s five-wicket haul made sure that India came back with their backs against the walls and bowled the home team out for 83 in 48.4 overs while defending 143. The only other Test where India did not lose despite conceding a first innings was back in January 2008 at the Adelaide Oval. Instances where India did not lose a Test in Australia after giving away a lead 
 


 As far as Australia are concerned, time has still not run out for them as far as securing victory is concerned. Pat Cummins' men have two full days to ensure that they come up trumps and take a crucial 2-1 lead in the five-match series. Their first task would be to take the last Indian wicket and then set a target which would end up being out of India’s reach. India, on the other hand, would be aiming to get as many runs as possible before taking the field again. India’s fortunes in the MCG Test could well end up deciding their fate in the series as they have won only one Test in Sydney, which was back in 1978.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also READ |  AUS vs IND, 4th Test: Sparkling Nitish hundred, Sundar rearguard cut India's deficit on Day 3

— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) December 28, 2024 On Saturday, December 28, Nitish Kumar Reddy became the first India batter at No.8 to hit a hundred in Australia. Nitish's innings was lauded by the likes of Sunil Gavaskar, who hailed the all-rounder's calm head on his maiden series for India. Gavaskar, who was seething at Rishabh Pant's dismissal in the morning of Day 3, did not hold back words in praising Nitish and rejoiced the batter's sparkling hundred in 171 balls. ""I think his shot selection. I actually think that tells you about the temparament. He's used the lofted shot to good effect. He's using his feet, hitting it over the field. Then he plays a classic straight drive, along the ground, then he plays again a lovely lofted shot. So, he is aware of where the fielders are, and is playing accordingly. Shot selection becomes such an important part in your batting and he showed that he has got that. He recognised the situation, that runs were also needed to be scored, but also that you need to play as long as possible to try and take the match deep into the fifth day,"" Sunil Gavaskar said on Star Sports. And why not? Nitish Reddy had not only saved follow-on for India - but he had nearly played out 50 overs alongside Washington Sundar, to stabilise the Indian innings, which seemed to be in a hurry to get bowled out. Sitting in the dugout on Day 2 and early on Day 3 - Nitish witnessed harakiri on the pitch as Yashasvi Jaiswal was run out after mix-up with Virat Kohli before the senior batter edged the ball to wicketkeeper Alex Carey. Later, he watched Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja nearly running themselves out thrice early on Day 3. If that was not enough, Nitish bore witness to an inexplicable and needless shot from Rishabh Pant - which saw India's biggest X factor return back to the pavilion cheaply, leaving India more than 280 runs behind Australia's first innings total.The challenges before the masterclass With things really tentative on an overcast day in Melbourne, Nitish got to task. First he tried to play shots along the ground, getting quick singles and regular boundaries in the early part of his innings, which put pressure back on the Australian bowlers. And later, when the Aussie bowling attack was delivering bullets, Nitish calmly soaked in the pressure. A view at Nitish's wagon wheel shows that he exploited the gaps in the Australian field, scoring all around the park - mostly through the covers, where he nearly scored 1/4th of his runs (25 - including 4 boundaries). According to Cricviz data, Nitish has the lowest false shot percentage of all the Indian batters in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. It was a show of incredible mental fortitude from the young all-rounder - who kept the likes of Starc, Cummins, Boland and Nathan Lyon at bay for entirety of his innings.The many minds behind Nitish Nitish, in an exclusive interaction with India Today Digital, about the mental side of things after his IPL 2024 season, where he had won the Emerging Player of the Year award. Nitish had credited Pat Cummins for helping him with the mental side of things. ""I spoke a lot to Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pat Cummins about execution and planning. They are experienced players and I tried to learn the mental side of the game from them,"" Nitish had told India Today. In the same interview, Nitish had spoken about learning the art of batting from Heinrich Klaasen, who had asked him to take games deep, whenever he felt that the team was under pressure. ""I have worked on my batting a lot. It is finally working. I am grateful that all the hard work and dedication paid off. I spoke to Klaasen about taking the game to the end, and playing the spinners. I closely watched him and he gave me really good answers whenever I asked him anything,"" Nitish had said. ""The biggest learning for the season has been taking the game to the end. In some matches, I played shots that were not required at that point, I should have played normal cricket and I would have got runs easily. I took a risky option at that time and I learnt that I needed to spend more time in the crease and play these shots later. I got carried away and next time I will not be doing that,"" he had further added. Klaasen's advice reflected in Nitish's batting on Saturday. The all-rounder was unperturbed when India had lost 6 wickets and were still 280 runs short of Australia's first innings total. In fact, Nitish's first poor shot came very late in the evening, when he tried to flick a ball off his pads, nearly handing Starc a catch at deep fine leg. His second poor shot came at 97*, when he tried to smash Cummins through cover to complete his century. Nitish's choice of shot resulted in nervy moments for the batter in the next 5 minutes. He had made the mistake of giving Jasprit Bumrah the strike for a full over against Pat Cummins, which resulted in the latter's wicket. Nitish's father was seen praying on the sidelines, hoping that the final batter of India - Mohammed Siraj - would play out the remaining balls from Cummins. After Siraj was able to successfully negotiate the remainder of the over, the Indian fans breathed a sigh of relief. The Bumrah brain-fade moment compounded and Nitish nearly lost his wicket when he was at 99*. He survived a close LBW call from Scott Boland. The mood at the MCG got tentative at that point and his father had a worried expression on his face. However, the fear turned into euphoria for Nitish's father and the fans present at the MCG when the batter hit Boland through the line for a four to bring up a sensational century in 171 balls. Perhaps, that one brainfade is allowed. The fighter had played more than 150 balls by that moment of the innings and the desperation of the landmark perhaps got the better of him. However, it can be asserted that despite the hundred, Nitish will possibly give himself a slap on the wrist tonight for playing that rash shot before reaching the coveted feat. With the hundred at the MCG, Nitish is now the highest scorer from the Indian team in the ongoing BGT- in debut series for a 21-year-old on Australia tour. He has already scored 284 runs - higher than Virat Kohli's 162, or Rohit Sharma's tally of 19. Nitish's MCG masterclass on Day 3 showed that the young all-rounder, with a great cricketing brain, is not just a quick learner but also here to stay for long. His ability to stay calm under pressure, and methodically manuevre through the gears proves that once again, pressure has helped India find their next-gen superstar in world cricket.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Dreams come true at MCG: How father's sacrifice fuelled Nitish Reddy's journey

The 17-year-old winger, instrumental in Spain's Euro 2024-winning campaign, has been out of action since mid-December, leaving Barcelona grappling with inconsistency in his absence. The setback has coincided with Barcelona losing their grip on LaLiga’s top spot after a 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid, who now lead the table. Despite his absence, Yamal remains a beacon of hope for the Catalan giants, as the young prodigy vows to make a triumphant return. On December 28, Yamal was honored with the Globe Soccer Award for Best Young Talent, a testament to his stellar performances when fit. ''I am in the recovery process, but I will come back stronger and more eager. When you stop playing for a while, you realize how important what you are doing is. It was not a problem from the other injury. It was just bad luck, a knock that caused my ankle to twist, and that can happen to anyone,"" Yamal told Barca One. ""This year, the collective titles were missing at Barca, which is what excites me the most, but we will try to win the League, cup [Copa Del Rey], [UEFA] Champions League, and everything we can,"" he added.

 Yamal’s brilliance has been evident in his limited appearances this season, contributing six goals and 12 assists in just 20 matches. However, injuries have plagued his campaign, with the latest being his third setback of the season. He first encountered trouble in October while on international duty for Spain, followed by an ankle injury against Red Star Belgrade in the UEFA Champions League in November, and now his recent mishap against Leganes. The La Masia graduate’s absence has been felt keenly by Barcelona, who had high hopes of building on his dazzling Euro 2024 form. Yamal’s ability to create chances and his knack for delivering in critical moments have made him a vital cog in Xavi Hernandez’s setup. While fans eagerly await his return, Yamal has reassured them that his recovery is progressing well and he is focused on regaining full fitness. The teenager's optimism and determination provide a glimmer of hope for Barcelona, as they look to reclaim their dominance in LaLiga and push forward in other competitions. Barcelona’s “starboy” is not just a player of immense potential but also a symbol of the club’s future aspirations. His comeback will be pivotal, not only for Barcelona's campaign but also for reaffirming Yamal’s position as one of football’s brightest young talents.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Cristiano Ronaldo makes bold Manchester United ownership claim: It's like aquarium

The five-time world champion explained that FIDE had no option but to un-pair Carlsen after he refused to adhere to the tournament’s dress code rules. The issue arose on Day 2 of the tournament in New York City when Carlsen, widely regarded as one of the greatest chess players of all time, arrived wearing jeans, which violated FIDE’s dress code. FIDE Chief Arbiter Alex Holowzsak initially issued a $200 fine and instructed Carlsen to change his attire before the ninth round. However, Carlsen refused, standing firm on what he described as a matter of principle. “He simply refused to follow rules, leaving us with little choice,” Anand told ChessBase India. “This decision seemed emotional. Magnus was not willing to compromise.” According to Anand, FIDE tried multiple times to resolve the issue amicably. “The arbiter said that as long as Magnus changed his jeans before the ninth round, it would be fine. But Magnus said he was not going to do it on principle. The arbiter applied the rules, and we supported that.” Anand further highlighted that other players had complied with similar requests. “Ian Nepomniachtchi was asked to change, and he did so. That is why he was able to continue. The fact that Magnus simply refused left us with little choice,” Anand added.

— Proteas Men (@ProteasMenCSA) December 28, 2024 South Africa’s chase began under pressure as Pakistan's bowlers came out firing. Veteran Mohammad Abbas led the charge, making the new ball talk. He trapped Tony de Zorzi (1) and Tristan Stubbs (1) leg-before, while Khurram Shahzad struck to dismiss Ryan Rickelton (0). At stumps, South Africa were reeling at 27/3, with Aiden Markram unbeaten on 22 and skipper Temba Bavuma yet to score. Abbas, with figures of 2/3 from four overs, was exceptional, while Shahzad supported him well. Pakistan’s sharp fielding and two successful DRS calls added to South Africa’s woes. Markram’s composure will be crucial on Day 4 as the pitch, offering variable bounce, continues to aid bowlers. Earlier, Marco Jansen’s fiery spell dismantled Pakistan’s middle order, with support from Kagiso Rabada (2/37). Despite Pakistan’s fight, they were guilty of playing loose shots, leaving them vulnerable. With 112 runs needed and seven wickets in hand, South Africa remain slight favourites, but Pakistan’s disciplined bowling has kept them in the contest. The potential final day promises an intense battle as both teams eye victory in this gripping Test.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  ICC Women's emerging cricketer of the year: India's rising player nominatedMust Watch

He then stood up, spread his arms in the air, and embraced his teammate Mohammad Siraj. When asked about the meaning behind the celebration, Nitish explained, ""After my hundred, I planted my bat - keeping the helmet - so there is an Indian flag and saluting the flag. "" The biggest motivation is playing for the country, and it was memorable."" It wasn’t just a celebratory gesture for Nitish. His thoughts were deeply tied to his family and his dream of making his father proud.

Nitish himself seemed tense, as he was seen holding his head in his hands after the wickets fell. Just when it seemed like he would get stuck on 99*, Nitish survived a close LBW call from Scott Boland. The tension at the MCG was palpable, and his father’s worried expression reflected the anxiety of the moment.

— Afghanistan Cricket Board (@ACBofficials) December 28, 2024 Zimbabwe’s bowlers struggled to find a breakthrough throughout the day. Medium pacers Blessing Muzarabani and Trevor Gwandu bowled well in patches, but Afghanistan’s pair were untroubled, and their bowlers were let down by poor fielding. Rahmat survived multiple dropped catches, with at least four chances missed off his bat, including two easy ones in an over by Muzarabani. Despite the missed chances, Zimbabwe could not capitalise, and the pressure on their attack increased as Rahmat and Shahidi continued to build their partnership. The day also marked a rare occasion in Test cricket, with Zimbabwe failing to take a wicket across an entire day's play for the first time in their history. This was the first such instance since January 2019, when West Indies and England achieved a similar feat. Afghanistan’s progress meant they ended the day just 161 runs behind Zimbabwe, with two full days of play still remaining. Rahmat, eyeing a potential triple century, and Shahidi, looking to continue his solid innings, will be key to Afghanistan's fightback. Zimbabwe will need to find a way to break the partnership if they are to remain in control of the game.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 28, 2024Also Read |  Nitish Reddy reveals reason behind his hundred celebration: Was saluting Indian flag

Konstas, who had dominated the Indian bowling attack with an aggressive display in the first innings, was unable to replicate his heroics the second time around. Opening alongside Usman Khawaja, Konstas faced a barrage of hostile deliveries from Bumrah and his new-ball partner, Akash Deep, lasting only 18 balls in his brief stay at the crease. Bumrah delivered a masterclass in seam bowling, producing a sharp in-cutter in the 7th over. The delivery, pitched on a good length, jagged back through the gap between Konstas's bat and pad, clipping the top of the off-stump.

The spirited celebration by Bumrah served as a reminder of the ""long memories"" fast bowlers often carry, a sentiment Sunil Gavaskar humorously highlighted when the broadcaster juxtaposed Bumrah's send-off with Konstas's Day 3 interactions. ""Fast bowlers, they have long memories,"" quipped Gavaskar, capturing the essence of Bumrah's fiery response to Konstas's earlier crowd-pleasing gestures.  Konstas looked shaky and lacked the audacity that he showed in the first innings when he scored 61 off just 65 balls. The ball was seaming quite a bit on Sunday morning and the young opener was all at sea.  With the wicked of Konstas, Burmah took his tally to 26 wickets in the series.

In addition to his constant chatter aimed at the two Australian openers, Kohli was seen actively setting the field while stationed in the slip cordon, right next to captain Rohit Sharma. His involvement prompted celebrated commentator Mark Nicholas to observe, ""Virat Kohli is extremely animated on the field, as if he is captaining the side.""

On a day when Virat Kohli evoked nostalgia by inspiring the team by stepping up as a leader, Jasprit Bumrah delivered another mesmerising spell, taking his tally in the series to 29 wickets and surpassing the 200-wicket milestone in his career. Mohammed Siraj also bounced back with an improved performance, but India struggled to show the decisiveness needed to wrap up the Australian innings. Boxing Day Test, Day 4 Highlights In the final over of the day, Jasprit Bumrah had Nathan Lyon caught in the slip cordon, only for it to be called a no-ball. Lyon responded by flicking the very next delivery off his pads in a manner reminiscent of Virat Kohli—a moment that symbolised India's mixed fortunes in the last session. Also Read: What's the highest successful total chased at the MCG? Marnus Labuschagne did a Cheteshwar Pujara, taking blows and blunting the bowling attack to hit a gritty 70. Captain Pat Cummins frustrated India for the second successive time with the bat in the Test, chipping in with a crucial 41 while Nathan Lyon, who will be expected to play a major role with the ball on Monday, frustrated India along with No. 11 Scott Boland.  Australia's last four wickets added 137 runs as Lyon and Boland went on to add 55 runs and remained unbeaten. The off-spinner needs nine runs to get to a fluent fifty.  It's a fair assessment that Lyon and Boland's resistance swung the momentum in Australia's favour and India's positive mindset took a hit. Yashasvi Jaiswal's drop catches, including the one that allowed Labuschagne a reprieve at 46, might prove to be decisive in the Test match. DID AUSTRALIA MISS DECLARATION TRICK? It was somewhat surprising, however, to see Australia refrain from declaring their innings despite holding a significant lead. Pundits had expected Pat Cummins to call Lyon and Boland in with half an hour remaining in the day’s play. Whether this decision reflects a defensive mindset, acknowledging the depth of India’s batting line-up, or a calculated move based on confidence in Australia’s bowling attack, remains to be seen. The highest total chased at Melbourne Cricket Ground is 332 and India now need a record chase to win the Test. No team in the past 96 years has successfully chased a target exceeding 300 at the MCG. Over the last 50 years, 183 remains the highest successful chase at the iconic venue. Yet, Australia will know they cannot discount India. Merely three years ago, India pulled off a remarkable chase of 329 at the Gabba in Brisbane, shattering Australia’s 32-year unbeaten streak at the fortress. A fortress was breached at the Gabba then, and India must now conquer Mount Melbourne to go 2-1 up in the series. A draw cannot be ruled out either. However, India need clarity in their approach when they begin their innings on Day 5, regardless of when Australia decide to declare. Captain Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir face tough questions:
advertisementCan the team bat through 90-odd overs, given their recent form?
Should they adopt an aggressive approach from the outset and aim for victory?
Is there someone capable of replicating Cheteshwar Pujara’s heroic resistance at the Gabba, batting for 50-odd overs to lay a foundation?

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/cricket-babar-azam-t20i-cricketer-of-the-year-shocks-fans-joke-of-year-2656918-2024-12-29,"Travis Head, Babar Azam, Sikandar Raza and Arshdeep Singh have been nominated for ICC Men’s T20 Cricketer of the Year award. But it’s Babar’s nomination that has surprised fans. During the period taken into consideration, Babar scored 738 runs from 24 matches at an average of 33.54 with a top score of 75 not out against Ireland back in May at The Village in Dublin. Babar had a mediocre campaign in the T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the United States of America, where Pakistan crashed out after the group stage. He got scores of 44, 13, 33 and 32 not out, but could not step on the gas at the right time. Former Indian batter Virender Sehwag went on to say that Babar did not deserve a place in Pakistan’s T20I team. “Babar Azam is not a player who will hit sixes. He only hits sixes when he is set and spinners are operating. I have never seen him using his feet to fast bowlers or hitting sixes over the covers; it’s not his game as he plays safe cricket by hitting on the ground. So, he consistently scores runs and his strike-rate isn’t great,” Sehwag had told Cricbuzz. Babar is nine runs short of overtaking Rohit Sharma as the leading run-scoring in T20Is. In 128 T20Is, the former Pakistan captain has racked up 4223 runs at an average of 39.83 and a strike-rate of 129.22 with three hundreds and 36 fifties to show for his efforts. Fans believed that the likes of Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah, who were both a part of India’s T20 World Cup team, should have been nominated in place of Babar. One of the fans wrote, “This has to be joke of the year; Babar Azam is getting nomination over Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya, what's wrong with you ICC.” “Babar Azam? What did he do?” wrote another fan.Here's how fans reacted to Babar Azam's ICC nomination

The illustrious former coach was at his inimitable best, delivering inspiring words for the team ahead of what promises to be a thrilling final day in Melbourne on Monday, December 30. India had Australia in a spot of bother at 91 for 6 on Day 4 at the MCG, but the steely home side rode on crucial contributions from Marnus Labuschagne (70), Pat Cummins (41) and Nathan Lyon (41 not out) to stretch their second innings total to 228 for 9 and extend their lead to 333. India fought back from 191 for 6 to post 369, thanks to Nitish Reddy's hundred and Washington Sundar's fifty, but the visiting team blew away an opportunity to seize control of the Test match in the last session on Sunday. There were drop catches, which handed lifelines to the likes of Marnus Labuschagne and Pat Cummins as the lower-order frustrated the Indian bowling attack despite the brilliance of Jasprit Bumrah, who picked four wickets.  While Australia have not declared their second innings yet, India already need a record chase at the MCG if they are to win the Test match. However, the delay in declaration from Australia has offered India with an opportunity to draw the Test and head to the New Year's encounter in Sydney with a 1-1 scoreline.  Ravi Shastri, speaking to the broadcasters after the exhilarating fourth day, said India have the resources to draw the match, but that it is easier said than done. Shastri said Australia are favourites to win the Test in Melbourne on Day 5.  Also Read: What's the highest successful total chased at the MCG? ""Absolutely (disappointed Indian dressing room?). This is a recovery of sorts. You had them at 91 for 6 and you would have imagined 140-all out. You would chased a total of 250 with ample time in hand to get that score, as opposed to the situation now,"" Ravi Shastri said.  ""The only positive thing from India's point of view is they can bat out to save the Test match. There's every chance that a draw comes into the equation.  ""An Australian win is odds-on favourite, then it's a draw, then it's an Indian win,"" he added. WHAT WOULD BE RAVI SHASTRI'S DRESSSING ROOM SPEECH?



Guys, hang in there. This series is not yet over. It will demand a lot of character. You have it in you to bat through the day and save the game, depending on what the state of the game is at Tea time. But, do not, for one minute, give up. You were far behind in this contest. You came back because of Washington Sundar and Nitish Reddy. Now, on this final day, show courage, show character. Try and save this game. If you do, Australia will feel the pressure in Sydney. The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is not their's until they win. A win for India means Australia don't touch the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for more than 10 years. So don't give it to them easily.

Ravi Shastri
 



WHY AUSTRALIA DID NOT DECLARE ON DAY 4 Australia's last-wicket partnership was worth 55 runs. While Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland frustrated India, their 110-ball stay also ensured Indian batters did not walk out to bat on Day 4.  Shastri, much like a few other pundits, said he was surprised that Australia didn't declare in the last hour and have a crack at the Indian batters in the evening.  The former head coach recalled India's sensational chase of 329 at the Gabba in Brisbane from 2021 and said Australia might be scared of the Indian team when it comes to setting fourth-innings targets.  ""I was surprised that Australia did not give a few overs for India to bat in the last 30 minutes,"" he added.  ""Probably that's the reason why Australia didn't declare (the pitch playing fine - Lyon and Boland partnership). They are a little worried about the Indian batting line-up, especially after what happened at the Gabba, they chased 329. They know there are players in the side who are very good at the attacking game - there is Jaiswal, there is Rohit. If he gets going, there's Kohli, there's batting depth all the way down. ""Australia are trying to play safe. It reminds me of the Test match in 2015.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/why-australia-didnt-declare-on-day-4-of-the-mcg-test-vs-india-2656919-2024-12-29,"Australia put in an excellent rearguard action on Day 4 of the Boxing Day Test match, to recover from a top-order failure. After getting reduced to 91/6 before Tea, Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland put up a brave fight to get Australia out of trouble. The bowling trio helped out Marnus Labuschagne, who scored 70 runs in the second innings - surviving an incredible barrage of fast bowling by the Indian pacers. Starting from a lead of 105 runs in the morning session of Day 4, the rearguard action saw Australia finish Day 4 at 228 for 9, taking a mega lead of 333 runs. Both fans and experts thought that the strategy to keep adding runs to an already healthy lead was a little too much given the highest chase in the 21st century at the venue is just 183 runs (2008). In fact, the highest total chased at Melbourne Cricket Ground is 332 and India now need a record chase to win the Test. No team in the past 96 years has successfully chased a target exceeding 300 at the MCG.
 Speaking after the game, former India head coach Ravi Shastri analysed the Day 4 play and said that there might be a delicate and yet masterful plan as to why Australia captain Pat Cummins did not declare the innings and force India to bat in the final half an hour on Day 4.

 Shastri argued that the batting conditions were good enough for No.10 and 11 - Nathan Lyon to hang around for nearly 20 overs, which meant that specialist batters from the Indian team would have enjoyed those conditions as well. Shastri argued that Cummins played it safe against the tall India batting line-up, which might have found momentum late on Day 4 of the Test match.

 Shastri argued that Cummins would put India under pressure later on Day 5 of the Test match, using the new ball.

 ""Probably that’s the reason why Australia didn’t declare (the pitch playing fine - Lyon and Boland partnership). They are a little worried about the Indian batting line-up, especially after what happened at the Gabba, they chased 329. They know there are players in the side who are very good with attacking game - there is Jaiswal, there is Rohit. If he gets going, there’s Kohli, there’s batting depth all the way down,"" Ravi Shastri said on Star Sports after the end of day's play.

 ""Australia are trying to play safe. It reminds me of the Test match in 2015. When I was in the dressing room, similar situation, Australia batted for a few overs on Day 5 morning, then asked India to bat 5-5:30 hours to bat and India saved the game. A draw definitely comes into the equation, but India have to show a lot of character. It will be a test of character on the big day. It will be a test of their technique and temperament on the final day. I just get the feeling seeing the way India bowled today, the ball did quite a bit for 60-70 overs -- the ball was seaming and there was some swing there. Luckily, from India’s point of view, the ball hasn’t kept low, but the ball has taken off from good lengths, like we saw with Mitch Marsh."" Ravi Shastri further added.
 Mitchell Starc, speaking on Star Sports, made similar points and said that with the early start to the day, Australia have enough overs to bowl out India. Starc added another layer of analysis to the debate and said that, in case Australia were not able to bowl out India in 80 overs, they would still have 18 overs of the second new ball left to do the job late on Day 5 of the Test match. ""We start early again tomorrow, there is 98 overs. So, play overnight, we still have 18 overs with the second new ball, and there is some reverse swing, so that adds another dimension as well. If the pitch deteriorates again, further throughout the day, there is Nathan Lyon as well. So, I am sure that Pat and Andrew McDonald will have a lot to think overnight,"" Mitchell Starc told the broadcaster. ""There is probably enough grass to hold the pitch together on Day 5. The big thing will be the hard new ball, the reverse swing and some spin later on Day 5, and how the batters take us on,"" concluded Starc. It is expected that Australia would bat a little more on Day 5 and get an assessment of the pitch, after which they would unleash the full fury of their bowling attack on a deteriorating wicket on Day 5. India have had the edge over Australia in the last decade at MCG, and Pat Cummins' side would be desperate to change that on final day of the Boxing Day Test match.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 29, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Jasprit Bumrah's cheeky quip to Marnus Labuschagne goes viral

After Sam Konstas got out, Labuschagne paired up with Usman Khawaja to build a crucial 65-run stand. He then joined hands with Steve Smith and stitched together an 83-run stand before Washington Sundar dismissed him. On the back of Labuschagne’s knock, Australia put up a formidable first innings score of 474. Labuschagne did not stop there and carried his form into the second innings as well. At a time when the Aussies needed him to stand all and put a price tag on his wicket, Labuschagne showed why he was once the No.1 batter in Test cricket. He kept the Indian bowlers at bay for the time he was there in the middle. His knocks also made sure that India were left with very little chance of coming up trumps in the Boxing Day Test with Australia's lead already as high as 333. Labuschagne turns on Pujara mode Back in the 2020-21 Border Gavaskar Trophy, Labuschagne was the top run-scorer after he notched 426 runs at an average of 53.25 with a top score of 108. But there was a man who played 155 runs less than him but played 78 more balls. Cheteshwar Pujara scored 271 runs at a strike-rate of 29.20 and played a major role in India’s famous 2–1 series win. Boxing Day Test, Day 4 Highlights Pujara was India’s standout batter when India won the Test series back in 2018-19 when he mustered three hundreds while facing 1258 balls. Labuschagne’s knocks in the ongoing MCG Test had shades of Pujara’s grit and determination. The Australian batter was not willing to throw his wicket away by any means.   In the second innings, batting at No.3, Labuschagne saw Australia getting reduced from 43 for one to 91 for six in the space of 15.2 overs. Amidst the fall of regular wickets, the 30-year-old Labuschagne got to his half-century off 105 balls, holding one end up. He also built a crucial 57-run stand for the seventh wicket with Pat Cummins and gave the innings some momentum. It eventually was Siraj who got rid of him, but not after he scored a fighting 70 off 139 balls with three fours. If Australia go on to win the Melbourne Test, Labuschagne, without a shred of a doubt, would be one of the strong contenders to win the Player of the Match award.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 29, 2024Also Read |  IND vs AUS: What is the highest successful run-chase in Melbourne Tests?Must Watch

Marnus Labuschagne credited the lower-order fightback and explained how India's relentless bowling shaped their decision to bat longer.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/why-australia-didnt-declare-on-day-4-at-mcg-marnus-labuschagne-reveals-reason-2656943-2024-12-29,"Australia showcased remarkable resilience on Day 4 of the Boxing Day Test, recovering from a top-order collapse to strengthen their position against India. Reduced to 91/6 before Tea, the Australian tail-enders, led by Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon, and Scott Boland, staged a spirited rearguard action. Marnus Labuschagne, who anchored the innings with a gritty 70, revealed the rationale behind Australia's decision to keep batting rather than declare despite a substantial lead. Starting the day with a 105-run advantage, Australia's primary focus was on extending the lead, eventually finishing at 228/9 by stumps. This effort gave them a commanding lead of 333 runs. However, fans and experts debated the approach, suggesting Australia could have declared earlier to give themselves more time to bowl India out, especially since the highest successful chase at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is 332, achieved nearly a century ago.Were Australia planning to declare? Labuschagne explained the decision, emphasising the pressure India’s bowlers exerted early in the innings. “I think we had the perfect game for us and that probably looked like having to bowl tonight and putting them under pressure,” Labuschagne shared. “You know the way the wicket played and the way India's bowling came out and put us under the pressure in that first 40–50 overs. That wasn’t an option for us. It became ‘let’s get as many runs as we can.’” He also highlighted the contributions of Australia’s lower-middle order. “There was a time when there could have been 250-270 and maybe even less for them. So we navigated that really well. Our lower-middle order deserves a lot of credit for how they managed the last part,” Labuschagne added.A record chase awaits India Interestingly, even the tail-enders found the batting conditions favourable, with Nathan Lyon enduring nearly 20 overs at the crease. This raised questions about whether specialist Indian batters might thrive under similar conditions on the final day. By continuing to bat, Australia ensured India would need to achieve a record chase at the MCG to win the match. With history against teams chasing targets exceeding 300 at this venue, Australia’s decision reflected a cautious yet calculated approach in securing victory.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 29, 2024Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/cricket-kl-rahul-rohit-sharma-sanjay-manjrekar-mcg-test-opening-2656936-2024-12-29,"Sanjay Manjrekar said that India should contemplate sending back KL Rahul to open the batting as the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground is set for a thrilling finish. Manjrekar said that Rohit Sharma should drop to No.3 with all four results possible in the MCG Test. Since returning to the national team, Rohit has scored only 22 runs from four innings at an average of 5.50, having entered double digits only once. In the first innings of the Melbourne Test, it was Pat Cummins who accounted for his wicket after Rohit mistimed a pull shot. “Ideally, you would want KL Rahul back at the top because it’s important to have an opening start. With the kind of form Rohit Sharma has been in, you are hoping against hope that he has another long innings under his belt. Rahul at the top restores a little more confidence, and it’s been a successful opening pair in the series. That could happen and No.3 for Rohit may not be too different from batting at the top of the order,” Manjrekar told Star Sports. At Stumps on Day 4, Australia were at 228 for nine on the back of Scott Boland and Nathan Lyon’s unbeaten 55-run partnership. Australia’s lead of 333 already means that India need to record the highest successful run-chase at the MCG in Test cricket when they come out to bat. Also Read: IND vs AUS: What is the highest successful run-chase in Melbourne Tests? Manjrekar also reckoned that the Australians are likely to find it tough to dismiss Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar when the Kookaburra ball becomes old and soft. “But the real dangerman apart from the top four are people like Pant, who is used to playing a great innings. As the Kookaburra ball gets soft, you have got three guys Australia will find it tough to get out. Jadeja, Reddy and Sundar. With the Indian batting running deep and with a soft Kookaburra ball, Australia will have to bowl really well to clean up the entire Indian batting lineup,” Manjrekar added. Early on Day 5, India would be looking to take the last Australian wicket and then plan their run-chase on a pitch that has deteriorated.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 29, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Melbourne Test set for cracking finish as India eye Gabba-esque miracleMust Watch

The final day of the contest promises to be a blockbuster with all the three results possible. India are still in the hunt for the final wicket as Australia's lower-order have put up a great fight on Day 4. A record chase awaits India with Australia leading by 333 runs. Let us understand how the pitch and weather conditions will impact the final day's play. According to former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, the pitch at the venue remains favourable for batting, though there are some signs of wear and tear that could assist bowlers on the final day. While the pitch is still conducive to batting, the variable bounce and footmarks could test batters on the final day. India's ability to exploit these factors with precision will determine whether they can score runs quickly or hold on for a draw if needed.Will pitch have demons on Day 5? Gavaskar observed, ""This pitch looks like a very, very good pitch to bat on. "" Yes, there are some bowlers' footmarks over here which might come to the help of Nathan Lyon, the off-spinner, if he can land it over here and get the ball there."" These footmarks could offer unpredictable turn and bounce, especially for spinners like Lyon, making him a key player for Australia. Additionally, Gavaskar mentioned a few spots on the pitch where the ball has behaved awkwardly, as seen in Mitchell Marsh's dismissal. He elaborated, ""There have been a couple of deliveries which have gone past the shoulders of the batters. So those are the spots which can cause some problems."" Another important factor Gavaskar highlighted was the height advantage of Australian bowlers. ""The Australian bowlers will be bowling from over 200 meters. They are much taller...if the ball lands anywhere here, it can cause a bit of a problem."" However, Gavaskar concluded by emphasising that despite these challenges, the pitch remains good for batting overall. The grass has almost disappeared, and the surface has flattened significantly since Day 1.Weather report for Day 5 in Melbourne Rain is unlikely to disrupt the final day of the 4th Test between India and Australia. The forecast shows hazy sunshine throughout the day with no rain expected. Temperatures will range from 62°F (16°C) in the morning to 80°F (27°C) in the afternoon, with a gentle breeze from the south-southwest at 8–16 mph. Air quality is mostly excellent to fair, and UV levels remain moderate to low, ensuring ideal playing conditions. With no rain in the forecast, the weather looks perfect for uninterrupted cricket. Both teams will have ample opportunity to push for a result on what promises to be an enthralling final day.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 29, 2024Also Read |  South Africa qualify for WTC final with thrilling 2-wicket win vs PakistanMust Watch

Notably, Australia have extended their lead to 333 runs with still one wicket remaining. If India are to have any chance of chasing down the massive target, they would need a great start from their openers. Hence, captain Rohit Sharma would be tasked with the duty of getting his team off to a sensational start. Sunil Gavaskar showed full confidence in the India skipper to get the team off to an aggressive start like Virender Sehwag did during India’s famous 387-run chase in Chennai 2008 vs England. Sehwag had scored 83 (68) with the help of 11 fours and four sixes to get India off to a rollicking start. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “Yeah, I think, you know, because this is, this is such a situation where he can actually give the team a fabulous start just like Virender Sewag did in that chase in 2008 against England when India chased down 387 in a day. So clearly I think, not in a day the start the previous evening, but he made it easy for the Indian batters the next day. So clearly, yes, I think a good start, like I said would be absolutely God sent,” said Gavaskar in an exclusive conversation with India Today. Rohit hasn’t been in the best of forms in the series so far having scored just 22 runs from four innings at an average of 5.50. Hence, the India skipper will be desperate to get himself amongst the runs in the second innings. Further speaking ahead, Gavaskar suggested India to plan their progress on an hourly basis on Day 5 and not think about the massive target.                                                                                                           “Well, the key point really is not to, think too far ahead about the 330, whatever target is set for them. They need to break it down into not just sessions, but intervals, like drinks interval that drinks intervals will be so much. At the lunch interval, we’ll be so much, at the first drinks interval after lunch, how much then you know by hour they should plan it by the hour rather than by the session. And see where they are and assess the situation from there,” he added. England hold the record for the highest successful run-chase in the history of Test cricket at the MCG after they tracked down 332 back in 1928. As far as teams from the sub-continent are concerned, only India achieved the feat once, back in December 2020 when they tracked down 70 to win by eight wickets. In the 21st century, barring India, only the Proteas are in the list of successful chases at the MCG by a visiting team after they chased down 183 to win by nine wickets.

""He's cleaned up Alex Carey, as if, he's a number 10, 11 batter. He just had two balls in that spell left. You knew he wasn't going to bowl more than two balls, and he nailed Alex Carey there as well. And when you look at the average, I mean, this is unbelievable. We talk about Curtly Ambrose.

The India vice-captain has the best bowling average in Tests amongst bowlers with over 200 wickets. He’s also the current number-one ranked bowler in the world with the joint-highest rating by an Indian bowler (904).

He acknowledged how South Africa started the campaign on the back foot, ""It is a big one. Not just for myself but also the team and the coach. Looking at the way we started our campaign, against India and then New Zealand with a not-so-strong team, and the way we have gone through with our performances...not many gave us a chance. We have overcome a lot. We haven't been ruthless but have found a way to ensure the result was on our side. Today was a testament and speaks to the character of not just this group and South African group,"" he said. The skipper praised the team for overcoming challenges and finding ways to secure results, even if they were not ruthless in their approach. ""We can pick on certain individuals at times but performances like this, give reason to say that these guys are here for a reason and are the best. We will enjoy the moment. I don't know who is going to speak in the changing room,"" he added.

Notably, Jaiswal dropped three catches in the day of Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne and Pat Cummins which allowed Australia to bat through the entire day. However, it was Labuschagne’s drop that angered Rohit the most as he let out his frustration with a loud roar in the slip cordon. Jaiswal failed to hold on to a simple catch at third slip in the 40th over as the ball slipped out of his hands. Upon seeing Rohit’s reaction on the catch drop by his teammate, several experts slammed him for his behaviour. Former Australia cricketer Michael Hussey felt that instead of reacting angrily, Rohit needs to send the message of calm and support. “I've got to be honest, I don't like that reaction from the Indian skipper. I appreciate he's emotional, and he desperately wants wickets, but you're the one who has to send the message of calm and support. No one means to drop a catch. He's gonna feel bad enough as it is for putting a catch down, especially someone like Marnus Labuschagne; it happens quickly, it's in, it's out. You don't need to see that as a young player,” Hussey said on Fox Cricket. Darren Lehmann also praised Rishabh Pant for giving Jaiswal a pat on the back to  calm him down.Australia extend lead to 333 runs Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""Rishabh Pant did well. He actually gave him a pat on the back and said 'just hang in there, we all drop them'. What he doesn't need is the captain Rohit Sharma and (Virat) Kohli throwing their arms about.

Together, they added an unbroken 87 runs for the fourth wicket, with Shahidi remaining composed while Zazai displayed more aggression. Zimbabwe’s bowlers, led by Nyamhuri and Blessing Muzarabani, found some assistance in the morning session with seam movement and occasional bounce. However, Shahidi and Zazai remained cautious, dispatching loose deliveries to the boundary. Zazai's attacking strokes included a pulled six off Sean Williams and a few elegant drives through the off-side. The first session ended with Afghanistan adding 73 runs, but post-lunch play was cut short by ominous weather. Shahidi drove a boundary off the second ball after the break, but only two overs were bowled before lightning and thunder forced the players off the field. Heavy rain followed, and despite the ground staff’s efforts, no further play was possible. Stumps were called earlier, with rain continuing to dominate the day. With only one day remaining and further interruptions likely, the match appeared to be headed for a draw.

The 42-year-old, who retired from international cricket earlier this summer, finished his illustrious career with 704 Test wickets in 188 appearances, cementing his legacy as one of the game’s all-time greats. Speaking about his decision to retire, Anderson revealed that he felt he was in prime form and capable of contributing for England for another Ashes series. “I always thought in my head I could make The Ashes at the end of next year,” Anderson told Sky Sports. “But obviously, they didn’t think that I could. I would have carried on and I will carry on still playing in some shape or form.” Despite his confidence, England head coach Brendon McCullum was looking to recalibrate the team’s bowling attack with an eye on the future. Anderson admitted the decision was tough but acknowledged the natural progression of the team. “I think that’s part of the fun of being a professional sportsperson, to constantly find things to improve on. Especially in cricket, which is a heavily skill-based sport, there’s always something else to look into and try. I’ve always loved that side of it.”James Anderson on his retirement

He joined the backroom staff as a bowling mentor, underlining his continued impact on English cricket. In addition to his Test achievements, Anderson surprised fans by entering the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction this year. However, having not played a T20 game in a decade, he went unsold. Reflecting on his debut for England, Anderson fondly recalled the whirlwind start to his international career in 2003. “The Australian fans made sure I knew about it as well,” he said, reminiscing about his ODI debut in Australia, where he didn’t even have his name or squad number printed on his shirt. “They were giving me a fair bit of abuse. But it was so eye-opening, playing for the first time at the MCG having only played county cricket before.” From a 20-year-old prodigy who once bought England shirts to support the team, Anderson rose to become a legend. Despite retiring, he leaves the game with few regrets, his name etched in cricketing history.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Dec 29, 2024Also read |  I was sulking in toilet: Temba Bavuma reveals nervy hideout during tricky chaseTrending Reel

Reflecting on the controversy, International Chess Federation (FIDE) President Arkady Dvorkovich stated on Sunday that tournament officials would now consider allowing ""appropriate jeans"" paired with a jacket and other ""elegant minor deviations"" from the dress code. Dvorkovich acknowledged that Carlsen's stand culminated in his withdrawal from the tournament on Friday-highlighted the need for further discussion ""to ensure that our rules and their application reflect the evolving nature of chess as a global and accessible sport."" Meanwhile, Carlsen announced in a video posted on social media that he would compete-and wear jeans-at the World Blitz Championship starting Monday. ""I think the situation was badly mishandled on their side,"" the 34-year-old Norwegian grandmaster said. However, he added that he loves playing blitz-a fast-paced format of chess-and wanted fans to enjoy the event. He also noted that his discussions with the federation after Friday's incident had been constructive. ""I think we all sort of want the same thing,"" he suggested in the video, posted on his Take Take Take chess app's YouTube channel. ""We want players to feel comfortable but also relatively presentable."" The dispute began on Friday when Carlsen wore jeans and a sport coat to the Rapid World Championship, held concurrently with the blitz event. FIDE stated that longstanding rules prohibit jeans at such tournaments and that players are accommodated nearby to facilitate outfit changes if needed. An official fined Carlsen $200 and asked him to change his pants, but he refused and was consequently not paired for a ninth-round game. FIDE also noted that earlier in the day, another grandmaster, Ian Nepomniachtchi, had been fined for wearing sports shoes, but he complied with the rules, changed, and continued playing. Carlsen later explained that he had offered to comply with the dress code the following day, but officials remained unyielding. ""It became a matter of principle,"" he said, leading to his withdrawal from both the rapid and blitz championships. In Sunday's video, Carlsen questioned whether he had truly violated any rules and argued that changing clothes mid-tournament would have disrupted his concentration between games. He called the penalty ""unbelievably harsh."" ""Of course, I could have changed. Obviously, I didn't want to,"" he said. ""And I stand by that.""

Starting the day with the challenging task of breaking Australia's stubborn resistance, Bumrah wasted no time. In just four deliveries, he dismissed Nathan Lyon, ending Australia's second innings at 234. This left the hosts setting India a target of 340 runs for victory. Bumrah returned with impressive figures of 5 for 57 from 24.4 overs, delivering an exhausting yet immensely rewarding performance. This effort marked a career-high workload, as he bowled an incredible 53.2 overs in the ongoing Boxing Day Test at the MCG, the most he has bowled in his career. Bumrah's dominance at the MCG is nothing short of phenomenal. With 24 wickets across six matches at a staggering average of 14.66 and a strike rate of 32.7, he has been the backbone of India's success at the MCG. His latest five-wicket haul adds to a glittering resume that includes standout figures such as 6/33, 3/53, 4/56, 2/54, 4/99, and 5/57. This sustained brilliance not only underscores his mastery of the craft but also establishes him as one of the finest modern-day performers on cricket's biggest stage. Australia's innings began without fireworks as debutant Sam Konstas (8) fell early to Bumrah. Marnus Labuschagne stood firm with a gritty 70, but his dismissal triggered a dramatic collapse. From a steady 80/2, Australia slumped to 91/6, undone by India's relentless pace attack. Pat Cummins fought valiantly with a defiant 41, supported by a frustrating final-wicket stand between Scott Boland and Nathan Lyon, which extended Australia's lead to over 325.

Despite showing early resolve, Rohit failed to convert his slow start into meaningful runs, once again falling prey to Australian captain Pat Cummins.  Facing 40 deliveries, Rohit managed to score just nine runs—the most deliveries he has faced in an inning during this series. Demonstrating commendable patience in the first 16 overs, the opener looked to anchor the Indian innings. However, his resistance ended when he attempted an ambitious flick shot off Cummins, only to edge the ball to Mitchell Marsh at gully. After removing the Indian captain, Cummins continued to dent India's chances by removing KL Rahul for a duck in the same over. Meanwhile, Yashasvi Jaiswal has adopted an uncharacteristically defensive approach, dropping anchor and batting against his usual aggressive style. The Indian opener survived the first hour alongside opening partner Rohit Sharma but soon witnessed Sharma and KL Rahul fall to Pat Cummins in the same over. Earlier in the day, Jasprit Bumrah needed just four balls to wrap up the Australian innings. India now face a daunting record chase of 340 runs.  The contest between the two captains has been decisively one-sided, with Cummins dismissing Rohit six times in Tests, including four times in the current series alone. The Indian has managed just 31 runs in five innings at an average of 6.20 in the ongoing Australia series, a drastic decline from his form earlier this year. His struggles have placed him among the worst-performing Indian top-order batters in an away series, with a minimum of 100 balls faced. Rohit Sharma began 2024 on a high note, scoring 455 runs in a high-scoring series against England. However, his form has plummeted dramatically since India's T20 World Cup triumph, raising concerns about his future in Test cricket. Rohit's current average of 6.20 in Australia ranks as the second-lowest for a top-six batter in a Test series against Australia in Australia, and the fourth-lowest by an Indian batter in an away series.

SHASTRI EXPLAINS Virat Kohli scored a century in Perth during the first Test of the series but has struggled since, with Australia consistently troubling the star batter with their disciplined bowling outside the off-stump. Kohli’s scores since the Perth hundred read 7, 11, 3, 36, and 5.   On the other hand, Rohit Sharma has looked lost at the crease, managing scores of 3, 6, 10, 3, and 9 so far in the series, accumulating just 31 runs across three Test matches. Rohit's struggles were evident even at home during India’s shocking 0-3 defeat to New Zealand in October-November, where he managed only 91 runs in three Tests, while Kohli scored 93 runs across six innings.   Ravi Shastri empathised with Rohit Sharma, acknowledging that there was little the Indian captain could have done on the morning of Day 5 against a relentless Australian bowling attack.   ""This is the mode of dismissal. Rohit Sharma, at his best, that front foot would be closer to the pitch of the ball. There’s a trigger movement and then the front foot stays planted. So the bat goes at the ball, so you are playing away from the body,"" Shastri explained.   ""They have bowled well at him. You can say ‘try and attack the bowling’. But, they gave you nothing. This is the best I think Australia have bowled in one spell as a unit,"" he added.

The Wankhede Stadium, which hosted the cricket World Cup final in 2011, is speculated to host the bout.

Reports suggest the event could be staged in India’s financial capital, marking a historic moment for combat sports in the country.  Conor McGregor, one of the most decorated UFC stars in the history of combat sport, nearly confirmed the bout in Mumbai, responding to a news report on social media. McGregor and Paul are reported to earn USD 250 million each from the bout, which is scheduled for 2025. The bout will be part of the 'Visit India' campaign, aimed at promoting tourism in the country.  The speculation about Logan Paul's dream match-up against McGregor comes weeks after his brother Jake took on Mike Tyson in a boxing match in November.

 The financial stakes are staggering, with industry insiders estimating the fight purse to exceed $100 million, bolstered by pay-per-view sales, sponsorships, and ticket revenue. Logan Paul, known for his extravagant bouts against Floyd Mayweather and other celebrities, is expected to command a significant share of the earnings. Meanwhile, McGregor, whose career has been synonymous with record-breaking paydays, would be seeking a lucrative return to the spotlight. Mumbai's selection as a potential venue has added to the intrigue. Traditionally, boxing super fights are hosted in global hubs like Las Vegas or London. However, Mumbai’s growing reputation as a sports and entertainment hub may have tipped the scales in its favour. Sources indicate that major stakeholders, including international promoters, are eyeing the city’s iconic Wankhede Stadium as a potential venue, with a capacity to host tens of thousands of fans. This fight would mark McGregor's return to combat sports after a period of inactivity following his devastating leg injury during a UFC bout against Dustin Poirier in July 2021. McGregor, a former two-division UFC champion, has been teasing a comeback, with rumours linking him to both MMA and boxing ventures. His infamous 2017 boxing match against Floyd Mayweather, which ended in a tenth-round TKO, remains one of the highest-grossing combat sports events of all time. Logan Paul, on the other hand, has successfully transitioned from internet stardom to the boxing ring, taking on high-profile opponents and attracting massive audiences. His potential clash with McGregor promises to blend star power and entertainment value, drawing fans from diverse backgrounds. While no official announcement has been made, the mere prospect of such a fight in Mumbai has ignited a frenzy among fans and sports pundits alike. If realised, the event could cement India’s place on the global combat sports map, delivering a night of unparalleled excitement and setting new benchmarks for international boxing. For now, all eyes remain on the camps of McGregor and Paul, as the world waits to see if this rumoured blockbuster bout will come to fruition.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 30, 2024

Yashasvi weathered the storm and batted 27.5 overs with Rishabh Pant in a 79-run partnership in the second session, which did not yield a wicket to Australia.  Yashasvi Jaiswal was batting on 63 after facing 159 deliveries in the first two sessions of the final day's play when India were set a target of 330. Yashasvi and Pant showcased the temperament and resolve of the highest order as they fended off the Australian charge after India were reduced to 33 for 3 at Lunch break. India lost Rohit Sharma (9), Virat Kohli (3) and KL Rahul (0) in a horror hour that saw their hopes of saving the Test crumble.  Yashasvi Jaiswal flaunted his mental strength on Day 5, especially after having been guilty of dropping three catches on Sunday at the MCG. Jaiswal's drop catches handed Australia lifelines at various stages of their innings. Notably, he dropped Marnus Labuschagne on 46 when Australia were reeling at 91 for 6. From there, Australia went on to post 234 and stretch their second innings lead to 339 runs. AUS vs IND, 4th Test Day 5 Live ""He is a gun player. Already at this age, he is getting big scores. He is good against pace, he is good against spin. He has got a wide range of shots. He can up the tempo, if need be. But, he is playing the situation now. He knows the importance of this game. I think those three drop catches would have made him ever more determined and stay there at the end of the day’s play with a hundred,"" Ravi Shastri told official broadcaster, Star Sports.  Yashasvi Jaiswal and Mitchell Starc were involved in battle of the highest order in the first session. The left-arm Australian pacer, who was braving a back injury scare, bowled his heart out and beat the edge on multiple occasions. Yashasvi struggled to put bat to ball against Starc, but the left-hander remained resolute and hung in the middle.  The battle between Jaiswal and Starc grabbed headlines with their on-field battle. Yashasvi, who hit a match-winning 161 in Perth, sledged Starc, saying the fast bowler was bowling a bit too slow.  Starc won the sledging battle in Adelaide, dismissing the youngster in the first innings of Adelaide and Brisbane.  Yashasvi, however, found form in the first innings of the Melbourne Test, showcasing incredible discipline.

Marsh's reduced bowling workload and limited impact in matches have raised concerns about his ability to fulfil the all-rounder role effectively, leaving selectors with a critical decision to make regarding his place in the squad.  Despite the injury to Josh Hazlewood, Marsh bowled only two overs on a day when Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc were required to shoulder a significant workload. Katich highlighted that Marsh's failure to deliver with the ball, combined with his poor batting performance at the MCG, has left selectors with a tough choice.  ""No doubt Marsh is under pressure because he isn’t bowling so much. Even after Josh Hazlewood got injured, he only bowled two overs on a day when Cummins and Starc had to share the workload. There were questions, he then missed out with the bat at MCG and hasn't been able to fulfil the role with the ball. The selectors have a decision to make at the end of this Test,"" Katich told PTI during an interview. AUS vs IND, 4th Test Day 5 Live Katich also reflected on the situation regarding Mitchell Starc, who has been struggling with a ""dodgy back."" He suggested that potential replacements for Starc could be either Jhye Richardson or Sean Abbott, both of whom are currently in reserve. However, Katich also noted the potential of Spencer Johnson, a tall left-arm pacer from South Australia, as a future contender for the Test team. Johnson, who has been recovering from a toe injury, is currently playing in the Big Bash League, but Katich emphasized the difference between the demands of T20 cricket and Test matches. For Johnson to make a Test debut, Katich believes he must continue to perform well in the Sheffield Shield and demonstrate his ability to bowl long spells. While he acknowledged that Johnson possesses the skills and capability to succeed at the highest level, he emphasized the importance of consistent performance in first-class cricket before a Test call-up. In addition to discussing Australian selection concerns, Katich shared his admiration for India's Jasprit Bumrah, considering him one of the best fast bowlers to have toured Australia in the past two decades. Katich, who has played against Bumrah in several series, praised the Indian pacer for his exceptional skill set. ""Bumrah's numbers speak for themselves,"" he said, particularly citing a delivery that knocked over Alex Carey’s stumps, which was a remarkable piece of bowling. Katich explained what makes Bumrah special: ""Great pace, a unique action, and the ability to get movement both ways. He has superb control over his yorker, bouncer, and length, allowing him to adjust his lines and lengths to trouble batsmen.""Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Tune InRead More |  Rohit Sharma wastes patient start on Day 5 as poor Test run in Australia continues

Simon Katich said 'The King is dead' when Virat Kohli was dismissed for 3 in the second innings of the fourth Test. Kohli's dismissal dented India's chances of surviving the final day's play after Australia set the visitors a target of 330 on the final day. Kohli paid the price for a lapse in concentration in the final over of the first session. Virat Kohli, who has been struggling to be disciplined against deliveries bowled in the fourth to sixth stump line, fell into Australia's trap once again. Kohli poked at a delivery that was slanted across the stumps by Mitchell Starc from over the wicket. The dismissal left the majority of the Indian fans distraught as the decibel levels dipped suddenly.  ""The King is dead,"" Simon Katich quipped while doing radio commentary for SEN Cricket.  ""He trudges off. King Bumrah has taken the mantle now. Kohli looks dejected with himself. That was a big knock for him. He has come up short.

Head dismissed India's Rishabh Pant in the final session, and his subsequent quirky celebration became the talk of the cricketing world.  After tea, India stood at 112 for 3, with Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal anchoring their hopes for a draw. But Head, trusted by skipper Pat Cummins, tempted Pant into an aerial pull shot towards long-on, where Mitchell Marsh safely took the catch. This wicket set the stage for a dramatic collapse. What followed was Head's unique celebration—pointing one finger into his other hand, which was shaped like a circle. The gesture puzzled fans and commentators alike until Channel 7's James Brayshaw offered some clarity. ""Now, great people in the back have said after he took 4-10 within 17 balls in Sri Lanka in 2022 he was quoted as saying, 'I had to put the digit on ice',"" Brayshaw said. ""So that was the celebration. He said 'I just got him and I'm putting it back on ice'."" Fellow commentator Greg Blewett expressed his admiration for the explanation while Brayshaw acknowledged the behind-the-scenes team for uncovering the intriguing detail. ""You have done some investigating, haven't you, JB. I had no idea what that was all about, good work,"" he said. ""I would like to take credit, but I had nothing to do with it. I was handed it on a bit of paper. That was a good get from our team,"" he said. Pant's dismissal triggered a collapse, with Ravindra Jadeja and centurion Nitish Kumar Reddy falling soon after for meager scores. India slumped to 130-6, leaving Yashasvi Jaiswal, who ground out a resilient half-century, and Washington Sundar to salvage the game in the final session. Earlier in the day, Jasprit Bumrah shone with his 13th Test five-wicket haul, helping India bowl Australia out for 234 and setting a challenging target of 340.

Jaiswal's dismissal on the final day of the fourth Test in Melbourne sparked widespread debate, as the batter was given out despite no edge being detected on the Snickometer.  The incident occurred when Jaiswal, batting on 84, attempted to hook a short-pitched delivery from pacer Pat Cummins that was angled down the leg side. On-field umpire Joel Wilson initially ruled the batter not out after Australia appealed for a caught-behind dismissal. However, upon review, third umpire Saikat Sharfuddoula determined that the ball had deflected off Jaiswal's gloves or bat, relying on visual evidence despite Snicko showing no spike. This decision led to loud chants of ""cheater, cheater"" from the crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  Sunil Gavaskar believes Jaiswal was not out and the umpire gave the wrong decision. ""If you are using technology, then use technology only. Whatever I am seeing, I always say that this is an optical illusion. This is an optical illusion. There is snicko, what does snicko say? Snicko is a straight line. So it is absolutely not out,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports. ""According to me, this is not out. If anything could be seen from snicko, then it was different. This is a wrong decision.  Absolutely wrong decision. Otherwise, don't use technology. If you are going to go with optical illusion, then don't use technology at all. It's simple. It's very simple.""

While over ruling field umpire third umpire should have solid reasons.@ybj_19,"" Rajeev Shukla wrote on X. Jaiswal, who had played a determined innings of 84 off 208 deliveries, was visibly upset and argued with the on-field umpires before reluctantly walking off. At one stage, he seemed poised to steer India towards a draw, but the visitors collapsed under pressure, losing wickets in clusters and ultimately falling short by 184 runs in their chase of 340. The controversy deepened as the television umpire closely examined the footage, noting a possible deflection from Jaiswal's right index finger and a slight change in the ball's direction. However, the lack of conclusive evidence on Snicko fueled further debate. This contentious dismissal follows a similar incident in the opening Test in Perth, where KL Rahul’s dismissal also sparked controversy. In that case, third umpire Richard Illingworth overturned on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough’s decision in favor of Rahul despite not having access to a split-screen view, which might have clarified whether the ball grazed the bat or if the Snicko spike was caused by contact with the pads.

The two teams traded blows in a gripping contest, as Australia’s relentless approach clashed with India’s resilience in fighting back from precarious situations. The match delivered exhilarating cricket, serving as a brilliant advertisement for the enduring appeal of Test cricket in an era often dominated by the glamour of T20. India's 13-year-long unbeaten run in the Boxing Day Test in Australia finally ended as the home side clinched an 184-run victory in the final session of the final day's play. India were not able to repeat the heroics of Sydney 2021 where they batted an entire day to save a Test match. After they were set a target of 330, India saw their big guns, including Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, failing to step up when the team needed them the most.  In a Test where Jasprit Bumrah continued to be unplayable and Nitish Kumar Reddy announced his arrival with a rearguard hundred, India's inability to perform collectively hurt their chances.  It was also the first time Australia have won a red-ball Test match against India in their home soil since 2018. Australia will head to the final Test of the series in Sydney with an unbeatable 2-1 lead. YASHASVI'S MARATHON IN VAIN Yashsavi Jaiswal's valiant knock of 84 off 208 delivered went in vain as Australia wrapped up the Test before the second new ball was taken in the final hour of the fifth day's play. Washington Sundar, who hit a fifty in the first innings, remained unbeaten on 5 after facing 45 balls, but he ran out of partners.  India were 33 for 3 at the lunch break on Day 5 after Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli failed. However, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant batted out 27.5 overs and added an unbeaten 78-run stand, not giving a wicket to Australia in the second session. Just when it looked like India were comfortably headed towards a draw, Rishabh Pant threw it away, hitting a half-tracker from Travis Head, Australia's part-time bowler, to the long-on fielder after the Tea break.  India collapsed from there, losing three wickets for the next nine runs, eventually folding for 155. India battled it out for 79.1 overs, but they were not able to last the final day with the bat. India lost seven wickets in the final session, much to the disappointment of thousands of Indian fans who turned up to watch them in action at the G. PAT CUMMINS AT HIS BEST, AGAIN Captain Pat Cummins was at his absolute best on Day 5 as he led from the front when India were trying to escape with a draw. The fast bowler picked three wickets, including the crucial one of Yashasvi Jaiswal in the final session, and was spot on with his tactics on the field as Australia were rewarded for their never-say-die attitude.  One of the major differences between the two sides was the performances of their captains. While Cummins did not put a foot wrong, India captain Rohit appeared low on confidence at the MCG, as he has been throughout the series.  Scott Boland, who enjoys bowling at the MCG was relentless once again as he took three wickets, including that of Ravindra Jadeja and lower-order batters Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah.  Off-spinner Nathan Lyon made his first significant contribution in the Test series, picking up three crucial wickets after chipping in with a crucial 41 with the bat that stretched Australia's second-innings lead beyond 300.

The decision caused widespread controversy across the cricketing world, as Jaiswal was the last specialist batter for India, fighting to save the Test match. Jaiswal was given caught behind by the third umpire despite the snicko meter showing that he did not edge the ball. The incident occurred in the 71st over of the match when Jaiswal was batting at 94. The left-hander miscued his pull shot after he failed to get a clean connection. The ball flew to the leg side of wicketkeeper Alex Carey, seemingly touching the glove of the batter. Carey completed a good catch on his wrong side and appealed to the umpire. On-field umpire Joel Wilson was not convinced by the appeal and judged Jaiswal not out.

Manjrekar further called the decision a brave one by the third umpire. ""Any other umpire would have gone the other way. They would have said that I love snicko as a technology and I trust snicko and would have given it a not out And that also would have been accepted by us as a pretty okay call,"" Sanjay Manjrekar said while commentating during the match.

AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Speculation surrounding Rohit Sharma's Test future intensified following his twin failures in Melbourne. Social media was abuzz with rumours of a potential retirement announcement, with his place in the side coming under scrutiny. The decision to drop Shubman Gill, one of India’s standout performers in 2024, added fuel to the fire as pundits questioned Rohit's own position in the squad. Legendary cricketer Mark Waugh was particularly blunt, suggesting that Rohit’s Test career might not extend beyond the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Rohit returned from paternity leave for the second Test in Adelaide, where India suffered a heavy 10-wicket defeat. A rain-affected draw in Brisbane followed, before the Boxing Day Test loss handed Australia their first victory over India in a Melbourne Test in 13 years.   Rohit is winless in his last six Tests as captain, including a stunning 0-3 whitewash at home against New Zealand in October-November. His batting form has also been underwhelming, with just 31 runs in six innings in this series and a total of 123 runs across his last six Tests.A DRAWN SERIES WILL BE NICE: ROHIT The India captain remained optimistic, saying the visiting team will look to buckle up and win the final Test and draw the series.  ""As of now, that’s where it is. There are things that we, as a team, need to look at, and I personally need to look at as well. We will try and see what happens. There’s a game to go. If that game goes well, it will be 2-2. A draw will be really nice,"" he added.   If India go on to win the Sydney Test, starting January 3, they will retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and boost their chances of reaching the World Test Championship final.

Rohit's thought process seemed bizarre given the fact that no team in the past 96 years has successfully chased a target exceeding 300 at the MCG.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ind-vs-aus-4th-test-rohit-sharma-india-wanted-to-go-for-win-mcg-boxing-day-2657219-2024-12-30,"India were hammered by Australia in the Boxing Day Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. India were beaten by a big margin of 184 runs, while chasing a 340-run target. Speaking at the post-match presentation ceremony, Rohit Sharma revealed that India were trying to chase the runs on the final day of the Test match. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Rohit's tactical call came as a little bizarre given the MCG deck was a difficult one to bat on. Not only there was prodigious seam movement on Day 4 and 5 of the Test match, but there was no evidence of a big target being chased down in the past 5 years as well. Australia were undefeated at the MCG in the last three matches, winning two of them by an innings margin. In fact, in fact, no team in the past 96 years has successfully chased a target exceeding 300 at the MCG. ""We knew 340 wasn't going to be easy. We tried to set a platform and keep wickets in hand for the last two sessions, but they bowled perfectly as well. We wanted to go for the target, but we didn't set the platform from our side. There are ways to win games and we fell short in finding ways to win games,"" Rohit Sharma said at the post-match presentation ceremony. IND vs AUS, 4TH TEST: MATCH REPORT The India captain further spoke about the reasons behind losing the Boxing Day Test match, India's first defeat since 2011. Rohit said that India failed to set themselves a platform which could have allowed them to push for the target - much like what they had done at the Gabba in 2024. ""It is pretty disappointing. It's not that we went in with the intent of giving up the fight. We wanted to fight till the end and unfortunately, we couldn't do it. It'll be tough to assess just the last two sessions. If you look at the overall Test match, we had our chances, but we didn't take them. We had Australia 90 for 6. We know things can get tough, but we want to play tough cricket in hard situations. I don't want to look at one situation. We were not good enough,"" Rohit Sharma said after the match.  ""I went back to my room and thought about what else we could have done as a team, but we threw everything we had, but they fought hard, especially that last-wicket partnership, which probably cost us the game there,"" Rohit further added. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri believed that India's chances of winning went out of the window once Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli got out cheaply in the morning session of the day. India were reeling at 33/3 at Lunch after which Rishabh Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal held the reins of the innings. Shastri argued that the game's fate was sealed when Rishabh Pant was dismissed by Travis Head just after Tea. ""It was the wicket of Rishabh Pant. You know, they knew they couldn't win the game at lunch time once they lost three wickets. Only chance you have of winning is if there's a platform set, exactly what Rohit said. And then when the Australians got Risabh Pant out after Tea, that lifted the Australians. That was the opening they were looking for,"" Ravi Shastri argued. India fell like a pack of cards after the dismissal of Rishabh Pant. From 121/4, India were bundled out for just 155 runs in a space of 20-odd overs. With the loss, India go into the Sydney Test match trailing 1-2 in the Border-Gavsskar Trophy. The fifth and the final Test match of the series starts from 3 January.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: How can India qualify for WTC final after Boxing Day Test defeat?Must Watch

The loss dropped India's points percentage (PCT) from 55.89 to 52.77, leaving them in third place with their seventh defeat of this WTC cycle. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Meanwhile, Australia bolstered their chances with their 10th win of the cycle, raising their PCT from 58.89 to 61.45. With South Africa already securing a spot in next year’s WTC final at Lord’s following their victory over Pakistan, Australia can eliminate India from contention by either drawing or winning the final Test in Sydney, which begins on January 3. Currently in second place in the standings, Australia can join South Africa in the 2025 one-off Test decider with a win in any of their remaining three Tests this cycle.CAN INDIA REACH WTC FINAL? India's hopes of reaching the WTC final remain alive but precarious. To secure a spot in the final, they must win the Sydney Test to level the Border-Gavaskar series and then depend on Australia failing to win any of their matches in the upcoming series in Sri Lanka, scheduled for next month.  The defeat at the MCG has turned the upcoming SCG Test into a must-win match for India to keep their World Test Championship hopes alive. Even with a victory in Sydney, India will need Australia to falter during their tour of Sri Lanka, hoping for a 1-0 or 2–0 series win for the hosts. If both Tests in Sri Lanka end in draws, Australia will secure their spot in the final. The highest winning percentage India can achieve, even with a triumph at the SCG, is 55.26, leaving their fate partially out of their hands. 
 


WHAT HAPPENED IN BOXING DAY TEST? The Boxing Day Test in Melbourne reached a thrilling conclusion as Australia secured a dramatic 184-run victory over India in the final hour of the fifth day on Monday. The last Indian wicket fell with just under 14 overs remaining as Nathan Lyon dismissed Mohammed Siraj, sparking jubilant celebrations among the MCG crowd of over 74,000. The epic contest between the two cricketing giants ended with Australia taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match Border-Gavaskar series. A draw or win in the next match in Sydney will see Australia reclaim the trophy. As reigning ICC World Test Championship holders, Australia are now well-positioned to secure a spot in next year's final at Lord's. The victory was built on a strong team performance, with Player of the Match Pat Cummins (3/28) delivering a game-changing spell before lunch on the final day. India's hopes were briefly reignited by an excellent 88-run partnership between Yashasvi Jaiswal (88) and Rishabh Pant (30) for the fourth wicket. However, momentum shifted back to Australia when Pant fell to part-time bowler Travis Head (1/14), and Jaiswal's dismissal soon after—via a TV umpire decision overturning the on-field call—left the visitors in trouble. Lyon (2/37), who bowled tirelessly throughout the day, sealed the victory by claiming the final wicket, capping off one of the most memorable Test matches witnessed on Australian soil in recent years.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Read More |  Sunil Gavaskar, Rajeev Shukla blast Yashasvi Jaiswal's controversial MCG dismissal

Rohit's cheeky reaction to Pant's frustrating dismissalsBorder-Gavaskar Trophy: India captain Rohit Sharma expressed his disappointment with Rishabh Pant's shot selection in both innings of the Boxing Day Test. Pant faced the heat after throwing his wicket away at a crucial juncture on Day 5 of the Test, which India lost by 184 runs. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ind-vs-aus-4th-test-rishabh-pant-dismissal-rohit-sharma-press-conference-comments-2657240-2024-12-30,"India captain Rohit Sharma was unimpressed by Rishabh Pant's reckless dismissals in the Boxing Day Test. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Rohit took a dig at Pant after he was asked about the latter's dismissal on Day 5 of the the Test, which India lost by 184 runs.  AUS vs IND, 4th Test: Full Scorecard Asked if Rishabh Pant's reckless shot in the final session put India in trouble in Melbourne, Rohit Sharma cheekily asked the journalist if he was referring to the dismissal in the first or the second innings of the game. Rohit did not mince any words while questioning Rishabh's shot selection in both innings of the Boxing Day game. Pant copped a lot of criticism for his dismissals in either innings. But his wicket in the second innings turned out to be a telling blow for the Indian team as it triggered a collapse on the final day of the Test match. With India chasing 340 runs for the win, Pant was the 4th wicket to fall.  Rishabh Pant's wicket came right after the Tea break when the left-hander tried to unnecessarily take on Travis Head, Australia's part-time bowler. At the time, Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal had nearly added 100 runs between themselves, helping India recover from a top-order collapse (33/3). Head tempted Pant into an aerial pull shot towards long-on, where Mitchell Marsh safely took the catch. This wicket set the stage for a dramatic collapse and India were bowled out for just 155 runs after that. It was frustrating as India recovered from 33 for 3 and added 79 runs in the second session without losing a wicket. Pant and Yashasvi showcased incredible discipline and composure, but the wicketkeeper-batter threw it away after the Tea break.  ""Today right, or are you talking about the first innings?"" Rohit Sharma gave a cheeky response to the journalist who questioned Rishabh Pant's pattern of dismissals. The India captain added that the team gets frustrated when the left-hander gets out playing a rash shot in pressure situations. However, Rohit chose to not throw Rishabh under the bus, stating that Pant had his own game plans but needed to recognise the value of his wickets in crunch situations. ""It just happened. There hasn't been any discussion about it today. Obviously, you know we lost the game. Everybody is disappointed about how things actually planned out. We certainly didn't think of this result. Rishabh Pant obviously needs to understand what is required from him more than any one of us telling him. It's about him understanding and figuring out what is the right way to go about it. In the past, he's given us a lot of success doing what he does. So as a captain, there is a kind of mixed reaction to that. Sometimes you want to back that thought of him playing the way he plays, and sometimes when things don't look good, it frustrates everyone,"" Rohit Sharma said.

— 7Cricket (@7Cricket) December 30, 2024 ""That's the reality, it's the success and the failure. There is there needs to be a balance about it. As a captain, it's very hard to have a conversation. It has given him a lot of success as well, but it's about him figuring out, you know, what is the right way to do things. It's just about the situation as well. Certain situations of the game where, if there is a risk percentage, do you want to take that risk? Do you want to let the opposition come back into the game? Those are the things he needs to figure out himself,"" the India captain explained. IND vs AUS, 4th Test: Match Report ""See, I know Rishabh for a very long time, and I understand his cricket as well. In the past also we've had a lot of conversations. There's no way I can say that I've not had a chat with him or that he doesn't understand what the team expects. He understands that, but the things that he does gives him results as well. So, it's just that fine line between telling him not to do those things or telling him to do those things,"" concluded the skipper.STUPID: GAVASKAR SLAMS PANT Earlier in the first innings of the Boxing Day Test match, Pant's dismissal had angered legendary Sunil Gavaskar. The legendary player had slammed Pant for his reckless dismissal on Day 3. While commentating for the host broadcaster, Gavaskar called Pant stupid after the keeper-batter was dismissed for just 28 runs in India's first innings. With India in dire straits, Pant's decision to play an unorthodox scoop shot off Scott Boland's bowling left many fans and experts questioning his temperament and approach in high-pressure situations. Gavaskar hit out at Pant and used some harsh words for the batter after his dismissal. Pant had looked jittery from the very start of his innings on Day 3. He nearly got caught twice at the slip cordon in the first hour of play and then survived 2 run-out attempts due to on-field mix-ups with Ravindra Jadeja. After settling down his nerves near the hour mark, Pant decided to scoop Scott Boland's full-length delivery behind the keeper. The batter did not get the ideal connection and was caught at deep third man after top-edging the ball. ""Stupid, stupid, stupid! You have two fielders there, you still go for that shot. You have missed the previous shot and look where you have been caught. You have been caught at deep third man. That is throwing away your wicket. Not in the situation that India was in. You have to understand the situation as well. You cannot say that that's your natural game. I'm sorry that is not your natural game. That is a stupid shot that is letting your team down badly,"" Sunil Gavaskar fumed while commentating on the match. ""He should not be going in that dressing room. He should be going to the other dressing room,"" he had added.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also Read |  Rohit Sharma concedes dip in form and captaincy but mum about Test futureMust Watch

Bumrah, India’s premier fast bowler, has been a cornerstone of the team’s bowling attack in the series, delivering match-defining performances while raising concerns about the heavy burden placed on him. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Bumrah’s workload in 2024 has been staggering. He has bowled the second-most overs amongst seamers worldwide this year and featured in the highest number of innings. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Rohit Sharma admitted to the challenges of balancing Bumrah’s exceptional form with the need to protect him from overexertion. ""There is to be honest (risk of overbowling Bumrah). He has bowled a lot of overs there's no doubt about it. But again, every Test match we play, we keep that in mind, the workloads of all the bowlers in fact. But again, if somebody is in such great form, you want to try and maximise that form how-much-ever you can and that is what we've been trying to do with Bumrah,"" Rohit said. ""There comes a time when you need to step back a little bit and give him that little bit of extra breather as well. So we've been very careful. I've been very careful. I talked to him about how he feels and stuff like that. So yeah, those things should be managed carefully, and I'm trying to do that on the field,"" he added. With 12 Tests under his belt in 2024—the most in his career so far—the 31-year-old pacer has shouldered significant responsibility. His 52.4 overs in Melbourne- the most he has ever bowled in a Test match. Bumrah has bowled a staggering total of 141.2 overs so far across the four Tests against Australia so far, picking up 30 wickets at an average of 12.83, The other pacers in the India squad, like Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Harshit Rana do not come close to the tally, which has now taken a concerning shape.Bumrah’s Masterclass Bumrah showcased his exceptional skills yet again in the Boxing Day Test, claiming his 13th five-wicket haul as India bowled out Australia for 228 on Day 5. However, despite his heroics, India suffered a 184-run defeat in the fourth Test. On Sunday, Bumrah surpassed Kapil Dev’s record to become the leading Indian wicket-taker against Australia in Australia. Achieving this milestone in just his 44th Test, Bumrah also became the joint second-fastest Indian to reach 200 Test wickets, matching Ravindra Jadeja. His bowling average of 19.56 is the best among all bowlers who have achieved the feat. Bumrah’s dominance across formats has necessitated careful workload management. Since his debut in 2018, he has missed 18 of 30 home Tests due to injuries or workload management, though he has been more consistent in away Tests. Remarkably, 153 of his first 200 Test wickets have come overseas, highlighting his unmatched effectiveness in foreign conditions. While Bumrah’s home average is marginally better, his away performances are no less extraordinary. His consistency and ability to deliver under pressure have made him invaluable, but the balance between brilliance and sustainability remains critical.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also Read |  Rohit Sharma concedes dip in form and captaincy but mum about Test future

Manjrekar believes Kohli is a great batter in Test cricket and deserves a longer rope than his captain. Manjrekar was addressing discussions about the futures of the two veteran cricketers after they failed to perform when the team needed them most during the final innings of the fourth Test in Melbourne on Monday, December 30. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD While Virat Kohli has played 122 Test matches, scoring 9,207 runs with 30 centuries, Rohit Sharma has accumulated 4,302 runs in 67 Tests. Kohli is widely regarded as a modern-day great in Test cricket, whereas Rohit has flirted with Test stardom for a few years but will ultimately be remembered as a batsman who never matched his white-ball legacy. Kohli is also India's most successful Test captain, having led the team to an historic overseas series win in Australia, whereas Rohit Sharma's captaincy has come under scrutiny after a series whitewash at the hands of New Zealand and losses in the Pink-ball Test and Boxing Day Test Down Under. ""I must say there is no comparison between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as Test batters. Virat Kohli is right up there. He's a great Test batter and Rohit Sharma is a good Test batter. Rohit's white-ball batting great. So Virat Kohli obviously deserves a longer rope. It's not so much about Virat Kohli. I want to know what the batting coach of India is doing. We can't solve the obvious problem of such a fine player. Enough has been said about Virat Kohli, we just have to leave him alone,"" Sanjay Manjrekar said while speaking on Star Sports after the Boxing Day Test. Meanwhile, Rohit admitted that both his batting form and leadership have not met expectations but refrained from making any definitive statements about his future in the Test team. Facing tough questions during the press conference following India’s loss in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, Rohit addressed the team’s inability to secure a draw on the final day. ""It's not really up to Rohit Sharma. If you look at how the protocol and the hierarchy of team selection is, the chairman of selectors, he has the decision to make. He has the power to do what's best for Indian cricket, so it's not so much about Rohit Sharma himself, you know, deciding what should be the future. The chairman of the selector has that power. That's with Rohit and he does look down in the doldrums. Virat Kohli is a different issue altogether,"" Manjrekar added. ROHIT vs VIRAT: BGT PERFORMANCES Rohit's dismal run on the tour of Australia continued on Day 5 of the fourth Test, as the Indian captain was dismissed for just 9 off 40 balls during India's chase of 340 to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The 37-year-old managed only 31 runs across five innings, averaging a mere 6.20—the worst ever for a visiting skipper in a Test series in Australia. This performance added to his forgettable stretch in the format since September, during which he scored just 164 runs at an average of slightly over 10. Kohli, meanwhile, provided a glimmer of hope with a century in Perth, raising expectations of a comeback following a lean patch in the home series against New Zealand in early November. However, his subsequent five innings yielded scores of 7, 11, 3, 36, and 5, dashing those hopes.

Bumrah appears to be the frontrunner to win the honour after a sensational year with the red ball.  England's young batting sensation Harry Brook and Sri Lanka's batting hero Kamindu Mendis complete the four-man shortlist for the ICC Test Cricketer of the Year award.  The nominees for the Test honour were confirmed by the ICC, a day after Arshdeep Singh and Babar Azam featured in the list of nominees for the Men's T20I Cricketer of the Year award.  Featuring across 13 Tests in the calendar year, Bumrah delivered his best-ever annual tally - 71 wickets - finishing the year with more Test wickets than any of his counterparts. Bumrah has been the standout bowler in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series between Australia and India taking 30 wickets in four matches, 10 more than the nearest rival and opposition captain Pat Cummins.  Bumrah also led India to a victory in his second Test as captain. Standing in for Rohit Sharma in the series opener in Perth, Bumrah was lethal with the ball and switched on tactically as India hammered Australia by 290 runs. TWO ENGLAND BATTERS IN CONTENTION Joe Root, meanwhile, continued his golden run with the bat. Across 17 Tests, he compiled his second-best annual run-tally in Tests - second only to his 1708 runs from 2021. It was also the fifth instance of Root scoring over 1000 Test runs in a calendar year. With six Test hundreds to go alongside five half-centuries, Root was a consistent performer for England - both home and away. Sri Lanka's Kamindu Mendis had a breakthrough year in 2024.  Putting in a admirable performances both home and away, Mendis boasted incredible numbers. The most notable was him becoming the joint-third quickest to score 1000 Test runs - equalling Sir Don Bradman’s 13-innings mark to reach the milestone. Mendis averaged more than any of the batters who played more than two Tests in the calendar year - a staggering 74.92 from nine matches. Meanwhile, Harry Brook, the flagbearer of England's Bazball approach, became the No. 1-ranked batter in Tests for the first time in his career in 2024.

Starc had raised concerns after suffering a back issue while bowling on Day 3 of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD The left-arm pacer was seen clutching his back during the third day of the Test but continued to bowl 16 overs in the second innings and even on Day 5. Despite these efforts, Pat Cummins confirmed during the post-match press conference that Starc’s fitness would be assessed before the Sydney Test. However, early signs suggest that the veteran pacer is on track to regain full fitness for the crucial encounter. ""I think every fast bowler knows it, the first ball of a spell when you're a bit sore, it's always hurts a little bit more. So yeah, I'm pretty confident he'll be fine. We'll reassess in a couple of days but yeah, he's managing a couple of sore bits, looked like his ribs or something. But he's a warrior. He gets through. He never even contemplates not being an option to bowl. So, yeah, other than being in pain, he's fully fully fit and available,"" Cummins said. Australia secured a 2-1 lead in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series with a dominant 184-run victory in the Melbourne Test. The team is keen to capitalise on this momentum in Sydney as they aim to solidify their chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship Final. Starc's presence, even though he managed only one wicket in the Melbourne Test, will be critical for Australia’s plans. Starc displayed remarkable determination, bowling through pain on Day 3. He refrained from taking the ball on Day 4, leaving Cummins, Scott Boland, and Nathan Lyon to complete India’s first-innings dismissal. However, on Day 5, ahead of India’s second innings, Starc stated that he would deliver as many overs as needed, showcasing his commitment to the team’s cause. The Sydney Test will be pivotal, not only in deciding the series outcome but also in boosting Australia's WTC qualification prospects. Starc’s pace and ability to create pressure will be invaluable, and his availability could bolster the team’s chances of wrapping up the series with another strong performance.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also Read |  Today or 1st innings?

Pathan’s comments, made during a discussion on Star Sports, come amidst Rohit’s prolonged slump in form in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia, where his struggles with the bat have been a significant factor in India’s underwhelming performance.  AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Rohit Sharma’s twin failures in Melbourne have intensified discussions about his Test future. Across five innings in the current series, the skipper has managed only 31 runs at an average of 6.20. His lack of form has placed him amongst the least effective Indian top-order batters in an away series, with his inability to convert starts raising questions about his longevity in the format. Fans and pundits alike are now speculating whether the 37-year-old might announce his Test retirement after the series concludes. ""A player who has made about 20,000 runs—yet the way Rohit is struggling now, it seems his form is not supporting him at all. What’s happening now is that he is the captain, so he is playing. If he were not the captain, he might not be playing right now. You would have had a set team. K.L. Rahul would have been playing at the top. Jaiswal would have been there. Shubman Gill would have been there. If we talk about reality, considering how he is struggling with the bat, there might not have been a place for him in the playing XI,"" Irfan Pathan told Star Sports. But because he is the captain, and you want to win the next match to draw the series, he stays in the team. But his form is so poor. Even in India, even before coming here, he wasn’t scoring runs, and he still hasn’t scored runs. This is a very disappointing scene when I see Rohit Sharma batting. Because whenever I see Rohit Sharma batting, I always want to see him bat. Whether it is test cricket or one-day cricket, But now, his form, the way he is going forward, whether it is his mindset or the coordination with his body, I can't see that at all,"" he added. Rohit started 2024 on a promising note, scoring an impressive 455 runs in a high-scoring series against England. However, his form has taken a nosedive since then. The nadir came during the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne, where he faced 40 deliveries on Day 5 but could only muster nine runs before falling to Australia captain Pat Cummins. This marked the longest Rohit had lasted at the crease in the series, underscoring his struggles against Australia’s disciplined bowling attack. His current series average of 6.20 is the second-lowest for a top-six batter in a Test series against Australia in Australia. It also ranks as the fourth-lowest by an Indian batter in an away series, highlighting the extent of his decline. Adding to his woes, Rohit’s captaincy record has come under scrutiny. The crushing 184-run defeat in Melbourne extended India’s winless streak under his leadership to six Tests, including a 0-3 home whitewash against New Zealand in late 2024. As Australia lead the series 2-1, Rohit’s form and leadership are under intense scrutiny. With calls for change growing louder, the Indian skipper faces an uphill battle to silence critics and prove his mettle in the longest format.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also Read |  Rohit Sharma wary of over-bowling Jasprit Bumrah in Australia: Been very carefulMust Watch

On Day 5 of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Jaiswal scored 82 runs, after which Cummins accounted for his wicket. On-field umpire Joel Wilson did not give the batter out, but third umpire Sharfulddoula Saikat from Bangladesh adjudged the batter out. The SnickoMeter showed no spike, but there was a deviation in the path of the ball that led Saikat to give the decision in the fielding team’s favour. Cummins said that after hitting the ball, Jaiswal also acknowledged his dismissal by dropping his head. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD “I think it was clear that he hit it. I heard a noise (and) saw deviation. So I was absolutely certain that he hit it. As soon as we referred it, you could see him drop his head and basically acknowledge that he hit it,” Cummins said in the post-match press conference.Correct decision: Simon Taufel  Legendary umpire Simon Taufel also backed Saikat, saying that the TV umpire made the ‘correct decision’. He said that Saikat was right in adjudging the batter out on the basis of the ball’s deviation. ""In my view, the decision was out. The third umpire did make the correct decision in the end. With the technology protocols, we do have a hierarchy of redundancy and when the umpire sees a clear deflection off the bat there is no need to go any further and use any other form of technology to prove the case,” Taufel told Channel 7. As far as Cummins is concerned, he won the Player of the Match award for his all-round performance after Australia won by 184 runs to take a 2-1 series lead.

On Monday, December 30, India went 1-2 down in the five-match series and lost the chance of making a hat-trick of Test series wins on Australian soil. Chasing 340 in the fourth innings on Day 5, India were bowled out for 234 in 83.4 overs. After the match during the press conference, the 37-year-old Rohit said that the youngsters needed to learn the art of converting their starts. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD “We got plenty of chances to win or even draw the game. But there are many guys who scored runs, but could have played a big innings. The guys are new and they will learn as they keep playing,” Rohit said. Rohit also talked about Pant’s style of play. Pant was severely criticised in the first innings after he got out to the rash shot. In the second, the 27-year-old Pant looked calm before succumbing to a mistimed pull shot off Travis Head. Rohit said that Pant needed to understand the game and make his choices accordingly. ""It's [Pant's dismissal] just happened, there hasn't been any discussion about today. Obviously we've lost the game, everybody is disappointed about how things panned out ... But again, look, Rishabh Pant obviously he needs to understand what is required from himself,” Rohit said. ""More than any one of us telling him, it's about him understanding and figuring out what's the right way to go about it. In the past, he has given us lot of success doing what he does. As a captain, there's a kind of mixed reaction to that,” Rohit added.

However, it’s not difficult to pinpoint what held India back in the fourth chapter of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy—it wasn’t the ‘naye ladke,’ but the veterans. Are Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma overstaying their welcome in the Test team? How long will we keep hearing the oft-repeated refrain: “Retirement is a personal call?"" Does anyone within the Indian cricket team’s setup have the authority to tell Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli that their time is up? Can the head coach or selectors take the bold call of dropping them in Sydney? Some established senior players in the past, including Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane -- the heroes of India’s last Test series triumph in Australia -- were told their services were no longer required when their form dipped. Is there a different standard for the superstars? When India needed to bat out 90-odd overs on Day 5 of a fiercely contested Test in Melbourne, their senior players failed. When the team needed them the most, Rohit managed just 9 runs, and Virat Kohli fell for 3. Both played avoidable shots, given the conditions and the match situation. India folded for 155 after battling for 79.1 overs. Yashasvi Jaiswal batted for nearly 40 of those overs, and Rishabh Pant for almost 20, before playing a rash shot that “frustrated” captain Rohit. To his credit, Rohit didn’t entirely shift the blame onto the younger players. He acknowledged the dip in form and captaincy, but refrained from commenting on his Test future. It was widely speculated that Rohit Sharma would follow R Ashwin into Test retirement. However, the Indian captain appeared determined to hold on to his spot, hinting he would play in the final Test of the series in Sydney. The external criticism is growing louder, and it no longer feels irrelevant or exaggerated. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli haven’t been justifying the extended opportunities they’ve been granted.HELPLESS ROHIT STRUGGLES FOR ANSWERS 

 



Rohit Sharma averages 6.20 with the bat in the ongoing series (AP Photo)
 The pressure on Rohit Sharma has been mounting ever since India’s proud 12-year home Test series dominance came to a crushing end in November with a 0–3 loss to New Zealand. With the bat, Rohit has lacked the conviction that underpinned his late bloom as a Test opener. In his last six Tests, he has scored only 123 runs. Things haven’t improved for Rohit in Australia. It’s often said that Test cricket in Australia makes or breaks cricketers. Unfortunately, Rohit’s legacy as a Test cricketer is disintegrating in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. While Virat Kohli is haunted by familiar concerns, Rohit Sharma has appeared clueless at the crease. With the bat, he has managed just 31 runs in three Tests. On the field, his tactical acumen has been poor, failing to seize critical moments. Rohit Sharma has not justified his position as team captain, nor does he seem to warrant a place in the side as a specialist batter. Legendary Australian batter Mark Waugh made a blunt assessment: ""I think the selectors have been lenient. They have extended the amount of games and innings to get a score than any other player."" To make matters worse for Rohit, his counterpart, Pat Cummins, is leading by example. The Australian fast bowler has bowled tirelessly and made proactive on-field decisions, never letting India take control of proceedings.  Jasprit Bumrah, who led India to a commanding 290-run victory in Perth in Rohit Sharma’s absence, seems a much better candidate to lead the team. Team selection under his captaincy has also been contentious. Dropping Shubman Gill for the Melbourne Test, citing the team’s best interests, seemed questionable, especially when Rohit failed to let his bat do the talking.  Even pundits, who rarely criticise star players, have struggled to defend Rohit Sharma.DOES KOHLI DESERVE A LONGER ROPE? With Virat Kohli, there’s more frustration than hopelessness. Kohli’s numbers remain unimpressive. While he showed glimpses of a return to form in 2022 after two challenging years in Tests, he ended 2024 with just 417 runs at an average of under 25. He scored a paltry 93 runs against New Zealand at home and began his Australian campaign with a century in Perth, only to follow it with just 62 runs in the next three Tests. Kohli’s recurring tendency to flirt with deliveries in the fourth to sixth stump line remains a glaring issue. Despite extensive efforts in the nets, he continues to fall into the Australian off-side trap. Yet, critics have been kinder to Virat Kohli, considering his legacy as a Test batter and the intensity that he still brings to the middle. 

 



The off-stump trap has worked against Virat Kohli (AP Photo)
 “I think Virat Kohli will play for some time—forget the way he got out today. I believe he’ll play for three or four more years,” former head coach Ravi Shastri told Star Sports on Monday. “As for Rohit, it’s his call. At the top of the order, his footwork isn’t the same. At times, he’s a little late in meeting the ball. So it’s his decision at the end of the series.” Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar, as always, was more direct. “There’s no comparison between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as Test batters. Kohli is a great Test batter; Rohit is a good one. Rohit’s white-ball batting is exceptional. Virat deserves a longer rope,” Manjrekar said. “It’s not so much about Kohli. I wonder what India’s batting coach is doing. We can’t fix the obvious issues of such a fine player. Enough has been said about Kohli—let’s just leave him alone.” Yet, shouldn’t we expect one of the greatest batters in the game to address his weaknesses and deliver on the big stage? Watching Kohli repeat the same errors has become increasingly frustrating and painful. Yes, it’s unfair to compare Kohli’s Test career to Rohit’s. But Kohli’s longer lean patch in Tests has only been masked by occasional brilliance, sparing him from harsher scrutiny. Ashwin departed the international stage with the question being “why” rather than “when”. If things continue the way they are, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli might not be afforded the same grace.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Tune InMust Watch

While Jaiswal's valiant efforts provided some resistance, India struggled to cope with the Australians’ all-round dominance, allowing the hosts to take a 2-1 lead in the series. Konstas' memorable debut has added fuel to the fire in an already intense series.

Gaud took four wickets while Anushka scored an unbeaten fifty as MP took down the 2018–19 champions in a one-sided grand finale to claim the title for the first time. After being asked to bat first, Bengal, who set the record for the highest run-chase in List A cricket earlier, were bowled out for 136 in 38.2 overs. Gaud wreaked havoc early in the innings after dismissing Dhara Gujjar, Sasthi Mondal and Richa Ghosh in quick succession. Later, Gaud took the wicket of Titas Sadhu to finish with figures of 9-1-25-4.

While young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal faced criticism for dropped catches, focusing solely on his errors ignores the broader systemic issues plaguing the team. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD On Day 4, Yashasvi Jaiswal had a tough day in the field, dropping three critical catches. His first missed opportunity came in the third over, when he failed to grab a difficult chance off Usman Khawaja, who was on 2. Later, Jaiswal dropped a straightforward catch at silly point, giving Marnus Labuschagne, who was on 46, an extra life. In the final over before Tea, he spilled another chance, this time letting off Pat Cummins. Although these errors were costly, Jaiswal displayed tremendous resilience with the bat, top-scoring for India in the second innings with an 84-run knock. His performance under pressure highlighted his mental strength, but it also underscored that the team’s issues run far deeper than a few dropped catches.Five Key Reasons for India’s MCG Test lossSenior Players’ Failures India’s senior players, particularly Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, failed to deliver in crucial moments. On Day 5, when India needed to bat out 90 overs to save the match, Rohit fell for 9, and Kohli managed just 3, both playing reckless shots. Rohit has struggled throughout the series, scoring just 31 runs in six innings at a shocking average of 6.20. Kohli, while starting the series with a century in Perth, has managed only 62 runs in his last three matches. Their inability to anchor the innings has significantly hampered India’s chances.Rishabh Pant’s 'style' in question Pant’s shot selection continues to baffle fans and critics. On Day 3, while batting fluently on 28, he attempted an unnecessary scoop shot off Scott Boland, only to top-edge it straight to Nathan Lyon. His dismissal at a crucial juncture left the team vulnerable and sparked fresh debates about his temperament in high-pressure situations.Bumrah’s Lone Fight Jasprit Bumrah has been India’s standout performer, taking 30 wickets across the four Tests at an incredible average of 12.83. However, his brilliance has been let down by a lack of support from the other bowlers. Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, and Harshit Rana have struggled to make an impact, leaving Bumrah to shoulder an unsustainable workload of 141.2 overs across the four Test in the series so far. 

There have been times in the MCG Test, when Bumrah looked in visible tiredness, and that only highlights the beaming bowling concerns in this Indian Test side.Batting Order Instability One of the most glaring issues for India in the Melbourne Test, and the series overall, was the lack of stability in their batting order. Early in the series, the opening pair of Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul showed promise. The duo stitched together a remarkable 200-plus partnership in Perth, becoming the first Indian opening pair to achieve such a feat in Australia. Their performance gave fans hope for a consistent and reliable opening partnership that could set strong foundations for the rest of the lineup. However, this promising start was disrupted when Rohit Sharma returned to the side. The Indian skipper, who had missed the Perth Test due to paternity leave, chose to resume his role as an opener in Melbourne. While this move was understandable given Rohit’s prior success as an opener, it unsettled the rhythm that Jaiswal and Rahul had developed.Rohit Sharma’s Tactical Missteps Rohit’s captaincy has come under scrutiny for its lack of aggression. Despite Bumrah dismantling Australia’s top order on Day 3, India allowed the tailenders— Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland and Pat Cummins—to mount a strong fightback. While Rohit would normally have been expected to go all out for the final Australia wickets and keep their lead in achievable check, that was not the same. Conservative field placements and defensive bowling changes let Australia build a match-winning lead, which proved too much for India to chase.Beyond the Blame Game While Yashasvi Jaiswal’s missed chances were unfortunate, they were far from the sole reason for India’s defeat. The team’s struggles stem from a combination of inconsistent performances, tactical errors, and an over-reliance on individual brilliance. With the Sydney Test looming as a must-win clash for India to keep their WTC hopes alive, the focus must shift to addressing these broader issues. The team needs collective contributions, sharper tactics, and a more settled lineup to bounce back against a resurgent Australia.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also Read |  AUS vs IND: How can India qualify for WTC final after Boxing Day Test defeat?

Speaking exclusively to India Today, Gavaskar pointed out that the duo's inability to deliver has been a major factor in India's struggles against a dominant Australian side led by Pat Cummins. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD India's hopes of reaching the World Test Championship Final suffered a severe blow after a 184-run defeat in the Melbourne Test. Gavaskar highlighted that India's premier batters have failed to rise to the occasion, especially during critical moments. On Day 5 of the MCG Test, when India needed to bat out 90 overs to secure a draw, Rohit and Kohli fell cheaply, contributing just 9 and 3 runs, respectively. Their dismissals set the tone for India's collapse to 155 in 79.1 overs. ""It actually all depends on the selectors. I'm not a good reader of the crystal ball, because in Indian cricket, nobody can read a crystal ball. That is a fact. But the contributions which were expected have not come. I don't think it's a lower order problem. It's the top order that has to contribute. So, I mean, the seniors have not really made the contribution that they should have and all that they had to do was to bat out today and live to fight another day in Sydney,"" Gavaskar said. Rohit Sharma’s dismal form has been a recurring concern, with only 31 runs from six innings in the ongoing series. Across his last six Tests, he has managed just 123 runs, raising questions about his place in the side. Virat Kohli, on the other hand, has also faced criticism despite showing glimpses of promise earlier. While 2023 saw a partial resurgence in his Test career, 2024 has been far less productive. Kohli has scored only 417 runs at an average below 25 this year. After a century in Perth at the start of the Australian campaign, he managed a mere 62 runs in the next three matches, further fueling speculation about his Test future. As India prepares for the decisive Sydney Test, Gavaskar’s remarks underscore the mounting pressure on Kohli and Rohit to justify their stature and experience. Their form, or lack thereof, will likely be pivotal in determining whether India can salvage the series and keep their WTC hopes alive.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 30, 2024Also Read |  Why Yashasvi Jaiswal's drops are not the only reason for India's MCG Test lossMust Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/football/story/manchester-united-threat-relegation-ruben-amorim-newcastle-loss-2657569-2024-12-31,"Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim admitted that the Premier League club must acknowledge they are in a relegation battle, despite the embarrassment of being in such a situation. The Red Devils suffered a 2-0 defeat to Newcastle at Old Trafford on Monday night, marking their fifth loss in six Premier League matches. This latest disappointing result leaves United 14th in the table, just seven points above the relegation zone. Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher described their recent form as ""relegation form,"" a sentiment Amorim echoed. The coach made this candid admission after watching his side outplayed at home by Newcastle. Amorim has become the first United manager since Louis van Gaal in 2015 to oversee three consecutive Premier League defeats. Although United have remained in the top flight since their promotion to the old First Division in 1975, they now sit precariously just seven points above the relegation zone halfway through the season. Speaking after the game, Ruben Amorim admitted it is ""really clear"" that Manchester United are in a relegation battle. He described the situation as ""a bit embarrassing"" during his post-match press conference but took responsibility for the team's struggles. When asked whether his team is in a relegation fight, Amorim told Sky Sports: ""That is really clear, and we have to fight. This is a really difficult moment-one of the most difficult in the history of Manchester United-and we need to address it with honesty. ""It is also my fault,"" Amorim added. ""The team is not improving. It is a little lost at the moment, and it is embarrassing to be Manchester United's coach and lose so many games. I think people are tired of excuses at this club. This club needs a shock. ""When you're in situations like this, especially at big clubs, it's very hard to turn things around, particularly when there's little time to train on the basics and manage difficult moments. We have to acknowledge our position. In this league, anyone can beat anyone."" Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville shared his post-match thoughts, expressing little optimism but acknowledging that Amorim is at least gaining insight into the players he has inherited. ""United have gone backwards, but hopefully that's backwards to go forwards,"" Neville said. ""There are very slim pickings in terms of positives from these first few weeks. Maybe the most positive thing is that Amorim is seeing these players for what they really are. We're not getting a 'bounce' that might have made him think they are better than they actually are. ""He knew this was a big job, but it's turning out to be a massive one.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/football/story/barcelona-lose-another-appeal-to-register-dani-olmo-before-deadline-2657592-2024-12-31,"Barcelona have lost another appeal to register Spanish forward Dani Olmo for the remainder of the season-just one day before the deadline. The club signed Olmo in August for approximately €55 million ($57.22 million). However, due to their inability to meet La Liga's wage cap, the attacking midfielder was registered only for the first half of the season. Barcelona managed to register Olmo initially by reallocating wages from long-term injured players, which allowed them to fit the 26-year-old, along with forward Pau V­ctor, into their budget. However, the four-month allowance for this arrangement is set to expire at the end of the month. On Friday, Barcelona's request to provisionally register Olmo was denied by the Commercial Court Number 10. The ruling was upheld on Monday by the Court of First Instance Number 47. According to La Liga, the precautionary registration of Olmo was rejected because none of the necessary conditions for such a measure were met. La Liga also emphasized that its Delegate Commission has full authority to approve budgeting rules, which no club, including Barcelona, has previously contested. The league further clarified that the decision not to register Olmo was made initially by its Budget Validation Body and later confirmed by its Financial Fair Play Committee, Social Appeals Committee, and UEFA's Second Instance Licensing Committee of the Spanish Football Federation. Olmo, who played for Barcelona's youth academy before leaving for Dinamo Zagreb at 16, has scored six goals in 15 appearances for the club this season. He was instrumental in helping Spain win the European Championship during the summer. Barcelona now faces a race against time to find an alternative solution to register Olmo before January 1, or he risks becoming a free agent. Reports suggest Premier League clubs are already expressing interest. Spanish media has reported that the club plans to sell VIP boxes at its Camp Nou stadium, potentially generating over €100 million, though this move would require La Liga's approval. Hansi Flick's Barcelona currently sits third in La Liga, three points behind leaders Atlético Madrid.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Tune InRead More |  Manchester United face clear threat of relegation, admits Amorim after another lossMust Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/aus-vs-ind-virat-kohli-test-comparison-fab-four-williamson-smith-root-2657490-2024-12-31,"Virat Kohli is one of the greatest cricketers of his generation without a doubt, if not all-time, and his numbers speak for themselves. Along with Australia’s Steve Smith, New Zealand’s Kane Williamson and England’s Joe Root, he became a part of the fan-made Fab-Four, which gave an account of the potential, skills and supremacy on display by Kohli. Like most players, including Williamson, Smith and Root, Kohli has had his troubles and patches of poor form. In the first 10 to 11 years of his international career, Kohli set astronomical standards for himself with match-winning knocks all across the globe. But in the last five years, Kohli has been far from his best and his best-friend, consistency, has betrayed him multiple times.  AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD In the ongoing Test series against Australia, Kohli is going through a lean patch. Barring the hundred he scored in the second innings of the Perth Test, Kohli searched for runs valiantly without much success. In the six other innings, he mustered only 67 runs at an average of 11.16 with a top score of 36. In three instances, Kohli failed to go past single digits.Long struggle for Kohli  Until 2019, Kohli averaged 54.97 in Tests and was one of the few batters to have an average of 50 across all three formats. But in the last five years, the average has dropped to 47.21; a drop of 14.62 per cent. In 38 Tests since January 2020, Kohli has scored 2005 runs at an average of 31.32 with three centuries and nine fifties, but the big scores he is known for have eluded him big time. Comparatively, Root and Williamson have dominated the run charts. Root has 5613 runs from 63 Tests at an average of 54.49 with 19 hundreds and 20 fifties. In fact, the English batter in right on top of the run-charts in this period. He also got double hundreds against Pakistan (262 in Multan, 2024), Sri Lanka (228 in Galle, 2021) and India (218 in Chennai, 2021). Williamson, who has had his fair share of concerns with injuries, also hit 12 centuries to manage 2897 runs from 27 Tests. He also chipped in with four double tons, while Smith also has a top score of 200 not out against the West Indies in 2022. Runs scored by Fab 4 in Tests since January 2020
 


Kohli not contributing enough Until 2019, Virat Kohli averaged a stunning 60.50 in wins for India, scoring 3872 runs from 44 Tests with 13 centuries. In the last five years, he has an average of a mere 31.21 in wins; a significant drop of 48.41 per cent. He has scored only one century during this period; 100 not out against Australia in Perth. In comparison, Joe Root has contributed significantly to England’s wins, scoring 3286 runs from 32 matches at an average of 67.06 with 12 centuries and 12 fifties. Although England failed to qualify for the final of all three editions of the World Test Championship, Root was at the forefront of every English heist in the purest format. When it comes to contributing to wins, Williamson has been a class apart from the rest. He scored 1937 runs in 27 Tests at an average of 101.94 with 10 hundreds and two fifties. Smith isn’t far behind either, with 1453 runs from 24 games with four centuries and a top score of 200. Runs scored by Fab 4 in Tests since January 2020 in wins 
 


Kohli not good enough abroad  Virat Kohli has struggled abroad as well in the last five years. In 45 overseas Tests until 2019, Kohli made 3644 runs at an average of 46.12 with 14 hundreds. In the last five years, he has averaged 32.28, a drop of 30 per cent. His top score of 121 came against the West Indies back in July 2023 at the Port of Spain. Root is on top of yet another list with 2979 runs from 33 Tests since January 2020 at an average of 49.65. That he has nine centuries overseas shows that Root has done well across the world apart from scoring runs in heaps on home soil. Smith has been reasonable with 1101 runs from 17 Tests at an average of 40.77. Williamson, on the other hand, has made 807 runs from the 11 overseas Tests since January 2020 with a top score of 200 not out against Pakistan back in December 2022 in Multan. Runs scored by Fab 4 in overseas Tests since January 2020 
 


Falling to old habits  Virat Kohli is known for his glorious and ambitious cover drives, shots that have fetched him plenty of runs across all three formats. But the same shot has led to his demise, especially in conditions favourable for fast bowling. On the Australian tour, the 36-year-old Kohli was found wanting again while playing balls outside the off-stump. In the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which India lost by 194 runs, Kohli was dismissed, poking tentatively outside the off-stump both times. Over the years, Kohli hasn’t quite found a way to curb his tendency to play balls outside the off-stump. Smith, on the other hand, made technical adjustments to his game, controlling his tendency to shuffle on the off-side. The results showed immediately after he made a hundred in Brisbane and backed it up with another dominating hundred in Melbourne. With 81 hundreds to his name in international cricket, Kohli has set a rich legacy for the upcoming generations to follow. Kohli would add another cherry to his hat if he ekes out a method to control his urges to go after balls outside the off-stump and set an example for budding cricketers.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Tune InAlso Read |  IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma slammed for blaming Pant, youngsters after MCG defeatMust Watch

Marsh has endured a dismal run in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar series, averaging just 10.42 with the bat and managing only one double-digit score across seven innings.  This marks the second-lowest batting average by an Australian in a home Test series (minimum seven innings), behind only Kim Hughes' 10.12 during the 1984-85 season. Marsh's contribution with the ball has also been minimal, apart from a couple of early wickets in Perth. Speculation about Marsh's fitness has circulated, but McDonald dismissed concerns of an injury, attributing Marsh's limited bowling involvement to tactical decisions. ""We haven't required him with the ball as often as what we would have thought. He bowled again today. His speeds are up in the high 120s. There are no injury concerns there,"" McDonald said during a media interaction on Monday. ""I think to sort of head that down that angle is a little bit unfair. We just haven't required him at certain times for whatever reason, so that's more a tactical implementation, as opposed to a body. ""I think the amount of overs that we've been bowling across the series is probably going to be a benefit to us."" Marsh's inclusion in the Test team came as a replacement for Cameron Green, who missed the series due to back issues. However, with Green unavailable, Marsh's poor form has led to growing arguments for his exclusion, especially as Australia seeks to maintain their 2-1 series lead. Complicating the selection dilemma is the potential unavailability of paceman Mitchell Starc, who may miss the Sydney Test due to injury. This could deter selectors from making multiple changes to a team fresh off a victory in Melbourne. McDonald acknowledged Marsh's struggles but noted his positive attitude within the camp. ""Would he like better performances? Of course,"" McDonald said. ""But he's in a good headspace after the win in Melbourne."" Should Marsh be dropped, all-rounder Beau Webster is on standby for a potential Test debut. Captain Pat Cummins is expected to confirm the final XI either on Thursday or at the toss on Friday. The SCG Test, beginning Friday, will determine whether Marsh retains his place or if Australia opts for a reshuffle in their quest to secure the series.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Read More |  Cannot read the crystal ball: Gavaskar on Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli's Test future

However, Raducanu has decided to travel to Melbourne to continue her preparations for the Australian Open, which begins on January 12. Raducanu, a Grand Slam champion and sixth seed at the Auckland warm-up event, expressed her disappointment in a statement: ""I’ve tried my best to be ready. I love Auckland and the fans here, but unfortunately, I’ve picked up a back niggle and won’t be ready in time.""

The 22-year-old managed to play only three matches after the Seoul injury in September, all of which she won while representing Great Britain at the Billie Jean King Cup Finals. Despite this success, she heads into the Australian Open without any recent match practice. Last season, Raducanu encountered fewer injury issues but played only 10 matches after Wimbledon and missed the Miami Open in March due to another back problem. To address her fitness challenges, Raducanu has enlisted the help of renowned trainer Yutaka Nakamura, who has been working with her in Auckland. ""I just needed a more tailored approach and someone dedicated solely to me as an individual,"" Raducanu said earlier this month. ""It’s already bringing a positive change.

The incident took place during the final session of Day 5 of the Boxing Day Test when Head dismissed Pant, who had scored a brisk 30. Head's peculiar celebration—pointing one finger into a circularly shaped hand—left fans and commentators puzzled. Although Channel 7's James Brayshaw and Pat Cummins later clarified that the gesture symbolised ""putting his finger on ice"". ""Travis head’s obnoxious behaviour during the course of the Melbourne test doesn’t auger well for the gentleman’s game...... sets the worst possible example when there are kids, women, young & old watching the game....... this caustic conduct did not insult an individual but a nation of 1.5 billion Indians......stringent punishment that would serve a deterrent for the future generations needs to be slapped on him so that no one dares follow suit !!!""

— Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp) December 30, 2024 Channel 7's James Brayshaw offered some clarity. ""Now, great people in the back have said after he took 4-10 within 17 balls in Sri Lanka in 2022 he was quoted as saying, 'I had to put the digit on ice',"" Brayshaw said. ""So that was the celebration. He said 'I just got him, and I'm putting it back on ice'."" Australia captain Pat Cummins provided an explanation for Head's celebration. ""I can explain that. His finger is so hot, that he is going to put it in a cup of ice. Yes, that’s what it is. That’s normally the running joke. Was it at the Gabba or somewhere, where he got a wicket as well and just got straight to the fridge, grabs a bucket of ice, puts his finger in and just walks in front of Lyno (Nathan Lyon). Just like that, I think it's very funny. So that’s what it would have been, nothing else,"" Cummins told reporters after Australia won the match by 184 runs to go 2-1 up with one match left in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Despite Head's struggles with the bat—registering scores of 0 and 1 in the match—he made a decisive impact with the ball. His timely breakthrough dismissed Pant, triggering a collapse in the Indian batting lineup. India lost their last six wickets for just 34 runs, succumbing to 155 in their chase of 340.

With a smile on his face, faith in his heart and immaculate trust in his approach, Cummins has again shown why he is currently regarded as one of the best captains in international cricket. Cummins very well knows how to lead from the front and is skilled enough to bring forth his A-game when the chips are down. Last year, under Cummins, Australia defeated India in two world finals: the World Test Championship, followed by the ODI World Cup in front of a packed house at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. On Monday, Cummins gave India another major jolt, pushing Rohit Sharma’s men on the brink of not qualifying for the WTC final to be held next year. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Cummins stood tall as Australia beat India by 184 runs in the Boxing Day Test. Sam Konstas, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jasprit Bumrah hogged the headlines, but it was Cummins won the Player of the Match award. Cummins went about his business as elegantly as he always had. Cummins put his hands up in crisis and inspired Australia to a crucial 2-1 lead after initially going 0-1 down.Pat Cummins sets the tone  With the series hanging in the balance after the drawn Gabba Test, the onus was on Cummins to put Australia back on top, and he did not let his team down. In the first innings at the MCG after the Aussies lost six wickets, Cummins joined hands with the stylish Steve Smith to build a priceless 112-run stand, also taking his team past the 400-run mark.

— Cricket Australia (@CricketAus) December 30, 2024 Cummins made 49 off 63 and was unlucky to not reach his fifty, but gave Australia the much-needed kick in their first innings. With the ball, Cummins gave the hosts the first breakthrough after dismissing Rohit Sharma, who might be terribly out of form, but is more than capable of taking quality bowling attacks to the cleaners. Cummins also cleaned up KL Rahul, after which he got rid of Bumrah to finish with figures of 29-6-89-3. On the back of his all-round showing, Australia took a big lead of 105 runs in the first innings.Cummins thrives under pressure In their second innings, despite taking a huge lead, Australia found themselves in a rabbit hole at 91 for six. Cummins wasn’t someone to give up the ghost and he didn’t. Batting at No.8, he made 41 off 90 before Ravindra Jadeja dismissed him for the second time in the game. With his knock, Cummins set the layout for the likes of Scott Boland and Nathan Lyon to follow. Lyon and Boland eventually put on 61 runs for the 10th wicket, taking the match away from India’s grasp. Cummins took his game a notch up after cleaning up India’s top 3 in the second innings, dismissing Jaiswal, Rohit and Rahul. With figures of 18-5-28-3, Cummins helped the Aussies bowl India out for 155 in their second innings. With a Test to be played in Sydney from January 3, Cummins will be eager to bring back the Border Gavaskar Trophy to Australia, which has been in India since 2017.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also Read |  4th Test: Australia break India's resistance to win MCG thriller, end 13-year streakMust Watch

However, McDonald acknowledged that Starc was managing a niggle and that a decision would be made closer to the New Year’s Test, which begins on 3 January. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Mitchell Starc dealt with an upper-body concern throughout the five-day Melbourne Test match. The issue first became apparent on Day 3 when Starc was seen clutching his back during spells and left the field at the close of play. Despite the discomfort, Starc pushed through the niggle, bowling at full pace on the final day to help Australia defend a target of 330 and secure victory in the Boxing Day Test. Starc consistently bowled at speeds of around 140 km/h and claimed the crucial wicket of Virat Kohli before lunch on Day 5. He managed to bowl 16 overs in the final innings of a closely contested Test that swung back and forth until India lost seven wickets in the last session, conceding the series lead to the hosts. “Clearly, Starc is carrying something of some description. We’ll assess that. But other than that, it looks as though we got through pretty well unscathed. However, it’s a short turnaround, and recovery is important. We’ll assess what the team looks like in Sydney based on the surface, as we always do,” McDonald said on 31 December. “Any time you get through the game, it’s always a good indicator that you’re a chance for the next one. It didn’t stop him,” he added. “There was clearly a bit of discomfort early in his spells, but once he warmed up, he seemed relatively free. His ball speeds were good. “I think the morning session, when we bowled over 20 overs, was probably as good as we’ve delivered.” Australia added Sean Abbott and Jhye Richardson to their Test squad as back-ups before the fourth match in Sydney. Both are expected to be available for the final Test despite their Big Bash League commitments. Australia will aim to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2014. They need nothing less than a win in Sydney to reclaim the trophy. If the series ends in a draw, India will retain the trophy and head home as holders.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Trending Reel

However, Warner also questioned why it took a 19-year-old to show the initiative that senior players failed to display.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-sam-konstas-david-warner-jasprit-bumrah-brave-batting-2657624-2024-12-31,"Former Australian opener David Warner has praised Sam Konstas's fearless approach against Jasprit Bumrah, crediting the 19-year-old for setting the tone during Australia's pivotal Boxing Day Test win that gave them a 2-1 series lead with one match remaining. However, Warner expressed concern over why it took such a young and inexperienced player to set the standard for Australia’s top order, questioning the lack of initiative from more seasoned players in the lineup. ""It was very special,"" Warner said about Konstas's knock. ""People are going to criticise him as well. That's the nature of the beast, that's the way he is going to play. When someone like Bumrah is bowling to you, you have to try and execute somehow. What he did in the Prime Minister's XI shows he has that talent. But it also shows he is brave."""" Konstas's aggressive innings included 34 runs off Bumrah in the opening session, the most any batter has scored against the Indian pacer in one spell. His fearless ramp shots and decisive footwork unsettled Bumrah, creating opportunities for the rest of the batting lineup. Usman Khawaja capitalised with his first half-century of the series, while Marnus Labuschagne credited Konstas for influencing his approach. Bumrah, however, had the last laugh, dismissing Konstas in the second innings with a delivery that jagged back sharply. Bumrah's nine wickets in the match underlined his status as India's key threat, with the pacer now holding 200 Test wickets at an astonishing average below 20. While Warner lauded Konstas's courage, he criticised the lack of initiative from more seasoned players. ""(Sam was) being brave at the top of the order, but you've got guys who have played 50 Tests, they could have been brave as well,"" Warner said. ""They could have played different shots, they could have moved out of their crease and batted different. (Smith) Smudge tried a million different things. But it shouldn't take someone to come out there and be brave to get that momentum shifting. ""You have experience at the top of the order, experience in that whole line-up. Travis Head took the game away from them in Adelaide with that magnificent hundred. It shouldn't take that guy just to come and do that. It's the way the Australians played, but other people can be braver as well."" Warner highlighted Travis Head's counterattacking century in Adelaide as an example of the impact aggressive intent can have against a world-class bowler. Despite Konstas's heroics, Bumrah remains the series' most dangerous bowler. His ability to swing the ball both ways with pinpoint accuracy has troubled Australia's top order throughout the series. Bumrah has already removed Khawaja five times, and his haul in Melbourne keeps him on track to equal Shane Warne's record of 40 wickets in a single series this century. With the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on the line in Sydney, Australia lead the series 2-1.

The fast bowler was nominated for the highest honour in the annual awards — the Sir Garfield Sobers Award for the Men’s Cricketer of the Year. He was also included in the four-man shortlist for the ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year award 2024. England batters Harry Brook and Joe Root will compete with Jasprit Bumrah in both categories. Former India off-spinner R Ashwin echoed the sentiments of many cricket fans, expressing his belief that Bumrah is the frontrunner to claim the Test honour. If Bumrah wins the Sir Garfield Sobers Award, he will become the fifth Indian to do so, following Rahul Dravid (2004), Sachin Tendulkar (2010), Virat Kohli (2017 and 2018), and R Ashwin (2016).

Bumrah picked 15 wickets at an average of 8.24 in the T20 World Cup, which India won under Rohit Sharma's captaincy.  In Test cricket, Bumrah has had a career-defining year. The Indian fast bowler picked 71 wickets in 13 Tests, finishing with more scalps than any of his counterparts. Bumrah has been the standout bowler in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series between Australia and India taking 30 wickets in four matches, 10 more than the nearest rival and opposition captain Pat Cummins.

Gavaskar also noted that Nitish's batting displays greater refinement compared to Hardik Pandya's during the early days of his international career. At just 21 years old, Nitish is building a solid reputation in the Border Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. He has consistently emerged as India's go-to player in challenging situations, showcasing his composure under pressure. Nitish stood out with his maiden century in the first innings of the recently concluded Melbourne Test, despite India's 184-run defeat. Batting at No. 8 in the first innings of the Melbourne Test, Nitish scored an impressive 114 runs, helping India reduce the deficit. Adding to the significance of the moment, his father was present at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, making the achievement even more special. ""The Melbourne Test brought to the fore one of the brightest young stars in Indian cricket, Nitish Kumar Reddy. He came to the attention of the Indian cricket fans with his performances for the Hyderabad franchise in the IPL, and while he had not done much at the first-class level, it's a credit to Ajit Agarkar and his fellow selectors to have seen enough to pitchfork him into the Test arena,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar. Nitish had already turned heads with valuable 40-run contributions in Perth and Adelaide, but it was his stunning century in Melbourne—against the likes of Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc, and Scott Boland—that truly put him in the global spotlight. Nitish has shown immense promise with the bat, but his bowling remains a work in progress. Enhancing his effectiveness with the ball could be the key to becoming a genuine match-winning all-rounder for India. ""In his debut Test match in Perth itself, it became evident that here was a cricketer who could read situations and play accordingly. With every subsequent Test match, that impression of a good 'cricketing head' on his shoulders began to get stronger and stronger,"" he added. In the four Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Nitish Kumar Reddy has amassed 294 runs and claimed three wickets, showcasing his potential as a budding star in Indian cricket. ""And in Melbourne, when India were looking down the barrel, he came through the fire with an outstanding century that has cemented his place in the team for a long time to come. Ever since the unavailability of Hardik Pandya for Test cricket, India has been looking for an all-rounder who can bowl medium pace and bat as well.

Reflecting on India's team changes during their defeat to Australia in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Chopra provided a strong critique of Rohit's decision to return to the top of the batting order in Melbourne. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Rohit Sharma moved himself down to the middle order during the Adelaide and Brisbane Tests to allow KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal to continue their opening partnership. Rohit had missed the first Test of the series in Perth, where Rahul and Jaiswal stitched a match-winning partnership of 201 runs in the third innings. However, Rohit struggled at No. 6, enduring multiple failures over the two Tests.   In Melbourne, Rohit returned to the top of the order, and India left out Shubman Gill from the XI—a decision that surprised many pundits and fans. India opted for three all-rounders in their XI but were unable to save the Test match. They collapsed to 155 all out in the final innings of the fourth Test, failing to survive the last day.  Rohit flopped again, managing 3 and 9 across the two innings of the Test match.  ""For the first time in his career, he has taken a call for himself. In the past, calls have been taken for him. MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli took calls for him to move him from middle-order to opener. Dhoni did in ODIs, Virat did in Tests because they wanted Rohit to fire,"" Aakash Chopra said on his YouTube show.   ""For the first time, captain Rohit took a call and it was totally in his interests. It was not in the team's interests. Let's be very honest. It can't be in the team's interests because Rahul was opening very well. Shubman Gill did well in 2023, he is the second-highest run-scorer. He has played in tough situations also. He was looking good in Adelaide too. But, he had to be dropped from the team.   ""All this is because Rohit thought about himself, not in the best interests of the team. For the first time in his captaincy career. It didn't turn out fine. India were not able to draw,"" he added.   NO ROHIT SHARMA IN SYDNEY TEST? The former India opener suggested that Rohit Sharma should drop himself from the Sydney Test to allow Shubman Gill to regain his place at No. 3. Chopra emphasised that while retirement is a personal decision, selectors have the authority to drop a player, even the captain, due to poor form.   ""In the team's interest, will he sit out of the Sydney Test? I am not saying retirement, but dropping himself for the Sydney Test, saying 'I am not able to contribute. Okay, let Rahul open the batting, let Shubman Gill bat at No. 3 and let's play Nitish at No. 6'. It will be a fair call to take. But, will he take it? If he doesn't take it, I will tell you why cricketers don't take such calls. Every cricketer believes, the entire life must have taught him/her one thing: we can bounce back. We can turn it around. Maybe Rohit Sharma is thinking like that,"" he added.   ""Will the selectors take that call mid-tour? Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar, guys, you are on the spot this time,"" he added.   Rohit Sharma began 2024 with a productive series against England at home. He then played a key role with the bat in India's T20 World Cup triumph. However, his form has deserted him in the Test season. The captain has become a walking wicket, managing just 164 runs in eight Tests at an average of 10.

The speedster got the series off to a terrific start as his 8/72 helped India win the first Test by a massive 295-run margin in Perth and was deservedly awarded Player of the Match. However, since then, all his efforts have gone in vain due to lack of support from other bowlers and Indian batters as India find themselves 1-2 behind in the five-match series with one match to go.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also Read |  Jasprit Bumrah dominates nominations for ICC Awards 2024: Full list

On the other hand, Kohli has scored 417 runs from 10 matches (19 innings) at an average of 24.52 with one hundred and as many fifties to his name. Following their continuous poor show with the bat, there has been widespread clamour amongst fans and pundits, asking for their retirement from the format.

However, he also mentioned that Indian cricket has enough depth to replace them. ""Look whenever they decide to give it away and whatever happens in next few days they have been great players for India over a long period of time.

Whenever these two guys decide to retire, there are so many talented youngsters that Indian cricket will be in good stead,” Lehmann told PTI.Final chance for Rohit and Kohli in Sydney?

The match, played on December 31 at Old Trafford, ended in yet another disappointing 2-0 defeat for United, plunging the club further into a relegation battle. United fell behind early, conceding two quick goals to Newcastle’s Alexander Isak and Joelinton in the 4th and 19th minutes, respectively. Seeking to regain control, Amorim replaced Zirkzee with Kobbie Mainoo before halftime. While the substitution sparked debate amongst fans and pundits, Amorim defended his decision in the post-match press conference.  ""You have to think about the team. The player is suffering during the game. We needed another midfielder. It was tough on me to do that, I talked with Joshua on that. I’m always thinking about the team. At that moment it was important for him to come out,"" Amorim said. ""I know that Josh is a really good guy. When he went to the tunnel, I can understand that some guys can be in a bad way but he is a really good lad. It is life, and we will support Josh and continue. Newcastle were better than Manchester United, they weren't better than Josh,"" he added. Despite the change, United failed to turn the tide, registering their third consecutive Premier League loss under Amorim. This marks a troubling milestone for the Portuguese manager, as he becomes the first United boss since Louis van Gaal in 2015 to endure such a streak. The defeat leaves United 14th in the league table, a mere seven points clear of the relegation zone. United’s struggles are compounded by their historical stature. Having remained a top-flight team since their promotion to the old First Division in 1975, the idea of relegation seems unthinkable to fans. Yet, with half the season gone, they face mounting pressure to turn things around quickly. Amorim now faces a crucial period to rebuild confidence and avoid further decline. Whether tactical adjustments like Zirkzee’s substitution will yield long-term results remains to be seen, but United’s supporters will be demanding a swift reversal of fortunes.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also Read |  Barcelona lose another appeal to register Dani Olmo before deadline

At the age of 43, Dhoni is set to play in his 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/ms-dhoni-pr-good-cricket-social-media-era-2657814-2024-12-31,"MS Dhoni, the iconic former captain of the Indian cricket team, opened up about his views on social media and public relations. Despite being one of the most recognisable sports figures in the world, Dhoni has consistently stayed away from the limelight when it comes to online platforms. He shared how his managers often pushed him to embrace social media for promotional purposes, but Dhoni remained steadfast in his belief that his cricketing performance should speak for itself. Having made his debut in 2004, Dhoni witnessed the rise of platforms like Twitter and Instagram, but he always believed that if he played well, there was no need for additional PR efforts. His approach stands as a testament to his values of simplicity and focus, showing that for him, the game itself takes precedence over online fame. Dhoni’s words resonate with fans who admire his grounded personality. “I have never been a big fan of social media. Throughout, I have had so many managers and all of them keep pushing. I started playing in 2004; Twitter got popular later on, after which Instagram came in. All the managers told me, ‘you should do some PR, build this and build that’. I had the same answer that if you play good cricket, you don’t need PR,” Dhoni said on Eurogrip Tred Talks.MS Dhoni’s glorious career  Dhoni got out for a duck on his debut for India in an ODI against Bangladesh, but from there on, he kept growing in stature. In 2007, Dhoni led the national team to glory in the inaugural edition of the Men’s T20 World Cup, after which India won the ODI World Cup in 2011. Then in 2013, India won the Champions Trophy under Dhoni’s leadership. In 2014, Dhoni retired from Test cricket following the Melbourne Test.

The star pacer, who has been nominated for the ICC Cricketer of the Year award for 2024, will be given a breather ahead of the much-anticipated Champions Trophy, India Today has learnt. India will host England in a five-match T20I series and a three-match ODI series from 22 January to 12 February. The ODI series concludes just seven days before the start of the Champions Trophy. Meanwhile, a decision regarding the availability of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will be taken during the selection meeting. Sources suggest both players are keen to play in the three ODIs to gain momentum ahead of the Champions Trophy. Jasprit Bumrah has been leading India’s pace attack in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series in Australia. The fast bowler has shouldered the responsibility of an inexperienced pace line-up in the absence of Mohammed Shami, who was ruled out of the series due to injury concerns. Bumrah bowled 53.2 overs - the most in a single Test in his career - during India’s 184-run defeat in Melbourne. Over four Tests, he has bowled 141.2 overs, the highest workload for any bowler from either side in the series so far. Bumrah is expected to play a crucial role in India’s fortunes during the New Year’s Test in Sydney, likely shouldering the majority of the bowling workload in the series finale. By the end of the Sydney Test, Bumrah would have played 10 Tests within a span of four months. India captain Rohit Sharma, speaking to the press after the team’s defeat in Melbourne, acknowledged the risks of overbowling Bumrah, especially given his extensive workload during the series. ""There is to be honest (risk of overbowling Bumrah). He has bowled a lot of overs there's no doubt about it. But again, every Test match we play, we keep that in mind, the workloads of all the bowlers in fact. But again, if somebody is in such great form, you want to try and maximise that form how-much-ever you can and that is what we've been trying to do with Bumrah,"" Rohit said. ""There comes a time when you need to step back a little bit and give him that little bit of extra breather as well. So we've been very careful. I've been very careful. I talked to him about how he feels and stuff like that.

Djokovic’s light-hearted comments came after a commanding 6-3, 6-3 victory against an Australian opponent in the ATP 250 event.

As the Australian Open approaches, all eyes will be on Djokovic and his new coaching dynamic with Murray.

The right-handed batter played a blistering knock of 181 (117) with the help of 15 fours and 11 sixes on Tuesday, December 31 at Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad. Mhatre (17y 168d) became the youngest player in the world to surpass the 150-run mark in List A cricket surpassing Yashasvi Jaiswal’s record of 17 years and 291 days when he achieved the feat against Jharkhand in 2019.

His departure, by mutual agreement, follows a challenging stint marked by poor results and growing pressure. Rooney joined Plymouth Argyle in May 2024 on a three-year contract, succeeding Ian Foster. Hopes were high for the former England star to bring a fresh perspective, but the team’s fortunes quickly nosedived under his leadership. Argyle currently sits at the bottom of the Championship table with 18 points from 23 matches, four points adrift of safety. The team has also failed to secure an away win all season, further compounding their struggles.

 Club Statement | Argyle and Rooney mutually part ways.https://t.co/0KM0pdIRO7#pafc
— Plymouth Argyle FC (@Argyle) December 31, 2024 The tipping point came after a 2-0 loss to fellow relegation contenders Oxford United on Sunday. This result extended a dismal run that included heavy defeats against Coventry City, managed by Frank Lampard, as well as Bristol City and Norwich City. Rooney’s challenges at Plymouth followed an equally tough spell at Birmingham City, where he was dismissed in early 2024 after just four months in charge. During that time, Birmingham managed only two wins in 15 games, casting doubts over Rooney’s managerial capabilities in the competitive Championship. In the wake of Rooney’s departure, Kevin Nancekivell, a club stalwart, will step in as caretaker manager for Plymouth’s upcoming match against Bristol City on New Year’s Day. Rooney’s coaching staff, including assistant manager Mike Phelan and coach Simon Ireland, have also exited the club. While Rooney’s managerial career has shown flashes of promise, his back-to-back struggles at Birmingham City and Plymouth Argyle suggest a steep learning curve as he navigates his post-playing days. As Plymouth grapples with their relegation battle, the focus now shifts to finding a long-term solution to revive their season and secure Championship survival. Rooney’s next steps in management remain uncertain, but his recent experiences underline the challenges of transitioning from a legendary playing career to a successful tenure in the dugout.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also Read |  Ruben Amorim explains decision to sub off Zirkzee after 33 minutes vs Newcastle

Ashwin and Overton will play for Chennai Super Kings in IPl 2025. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/big-bash-league-jamie-overton-finn-allen-run-out-warning-r-ashwin-reacts-2657897-2024-12-31,"Former India off-spinner R Ashwin reacted to Jamie Overton's attempt to run out a batter at the non-striker's end during a Big Bash League match on New Year's Eve at the Adelaide Oval. Ashwin appeared to support Overton, who was alert to opposition batter Finn Allen's habit of leaving the non-striker's crease before the delivery stride was completed. In the 8th over of Perth Scorchers' chase against Adelaide Strikers, Jamie Overton broke the stumps at the non-striker's end as Finn Allen stepped out of his crease. However, the England fast bowler chose not to appeal and instead informed the umpire that he was issuing a warning to the New Zealand big-hitter. Running a batter out at the non-striker's end for backing up too far has historically been viewed as unsporting. However, the cricketing community and governing bodies increasingly recognise it as fair play within the rules. In October 2022, the International Cricket Council officially reclassified this mode of dismissal under the category of ""Run Out"" to remove any associated stigma.

— Ashwin ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ (@ashwinravi99) December 31, 2024 The mode of dismissal became a major talking point during the 2019 IPL season when R Ashwin, then captain of Punjab Kings, ran out Rajasthan Royals' Jos Buttler at the non-striker's end. This incident reignited debates about the spirit of cricket, but Ashwin stood firm amidst the criticism, reiterating that the dismissal was within the laws of the game. Since then, Ashwin has been a vocal advocate of this mode of dismissal. Interestingly, Jamie Overton is set to play alongside Ashwin for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL 2025 season. During the match, Overton and Finn Allen were involved in an on-field exchange prior to the England fast bowler breaking the stumps in the 8th over of the Scorchers' chase. Overton had been hit for 18 runs in his first over, and tensions appeared to rise as the two exchanged words in the previous over. Allen's blistering 23-ball fifty set the stage for a dominant win for the Strikers in their high-stakes home fixture. Cooper Connolly contributed with 48 off 35 deliveries, while captain Ashton Turner closed out the chase with a quickfire 35 off 18 balls. The Perth Scorchers comfortably chased down a target of 143 in just 14.3 overs, ringing in the New Year in style. Earlier in the day, pacers Jhye Richardson, Jason Behrendorff, and Lance Morris shared seven wickets between them, helping Perth restrict Adelaide to 142 for 8 in their 20 overs. With this New Year's Eve victory, the Perth Scorchers moved to second place on the 8-team points table, with 6 points from 5 matches. The Sydney Sixers lead the BBL 2024-25 standings, having won all four of their games so far. Meanwhile, the Adelaide Strikers remain in 7th place with just one win from five matches.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Dec 31, 2024

Agent reveals stanceAnsu Fati's agent Jorge Mendes revealed Barcelona might loan the 22-year-old in January, balancing crucial game time and his commitment to fight for a spot under Hansi Flick amidst struggles with form and recurring injury setbacks.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/football/story/fc-barcelona-ansu-fati-january-window-loan-agent-jorge-mendes-reveals-stance-2657960-2024-12-31,"Ansu Fati’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has hinted that FC Barcelona might consider loaning out the young forward in the January transfer window to provide him with crucial game time. Mendes explained that while a loan move could help the 22-year-old regain his rhythm, Fati remains committed to fighting for his place at Barcelona. Fati’s career trajectory has been a mix of promise and setbacks. Once regarded as Barcelona’s next superstar, he inherited the legendary number 10 jersey following Lionel Messi's departure to Paris Saint-Germain. However, recurring injuries and inconsistent performances dimmed his rising star. Struggles with form and fitness under coaches Ronald Koeman and Xavi saw Fati slip out of favour. ""Two years ago, Ansu Fati was at the peak of his brilliance. He had bad luck due to injuries, but I am sure he will overcome all these difficulties. He will return to his level. He will continue to win the hearts of Barcelona fans,"" Amorim told MD. ""Question for Barça but he has the level to play for them...He needs is confidence and to resolve his physical issues. Once he’s at 100%, Barça will need him. He’s a unique player,"" he added. Seeking regular minutes, Fati joined Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion on loan. While initially seen as an opportunity for resurgence, injury woes resurfaced, limiting his appearances and pushing him down the pecking order. Now back at Barcelona and working under new German manager Hansi Flick, Fati has been given another opportunity to prove his worth. Flick has expressed confidence in Fati’s potential, which led the club to retain him in the squad during the summer transfer window rather than sending him out on another loan. Mendes echoed this sentiment, noting that the forward is determined to overcome his injury troubles and return to his best form. As Barcelona navigates a challenging season, the decision regarding Fati’s immediate future looms large. While the club values his talent and sees him as a long-term asset, consistent game time remains a pressing concern for his development. A January loan could provide the platform for Fati to rebuild his career, yet staying at Barcelona under Flick's guidance may also help him regain the confidence and form that once made him La Masia’s brightest prospect. For now, the young forward’s journey remains one of perseverance, with hopes that his talent will shine once again.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Also Read |  Ruben Amorim explains decision to sub off Zirkzee after 33 minutes vs Newcastle

For the first time in over a decade, the team faces a transition phase, with questions looming over the futures of senior players.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/virat-kohli-rohit-sharma-team-indias-transition-period-indian-cricket-in-2025-2657955-2025-01-01,"After ending 2024 on a not-so-memorable note, the Indian men’s cricket team will look to get 2025 off to a positive start as they take on Australia in the fifth and final Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25. The year 2025 will be full of several important tournaments for India, with the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 scheduled to be held in February, followed by the World Test Championship (WTC) final and the all-important away Test series in England. The year will also give further clarity on the red-ball future of star batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who’ve been struggling for form in recent times. With India trailing by 1-2 in the ongoing series against Australia, there have been widespread discussions on what future holds for the duo. It remains to be seen whether the duo will be allowed to continue ahead even after India ends up losing the series and doesn’t make it to the WTC final. While former India head coach Ravi Shastri feels Kohli still has a lot to give in Test cricket to India, the India skipper hasn’t got the same backing with Jasprit Bumrah ready to take over the reins from him. Hence, the year 2025 could well see the end of the road for at least one of them in the longest format. However, there will be some long discussions before arriving at a decision with a crucial five-match Test tour to England scheduled in August as India won’t be willing to risk taking a completely inexperienced batting lineup in the series.Champions Trophy 2025 to decide the ODI Roadmap

 After Test cricket, the focus will shift on the all-important Champions Trophy as India will be hungry for an ODI crown after falling short of winning the World Cup on home soil in 2023. The onus will be once again on the batting stalwarts Kohli and Rohit as India enter yet another ICC event as favourites. Since the ODI World Cup 2023, the duo has played just one ODI series against Sri Lanka in August 2024. While Rohit looked at his usual best, scoring 157 runs from three innings at an average of 52.33 and a strike rate of 141.44 with two fifties, Kohli looked far from his best accumulating just 58 runs from three innings. Hence, questions could be raised on their form if India don't win the Champions Trophy. As far as ODIs are concerned, both players might be willing to push until the World Cup 2027 in South Africa and give themselves another chance at winning the coveted prize. However, a lot will depend on their form and the faith of the team management in their abilities. The Gautam Gambhir-era has already seen an unceremonious ending of a legendary cricketing career in Ravichandran Ashwin. It could well be an indication that we could be on for several more silent goodbyes if the team’s performance continues to go downhill.T20I side on track to defend their crown in 2026 As far as the T20Is are concerned, the team has already been in a transition mode, something that started after T20 World Cup 2024 when Kohli and Rohit retired from the format. Players like Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, Abhishek Sharma, and Arshdeep Singh have already proven their mettle in the format and are taking forward the all-out attack philosophy of the management.   Under the leadership of Suryakumar Yadav, the young brigade will continue to prepare for a title defence on home soil in 2026. Hence, 2025 could well prove to be another action-packed year for Indian men’s cricket and fans will hope for the addition of another ICC Trophy to their cabinet. The year could also see the end of the road for some of the veterans, but the betterment of Indian cricket will remain paramount for both the management and the fans.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  No more Fab 4: Struggling Virat Kohli fails to keep up with ever-evolving peers

As India fight to salvage the series in Sydney, Rohit's choices could define both the team's fate and his legacy.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-rohit-sharma-new-year-test-sydney-big-call-drop-2657957-2025-01-01,"The knives are out for Rohit Sharma. A doyen of white-ball cricket, the India captain is under immense pressure following repeated failures in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. With just 31 runs in three Tests, his place in the side is being questioned with unprecedented ferocity. India have surrendered an unassailable lead to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, despite taking a 1-0 lead in the much-anticipated five-match series. For the first time in 13 years, India lost a Boxing Day Test in Australia. Moreover, they are on the verge of losing a Test series to Australia for the first time in a decade. All this has unfolded under Rohit's leadership, coinciding with his struggles at the crease. Despite the setbacks, India can still salvage the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a draw in the New Year's Test in Sydney. While 2024 ended on a sour note, there remains hope for the year ahead. Much hinges on Rohit Sharma's decisions. While he seems unlikely to retire from Test cricket, it is crucial the right calls (read as bold) regarding the team combination for the Sydney Test, starting 3 January. The newly-formed captain-coach duo of Rohit Sharma and Gautam Gambhir has taken pride in prioritising the team's interests, even when it requires making difficult decisions.'IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE TEAM' When Shubman Gill was left out of the XI during India’s 184-run defeat in Melbourne, both Rohit and the coaching staff clarified it was not a case of being ‘dropped’ but a decision made in the team's best interests. India opted for an extra bowling option without compromising batting strength, as explained by the skipper. ""We don't make personal decisions. It's in the best interest of the team. We want to prioritise the team and think about the right combination for a specific venue and opposition,"" Rohit said, justifying the decision to leave out Gill in Melbourne. ""That's how I approach team selection. Yes, there have been changes, but you have to ensure that whatever suits the conditions and the team, covering all facets of the game, you make that call. That’s exactly what we did,"" he added. Will they apply the same rationale and drop the captain in the 'best interests of the team' for the Sydney Test? Gill has not been the worst Indian batter in the series—his numbers prove otherwise. In fact, he emerged as the second-highest run-scorer for India in Tests in 2024 and looked solid in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, where the rest of the batting unit faltered. Yet, Gill was left out to make room for an extra batting all-rounder. Rohit returned to the top of the order, disrupting an opening partnership that had been performing well. Notably, it was Rohit himself who relinquished his opening spot earlier to allow Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul to continue at the top following their match-winning 201-run stand in Perth. Rohit, absent for the series opener in Perth due to paternity leave, batted at No. 6 in Adelaide and Brisbane. However, he abruptly decided to return to the top order in Melbourne—a move that backfired, with the skipper scoring 3 and 9 in the Test. Moreover, it’s no secret that Rohit has been sub-par as a captain, often appearing out of ideas under pressure. With Pat Cummins, the opposition skipper, leading from the front, Rohit’s frailties have been further magnified.WILL ROHIT DROP HIMSELF IN SYDNEY? Former India opener Aakash Chopra has opined that dropping Rohit Sharma for the Sydney Test would be a fair call. The cricketer-turned-pundit also accused Rohit of prioritising his interests over the team's for the first time in his illustrious captaincy career. ""For the first time, captain Rohit made a decision entirely in his own interest. It was not in the team’s best interests. Let’s be honest. It couldn’t have been, because Rahul was opening well. Shubman Gill performed admirably in 2023 as the second-highest run-scorer and played under challenging conditions. He looked promising in Adelaide too. Yet, he was dropped. ""All this happened because Rohit thought of himself, not the team’s interests, for the first time as captain. It didn’t work out. India couldn’t even secure a draw,"" Chopra remarked. Will Rohit rectify his mistake? He could back his words with actions by handing over the captaincy to Jasprit Bumrah, restoring KL Rahul to the opening spot, and bringing Shubman Gill back into the XI. What Rohit chooses to do in Sydney, whether on or off the field, could play a decisive role in shaping his legacy as a leader.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  India cricket 2025 schedule: Full fixtures, dates, venues and time for men's team matchesMust Watch

Not only did he win the T20 World Cup with the Indian team, he was also made the full-time captain of the side after the tournament was concluded. Suryakumar pipped Hardik Pandya for that position - despite the all-rounder captaining the side since the start of 2023 - in the absence of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli - when they took a year-long break from the format. ""Bidding farewell to a year that is etched in our hearts.

 Suryakumar Yadav's post also included his tough times at the start of 2024, where he was sidelined due to multiple injuries. After being sidelined for an ankle issue, Suryakumar had to sit out longer than expected after he was diagnosed with sports hernia. The batter made a strong comeback and put in stellar performances in the T20 World Cup 2024. Suryakumar, however, will probably not be remembered for his batting in 2024. The Mumbai player's catch in the T20 World Cup Final went viral in the cricketing world. In an interview, India wicketkeeper batter Rishabh Pant recalled his thoughts before Suryakumar Yadav’s iconic catch in the T20 World Cup 2024 final against South Africa. Notably, Suryakumar took a sensational game-changing catch in the last over of the final to dismiss David Miller which tilted the balance in India’s favour. He showed great presence of mind to grab hold of the ball near the boundary at long-off and quickly got rid of it as the momentum took his body over the ropes. The Indian fielder further jumped back quickly to complete one of the greatest catches in Indian cricket history which became one of the pivotal reasons behind India’s seven-run win in the final. Recalling the nerve-wracking incident, Pant said that he felt like everything was gone as Miller had timed the ball nicely. He even joked that the prayers of Indian fans stopped the ball from crossing the boundary line. ""When the ball was in the air, it felt like everything was gone. When it hit the bat, it seemed like a sure-shot six. The ball didn't cross the boundary line because of the Indian fans' prayers,"" said on Tanmay Bhatt’s YouTube channel.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  India cricket 2025 schedule: Full fixtures, dates, venues and time for men's team matchesMust Watch

Grandmasters Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi sharing the 2024 World Blitz Championship title in New York on Wednesday, December 31, has not been well-received by a large section of fans. For the first time in the tournament's history, the world title was shared after the two finalists agreed to a tie following seven rounds. Fans have questioned the credibility of the World Blitz Championship after FIDE, the world chess governing body, permitted the tie and awarded the title jointly to both players. Defending champion Carlsen initially dominated the final, winning the first two games. However, Nepomniachtchi mounted a strong comeback to level the score at 2-2. Three subsequent sudden-death games also ended in draws, leading Carlsen to propose to Nepomniachtchi that they share the title. The arbiters at the venue deliberated on the proposal and ruled in favour, officially declaring two blitz champions for 2024. Carlsen, who had initially withdrawn from the Blitz Championship following a dress code controversy in the Rapid event, explained the reasoning behind the shared title decision. ""People, of course, understand that we are both tired and nervous. Some people will like it; some won’t. It’s just how it is,"" Carlsen said after the final. Legendary Garry Kasparov found humour in the situation, referencing the dress code controversy that had caused an uproar earlier in the week.

 Carlsen was embroiled in a controversy during the 2024 World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in New York due to a dress code violation involving jeans. On December 27, after the sixth round of the Rapid Championship, Carlsen was fined USD 200 by the FIDE for wearing jeans, which contravened the tournament's dress code aimed at maintaining professionalism.  Despite being allowed to change attire, Carlsen declined, stating it was a matter of principle. As a result, he was not paired for the ninth round and subsequently withdrew from both the Rapid and Blitz Championships, expressing his frustration with FIDE's regulations.  However, on December 29, following discussions with FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich and a relaxation of the dress code, Carlsen reversed his decision and rejoined the Blitz Championship.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 1, 2025

Khanna, who hails from Delhi, slammed the Indian team, after the 184-run loss, which saw them go 1-2 behind the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, after playing 4 Tests. Surinder's comments come on the backdrop of the controversial dismissal - which claimed the wicket of Yashasvi Jaiswal. The incident occurred in the 71st over of the match when Jaiswal was batting at 94. The left-hander miscued his pull shot after he failed to get a clean connection. The ball flew to the leg side of wicketkeeper Alex Carey, seemingly touching the glove of the batter. Carey completed a good catch on his wrong side and appealed to the umpire. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage On-field umpire Joel Wilson was not convinced by the appeal and judged Jaiswal not out. Bowler and captain Pat Cummins was not happy with the on-field call and immediately reverted to the third umpire, using one of the Decision Review System (DRS) referrals that he had. There was a long check on the DRS - ultra edge showed that there was no spike when the ball went past the batter but third umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat adjudged it out based on the visual evidence of the deflection. The Indian broadcaster's Hindi commentary team went up in unison against the decision and slammed the third umpire for his interpretation of the event. Surinder Khanna slammed the Indian team for arguing with the umpire and called the side a bunch of liars. “There is no point in making controversy, they’ve shown it from four angles that the ball hit the gloves and its pace also decreased before Alex Carey caught it behind the stumps. Akash Deep also complained of a similar thing when he was caught out. ‘Juthe log hai yeh’ (These people are liars), you have to play fair first then only you’ll start winning,” Khanna told IANS. “When the bat is in your hand, how can you not know about edging the ball? We have played bad and we have lost. What kind of batting they’re doing? Come the IPL, these players will hit runs. Don’t play over-aggressive T20 cricket and play positively. Let’s hope that the luck changes in the New Year (for the Indian team),” he added. India go to the final Test of the series 1-2 down against Australia. The Indian team has to win the final Test match, to stay in contention for the World Test Championship Final.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Was Yashasvi Jaiswal out or not out?

It came as  a shock to fans of her fans, who thought that Mandhana would close in on the top-ranked Laura Wolvaardt after her stellar show. In 2024, Smriti Mandhana delivered remarkable performances, scoring 743 runs in 12 innings at an impressive average of 61.91 and a strike rate of 96.99. The left-hander also chipped in with one wicket, showcasing her all-round abilities. Mandhana's year gained momentum in June with back-to-back centuries against South Africa in Bengaluru. She followed it up with two more hundreds, including one during India’s home series against New Zealand after the ICC Women's T20 World Cup. She ended the year on a high with a century in the final match of the series against Australia, even though India lost the series 3-0. Mandhana's standout all-round performance came in the second match of India’s home series against South Africa in June. Her brilliant 136 from just 120 balls, featuring 18 fours and two sixes, set the foundation for India’s total of 325/3. Later, she claimed the crucial wicket of South Africa captain Sune Luus, helping India secure a narrow four-wicket victory. More recently, Mandhana shattered the record for most ODI centuries for India with a terrific knock against New Zealand on October 29. Playing at Ahmedabad in the 3rd and final match of the series, Mandhana scored her 8th century and guided India to a series win over New Zealand. Mandhana, who played her 88th ODI match, scored 100 off 122 balls, helping India chase down the target of 233 runs in 44.2 overs. The innings, combined with captain Harmanpreet Kaur's unbeaten 59 off 63 balls, helped India exact revenge over the New Zealand side, which had beaten the Women in Blue in the recently concluded T20 World Cup 2024. Since her hundred vs New Zealand, Mandhana has scored one more hundred - against Australia, taking her tally to 9 centuries in the ODI format. She has a total of 3960 runs at an average of 45.

Kohli, along with captain Rohit Sharma, has faced scrutiny for a lack of impactful performances in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. The former medium pacer said it's important to be prepared for a smooth transition. AUS vs IND, 4TH TEST: FULL SCORECARD Kohli’s struggles with the bat in the series have been stark. Apart from a century in the second innings of the Perth Test, he has struggled to make significant contributions. Across six other innings, Kohli has managed just 67 runs at a dismal average of 11.16, with a top score of 36. On three occasions, he failed to reach double digits. His dismissals frequently arise from his inability to resist playing at deliveries outside the off-stump, highlighting a persistent flaw in his technique. ""Virat has got runs, but he also knows what's happening. They are very sorted mentally. A player always thinks that 'my best is around the corner'. I'll do it just now.' It's such a long spell; it's hurting the team, and there is questioning, saying you should be dropped. A lynch mob comes after you,"" Wassan told ANI. ""They also know what is going on. I think an exit plan, like a succession policy, must be clear. It's not fair on the management, the team, and the cricketing structure, we don't know what's there in your mind,"" he added. Statistical trends further highlight Kohli’s dip in form. Until 2019, he averaged 54.97 in Tests and was amongst the few players to maintain a 50+ average across all three formats. However, since January 2020, his Test average has dropped to 31.32. In this period, Kohli has played 38 Tests, scoring 2005 runs with just three centuries and nine half-centuries, far below his usual standards. The Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground added to the criticism. Kohli was dismissed in both innings while chasing deliveries outside the off-stump, a weakness that has haunted him in recent years. As a result, questions about his adaptability and ability to address technical shortcomings have resurfaced. Despite these struggles, Kohli’s career remains one of the most illustrious in cricket history, with 81 international centuries. Regaining his form and overcoming his technical flaws would not only extend his legacy but also set an example for aspiring cricketers. While the BCCI may be considering long-term plans, Kohli’s determination to bounce back will play a crucial role in defining the next chapter of his career.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Jasprit Bumrah to be rested for England ODIs ahead of Champions Trophy: Sources

His form in 2024 suggests he still has the magic to deliver at the highest level, leaving the door tantalisingly ajar. Ronaldo, meanwhile, has dazzled for Al Nassr and Portugal.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/exclusive-nandini-kashyap-interview-wpl-india-virat-kohli-2657984-2025-01-01,"Fairy tales exist only in textbooks, not in real life, they say. Nandini Kashyap may want to disagree. 2024 couldn’t have ended in a better way for the 21-year-old swashbuckling batter from Uttarakhand. November started with her finishing as the third-highest run-scorer in the Senior Women’s T20 Trophy. In nine games, the right-hander smashed 247 runs, averaging 41.17 with a top score of 117 against Pondicherry. Later in November, Nandini upped her game to become the top run-getter in the Senior Women’s T20 Challenger Trophy. Playing for Team E, she smashed 332 runs from five matches at an average of 83 and a strike-rate of 137.19 with four fifties. It was her 56-run knock against Team A that set the final up for Team E at the JSCA International Stadium Complex in Ranchi. December turned out to be even more memorable for Nandini, who bagged her maiden deal in the Women’s Premier League (WPL) and also earned her maiden call-up to the Indian team. Although she did not make her debut in the T20I series against the West Indies, she got to rub shoulders with Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues and others.

 In the WPL, Delhi Capitals (DC) picked her up at her base price of Rs 10 lakh. Nandini has built a reputation to the extent that Sourav Ganguly, the Director of Cricket at the Capitals, was surprised after the batter fetched only her base price. Nandini is one of the three wicketkeepers at DC along with Taniya Bhatia and Scotland’s Sarah Bryce. India Today recently caught up with Nandini for an interview where the Uttarakhand batter spoke about the recent breakthroughs she has made in her career. She also talked about her interaction with Virat Kohli and VVS Laxman. Nandini did not miss out on speaking about and praising Raghvi Bist, with whom she has been friends through age-group cricket.

After the Senior Women’s T20 Trophy and Senior Women’s Challenger Trophy, you earned the India call-up and bagged the WPL deal. How would you describe the phase of your journey? I have worked hard in the off-season, and I am able to execute it now. The last two months have been great for me after I focused on my skills and technical aspects of my game. How did you get to know about your WPL selection, and how did your family react?   I was with the Indian team when I got to know about DC. Two of my friends called me and immediately after I started watching the auction, my name popped up. I was very excited and then my parents congratulated me. My coach was very happy and it was a great time.

 Since you are already rated very highly at DC, is there any pressure of expectations building? No, there’s nothing of that sort. I am happy that I am with DC at my base price itself. I only expected my selection and I wanted nothing else. How excited are you to meet Sourav Ganguly? I am very excited to meet him. I want to ask him a lot of questions about how to become a great cricketer and how to build a long career. It would be an honour to interact with him and gain knowledge. I am also looking forward to interacting with Meg Lanning and so, it would be great. Who have you idolised as a wicketkeeper over the years? My favourite is Sarah Taylor. She has retired, but she is the greatest of all time. I am very inspired by her style of wicket-keeping and overall career.

 Tell us about the emotions you went through at the national anthem on India debut I have dreamed of this for a very long time. When I started playing, I wanted to sing the national anthem for India and I had goosebumps when I was standing there. More than playing, I was excited about the national anthem. I was also happy to see the packed crowd cheering for us and supporting women’s cricket. Were you disappointed after not making your debut against the West Indies? No, I was not disappointed. It was all about team combination, and I am very happy with my team. Since we won the series, everything was very positive.

 



Nandini Kashyap was the top run-scorer in the Senior Women’s T20 Challenger Trophy. Courtesy: Nandini Kashyap Instagram
 Any advice you got from the seniors during your time in the dugout? I got a lot of advice from the senior players, especially Jemi (Jemimah Rodrigues) and asked her about the game. Smriti di (Smriti Mandhana) and Harry di (Harmanpreet Kaur) and all seniors were very supportive. They told me about skills and work ethics and I will apply them in my game. Being close friends with Raghvi Bist, is there a healthy rivalry with your Uttarakhand teammate? She has different skills and I have different skills. She is a decent power-hitter and is the best batter for Uttarakhand. We have been friends from the beginning, and we always dreamed of playing for India together. So, there’s no rivalry as such. We always wanted to make our debut together and represent India. She was very capable, and so she got the cap, and I am very happy for her.

 Tell us about your meeting with Virat Kohli? We were at an NCA camp, and were lucky that Kohli was there at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru for a practice session for RCB. On the first day we went, although we knew that he did not have a session, hoping that we would get a glimpse of him. The next day, Kohli himself called us and asked us about our coaches and planning. For a good part of 10 to 15 minutes, he talked to us, and we were very nervous in front of him. So, we couldn’t ask him a lot of questions, but it was a wonderful experience, seeing him in front of us.

Women’s cricket is progressing, and we have to keep performing. There are plenty of chances to grab on as the selectors are always watching.

India and Australia are set to face off in the final Test of the series in Sydney, starting on 3 January. Also Read: Will Rohit Sharma do what's best for Team India in the New Year's Test? The team management, led by head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma, has come under intense scrutiny following India’s recent poor results in Test cricket. India suffered a historic 0-3 whitewash at home against New Zealand in October-November, marking their first-ever clean sweep in a home Test series. Rohit Sharma missed the opening Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth due to paternity leave, and Jasprit Bumrah stepped in as stand-in captain. Under Bumrah’s leadership, India crushed Australia by 290 runs. However, India’s fortunes took a turn for the worse after Rohit’s return. They suffered a 10-wicket defeat in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, followed by a rain-assisted draw in Brisbane. In Melbourne, India conceded a first-innings lead of 105 runs after allowing Australia to amass a daunting 474. Despite reducing Australia to 91 for 6 in their second innings, India failed to capitalise, as Australia’s lower order contributed crucial runs to set a target of 330. India’s hopes of a record chase in Melbourne were dashed early as they lost three key wickets in the first session. Rohit Sharma’s poor form with the bat persisted, scoring just 9 runs. KL Rahul, shuffled across the batting order, fell for a duck, while Virat Kohli departed for 3, playing an ill-judged drive in the final over before lunch. At 33 for 3, India found stability through Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant, who batted resiliently for over 30 overs to deny Australia a wicket in the second session. India appeared on track to secure a draw and head to the New Year’s Test with the series level at 1-1. However, the momentum swung dramatically when Rishabh Pant played a reckless shot, gifting his wicket to part-time off-spinner Travis Head. Australia seized the opening, bowling India out for 155. The visitors collapsed spectacularly, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs and suffering their first Boxing Day Test defeat in Melbourne in 13 years. While Rishabh Pant has faced criticism for his rash dismissal, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli remain under fire for their continued struggles with the bat.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 1, 2025

In the latest ICC Test Rankings, Bumrah not only remained at the top of the bowler's list but also recorded the highest-ever rating points by an Indian bowler. The pacer reaped rewards for his sensational performances in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Bumrah has been the standout bowler in the marquee bilateral series so far, with 30 wickets from 4 matches. Bumrah's exceptional performances however have not reflected in the results, as the hapless Indian side have lost 2 out of the first four matches of the series. Bumrah, who is shortlisted for the ICC Men’s Cricketer of the Year award for the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy and also the ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year award, has moved up from his previous tied high of 904 with Ravichandran Ashwin. His tally of 907 rating points now places him joint-17th in the all-time list with yesteryear spinner Derek Underwood of England. The list is led by England seamers Sydney Barnes (932) and George Lohmann (931) who played more than a century ago while Imran Khan (922) and Muttiah Muralidaran (920) are third and fourth. Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024/25: Full CoverageBUMRAH FASTEST INDIAN PACER TO 200 TEST WICKETS Playing in the Boxing Day Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Bumrah also became the fastest Indian pacer to reach the landmark of 200 wickets in Test cricket. The legendary Kapil Dev earlier held the record in 50 matches in the Test against West Indies back in March 1983 in Port of Spain. Bumrah reached the landmark in his 44th Test, thereby also becoming the joint second-fastest Indian to 200 Test wickets along with Ravindra Jadeja. Ravi Ashwin, who retired after the Brisbane Test, stays the fastest Indian after he picked up his 200th Test wicket in his 37th Test back in September 2016 during a Test match against New Zealand in Kanpur. Bumrah touched the 200-wicket landmark after dismissing Travis Head, who is the leading run-scorer of the series after smashing back-to-back hundreds in the Adelaide and Brisbane Tests. Overall, former Pakistani spinner Yasir Shah is the fastest to the milestone in only 33 Tests. Amongst pacers, Australia’s Dennis Lillee holds the record in 38 Test matches. The 31-year-old Bumrah also became the fourth fastest to 200 Test wickets (by balls bowled), getting there in 8484 balls. Pakistan’s Waqar Younis (7725) holds the record, followed by South Africa’s Dale Steyn (7848) and South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada (8153). Bumrah also reached the landmark at an average of 19.56, the lowest amongst all bowlers. Bumrah also broke Kapil Dev’s record for most wickets by an Indian pacer in a bilateral Test series on Australian soil. The speedster has been in splendid form, having troubled the Australian batters throughout.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Just not on: Ex-cricketers shocked by dressing room leaks from Australia TestsMust Watch

Carey's comments came after he was asked about Yashasvi Jaiswal's controversial dismissal from the Boxing Day Test match. Speaking at the press conference on Wednesday, 1 January, Carey called out the ultra-edge tech and said that it had been inconsistent throughout the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but praised the umpire for making what he thought was the best decision. ""I had no doubt and I think that the evidence was really clear that the third umpire made the right decision. Snico has been a little bit funny in this series. I think it is about taking a decision with all the evidence that you get and come up with a decision. I think the third umpire did a really good job,"" Alex Carey said.The Jaiswal DRS Incident A huge DRS controversy erupted at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on the final day of the 4th Test match when youngster Yashasvi Jaiswal was given out by the third umpire. The decision caused widespread controversy across the cricketing world, as Jaiswal was the last specialist batter for India, fighting to save the Test match. Jaiswal was given caught behind by the third umpire despite the snickometer showing that he did not edge the ball. The incident occurred in the 71st over of the match when Jaiswal was batting at 94. The left-hander miscued his pull shot after he failed to get a clean connection. The ball flew to the leg side of wicketkeeper Alex Carey, seemingly touching the glove of the batter. Carey completed a good catch on his wrong side and appealed to the umpire. On-field umpire Joel Wilson was not convinced by the appeal and judged Jaiswal not out. Bowler and captain Pat Cummins was not happy with the on-field call and immediately reverted to the third umpire, using one of the Decision Review System (DRS) referrals that he had. And here's where the controversy happened. There was a long check on the DRS - ultra edge showed that there was no spike when the ball went past the batter but third umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat adjudged it out based on the visual evidence of the deflection. While the Australians went up in celebrations, Jaiswal stood there stunned at the third umpire's call.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Just not on: Ex-cricketers shocked by dressing room leaks from Australia TestsMust Watch

Notably, Reddy is the third-highest run scorer of the series so far with 294 runs from four Tests (7 innings) at an average of 49 with one hundred to his name. He registered his maiden Test century on Day 3 of the fourth Test in Melbourne, playing a magnificent knock of 114 (189) with the help of 11 fours and a six. Following his remarkable century, Clarke was in awe of Reddy’s talent as he called him a ‘genius’ and mentioned that he should be batting at number 6 in the Sydney Test. Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024: Full Coverage ""Reddy, this young kid batting at number eight, is a genius. I think he has definitely got to bat seven if not six. He has been India's leading run-scorer, 21 years of age, unbelievable. He has been underrated in the entire series. I think he is good enough to bat at number six. So what a great option for India going into the last Test match,” Clarke said on Beyond 23 Cricket Podcast. “He has impressed everyone. He has not feared any Australian bowler. He has been patient when he has needed to be patient. He has batted with the tail extremely well. He has shown his intent. He bats, bowls and fields,"" he added.Will management promote Nitish Reddy up the order? Reddy has been consistent with the bat throughout the series as he’s scored crucial runs down the order across all four Tests. His promotion at number 6 could well help India add another bowling option in the playing XI, and fix the area they’ve struggled in the series so far.

The ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy has been a difficult ride for the side has struggled to get the right combination in the face of an aggressive and highly-driven Australian team. The visitors will be playing the must-win fifth and final Test here from Friday. The on-field roller-coaster is causing some off-field issues as well with murmurs of unrest in the dressing room beginning to grow. It is learnt that Gambhir is not on the same page with most of the players in the team and the communication isn't as good as it used to be during the time of Ravi Shastri and Rahul Dravid. Skipper Rohit Sharma has maintained that he speaks individually to the players about selection issues. But after Gambhir took charge in July, Rohit, it is said, hasn't actually given clarity to some of the not-so-junior players about why they were being excluded at times from the side. His own poor form hasn't helped Rohit's cause. But it is also reliably learnt that Gambhir, who is considered a more assertive person, hasn't earned a lot of confidence from the group of players, who aren't as old as Kohli or Rohit but are also not rookies like Harshit Rana or Nitish Reddy. ""There is a Test match to be played and then there is Champions Trophy. If the performance doesn't improve, even Gautam Gambhir's position wouldn't be safe,"" a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Gambhir's equation with the selection committee is also not particularly clear at this point. There are players in the team, who are feeling insecure because of his proclivity to experiment with the playing eleven. In the ongoing BGT, a punt like Nitish Reddy has worked out brilliantly but the handling of Shubman Gill is still being debated. BCCI secretary Jay Shah has now been elevated to the ICC chief's position and the Board will have his full-time successor only after January 12. Once that administrative stability is in place, the BCCI brass will have some thinking to do. Till Shah was in-charge of BCCI, he called the shots. Former India seamer Roger Binny, who is the current president of the Board, hasn't been seen taking any policy related calls. But if India's performance is not drastically better in the Champions Trophy in February-March, Gambhir will certainly have his wings clipped. ""He was never BCCI's first choice (it was VVS Laxman) and some of the well-known overseas names didn't want to coach all three formats, so he was a compromise. Obviously, some other compulsions were also there,"" the official said. Gambhir has already been asked a few tough questions after the 0-3 defeat at home to New Zealand and if the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is also lost, it can all go downhill for the feisty former opener from Delhi's Old Rajinder Nagar. Already there is a school of thought that Gambhir should only be given charge of the T20 team, a format in which he has been a successful captain and then mentor for both Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow SuperGiants. One question that is being asked in the corridors of power is whether he has been able to offer any solutions to Virat Kohli with regards to his never-ending dismissals in the outside off-stump channel? By the look of things, the answer to that seems to be an emphatic no. ""Gautam, all his life, while playing in England and Australia, would dab the ball towards slip and gully. So, he knows exactly what Kohli's problem is. He has seen that as a player (in 2014) and as a commentator and now as a coach. ""If he knows what is wrong, he should tell him,"" a former India great, with the experience of more than 90 Tests, said. ""Support staff"" for support staff The BCCI mandarins are also keeping a tab on certain other developments about one of the key members of the support staff, who is being accompanied at all the venues by his personal assistant. It is leant that the person in question used to have FOP (Field Of Play) access during the IPL where he would stride into the playing arena after games in a franchise jersey. In Australia, his presence in the box dedicated to BCCI members hasn't really been appreciated, according to a top source.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Jasprit Bumrah to be rested for England ODIs ahead of Champions Trophy: Sources

Although they racked up bilateral triumphs, the coveted ICC title kept eluding them. Prior to the T20 World Cup, multiple World Cup champion Jess Jonassen predicted that India were the firm favourite to lift the trophy given their familiarity with conditions in the UAE. But it didn’t quite turn out the way the women’s fratenity expected. Barring the win over Sri Lanka, India lacked intent that led to their downfall and elimination before the semi-finals. Harmanpreet Kaur did perform reasonably with the bat, but her captaincy again came under scrutiny. With them under the pump before their must-win clash against Australia, India fought hard before giving up the ghost. Amol Muzumdar’s role as head coach also went under the scanner. But all is not lost for India by any means. India got hammered in Australia before they took down the West Indies at home. That India won their first T20I series at home after five long years showed that the team hasn’t dominated in conditions expected to favour them mostly. Smriti Mandhana has produced single-handed efforts, shattering one record after the other, but she needs the desired support. Come 2025 and Harmanpreet has a point to prove. The ODI World Cup is scheduled to take place later this year at home and India aren’t going to get a better chance to reign supreme. India would know that laying their hands on the cup might change the landscape of women’s cricket in the country, once and for all. There’s more than a ray of hope for India Women in the next 12 months. After their early exit in the UAE, India have gone berserk, handing ODI caps to seven of their players, namely Minnu Mani, Tejal Hasabnis, Pratika Rawal, Titas Sadhu, Saima Thakor, Priya Mishra and Tanuja Kanwer. The effort India have put in to build a large pool is evident. The rise of Nandini Kashyap, Raghvi Bist, G Kamalini, the 16-year-old WPL crorepati, and Niki Prasad also bode well for the national team.India Women’s schedule in 2025 January 2025 – vs Ireland (Home) – 3 ODIs July 2025 – vs England (Away) – 3 T20Is, 3 ODIs September 2025 – vs Australia (Home) – 3 ODIs September-October 2025 – ICC Women’s World Cup (Home) December 2025 – vs Bangladesh (Home) – 3 ODIs, 3 T20IsTitle defence on the cards

 While the focus stays on the senior team, the junior girls also have plenty to look forward to. From January 18 onwards, the Indian U19 women’s team will start their title defence in the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup in Malaysia. In 2023, Shafali Verma took India to glory when the tournament took place in South Africa. This time around, the onus is on Niki Prasad to bring India glory. Niki recently helped India win the inaugural edition of the Women’s U19 Asia Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Left-arm spinner Aayushi Shukla was their star performer with the ball while Gongadi Trisha, who also played in South Africa, was their standout batter. The focus will also be on Kamalini and Mithili Vinod, who are more than good enough to give opposition headaches. Aayushi was recently part of the Madhya Pradesh team that won the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy after beating Bengal in the final. In the title clash, Aayushi showed her fearless approach with the bat, smashing a quick-fire 30 off 29 balls with six fours. It was the 17-year-old who also hit the winning boundary. Overall, the U19 team looks more than good enough to win the cup on February 2.

 Apart from international cricket, eyes will also be on the upcoming edition of the WPL. Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) faced flak for their lacklustre showing in the inaugural season. After losing five games on the bounce, they failed to advance to the playoffs. Their skipper Smriti Mandhana also flattered to deceive, while the world-class Megan Schutt took only four wickets from seven games. But in the 2024 edition, RCB did justice to their potential, winning the title. In the final against Delhi Capitals, Mandhana’s women found themselves in a rabbit hole before Sophie Molineux and Shreyanka Patil spun them back into the game with match-winning spells. Shreyanka also bagged the Purple Cap. Asha Sobhana became the oldest debutant for India Women on the back of 12 wickets in the WPL. Most importantly, there was the colossus named Ellyse Perry, who showed why she is the greatest women’s all-rounder to have ever graced the game. Not only did she finish as the highest run-scorer of the tournament with a top score of 66 in the Eliminator, but ripped apart Harmanpreet’s Mumbai Indians (MI) with figures of 4-0-15-6 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in the group stage. MI, who won the title in 2023, failed to qualify for the final last time and would be looking to make amends. Meg Lanning’s Capitals were hard done by after they couldn’t cross the final hurdle both times. The Giants would also be looking to turn their fortunes around after finishing at the bottom both times. Overall, with the ODI World Cup, WPL and the U19 Women’s T20 World Cup ahead, there’s plenty to look forward to in women’s cricket this year. Time will only tell how far India are able to climb the ladder and make themselves a stronger force in the women’s game over the next 12 months.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Tune InAlso Read |  Buoyed by Asia Cup heist, WPL gig, Niki Prasad sets sights on U19 T20 World CupMust Watch

In Adelaide, Australia stormed back with a thunderous 10-wicket win on the back of Travis Head’s hundred. At The Gabba in Brisbane, rain played spoilsport and, despite Head’s century, Australia could not take a lead. But Australia took the 2-1 lead after winning the Boxing Day Test by 184 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It’s now up to India to rise like a phoenix from the ashes and retain the prestigious Border Gavaskar Trophy. But can they do it?History isn’t promising for India   India do not have a promising record at the SCG, a reason why they needed to win in Melbourne, where they won four Tests. India have won one out of 13 Tests at the Sydney Cricket Ground, losing five, while seven matches ended in draws. Their only victory came back in January 1978 after Bishan Singh Bedi’s men defeated Bob Simpson’s troops by an innings and two runs. After bowling Australia out for 131 in the first innings, half-centuries from Gundappa Viswanath and Karsan Ghavri helped India take a lead of 265 runs. Following on, Australia were bowled out for 263 in their second innings after Erapalli Prasanna took four wickets. In the first innings, Bhagwath Chandrasekhar and Bedi took four and three wickets respectively. As far as Rohit Sharma’s men are concerned, they are under a lot of pressure. Having already played in the finals of the 2018-19 and 2020-21 WTC, they are looking for their third final on the trot. But their fate isn’t in their hands anymore after losses in five out of seven Tests.Here’s India's Test record in Sydney

During the first innings of the match, Maxwell put his sensational fielding skills on display as he first took a one-handed grab running to his right and immediately got rid of the ball as the momentum took him over the line. Within a few seconds, he quickly balanced himself and came inside the boundary to complete a breathtaking catch. As a result, Will Prestwidge had to return back to the pavilion for just 4 (10) leaving Heat on 106/6 in 16.1 overs, handing Dan Lawrence (1/6) his first wicket of the match.

The event, held on January 1, was part of the Glenn McGrath Foundation's celebrations ahead of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). The gathering brought together the Indian and Australian cricket teams, setting aside the fierce on-field rivalries for a moment of camaraderie. The Konstas brothers posted pictures of their interaction with Kohli and Bumrah on social media, drawing significant attention from fans. This light-hearted moment came in the wake of a heated exchange between Kohli and 19-year-old Sam Konstas during Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).

 On Day 1 of the MCG Test, Konstas had a fiery debut, engaging in verbal battles with the Indian batting icon. Despite the tension on the field, the photo with Kohli showcased the camaraderie and respect that transcend the game. Jasprit Bumrah’s connection with Konstas also added to the narrative. The young Australian batter had made waves with his audacious scoops and boundaries off Bumrah, even hitting the Indian pacer for six. However, Bumrah had the last laugh, dismissing Konstas on Day 4 and celebrating with his cheeky flair. This lighthearted rivalry added spice to an already intense series but took a backseat during the New Year’s event. The SCG Test is not just another cricket match; it holds special significance as it coincides with the 'Jane McGrath Day,' celebrated on Day 3. The day honours Jane McGrath, the late wife of Australian cricket legend Glenn McGrath, who passed away from breast cancer in 2008. Jane and Glenn co-founded the McGrath Foundation in 2005, aiming to fund breast care nurses and raise awareness about breast cancer, particularly among young women. This heartwarming gathering highlighted the unity cricket fosters, even amidst fierce competition, and set the tone for what promises to be an exciting final Test of the series.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Indian dressing room leaks from Australia leave ex-cricketers shocked

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/cricket-ms-dhoni-dressing-room-leak-india-vs-australia-melbourne-2658293-2025-01-01,"Reports of tension in the Indian dressing room surfaced after the embarrassing 184-run defeat in the Boxing Day Test against Pat Cummins’ Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). As per reports in The Indian Express, Gambhir came down hard on the Indian team after the visitors lost the chance of winning the Test series on Australian soil. As per the report, Gambhir said that he ""has had enough"", criticising the players for backing their “natural game” over prioritising the need of the hour in critical stages of the match. The report stated that the head coach wasn’t happy with the approach on display by the Indian batters. While the ongoing controversy keeps hitting the headlines, a certain MS Dhoni once tactfully dealt with similar reports when India toured Australia back in 2014-15. Back then, reports of a rift between Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan emerged during the Gabba Test against the Aussies. During the second Test, Dhawan injured his hand before Day 4’s play, after which Kohli had to walk out to bat along with Cheteshwar Pujara. Reports had suggested that Kohli wasn’t pleased after being given a notice of only 5-10 minutes to go out and bat. India went on to lose the match by four wickets in Brisbane.  MS Dhoni rubbishes rumours  Tackling the situation with grace, Dhoni said that players leaking information out of the change-room to the media don't ""deserve to be in our dressing room”. He also said that the ones putting out inside stories should be working for “movie companies”. ""Actually that was the case. Virat used a knife. He stabbed Shikhar, who just recovered out of that then we pushed him to bat. These are all stories. Marvel, maybe Warner Bros or somebody should pick up this and make a nice a movie out of it,"" Dhoni had said.

The Rohit Sharma-led side trail the series by 1-2 after playing 4 games, and are at a risk of getting thrown out of the World Test Championship Final race. The Indian team needs to win the final Test match of the series, but that is going to be more tricky than usual in Sydney. Sydney is traditionally a track that offers the most spin in Australia, but the Indian team might not be able to take full advantage of it. In fact, with India desperately needing a win in the final Test, a lot of the prayers might be directed to the 'Rain Gods' in Sydney. Just like the MCG Test match, Sydney's weather conditions is expected to be challenging with the temperature between 20-34 degrees Celsius. The first three days of the Test match are expected to remain rain-free, but they will range in terms of heat. According to Accuweather, Day 3 and 4 of the Test match is going to be the hottest, with temperatures soaring up to 34 degrees Celsius.   However, the match will be affected by rainfall on the final day. There is an 80 per cent chance that rain will take over the scenes in the afternoon, which will also result in some respite from the heat. While that will be good news for the people of Sydney, it could prove to be catastrophic for India's hopes of reaching the WTC Final.AUS vs IND, Sydney Test: Pitch report The Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) is known for its batting-friendly pitch, offering consistent bounce and rewarding batsmen early in a Test match. As the game progresses, the pitch deteriorates, bringing spinners into play with turn and variable bounce. Teams often include multiple spinners to exploit these conditions in the later stages.

Matches at the SCG frequently extend to the final day, making patience and strategy crucial for both batsmen and bowlers. In the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the fifth Test at the SCG is crucial. Australia leads the series 2-1, and India will aim to capitalise on the conditions to level the series. The Test begins January 3, promising a thrilling contest on one of cricket’s iconic grounds.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Indian dressing room leaks from Australia leave ex-cricketers shocked

 KL Rahul in his 4 matches in this Test series against Australia has scored 259 runs at an average of 37.00, has been one of the better batters in the India top order. The 32-year-old was promoted to the opener role alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal in the place of India skipper Rohit Sharma for the first three Tests, only for Rohit to resume the role again in the Melbourne Test.  Ahead of the New Year’s Test, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hosted the India and Australia cricket teams on January 1. The SCG Test is also notable for its celebration of ‘Jane McGrath Day’ on Day 3, an event dedicated to raising awareness and funds for breast cancer.  Australia, currently leading the series 2-1, are in a commanding position after their emphatic 184-run victory in the fourth Test in Melbourne. The Pat Cummins-led side has outplayed India in critical moments, leaving Rohit Sharma and his team under immense pressure to deliver in Sydney. A loss or a draw at the SCG would mean India surrendering the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a title they have held since 2017. With stakes this high, the SCG Test promises to be a battle of grit and determination as India aim to salvage the series and maintain their dominance in the iconic rivalry.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Indian dressing room leaks from Australia leave ex-cricketers shocked

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/rohit-sharma-michael-clarke-retirement-india-vs-australia-sydney-test-2658328-2025-01-01,"Former Australian cricketer Michael Clarke said that Indian captain Rohit Sharma has earned the right to walk away from the sport on his own terms. The 37-year-old Rohit has faced flak of late, especially after India’s lacklustre outings in the home Test series against New Zealand followed by the Border Gavaskar Trophy on Australian soil. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage In three Tests thus far in the five-match series, Rohit has notched 31 runs at an average of 6.20 with a top score of 10 to his name. Amid his poor run of form, calls of Rohit’s retirement have also been doing the rounds. Clarke, in the meantime, said that Rohit will take part in the New Year’s Test at the SCG before taking any call on his career.   ""You see that with a number of players -- to some people the captaincy helps for others it doesn't. I certainly think he'll play at Sydney. I don't think they'll drop him. I think Rohit has earned the right and he's captain. When you are captain you get a little more leeway as well,"" Clarke told ESPN. Also Read: Indian cricket in 2025: Transition time again as Kohli, Rohit futures in focus ""But those numbers don't read great. But they'll allow Rohit to walk away on his own terms. No idea if Sydney will be his last Test. I'm not sure what he is thinking, or what India's got coming up Test cricket wise,” Clarke said. ""I'm not sure how Rohit feels captaincy wise... He's just had his second child so who knows what's going to happen there but I'll imagine he will certainly play in Sydney,"" Clarke added. Out of 24 Tests that Rohit has captained, India have won 12, losing nine while three matches ended in draws. Under him, India also played in the World Test Championship 2021-23 final where they lost to Pat Cummins’ Australia. For now, India are looking to retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy and also keep alive their hopes of playing in the WTC final.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Jasprit Bumrah eyes BS Chandrasekhar's historic 52-year-old recordMust Watch

Rashford took to Instagram to deny allegations that he had approached Stellar, the agency previously involved in Gareth Bale’s record transfer to Real Madrid, to speed up the process of him securing a new club. The speculation stemmed from a report by the Sun suggesting that Rashford, feeling unsettled at United, had engaged with Stellar to facilitate a transfer during the ongoing winter window. Stellar represents several high-profile players, including Jack Grealish, Ivan Toney, and Eduardo Camavinga, as well as his United teammate Kobbie Mainoo. However, Rashford made it clear that his career is managed solely by his brother, Dwaine Maynard, and that the rumours were baseless.  ""Been a lot of false stories written over past few weeks, but guys this is getting ridiculous. Never met with any agency and don't have any plans to,"" Rashford wrote on his story. The 27-year-old forward has endured a challenging season under new manager Ruben Amorim. Having been left out of United’s squad for three consecutive league matches, Rashford’s future has come under scrutiny. Although he returned to the squad for a recent match against Newcastle United, he did not feature, intensifying speculation about a possible exit. Adding fuel to the fire, Rashford had previously hinted at exploring “new challenge” in his career, leading to heightened anticipation about his next move. With the January transfer window open until February 3, the rumor mill has been abuzz, though Rashford’s strong rebuttal has momentarily quelled discussions about his departure. Manchester United, meanwhile, find themselves at a crossroads, struggling to find consistency in a turbulent season. They are set to face arch-rivals Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday, January 7, in a match that could shape their campaign. While fans are eager to see Rashford return to the pitch, his involvement remains uncertain given his limited role under Amorim. As the club looks to regain momentum, Rashford’s situation adds another layer of complexity. Whether he stays at United or seeks a fresh start elsewhere, the weeks ahead are likely to be decisive for both his future and the direction of his career. For now, Rashford’s firm denial has shifted focus back to his commitment, though questions about his role at Old Trafford linger.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Football in 2025: Ronaldo-Messi future and 4 other things to look forward to

The video, which has sparked widespread controversy, features Carlsen allegedly suggesting to Nepomniachtchi that they “just play short draws until they give up” if their proposal to share the title was rejected. The chess world was left stunned when Carlsen and Nepomniachtchi were declared co-champions of the tournament after several intense games ended without a clear winner. Followed by their viral backstage video, many have called out both Carlsen and Nepomniachtchi for ""match-fixing"". Niemann, a consistent critic of FIDE, took to social media to call out the governing body, emphasising the need for transparency in resolving what he described as a blow to the integrity of the sport.

I can’t believe that 2 players who maliciously accused me and tried to ruin my career are openly breaking the rules. The irony simply can’t get any worse,"" Niemann said. This is not the first time Niemann has clashed with Carlsen or FIDE. The American grandmaster previously faced accusations of cheating from Carlsen during the 2022 Sinquefield Cup after defeating the Norwegian. Now, Niemann is once again questioning FIDE’s actions, accusing the organisation of bowing to financial pressures and granting undue influence to Carlsen. Adding fuel to the controversy, critics and even Niemann pointed to FIDE for leniency after its decision to allow Carlsen to compete in the Blitz Championship despite breaching the dress code during the Rapid event by wearing jeans. This perceived leniency, combined with the latest allegations of collusion, has intensified scrutiny on the chess federation’s governance. The championship’s final phase saw Carlsen dominate early, winning the first two games before Nepomniachtchi mounted a comeback to level the score at 2-2. Three sudden-death games also ended in draws, leading Carlsen to propose sharing the title. After deliberations, the arbiters approved the decision, officially naming both players co-champions. While some have defended the outcome as a practical solution to an unprecedented situation, many in the chess community have expressed outrage, accusing the players of undermining the competitive spirit of the game. Niemann’s call for an investigation has further amplified demands for FIDE to address these allegations and ensure accountability. This incident has reignited debates about fairness and governance in chess, leaving FIDE under immense pressure to uphold the sport’s integrity amidst growing scrutiny.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  What a joke: FIDE slammed after Carlsen, Nepomniachtchi share World Blitz crown

The 31-year-old speedster is currently the top wicket-taker, having taken 30 wickets from four Tests at an average of 12.83 with three five-wicket hauls to show for his efforts. Under Bumrah, India also won the Perth Test by 295 runs, their biggest by margin of runs on Australian soil. Albanese talked about the threat that Bumrah has posed to the home team’s batters and jokingly said that Australia could pass a law that would allow Bumrah to only bowl left-handed. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage ""We could pass a law here that says he has to bowl left-handed or off one step. Every time he has come onto bowl has been very exciting,” Albanese was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald. ""The Australian and Indian teams have already given us an incredible summer of cricket. When the fifth test starts on Friday, the SCG will be a sea of pink in support of the great work of the McGrath Foundation. Go Australia!,"" Albanese added.

The Reds are firm on retaining the defender until the end of the season, despite his expiring contract that could lead to a potential move to Spain. Reports suggest Real Madrid initiated contact with Liverpool to explore the possibility of signing Alexander-Arnold. With his contract at Anfield running out in June 2025, the England international will soon be eligible to negotiate with European clubs. Real Madrid could secure the fullback on a free transfer via a pre-contract agreement, similar to how they previously acquired Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain. Michael Owen, a former Liverpool forward who made the switch to Real Madrid during his career, expressed his thoughts on the situation. Owen believes Alexander-Arnold’s transfer to Los Blancos is inevitable, given his stature and Madrid’s history of targeting elite talents.  The potential move is viewed as part of Real Madrid’s ongoing efforts to assemble a formidable squad. The Spanish giants signed Trent’s England teammate, Jude Bellingham, ahead of the 2024 season. Bellingham's debut campaign saw him lead Madrid to victories in La Liga, the UEFA Champions League, and the UEFA Super Cup. Madrid also added French captain Kylian Mbappe to their ranks in a high-profile transfer. The prospect of Alexander-Arnold joining these marquee players could significantly strengthen the team's already imposing lineup. Known for his exceptional passing, set-piece delivery, and attacking prowess, the English fullback would bring a dynamic edge to Madrid’s tactical setup with Dani Carvajal ruled out of this season. For now, Liverpool remains resolute in retaining their star, focusing on the remainder of their campaign. However, with Alexander-Arnold’s contract nearing its conclusion, speculation about his eventual move to Real Madrid continues to dominate the headlines.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 1, 2025Also Read |  Marcus Rashford hits out at fake Manchester United exit articles: Getting ridiculous

With Australia leading the series 2-1, a win or draw in Sydney would secure the coveted trophy for the first time since 2014-15 and confirm their spot in the World Test Championship final at Lord's. During the pre-match press conference, Cummins lauded Bumrah's exceptional bowling form, noting his ability to trouble batters across formats. Bumrah was the best bowler in Test cricket in 2024, with 71 wickets from 13 matches at an average of 14.92 and a strike rate of 30.16. Bumrah recorded the highest-ever rating points by an Indian bowler in Test cricket, surpassing Ravichandran Ashwin. ""Bumrah is bowling well at the moment. He is always tough,"" Cummins said during the pre-match press conference. ""Hopefully, by the time I come in, late in the day, he has bowled quite a bit, which might make it a bit easier for me. But he is bowling well. I’ve faced him quite a bit across the world in different formats, and he always poses a challenge."" In a lighter moment, Cummins reflected on his fortune in the previous match, saying, ""Last game, it helped as I was in the non-striker's end. That certainly helped [laugh]."" Australia have announced one change to their lineup for the Sydney Test. Allrounder Mitchell Marsh was dropped due to lackluster performances, making way for Beau Webster, who will debut. ""Mitchy obviously hasn't quite got the runs or wickets he would have liked this series and felt like it was time for a freshen up,"" Cummins explained. ""Beau's been with the squad and been great. It's a shame for Mitchy because we know how much he brings to the team, but we feel like now is a good time for Beau to get a chance.""

 The controversy began on December 31, 2024, when Carlsen and Nepomniachtchi made history by sharing the World Blitz Championship title after seven rounds of the final match ended in a tie.

Fast bowler Harshit Rana made his debut in Perth but was benched after struggling in the Adelaide Pink Ball Test. The experimentation continued in Melbourne, where India fielded three all-rounders—Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, and Washington Sundar—while Shubman Gill was dropped. Under-fire captain Rohit Sharma chose to open the innings in place of KL Rahul, who was shifted to the No. 3 position.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Tune InRead More |  Australia drop struggling all-rounder, Mitchell Starc passed fit for Sydney Test

Australia all-rounder set to debut in SCG Test vs India Beau Jacob Webster, a 31-year-old all-rounder from the quaint town of Snug, Tasmania, has made headlines as the latest addition to Australia's Test playing XI for the final match of the series against India in Sydney. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/beau-webster-australia-all-rounder-set-to-debut-in-scg-test-vs-india-2658401-2025-01-02,"Australia will hand Beau Webster his debut in the New Year's Test against India, replacing the out-of-form Mitchell Marsh in the playing XI for the Sydney Test. This is the only change to the team that secured a commanding 2-1 series lead in Melbourne, with Mitchell Starc declared fit to play despite experiencing rib soreness during the Boxing Day Test. Marsh, Australia's T20 captain, managed only 73 runs across the first four Tests and bowled sparingly as the team rebounded from a heavy defeat in the Perth opener. Meanwhile, Webster, 31, is set to make his international debut in any format. The Tasmanian all-rounder boasts an impressive domestic record, having scored 5,297 runs and taken 148 wickets in 93 first-class matches.advertisementWHO IS BEAU WEBSTER?Born on December 1, 1993, Webster's cricketing journey began with age-group cricket for Tasmania before debuting in first-class cricket in 2014. Over the years, he has cemented his reputation as a versatile player. He has scored 5,297 runs in 93 first-class matches at an average of 37.83, including 12 centuries. With the ball, Webster took 148 wickets, solidifying his status as a genuine all-rounder. Born on December 1, 1993, Webster's cricketing journey began with age-group cricket for Tasmania before debuting in first-class cricket in 2014. Over the years, he has cemented his reputation as a versatile player. He has scored 5,297 runs in 93 first-class matches at an average of 37.83, including 12 centuries. With the ball, Webster took 148 wickets, solidifying his status as a genuine all-rounder. In a career-defining move four years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic, Webster transitioned from off-spin to seam bowling. The switch, coupled with relentless gym sessions, has paid dividends. Tasmania captain Jordan Silk praised Webster's adaptability: ""He's basically playing as our third seamer and top-six batter, which is a pretty good luxury to have in our side."" Webster's contributions have been critical for Tasmania, particularly in recent seasons. Since the start of the 2022/23 campaign, he has amassed 1,837 runs at an average of 51.01 and taken 39 wickets. His performances earned him the title of Sheffield Shield Player of the Season, and his impressive showing in the recent Australia A series against India further bolstered his case for national selection. Nicknamed ""Slug"" and standing at 200cm, Webster has become Tasmania's most dependable player. His ability to adapt-be it as an opener, a middle-order anchor, or a bowler switching between seam and spin—adds a unique dimension to Australia's squad. As Australia prepares for the Adelaide Test, Webster is ready to step up if called upon. He expressed confidence in embracing any role, stating: ""I'd be comfortable to do whatever they require; I feel like I've done it all in the last ten years at the top and in the middle,"" Webster said on Thursday. ""I daresay the role will be somewhere between that five and seven with the bat and some overs as well, predominantly seam up. We've got the spin department covered pretty convincingly with Nathan (Lyon) and a few other guys who bowl some part-time spin.""Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Read More |  Pat Cummins reveals how Australia will deal with Jasprit Bumrah's threat in Sydney

In his absence, Steve Smith or Travis Head may be handed the captaincy of Australia for the Sri Lanka tour. Cummins' decision is deeply influenced by personal experiences, particularly the recent loss of his mother, Maria, and his reflections on balancing professional commitments with family life. Speaking at the launch of the Pink Test for the McGrath Foundation—a cause close to Australian cricket, now expanding its support to all cancer patients-Cummins shared his evolving perspective. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""In some ways it really makes you focus in on what I think is important,"" he told the Daily Telegraph at the launch of the Pink Test. ""It's family, it's enjoyment, it's trying to find joy in life and I think that's been a slight shift in the way I've approached playing and touring and it's just given me that real decluttering mindset. ""When you go out you just want to play well and of course there's going to be pressure, but you don't want to forget that what mum and dad used to say to us every time we went and played as kids, was to go and enjoy it. Try your best, but make sure you enjoy it. I try and remind myself of that every time I go on a tour or play. ""Whatever you choose to do there's always an opportunity cost. And I think in the last few years that's probably rung true. That is when you go away on a tour you are missing out on maybe family time or moments. That's a deliberate choice so make sure you are making the most of that tour or that game if that makes sense."" Reflecting on the birth of his first child, Albie, Cummins expressed regret for missing the early weeks of his son's life while playing in a World Cup. ""I missed a big chunk last time. I want to spend more time at home for this initial period,"" he said.

Akash had claimed five wickets in the first two Tests in Brisbane and Melbourne. He was somewhat unlucky not to take more wickets, as several catches were dropped off his bowling during those matches. ""Akash Deep is out with a back issue,"" India coach Gautam Gambhir confirmed during the pre-match press conference. The 28-year-old right-arm pacer bowled a total of 87.5 overs in the series so far, and the injury could be attributed to the heavier-than-usual workload he has endured. The hard Australian pitches are notorious for causing knee, ankle, and back issues for fast bowlers. Either Harshit Rana or Prasidh Krishna is expected to replace Akash in the playing XI. India trail 1-2 in the five-match series and must win the final game to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India’s selection decisions throughout the tour have raised eyebrows, starting in Perth where both Ravindra Jadeja and R. Ashwin were benched in favor of Washington Sundar. Harshit Rana, who made his debut in Perth, was also included in the Adelaide Test but visibly struggled with the demands of back-to-back matches and long bowling spells.  The trend continued in Melbourne, where India opted to field three all-rounders—Nitish Kumar Reddy, Jadeja, and Washington—while dropping their No. 3 batter, Shubman Gill. Adding to the puzzling decisions, they promoted the out-of-form Rohit Sharma to open the innings in place of KL Rahul, who had looked steady at the top, disrupting the team's balance further. Meanwhile, Australia confirmed that all-rounder Mitchell Marsh will play no part in the series decider due to poor form. Tasmania all-rounder Beau Webster is set to make his Test debut, as announced by Australian captain Pat Cummins during the pre-match press conference. The 33-year-old Marsh managed only 73 runs in seven innings across four Tests, and Cummins cited his underwhelming performance as the reason for his exclusion. Marsh has bowled just 33 overs in the series, taking only three wickets. ""We have one change in our side: Beau Webster replaces Mitch Marsh. Mitch knows he hasn't scored enough runs,"" Cummins said.

Speaking to the press on the eve of the final Test in Sydney, Gambhir dismissed reports of unrest following the Boxing Day Test defeat, where India succumbed to Australia by 184 runs.  A report had suggested that Gambhir had delivered a scathing address to the team after the defeat, reportedly criticising players for prioritising their ""natural game"" over adapting to match situations. However, Gambhir downplayed the incident, stating, ""Those are just reports. That's not the truth. I don't think I need to answer any reports. There were some honest words, that is what I can say. Honesty is very important. Honesty is extremely important if you want to go and achieve great things.  The coach also reaffirmed the need for unity within the squad, saying, ""Team first. It's a team game, and everyone understands this. Debates between a player and a coach should stay between them. Any conversations in the dressing room should stay in the dressing room.""   The controversy arose after a report by The Indian Express detailed Gambhir's frustration during the post-match team meeting, where he reportedly warned players unwilling to adhere to his team strategies that they would face exclusion.  Gambhir, who took over as head coach in July, admitted in the reported post-match meeting to allowing players more freedom over the past six months but signalled a stricter approach moving forward.  Former cricketers Irfan Pathan and Sreevats Goswami criticised the breach of confidentiality, with Pathan stating, ""What happens in the dressing room should stay in the dressing room.""EXTREMELY CONFIDENT OF WINNING SYTNEY TEST: GAMBHIR Gambhir said the focus will now shift to winning the Sydney Test and that he is ""extremely confident"" of the team putting on a strong show in the series finale.

This was Sri Lanka's first T20I win in New Zealand since 2006, a consolation in the three-match T20I series, which New Zealand won 2-1. After being sent in to bat under overcast skies, Sri Lanka faced early trouble, losing both openers within the powerplay. However, Kusal Perera stepped up and transformed the innings with a blistering counter-attack. His remarkable century, off just 44 balls, set a record as the fastest T20I hundred by a Sri Lankan. Perera's knock was studded with 13 fours and 4 sixes. ""It's always a pleasure to score a 100. When I faced the first ball today, was like a wake-up call. You need to adjust to the extra bounce and conditions here. I always try to back myself and play my natural game. These conditions are helpful for the seamers, the last two games we did not get a start, once you get a start here you need to make it count.

Supported by skipper Charith Asalanka's solid 46, Perera guided Sri Lanka to an imposing total of 218/5, their second-highest T20I score. Even a subdued finish in the final overs could not overshadow the platform set by Perera's brilliance. Chasing a challenging target of 219, New Zealand got off to a flying start, with openers Tom Robinson (37) and Rachin Ravindra (69) putting on an 81-run partnership in the powerplay. Their aggressive approach placed the Sri Lankan bowlers under pressure and gave the hosts a realistic chance of reaching the target. However, Sri Lanka fought back with crucial wickets at key moments. Charith Asalanka (3/50) played a pivotal role, despite conceding runs, by removing important batters. Daryl Mitchell's brisk 35 kept New Zealand's hopes alive, but the lack of middle-order support ultimately saw them fall short by seven runs.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Read More |  Will Rohit Sharma play in Sydney Test?

Speaking on the eve of the decisive Test, Gambhir remained tight-lipped, fuelling speculation that the 37-year-old skipper might be axed. Rohit, struggling with the bat and leading a side trailing 2-1 in the five-match series, was a surprising omission from the pre-match media interaction, with Gambhir stepping in at the last minute. When asked directly if Rohit would play, Gambhir deflected, stating that the final XI would only be decided after assessing the pitch. Rohit's form this season has been dismal. Across three series, including two at home, he has managed just 164 runs in 15 innings at an average of 10.93, with only one half-century. On the ongoing tour of Australia, he has contributed just 31 runs, including a solitary double-digit score. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Shortly after the press conference, the Indian head coach was spotted overseeing practice at the SCG, where Rohit's absence from the slip cordon raised eyebrows. Virat Kohli took over at first slip, with KL Rahul shifting to second and Nitish Kumar Reddy occupying third. Regulars Rishabh Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal retained their positions at wicketkeeper and gully, respectively. If Rohit is dropped, it could pave the way for Shubman Gill's return at No. 3, with KL Rahul opening alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal. Gambhir, while revealing that pacer Akash Deep was ruled out with a back injury, offered no clarity on the batting lineup.  Gill was seen in conversation with Gambhir during practice, receiving a pat on the back before being approached by Jasprit Bumrah. The exchanges suggested good news for the young batter, who missed the fourth Test in Melbourne to accommodate Washington Sundar. Gill then batted confidently in the nets, with his father watching from nearby steps. Should Rohit miss out, Bumrah will lead India in the final Test. A win at the SCG is crucial for India to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Notably, India's solitary win in the series came in Perth under Bumrah's captaincy.  Meanwhile, the Melbourne defeat, coupled with a stunning 3-0 home series loss to New Zealand earlier, extended Rohit's winless streak as captain to six Tests. His batting average of 6.20 in the Australian series is now the lowest for a touring captain in Australia with a minimum of five innings, surpassing Courtney Walsh's record of 7.75 in 1996/97. There is also a school of thought that the Indian team management is deliberating on Rishabh Pant's position in the XI. Pant's dismissals due to reckless shots at the MCG drew significant criticism, including Sunil Gavaskar's viral ""Stupid, stupid, stupid"" rant on the commentary.  Pant was expected to be a game-changer on the tour of Australia, especially given his heroics in the 2020/21 series Down Under. However, the wicketkeeper-batter has managed just 154 runs in seven innings in the ongoing series, averaging only 22, with no fifty-plus scores. If India benches Pant, Dhruv Jurel, who played just one match in the series, scoring 11 and 1 in Perth, will be tested in Sydney. Gambhir also confirmed Akash Deep's unavailability for the New Year Test due to a stiff back but refrained from naming a replacement. Mohammed Siraj seemed to bowl better when he was brought in as the first change after Bumrah and Akash Deep had built pressure with the new ball. With Akash ruled out due to a stiff back, India will have to rejig their bowling attack, with either Prasidh Krishna or Harshit Rana set to replace him. India Predicted Playing XI for 5th Test: KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rohit Sharma/Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant/Dhruv Jurel, Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Prasidh Krishna/Harshit Rana, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed SirajPublished By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Read More |  AUS vs IND: Akash Deep out of Sydney Test with back issue, confirms coach Gambhir

Addressing the press on the eve of the New Year’s Test against Australia in Sydney, Gambhir expressed his satisfaction that the transition is occurring in both the batting and bowling departments, unlike certain periods in the past. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Questions about Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma’s place in the side have intensified after India conceded an unbeatable 2-1 lead to Australia following the 184-run defeat in Melbourne. While Kohli has struggled for consistency in Tests, Rohit’s form has declined sharply. The India captain has managed just 31 runs in three Tests in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and only 164 runs in eight matches in the 2024-25 Test season, averaging a mere 10.83 per innings. “See, I will tell you one thing. I think Indian cricket will always be in safe hands till the time honest people are sitting in the dressing room. Honesty is the most important thing for any transition. It’s not about phasing out senior players or getting the youngsters in. Ultimately, the only thing that can keep you in the dressing room is the performance,” Gautam Gambhir said. The Indian head coach declined to answer questions about Rohit Sharma’s place in the XI for the fifth and final Test, reiterating that a decision would be made on Friday morning after assessing the pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Gambhir’s comments come at a time when several pundits have been discussing the futures of senior batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Former head coach Ravi Shastri remarked that Kohli could continue in Tests for another three to four years but suggested that Rohit Sharma might need to make a decision about his future at the conclusion of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Former Australia captain Mark Waugh speculated that Rohit’s Test career might be nearing its end, while former India opener Aakash Chopra called on Rohit to drop himself for the Sydney Test.TRANSITION PERIOD IS AN EXCITING TIME: GAMBHIR Gambhir, who was part of the Indian team during a major transition phase that saw the careers of Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, and Sachin Tendulkar come to an end, described the current transition phase as not just a challenge but an exciting opportunity. The head coach further stated that ensuring a smooth transition is a collective responsibility, emphasising that both the batting and bowling units of the current team are already undergoing significant changes. “It’s not the role of only the support staff, but you people as well. It’s about not just criticising them, but trying to hug them out as well. Transition doesn’t happen only for us; it happens for the entire country,” Gambhir said. “Yeah, it’s an exciting time in Indian cricket. I felt that when transitions happened in the past, there was one department that was carrying the team forward. But at the moment, if you see this transition, it’s happening in both departments. And it has already started. You see some younger fast bowlers coming in. You have got some younger batters who have been on their first tour to Australia and done exceptionally well. Look at Yashasvi Jaiswal, Nitish Reddy and Washington Sundar, who is on his second tour. Akash Deep has done really well. I think the conversations that have happened are only around how we can play well in this series,” he added. India appear to have moved on from Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, grooming young talents like Sarfaraz Khan and Dhruv Jurel. While Mohammed Shami has not travelled to Australia due to injury issues, R Ashwin retired from Test cricket midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

With the series delicately poised at 2-1 in Australia’s favour, all eyes are on the Indian team’s composition and the brewing tension in the dressing room. On Thursday, January 2, India head coach Gautam Gambhir refused to confirm whether under-fire captain Rohit Sharma would feature in the playing XI for the Sydney Test. Rohit, who has been woefully out of form, has amassed just 31 runs in the series, averaging 6.20—the lowest by a touring captain in Australia with at least five innings. His prolonged slump in the 2024-25 season, managing a mere 164 runs in 15 innings at 10.93, has raised questions about his role as both batter and skipper. Addressing the press on the eve of the Test, Gambhir deflected questions about Rohit’s inclusion, stating that the final XI would be decided after assessing the pitch. “The only thing that keeps you in the dressing room is performance,” he reiterated, adding further intrigue to the captain’s fate. During training, Rohit’s absence from the slip cordon added fuel to the speculation. Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Nitish Kumar Reddy were seen practising slip catching while Rishabh Pant was out with the wicketkeeping gloves, doing his drills on Thursday morning. Rohit spent a large part of the session in discussion with Gambhir, vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah, and chief selector Ajit Agarkar. Sydney Test: India predicted XI Rohit eventually padded up and walked out to bat in the nets. However, the skipper had a brief session, taking throwdowns. Rohit did not spend as much time as his teammates at the nets.  If Rohit is dropped, Bumrah is expected to lead the side. Shubman Gill, who missed the fourth Test to accommodate Washington Sundar, is likely to return, potentially at No. 3, with Rahul partnering Jaiswal at the top.A MESSAGE SENT TO SHUBMAN GILL?

Bumrah also approached Gill, offering a similar gesture, hinting that a message was being conveyed to the Gujarat Titans captain. Gill batted in the nets alongside Kohli and Rahul, looking focused on the job at hand. Interestingly, Gill's father was standing behind the nets and watched him hone his skills.

Following India’s 184-run loss in the Boxing Day Test, a media report detailed head coach Gambhir’s purported frustration with players prioritising their ""natural game"" over adapting to match situations. The leak has drawn criticism from former cricketers, including Irfan Pathan, who condemned the breach of confidentiality, saying, “What happens in the dressing room should stay in the dressing room.” Gambhir addressed the controversy during the press conference, categorically denying any unrest within the team. “Those are just reports. That’s not the truth. I don’t think I need to answer any reports. There were some honest words, that is what I can say,” he stated. Australia, meanwhile, remain buoyant after dominant performances in Melbourne and Adelaide. The Australian dressing room has been a happy camp. Captain Pat Cummins announced the XI for the Sydney Test on Thursday, confirming that all-rounder Mitchell Marsh had been dropped due to poor form. Cummins did not sugarcoat the decision, opting not to frame it in a different light. Australia have added uncapped all-rounder Beau Webster as Marsh's replacement for the series finale.

The stadium will play host to the opening match of the ICC marquee event between Pakistan and New Zealand on February 19. ""Due to the ongoing construction and renovation work, it was decided against holding any matches at the NSK as it would only further delay the work and also disturb the players,"" one official said. The Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final, the premier first-class event in Pakistan, began on Thursday at the smaller UBL Complex here after getting shifted from the National Stadium. The PCB has also announced that the two-Test series against the West Indies later this month would be held in Multan after scheduling the first Test in Karachi after continuing delay in the renovation work remained a cause of concern. Some of the construction work, which was scheduled for a December 15 finish, was completed at the deadline and fresh instructions have been issued to the construction company to push the job schedule. The PCB is carrying out massive construction work worth Rs 12 billion at all three venues scheduled to host the Champions Trophy, including Lahore and Rawalpindi. It includes renovation of the main NSK building, new dressing rooms, media centres, hospitality boxes and board offices. A new electronic scoreboard is also being installed along with new chairs in enclosures and the fencing around the ground is also being replaced from scratch.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Read More |  India's predicted XI for 5th Test vs Australia: Rohit Sharma out, Shubman Gill in?

Gambhir addressed chatter about his dressing room speech while talking to the press on Thursday in Sydney. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-gautam-gambhir-dressing-room-speech-melbourne-defeat-inside-scoop-2658539-2025-01-02,"India head coach Gautam Gambhir delivered a strongly-worded speech in the dressing room following the team’s 184-run defeat to Australia in Melbourne, critically assessing both the performance and attitude of the players. Gambhir’s address, a stern yet constructive talk, was made in front of the entire squad, including senior players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.   Addressing the team’s underperformance, Gambhir wanted to say ""Tum log jaag rahe ho ya nahi? (Are you guys going to wake up or not?)"" but tempered the tone and said, ""Just because I haven’t spoken much doesn’t mean you can take things for granted"". The remarks were aimed at motivating the players to adapt and improve ahead of the series finale in Sydney, sources told India Today. Gambhir’s speech was perceived as a wake-up call, a clear message to those falling short of expectations during the high-stakes Border-Gavaskar Trophy.   Reports of Gambhir’s post-match address surfaced on Wednesday, claiming he criticised players for prioritising their ""natural game"" over adapting to match situations. Speaking at a press conference in Sydney on Thursday, Gambhir dismissed rumours of unrest within the camp. However, he acknowledged having ""honest conversations"" with the players after the Melbourne defeat.   ""Those are just reports. That's not the truth. I don't think I need to answer any reports. There were some honest words, that is what I can say. Honesty is very important. Honesty is extremely important if you want to go and achieve great things,"" Gambhir said on the eve of the fifth Test.   He also emphasised the importance of unity within the squad, stating, ""Team first. It's a team game, and everyone understands this. Debates between a player and a coach should stay between them. Any conversations in the dressing room should stay in the dressing room.""NO ROHIT SHARMA IN SYDNEY TEST?  Meanwhile, sources have told India Today that Rohit Sharma might not feature in the XI when the two teams meet in Sydney from Friday, January 3.  Gautam Gambhir did not confirm captain Rohit Sharma's place in the XI for the Sydney Test during his media conference. During training on the eve of the Test, Rohit was not fielding in the slip cordon, adding fuel to the speculation. The India captain walked out last to bat in the nets and had only a brief session.  Pundits, including former Australia captain Mark Waugh, called for Rohit to be dropped for the Sydney Test. The India captain has been struggling for form, managing just 31 runs in three Tests in Australia.  A journalist persistently questioned Gambhir, asking why the captain had not attended the press conference on the eve of the Test, highlighting that it is a tradition in Test cricket. While Gambhir confirmed that India would miss fast bowler Akash Deep due to an injury, he remained non-committal regarding the team combination and Rohit’s inclusion in the playing XI. ""Everything is fine with Rohit. I don't think it's a tradition. The head coach is here. That should be fine, that should be good enough. I am going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow,"" Gambhir said.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 2, 2025

Shastri's comments came after India coach Gautam Gambhir refrained from confirming Rohit's participation in the fifth Test against Australia.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-rohit-sharma-test-future-ravi-shastri-2658525-2025-01-02,"Former coach Ravi Shastri has said he wouldn't be surprised if India captain Rohit Sharma retires from Test cricket. However, if selected for a farewell match, Ravi Shastri believes Rohit should play without any baggage as India fights to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and keep their World Test Championship 2025 final hopes alive in Sydney. Shastri's remarks came after India coach Gautam Gambhir declined to confirm whether Rohit would play the fifth Test against Australia, stating only that the team would be announced before the toss on Friday. ""If I were anywhere near Rohit Sharma, I'd tell him Just go and smash it. Go out there and have a blast,"" Shastri said on The ICC Review. ""Right now, playing the way he is, it's not looking great. He needs to take the attack to the opposition and see what happens."" Speculation about the Indian captain's retirement from Test cricket has intensified since Gambhir's pre-match press conference on Thursday, with Rohit managing only 31 runs at an average of 6.2 in five innings in the Australia series. The regular captain did not play in the first Test of the series in Perth, which India won. ""He'll take a call on his career, but I won't be shocked if he retires because he's not getting any younger,"" Shastri said. ""There are young players waiting in the wings, like Shubman Gill, who averages over 40 in 2024. Seeing a player of that quality sitting on the bench makes you wonder. So I wouldn't be surprised, but it's ultimately his decision. ""If India qualifies for the World Test Championship Final, it's a different story. Otherwise, this might be the right time for him to go out with a blaze of glory."" Rohit retired from T20Is on a high note, captaining India to World Cup silverware in the West Indies in 2024, where he scored two half-centuries in his final three innings. He remains in contention for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, though his recent struggles in red-ball cricket have drawn scrutiny. ""I think he's a bit late on the ball,"" Shastri observed. ""His footwork, which was minimal even at his best, seems to have declined further. He's often caught on the crease, neither forward nor back. When Rohit moves towards the ball with intent, the right signals are sent from his brain to his feet, and he performs better. ""He needs to play his natural game. Go out there, take the opposition on, and try to win the Test match. Losing one Test doesn't mean the series is lost."" The fifth and final Border Gavaskar Test begins on Friday, with Australia leading 2-1. India must win the Sydney Test to keep their slim World Test Championship Final hopes alive and would also need Australia to avoid winning either of their two Tests in Sri Lanka to secure a spot at Lord's in June.

Cummins also put to rest the speculation surrounding Mitchell Starc's fitness, saying he will play the game. India rarely reveal their playing XI ahead of a test, but Gautam Gambhir's reluctance to confirm Rohit Sharma's inclusion raised eyebrows. Isn't the captain an automatic choice? Doesn't he decide who plays, not the other way around? The new year has started with plenty of intrigue for Indian cricket. Gambhir's vague response only added to the suspense. Shubman Gill, who had made way for Rohit earlier, was seen batting early in the nets, while Dhruv Jurel, not typically part of the first XI training group, stayed the longest. Could there be signs of a shakeup in the lineup? Is Rohit on the way out? Meanwhile, Akash Deep's unavailability due to a stiff back means India must revamp their bowling attack, with Prasidh Krishna or Harshit Rana likely stepping in.

Despite struggles in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, their ODI brilliance remains a critical factor for India's campaign success.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-rohit-sharma-virat-kohli-test-form-wont-impact-champions-trophy-shane-watson-2658570-2025-01-02,"Former Australian cricketer Shane Watson has expressed confidence in Indian stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, stating that their recent struggles in Test cricket should not affect their performances in the upcoming Champions Trophy. Despite facing criticism during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Watson believes that both players' exceptional records in the ODI format make them pivotal for India’s success in the tournament. As the Champions Trophy approaches, Watson highlighted the difference between the challenges of Test and ODI cricket. He reiterated Kohli and Rohit’s stellar form in the 2023 ODI World Cup, where they played crucial roles for India, underlines their dominance in the shorter format.  Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage ""I don't think it (current poor form) will really play a part at all with Rohit Sharma and Virat's impact in one-day cricket. It's going to be different conditions where they're playing in Dubai. One-day cricket does really free them both as well,” said Watson. ""Kohli is an absolute master of one-day cricket...Yes, he's a master of all formats, but especially ODIs. You see his extraordinary numbers over a long period of time, averaging around 57 and a strike rate of 93 over a long period of time. It's crazy to think the control that he has over his innings...We'll see that again in the Champions Trophy. Rohit, like we saw in the one-day World Cup (2023), when he was at his very best, he was taking on the game,"" Watson added. Rohit and Kohli have faced a tough time with the bat in recent Test outings. Rohit has managed just 164 runs across 15 innings in three series, averaging a modest 10.93, with only one half-century. On the current tour of Australia, his performance has been similarly underwhelming, contributing 31 runs with only a single double-digit score. Kohli, despite a promising century in Perth, struggled for consistency in subsequent innings, registering scores of 7, 11, 3, 36, and 5. This patch of poor form has raised concerns amongst fans and experts alike. ""It's more difficult to be able to do that in Test cricket. He hasn't been able to find that balance here in Australia. But when he goes out for the batting in one-days, he lets loose. That’s when we see the very best of Rohit Sharma,"" Watson said. ""So I'd be very surprised if he doesn't perform really well in the Champions Trophy, knowing that he probably doesn't have a lot of time left, whatever that is, but a lot of time left in international cricket. So I'm sure he'll let the handbrake off,” he added. When asked about Rohit’s place in the final Test against Australia, starting January 3 in Sydney, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir declined to confirm his inclusion. He stated that the final XI would only be determined after assessing the pitch, further fueling speculation about Rohit’s future in the Test setup. Despite these uncertainties, the focus remains on the Champions Trophy, where both Kohli and Rohit are expected to lead India’s charge. Their experience and track records in high-pressure ODI tournaments make them invaluable assets. As the team shifts its focus from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to the Champions Trophy, India will look to their star players to rediscover their rhythm and deliver when it matters most.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  Just reports, not truth: Coach Gautam Gambhir on leaks from Indian dressing room

Cummins also put to rest the speculation surrounding Mitchell Starc's fitness, saying he will play the game. India rarely reveal their playing XI ahead of a test, but Gautam Gambhir's reluctance to confirm Rohit Sharma's inclusion raised eyebrows. Isn't the captain an automatic choice? Doesn't he decide who plays, not the other way around? The new year has started with plenty of intrigue for Indian cricket. Gambhir's vague response only added to the suspense. Shubman Gill, who had made way for Rohit earlier, was seen batting early in the nets, while Dhruv Jurel, not typically part of the first XI training group, stayed the longest. Could there be signs of a shakeup in the lineup? Is Rohit on the way out? Meanwhile, Akash Deep's unavailability due to a stiff back means India must revamp their bowling attack, with Prasidh Krishna or Harshit Rana likely stepping in. Australia XI for the fifth Test: Sam Konstas, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Travis Head, Beau Webster, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland India Predicted Playing XI for 5th Test: KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant/Dhruv Jurel, Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Prasidh Krishna/Harshit Rana, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed SirajPublished By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  ICC Test Rankings: Jasprit Bumrah records highest-ever rating points by an Indian bowler

The couple confirmed it to the media organisation through their friend Magnus Barstad. Reportedly, the duo don’t wish to divulge information about the time or place of their wedding as they wish their special day to be quiet and peaceful. Reports suggested that the wedding would take place over the weekend after Carlsen shared his World Blitz Championship 2024 title with Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia. 26-year-old Malone has kept a low profile on social media, attending chess games and other events with the top-ranked player. As per Davide Nastasio, a former chess player from the United States, Malone has “an American father and a Norwegian mother, and has reportedly lived abroad several times, including while at school. She is from the western part of Oslo and went to the Uranienborg School in the Frogner area.”

It was also the eighth time that Carlsen bagged the blitz title. After seven fiercely contested games, reigning world blitz champion Magnus Carlsen made an unprecedented proposal to his opponent, Ian Nepomniachtchi: they should share the title. Without hesitation, Nepomniachtchi agreed, marking a historic moment on Wednesday.

 The decision came after three consecutive draws in the sudden-death stage. Carlsen had initially dominated the finals, winning the first two games and needing only a draw to claim victory. However, Nepomniachtchi showed extraordinary determination, achieving two must-win victories to level the score at 2-2 and force a sudden-death showdown. Despite intense efforts, the sudden-death games ended in three draws. Carlsen then suggested sharing the title, a proposal later ratified by FIDE.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  Magnus Carlsen dismisses match-fixing allegations, calls backstage chat a bad jokeMust Watch

Pacer Aakash Deep will miss the fifth Test due to injury. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-5th-test-sydney-rohit-sharma-not-feature-playing-xi-2658668-2025-01-02,"Captain Rohit Sharma is likely to be left out of the Indian playing XI for the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia in Sydney. Vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah is set to lead the team in the absence of the skipper, sources have told India Today.  Rohit, who has featured in 67 Tests for India, might not don the whites for the national team again. “The fourth Test in Melbourne may well have been Rohit’s last in Test cricket. Unless the BCCI intervenes and requests him to play one final time, the decision is unlikely to change,” the source said. Shubman Gill is set to replace Rohit in the XI and will bat at No. 3. KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal are expected to take up the opening slots for the series finale. Rohit Sharma made only a cameo appearance in India's final training session ahead of the Test match in Sydney. On the eve of the big game, Rohit was seen more talking to the coaches, including head coach Gautam Gambhir, and Bumrah. He did not train at the nets with the first batch of his teammates, which included Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, and Yashasvi Jaiswal. He was absent from the slip cordon during a caching practice session. Also Read: Don't take things for granted | Details of Gambhir's fiery dressing room speech However, Rohit arrived last to the nets and batted for only 10-odd minutes. He was then spotted having another chat with Gambhir and Bumrah at one of the stands at the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground.  The development comes after coach Gambhir refused to confirm Rohit's place in the XI while addressing the press on the eve of the Test match. Contrary to tradition, the coach, and not the captain, addressed the media on Thursday at the SCG.  ""Everything is fine with Rohit. I don't think it's a tradition. The head coach is here. That should be fine, that should be good enough. I am going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow,"" Gambhir said. When asked if Rohit would feature in Team India's plans, Gambhir reiterated: ""As I just said, we are going to have a look at the wicket and announce the playing XI tomorrow."" When pressed further, Gambhir firmly added: ""The answer is the same.""SHUBMAN GILL SET TO RETURN Shubman Gill, who was dropped for the fourth Test, is set to return to the XI and take his No. 3 spot.  Meanwhile, India will be without fast bowler Akash Deep for the fifth and final Test. The Bengal pacer was ruled out with a back injury. Either Prasidh Krishna or Harshit Rana will replace Akash.  Notably, Harshit played the first two Tests in Perth and Adelaide before he was dropped for Akash. Prasidh last played a Test in South Africa in January last year. India will look to put behind the stormy lead up and win the series finale in Sydney. If the series ends in a 2-2 draw, India will walk away with the Border-Gavaskar Trophy as they are the current holders of the coveted silverware.

Last year in March, Djokovic and Ivanisevic parted ways after their five-year association. With Ivanisevic as his coach, the Serb bagged nine out of his 24 Grand Slam men’s singles title. Since his departure, Djokovic hasn’t won a major. Ivanisevic is the only singles player to win the Wimbledon title as a wildcard entrant when he achieved the landmark in 2001. Back in July 1994, Ivanisevic achieved his career-best ranking of No.2. Shastri heaped praise on the former Croatian player as a ‘champion’ and a ‘terrific personality’. Captioning the picture, Shastri wrote, “Great to catch up with a champion tennis player. A Grand Slam winner and a terrific personality that the sport always needs. God bless.”

Had Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah not avoided the follow-on in Brisbane, it could well have been curtains for India in the series and World Test Championship even with the rain-gods helping them. After losing the MCG Test by 184 runs, India also missed the chance of making a hat-trick of Test series wins in Australia. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage Before the New Year’s Test, starting Friday, January 3 at the Sydney Cricket Ground, chaos has unfolded big time. More than the on-field saga, it’s the off-field developments that seemed to have pushed India in a rabbit hole, a muddle from which they do not have enough time to recover. For the uninitiated, anything but a win would kick India out of the race for a berth in the final of the WTC.Dressing room drama  As if the losses in Adelaide and Melbourne were not enough, India were grappled with reports emerging that head coach Gautam Gambhir gave the Indian cricketers a mouthful inside the dressing room, slamming them for putting personal goals over the needs of the team. A report in The Indian Express detailed how Gambhir lashed out over the approach of players. Reports said that in Rohit’s absence, some of the players openly eyed the captain’s spot, claiming that India needed to pull off something spectacular on the tour. One of the senior members reportedly portrayed himself as ‘Mr Fix-It’, saying that the younger members of the team aren’t equipped enough to lead the team. Moreover, decisions were reportedly not made unanimously. The reports did not go down well with former cricketers Irfan Pathan and Shreevats Goswami. Pathan, India’s hero in the 72-run victory in the 2007 Perth Test, said that information inside the dressing room is sacred and isn’t something to be let out in the media. Goswami, a part of India’s 2007 Under-19 World Cup-winning squad, said that it’s “just not on”. Gambhir dismissed the reports of any tension, but said that he needed to be “honest” with the players, which he believed was necessary for the betterment of the team.  ""Those are just reports. That's not the truth. I don't think I need to answer any reports. There were some honest words, which is what I can say. Honesty is very important. Honesty is extremely important if you want to go and achieve great things,"" Gambhir said in the press conference before the Sydney Test. After the Gabba Test match, Ravi Ashwin, the owner of 537 Test wickets, also announced his retirement from international cricket midway through the tour. Ashwin’s sudden retirement had also led to speculations of tensions inside the dressing room.End of Rohit Sharma?  On the eve of the New Year’s Test, a bombshell was dropped after India Today reported that Rohit could well miss out on playing the SCG Test. It could well mark the end of his career in the purest format since marking his Test debut with a century against the West Indies back in 2011 at the iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata. For now, Rohit might have fallen far too deep for him to revive his Test career. Needless to say that Rohit Sharma has been under immense pressure over the last couple of months. He was severely criticised after India’s loss to the Black Caps. He has had the chance of making amends in Australia, but instead he has kept going down the barrel. Both as captain and a batter, the Indian captain is under the pump to prove a point as time is running out for him.  Since the 2–0 series win over Najmul Shanto’s Bangladesh, Rohit has not won a Test out of six games, losing five of them. In the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the 37-year-old has averaged a ridiculous 6.20, failing to go past single digits in four out of five innings. It seems that the quicksand of pressure is slowly, but surely sucking Rohit’s career to its death.Golden chance for Bumrah  Even as Rohit’s fate in his Test career hangs by a thread, the indispensable Jasprit Bumrah is likely to enter a new dawn. Bumrah could take charge of the Indian team if Rohit doesn’t feature in the SCG Test. Bumrah has been one of the few bright spots for India along with Nitish Reddy and Yashasvi Jaiswal in an otherwise indifferent campaign for the visiting team. With 30 wickets from four Tests, Bumrah hasn’t done his reputation any harm. Throughout the first four Tests, the speedster has taken down multiple records and is on the verge of a few at the SCG. Very few would have predicted India’s colossal win in Perth given their hammering at the hands of the Kiwis and Australia’s record at the venue. But Bumrah led from the front, won the Player of the Match award, and powered India through to a 1-0 lead. From what was a fairytale start in Perth, the Australia tour has turned out to be a nightmare. Australia have been relentless with Pat Cummins showing why he is one of the very best leaders in world cricket. If he leads, Bumrah has the chance to finish the series in the exact way he started it in Perth. Bumrah could well help retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy which is in India since 2017. But the task would not be easy as India have won only a solitary Test at the SCG back in 1978 out of the 13 Test they have played at the venue.Pitch Report  SCG pitch curator Adam Lewis provided an update on preparations for the New Year’s Test, revealing that the pitch covers were removed for the first time on Wednesday, and 7mm of grass was trimmed. He also shared that the pitch would be subjected to heavy rolling ahead of the fifth Test. Lewis noted the current hot weather in Sydney, which could cause cracks in the pitch to widen, potentially favouring spinners as the match progresses. Historically, Sydney has been a batting-friendly venue, making batting first an appealing option for the toss-winning captain. Regarding weather conditions, light showers are expected on Days 1 to 4, with heavier rain (over 50% likelihood) predicted for Day 5.

Ahead of the much-awaited finale of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the Indian cricket team has been rocked by off-field controversy. While the dressing room chaos has been ugly, it is not unprecedented.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-dressing-room-leaks-persistent-issue-rohit-sharma-sydney-test-gambhir-2658790-2025-01-02,"What happens in the dressing room stays in the dressing room, they say -- unless, of course, you’ve sold the rights to behind-the-scenes footage to platforms like Netflix or Prime Video. Access to the raw emotions of professional sportsmen in the changing rooms has become a compelling viewing experience for fans in recent years. Prominent football clubs such as Manchester City and Formula One teams have opened their backstage doors. Even the Australian men’s cricket team has released two seasons of The Test, offering unfiltered glimpses into their highs and lows. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Indian cricket, however, has yet to commercialise such behind-the-scenes access. Dressing room sanctity, at least outwardly, is held as sacred. The changing room is viewed as a safe haven, far removed from the hundreds of cameras scrutinising every emotion and mistake on the field. It’s where even the toughest players can afford to be vulnerable. Yet, leaks from the dressing room are not new in the world of sport, and Indian cricket is no exception. Since the country’s first-ever Test match, dressing room leaks have been an enduring issue. When India won the T20 World Cup six months ago, and when Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli embraced atop a bus during the victory parade in Mumbai, everything seemed harmonious. Even after India’s heartbreaking loss in the ODI World Cup final at home in 2023, no reports of dressing room discord emerged. However, the situation unravelled in Australia. As the world welcomed the New Year, Indian cricket revisited old wounds, with private dressing room emotions and perceived insecurities of some team members being laid bare. A report in a leading daily claimed that coach Gautam Gambhir had delivered a strongly-worded address to the players after India’s 184-run defeat in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. The report highlighted disagreements over team selection, leaving pundits and former cricketers baffled. R Ashwin, known for his dedication to the team, retiring midway through the series may have foreshadowed the turmoil. The report also alleged that two players harboured captaincy ambitions and tried to assume the role of “Mr. Fixit” as Rohit struggled tactically on the field. Rohit’s dismal form with the bat compounded matters. Notably, Jasprit Bumrah led India when Rohit missed the first Test in Perth due to paternity leave -- it remains the only Test India have won so far on this tour of Australia. “Australia is a beautiful country to travel but a tough country to tour,” coach Gautam Gambhir remarked during an address at the Prime Minister’s residence in Sydney. An Australian tour has always been a crucible for players and teams, and Gambhir’s words aptly captured the moment. In the era of social media wars, dressing room leaks can be perilous. Ever since news began trickling out of the Indian dressing room in Melbourne, fan groups online have erupted with vitriol.ANOTHER CAREER CRUMBLES IN AUSTRALIA? More crucially, exposing dressing room dynamics before a decisive Test could erode team morale. Even experienced players in an unhappy dressing room would struggle with confidence, while younger players on their first Australian tour might find the pressure unbearable. This unease could very well impact India’s performance in Sydney. Unless cooler heads prevail, India might begin the series finale with a psychological disadvantage. Twelve hours before the Test, sources told India Today that Rohit Sharma was likely to be excluded. While leaving Rohit out might have been a pragmatic choice considering his form and struggles as captain, the journey to this decision has once portrayed the power dynamics of Indian cricket in a poor light, once again. At the pre-match press conference on the eve of the Sydney Test, head coach Gambhir deflected questions about Rohit’s inclusion. Even when pressed by journalists, he remained tight-lipped.  “Everything is fine with Rohit. I don’t think it’s a tradition. The head coach is here. That should be fine, that should be good enough. I’m going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow,” Gambhir stated. When was the last time a captain’s selection hinged on pitch conditions?  Rohit’s brief cameo at Thursday’s training session only added intrigue. He skipped slip-catching drills, was the last to bat in the nets, and faced throwdowns for just ten minutes. Sources suggest Rohit may have played his final Test in Melbourne - another career potentially crushed by the intensity of playing on Australian soil.THIS IS NOT NEW  While the dressing room chaos has been ugly, it is not unprecedented. Stories of turmoil often emerge when team performances dip or egos collide. When India, under the leadership of Rohit and Gambhir, lost a Test series 0-3 at home to New Zealand in October-November, cracks started to emerge. They became more evident when India failed to extend their decade-long streak of Test series victories against Australia. Fans nostalgically projecting past generations of players as paragons of harmony might overlook history.  The infamous Sourav Ganguly-Greg Chappell saga remains one of Indian cricket’s darkest episodes. Chappell’s leaked email criticising Ganguly’s leadership exposed deep fissures, resulting in Ganguly’s removal as captain and polarising the cricketing community. What about the rumoured power struggle between Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar in the 1980s? The reported friction between Anil Kumble and Virat Kohli led to a significant upheaval in Indian cricket in 2017. Despite a stellar year as head coach, during which India achieved remarkable success across formats, Kumble stepped down citing an untenable relationship with Kohli. Reports suggested differences over team strategies and man-management styles, with Kumble's authoritative approach clashing with Kohli’s preferences. Kumble described the situation as ""untenable"" in his resignation, hinting that the captain's reservations influenced his decision. The episode highlighted the complex dynamics between players and coaches and how even the most successful partnerships can have underlying issues. When Gautam Gambhir was appointed head coach, he was seen as a saviour. Known for his no-nonsense approach and composure under pressure, he seemed ideal to steer Indian cricket through its transitional phase. “I think Indian cricket will always be in safe hands till the time honest people are sitting in the dressing room. Honesty is the most important thing for any transition. It’s not about phasing out senior players or getting the youngsters in. Ultimately, the only thing that can keep you in the dressing room is performance,” Gambhir asserted, downplaying the challenges of transition. However, it may not be as straightforward as Gambhir suggests. Hopefully, he won’t have to learn this lesson the hard way.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Tune InMust Watch

Gukesh is one of the four athletes, along with shooter Manu Bhaker, hockey player Harmanpreet Singh and Paralympian Praveen Kumar, to be honoured with the prestigious award on January 17 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. Back in December 2024, Gukesh became the youngest world champion after beating China’s Ding Liren in the final in Singapore. Gukesh broke the record of Garry Kasparov, who won the title as a 22-year-old back in 1985. The 18-year-old also became only the second Indian after the legendary Viswanathan Anand to bag the title. After being named for the Khel Ratna Award, Gukesh said that it had motivated him to keep putting in the hard yards. “I am extremely humbled and honoured to know that the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports announced the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award for me and for recognising my achievements,” Gukesh said in a statement.   ""I would like to thank the government of India, Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji and the Honourable Sports Minister for their recognition.” “This award will motivate me to work even harder and achieve more laurels for the country in 2025. This means a lot to me and my family and my team. Thank you so much,” Gukesh added. Gukesh and Ding headed into the final game of the match tied at 6.5 points each. The 14th game, in which Ding played with the white pieces, seemed destined for a draw until Ding made a crucial mistake on the 53rd move. Gukesh's strategy of maintaining pressure on Ding, who was a pawn down, ultimately paid off, leading to an unforced error from last year’s world champion in the closing stages. On Thursday, the Sports Ministry announced the list of athletes who will be given the Khel Ratna, Arjuna and Dhronacharya awards on January 17. While four will be conferred with the Khel Ratna award, 32 athletes will receive the Arjuna Award, and Dhronacharya Award for three coaches. A controversy had erupted over Manu Bhaker's omission from the list of nominees for the prestigious Khel Ratna Award.  However, Manu Bhaker addressed the controversy in a statement, clarifying that she was not concerned with awards and remained focused on winning more laurels for the country.

As chatter grows about Rohit’s form and a possible decision to step aside, Gavaskar emphasized that the team must stay focused on the immediate goal: winning the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, starting January 3, to level the series and keep their World Test Championship (WTC) Final hopes alive. The build-up to the SCG Test has been overshadowed by reports suggesting Rohit Sharma might miss the game, with Jasprit Bumrah likely to take over as captain. These rumours have been fuelled further by talk of Rohit’s potential retirement from Test cricket. Speaking exclusively to India Today, Gavaskar noted that such speculations often surface during challenging phases, but the Indian team is resilient and experienced enough to remain unaffected as they prepare for a must-win encounter. Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024: Full Coverage ""Every time the Indian team has not done well, these things about rifts and all come up. That is a common story. It's almost as if we people feel that the Indian team cannot lose. So if they lose, there has to be some reason other than cricketing. I don't think any of the players really give a thought to what has been written. They just want to focus on how to get better thean what they were in the previous Test,"" Gavaskar said. Rohit's likely absence from Sydney Test Speculation surrounding Rohit’s place in the XI intensified after his limited participation in India’s final training session. The skipper was seen engaging with head coach Gautam Gambhir and vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah but did not train alongside teammates like Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and Shubman Gill. Additionally, Rohit missed the slip-catching drills and opted out of net practice, fuelling further conjecture. Adding to the intrigue, Gambhir addressed the pre-match press conference instead of Rohit—a break from tradition where the captain typically speaks to the media before a Test. While Gambhir refused to confirm Rohit’s inclusion, his evasive responses only deepened the mystery surrounding the skipper’s availability. ""The captain addressed the media just two days ago, so maybe he felt that he didn't need to address the media again and the coach had not addressed the media at all. So maybe the coach had to come and say that nothing of that sort had happened, which again should tell you a thing or two about those reports,"" Gavaskar added. In Rohit’s potential absence, Bumrah is expected to lead the team, with Shubman Gill likely reclaiming his spot at No. 3 in the batting order. India will also miss the services of Bengal pacer Akash Deep, who has been ruled out due to a back injury. Either Prasidh Krishna or Harshit Rana is set to replace him in the playing XI. Despite the stormy build-up, India would be determined to finish strong in Sydney. A win would draw the series 2-2, allowing India to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy as the current holders. For now, Gavaskar’s words serve as a reminder that resilience and focus are paramount as India aims to rise above the off-field noise and deliver on the field.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  IND vs AUS: Can India win Sydney Test?

Trailing 1-2 in the series after a humbling Boxing Day Test defeat in Melbourne, the team faces a must-win scenario to level the series and keep their World Test Championship (WTC) Final hopes alive. However, the build-up to this critical encounter has been dominated by speculation about Rohit Sharma’s absence and Jasprit Bumrah potentially stepping in as captain. For Team India, this isn’t just about retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy—it’s about silencing critics and proving their resilience under intense scrutiny. Fans hope the team will channel the spirit of the 2021 SCG Test, a masterclass in grit and determination that cemented India’s place in cricketing folklore. Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024: Full CoverageRising Above Chaos: Lessons from 2021 The Sydney Test of 2021 remains a beacon of unyielding spirit. Ravichandran Ashwin, who announced his retirement from international cricket midway of the ongoing BGT, and Hanuma Vihari became heroes, battling injuries and an intimidating Australian bowling attack to secure a heroic draw in the 2021 SCG Test. Vihari, playing with a torn hamstring, and Ashwin, enduring severe back pain, survived 259 deliveries over more than 42 overs after joining forces in the 89th over of India's second innings to forge an unbroken partnership of 62 runs. Every ball they faced was a testament to their mental strength. Vihari's 23 not out off 161 balls and Ashwin's 39 not out off 128 balls were not just numbers on the scoreboard; they were a testament to their indomitable spirit. This defiance, alongside Rishabh Pant’s match-winning brilliance at Brisbane, sealed India’s 2-1 series triumph and became a symbol of resilience. This time, India’s challenge isn’t just on the field—it’s mental. Reports of head coach Gautam Gambhir reprimanding players in the dressing room for prioritising personal milestones over team goals, coupled with whispers of Rohit Sharma’s potential Test retirement, have created a stormy lead-up to the decider. Yet, this drama could serve as the perfect crucible for India to rediscover their 2021 mindset.Rohit’s Limited Presence Fuels Speculation Rohit Sharma’s limited involvement in India’s final training session has only added to the uncertainty. While senior players like Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill honed their skills in the nets, Rohit was seen engaging in discussions with Gambhir and Bumrah. His absence from slip-catching drills and the pre-match press conference—typically a captain’s duty—has further ripened speculation about his exclusion. Gambhir, addressing the media, refrained from confirming Rohit’s place in the XI, intensifying the guessing game. ""Everything is fine with Rohit. I don't think it's a tradition. The head coach is here. That should be fine, that should be good enough. I am going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow,"" Gambhir said on Rohit's availability for the SCG Test.  Adding to India’s challenges, pacer Akash Deep has been ruled out of the SCG Test due to a back injury. Either Prasidh Krishna or Harshit Rana will replace him in the playing XI. Harshit impressed in the opening two Tests, while Prasidh, last seen in a Test in January 2022, offers a fresh option.Turning Pressure into Performance As the first ball is bowled at the SCG, fans will expect a focused and determined Indian side, ready to put the distractions and speculation behind them. With Jasprit Bumrah likely at the helm, the team has the chance to deliver a disciplined and commanding performance. A strong showing in Sydney won’t just keep their WTC hopes alive but also reinforce their reputation as a team that can respond to adversity with resolve and professionalism.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 2, 2025

A few minutes later, Rohit Sharma also joined the duo in the middle but there was hardly any communication between the head coach and the designated captain. Then Gambhir showed up at the pre-match press conference (usually the captain attends it) and chose not to confirm Rohit's place in the playing eleven for the fifth and final Test. “We will look at the pitch and decide,” Gambhir said when asked about Rohit's place in the team. In the media interaction, Gambhir also spoke about “honesty” and “performance being only criteria to be in Indian dressing room” and soon after that, he was seen engaged in a conversation with Bumrah while the rest of his teammates were warming up with a round of foot volley. All present at the SCG witnessed a complete communication breakdown between skipper and the head coach. There were already enough indications but the developments on Thursday made one thing as clear as daylight. Rohit Sharma is no longer in coach Gautam Gambhir’s scheme of things after scoring just one second innings half-century in the eight Tests that he has played this season. It is learnt that an influential cricket administrator, who commands a lot of respect in the BCCI, has had a word with the head coach to explore if the skipper can be allowed to play the Sydney game and bow out from the Test arena. However, the head coach's priority is to ensure India wins in Sydney and remains in hunt for a place in the WTC final.  

Such is the state of affairs that Rohit was more comfortable speaking to his deputy Bumrah and chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar than Gambhir. After a game of foot volley in which Rohit and Rishabh Pant were on one side and Virat Kohli on the other, suddenly the penny dropped with a different looking slip cordon. While Pant was behind the stumps for the slip catching session, the formation behind the batter had Virat Kohli at first slip, KL Rahul at second, Nitish Kumar Reddy at third with Yashasvi Jaiswal manning the gully. There were no signs of Rohit yet as one headed to the net practice area outside the main stadium. Ravindra Jadeja was the first one in the nets to receive throwdowns but then Kohli entered followed by Jaiswal and KL Rahul. When Shubman Gill joined the fourth net, the batting sequence of the top-order became somewhat clear. All this while, Rohit and Bumrah were in the dressing room. The one who looked the most edgy was Kohli, who was in fact bowled twice during the session – once by Nitish Reddy and other time by Washington Sundar. In one of the throwdown nets, Pant was facing Dayanand Garani.    Once Pant finished his nets, rather than walking back to the dressing room, he walked towards the small wooden gallery where a middle-aged couple were sitting. They happened to be Gill’s parents, the only ones allowed in the gallery area. After nearly 35 minutes, Rohit quietly walked into the net arena and without his kit. While Gambhir stood at the farthest net, talking to Bumrah, Rohit was at the other end conversing with video analyst Hari Prasad. They stood in their respective places and there was not even minimal interaction between the two. After the top-order had almost finished their session, Rohit entered the nets. It was just like MCG where he had come to bat after all recognised batters had finished their stint even though he was set to open the innings. How did Rohit look during his 30-odd minutes of practice? To be honest, he looked a shadow of his old self. He was bowled after missing the line of T Dilip’s throwdown. His reaction to deliveries were late.

The most interesting aspect was when Rohit was batting, at the adjacent nets, it was Reddy who was looking in fine touch as he middled most deliveries. The head coach was standing at the umpire’s position in the youngster’s nets as the captain went about his routines. Once Rohit was done with his training, he along with Bumrah and Agarkar left the nets but Gambhir stayed back. It is learnt that during this meeting after training it was decided that Rohit Sharma would be “rested”, which in Indian cricket parlance means “dropped by intimation”. Nearly 45 minutes to an hour later when the team dispersed, most players came out of the exit door leading to the net area before heading towards the team bus. Rohit didn’t come out with the team and boarded the bus after coming out from the other gate. As the Indian team were leaving, the SCG operations team was practising its pre-match drill. “The Indian team led by captain Rohit Sharma,” blared the SCG loudspeaker. It sounded different.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 2, 2025Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Sydney Spirit of 2021 is what wounded India needs for series finale

Jasprit Bumrah, who led India to the historic 295-run win in the opening Test match of the series in Perth Stadium, has returned as captain. The decision comes after Rohit Sharma's disastrous campaign in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he has scored only 31 runs from three matches. Pressure was also building on Rohit, who had lost five out of his last six Tests as captain. Last year, under his leadership, India’s 12-year streak of not losing a Test series at home also ended when New Zealand beat them 3-0. In Rohit’s place, India have picked Shubman Gill at SCG as they look to win the Sydney Test and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25: Full Coverage A report from the Indian Express on January 1, 2025, suggested that there was an internal struggle within the Indian team. The report spoke about how coach Gautam Gambhir spoke sternly to certain individuals about their form in the ongoing series. The report further claimed that one player saw himself as 'Mr. Fix-It' and was willing to become the interim captain of the Indian Test team. Gautam Gambhir's pre-match press conference on Thursday further fuelled the reports of the rift. The head coach of the men’s team, evaded the question of Rohit’s inclusion in the team for the SCG Test. When asked if Rohit would feature in Team India's plans, Gambhir said, “As I just said, we are going to have a look at the wicket and announce the playing XI tomorrow,” When pressed further, Gambhir firmly added: ""The answer is the same."" On December 2, sources confirmed to India Today that Rohit was likely to be left out of the Indian playing XI. “The fourth Test in Melbourne may well have been Rohit’s last in Test cricket. Unless the BCCI intervenes and requests him to play one final time, the decision is unlikely to change,” the source said. Under Rohit Sharma's captaincy, India have won 12 Tests, lost nine, while three matches ended in draws. In 67 Tests since his debut back in 2011 against the West Indies at the Eden Gardens, Rohit has scored 4301 runs with 12 centuries and a top score of 212.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Tune InAlso Read |  AUS vs IND: Can India rise above chaos and taste rare success in Sydney Test?Must Watch

Shastri, who presented the toss for the broadcaster, spoke to stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah. Bumrah told Shastri that Rohit was an unselfish captain and had opted to rest himself so that India could field their best line-up for the SCG Test. IND vs AUS, 5th Test: Full Scorecard Shastri was asked about his thoughts while commentating during the match. The former India head coach said that it was a bold call for the captain to own up and say 'I am prepared to take the bench'. ""That's what Jasprit said at the toss before I could even ask him. He said the captain opted to sit out and said the team would be stronger if Shubman Gill plays. It can happen when you're out of sorts, you're mentally not there, you don't have the runs under your belt. It still is a brave call for a captain to own up and say, you know, I'm prepared to take the bench in this game,"" Ravi Shastri said. Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25: Full Coverage Incidentally, Sharma did not even make it to the 16-member squad for the Sydney Test but was seen sitting at the Indian dressing room. Shastri further spoke on the matter and said that with no home season in sight. Sharma might pull the plug on his Test career and retire from the format. ""If there was a home season coming up, he might have thought of carrying on, but I think he might just pull the plug at the end of this Test. He's not getting younger, he's 38 years of age. It's not that India don't have youngsters, there are some very, very good players in the wings, and it's time to build. It's a tough decision, but there's a time for everything,"" Ravi Shastri said.

""So typical of Rohit Sharma. Doing the right thing, doing what’s right for the team. But could not understand the ‘cloak & dagger’ around the issue. Wasn’t even talked about at the toss,"" Sanjay Manjrekar said. India made two changes to their line-up on Friday, 3 January.

Taylor argued that Rohit Sharma was clearly dropped from the playing XI for his poor form with the bat and India should call a spade - a spade. ""To be honest, that's, what do I call that. That's once again, sidestepping the point. The bottom line is the captain of a country does not opt out for the final Test match, the final deciding Test match of a series.

""Yes, I think, because this is such an important Test match they don't want any anything to distract them. Sharma, obviously he's the captain and he's he is selector to selector.

The decision came after Australia claimed a catch off the very first delivery Kohli faced on Day 1 of this highly anticipated series decider. However, the verdict was overturned after the matter was referred to the third umpire.  The incident began when Scott Boland delivered a ball in the good length area, generating extra bounce that unsettled Kohli. The Indian batter, unable to withdraw from the line of the delivery, edged the ball thickly. The ball appeared to carry towards second slip, where Steve Smith was stationed.

The Australian slip cordon erupted in appeal, with Smith visibly thrilled. However, the on-field umpires referred the decision to the third umpire for verification. HOW THIRD UMPIRE JOEL WILSON MADE THE CALL Joel Wilson, the third umpire, who has faced criticism for contentious decisions against Australia in the past, examined the replays. Initially, he appeared convinced that Smith had his fingers under the ball, but after reviewing multiple angles, he revised his conclusion.   Wilson’s final decision of not out was met with cheers from Indian fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground.   ""I can see the fingers under the ball. Can you provide another angle to check if it touched the ground?"" Wilson was heard saying via the broadcast microphone.   After further examination, he added:  ""I see the ball rolling on the ground. Do you have any other angle?  ""Spotted. It’s rolling. I have that ball touching the ground. ""He has his fingers under it, but it’s rolled onto the ground. ""It’s touching the ground. I have a decision for the big screen.""

Former Australia coach Justin Langer said he believed the right decision wasn't made in that instance.  ""From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did,"" Langer told 7Cricket.  ""He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that’s out."" For Virat Kohli, the reprieve came as a much-needed stroke of luck. The former Indian captain, aside from his century in Perth, had struggled throughout the series, scoring only 62 runs in the previous three Tests, including three single-digit scores.

Speaking during the Lunch break of the 5th Test match, Gavaskar tried to make sense of Rohit Sharma's decision to 'rest' himself from the final Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25. Gavaskar felt that India were unlikely to reach the final of the World Test Championship and that the team will move on from Rohit Sharma since there are no home Tests scheduled for the next few months. The former player said that the selection committee will look for a batter who can remain active till 2027 - till the end of the third World Test Championship cycle. ""Well, I think what it probably means is that India don't qualify for the World Test Championship final. To me, it looks that the Melbourne Test would be Rohit Sharma's last game. The new cycle of the World Test Championship will start from the England series, so they will look to have somebody who will be available for 2027 final. Whether India gets to the final or not is another matter, but I think that's what the selection committee will do. Therefore maybe we've probably seen Rohit Sharma for the last time in Test cricket,"" Sunil Gavaskar said on Star Sports. Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25: Full Coverage Gavaskar argued that chairman of the selection committee Ajit Agarkar certainly had a role to play in the decision behind resting Rohit Sharma for the final Test match of the series. India were 1-2 down ahead of the Sydney Test. They need to win the final Test match of the series to remain in contention of the World Test Championship Final. ""At the end of the day he's also part of the selection committee. What happens in Indian cricket is there is a selection committee which chooses the squad to go to travel overseas. Then when you come overseas, the captain, the coach, and I think if there's one selector, they generally form the selection committee. I believe the chairman of the selection committee, Ajit Agarar here in town, so he would have been part of the call that was taken. Maybe some of the senior players in the team would have been asked,"" Gavaskar added. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri also echoed the sentiments of Gavaskar and said that Rohit would have carried on if there was a home Test season after Australia. ""If there was a home season coming up, he might have thought of carrying on, but I think he might just pull the plug at the end of this Test. He's not getting younger, he's 38 years of age.

IND vs AUS, 5th Test: Full Scorecard Walking out at 17/2, Kohli edged a delivery from Scott Boland towards Smith at second slip, with Smith diving low to his right. With the red Kookaburra wedged between his thumb and index finger, Smith appeared to scoop the ball in the direction of Marnus Labuschagne, who caught it. However, Kohli stood his ground. Upon reviewing the play, third umpire Joel Wilson determined that the ball in Smith's hand had made contact with the ground during the catching process, thereby failing to meet the conditions of a fair catch as per MCC Law 33. The limitations of various replay angles led to a decision that sparked debate within the cricket community. Speaking on Channel 7, former ICC umpire Simon Taufel commented that ""he could certainly understand what the third umpire's done there."" ""I think you described it very well when you said that depending upon which side of the fence you sit on, you could probably build a case for either decision to be given,"" Taufel said. ""Listening to Joel Wilson's language, where he said the fingers were underneath the ball and then he saw it roll onto the ground, by his own language, he is telling us he believes the ball touched the ground. ""There are two key things the TV umpire looks for. One is whether the fingers are underneath the ball, and he was satisfied on that point. However, he also believes the replay shows the ball on the ground. Here's the challenge: slowing it down with slow-motion. At real speed, it looks fine. But I can certainly understand what the third umpire's done. He believes he's seen the ball on the ground and has called it as he sees it. ""Normally, ICC protocol for fair catches is to check if the fingers are under the ball. That’s sufficient to confirm a fair catch. But the issue here is that on-field umpires no longer provide a soft signal; the decision now lies solely with the television umpire."" Having survived the close call on his first ball, Kohli remained unbeaten on 12 off 48 deliveries at lunch on the opening day of the fifth Test in Sydney.

Konstas stunned Jasprit Bumrah-led Indian bowlers with his breathtaking strokeplay, showcasing ramps, reverse scoops, pulls, and powerful drives through the covers. The young teenage opener even took the attack to Bumrah, arguably the best bowler of his generation. IND vs AUS, 5th Test: Full Scorecard Konstas scored 14 runs off one of Bumrah’s overs and followed it up with an 18-run assault — two of Bumrah’s three most expensive overs in Test cricket. Konstas eventually finished with a score of 60 off 65 balls, studded with six fours and two sixes. ""I understood what his game plan was — what plan A was, anyway. So when plan B kicked in quite quickly, within a couple of overs, that was a little surprising. But one thing we’ve always talked about is trusting his gut,” Watson said during the ICC Champions Trophy tour at the SCG, as reported by ESPNcricinfo. Reflecting on his experience mentoring Konstas, Watson added: “My experience working with Sam has shown me a very quiet, reserved personality — a deep thinker and certainly not an extrovert. But what we saw in the Test match is that he’s a showman, rising to the occasion without being overawed. ""I know from my own debut experience that you put a lot of pressure on yourself because it’s your dream to represent your country and wear the baggy green. But for Sam, it’s almost superhuman how he seemed unaffected by that pressure. Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25: Full Coverage “You could see it wasn’t an act — that’s just who he is. And honestly, I hadn’t seen that side of him before. It just shows he’s built for the big stage, where most players take time to adjust. Sam thrives on it.” However, Konstas faced the harsh realities of Test cricket in the second innings, with Bumrah dismissing him for just 8 runs with a superb inswinger. Watson remains confident in Konstas’ abilities, highlighting his technical soundness and adaptability as key to succeeding in red-ball cricket. ""Now, it’s going to be a different challenge for him. He’s shown what his plan B is, and we already saw in that second innings that field positions were adjusted accordingly. This will be a good test of his evolution — how he can continue to take the game on against the world’s best bowlers. But he’s certainly got all the gears and the skills to make those adjustments quickly. ""He’s technically very correct and waits for loose balls. But he’s also got the ability to hit the ball down the ground. Of course, when the field is set with a fine third man and a fine leg, the ramp shot might be off the table. Then again, I didn’t think he’d play the ramp shot in the first couple of overs, and he did! Sam will trust his instincts, and that’s something truly special that sets him apart.”

Batting on the first day of the 5th Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Rishabh Pant took body blows from Australia fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. Pant was once hit on his arm and then on the helmet by Starc and was seen receiving treatment from the team's physio. Starc's bouncer in the 35th over of the game left a big impression on Rishabh Pant's arm and visuals showed that he had got a blood clot around that region. In a space of a few balls, Starc once again hit him on the helmet which once again saw a break in play.

The ball was struck so well that it got stuck in the sight screen and the ground staff had to get stairs to fetch the ball.

Batting on Day 1 of the final Test match of the series in Sydney, Kohli was caught in the slips in the 32nd over of the game. The senior India batter played 69 runs and scored only 17 runs. Kohli, in fact, was nearly dismissed in the very first ball of his innings, after he had managed to edge Scott Boland to Steve Smith. Kohli was lucky to survive after Smith seemingly grassed half the ball before floating it up for Marnus Labushchagne at gully. This was the 6th time that Kohli got out by edging the ball outside off stump. The Indian No.4 has been challenged in the corridor of uncertainty throughout the series, and has managed to edge the ball every time despite looking set. Kohli's exploits in series as as follows: 5, 100*, 7, 11, 3, 36, 5 and now 17. The only time Kohli did not edge the ball to the slips was when he remained unbeaten in the second innings of the opening innings at Perth. On other note, Virat Kohli's love-hate relationship with Australia continued after the batter was booed by the SCG crowd on Friday, January 3. Kohli got jeered by the crowd while entering the arena. The batter has been targetted by the crowd ever since bumping into Sam Konstas in the first innings of the Melbourne Test match. Kohli had rammed into the young Australia batter at the MCG when the youngster took on Jasprit Bumrah in the Boxing Day Test match.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-sunil-gavaskar-sydney-grass-pitch-5th-test-2659077-2025-01-03,"Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar referred to the unusually grassy pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground while adding how former Indian players have refrained from criticising the challenging surface despite its apparent difficulty. The SCG wicket proved treacherous for the visiting Indian team, which struggled to adapt to the green surface. India were precariously placed at 134 for seven in the final session of Day 1, with their batting lineup once again failing to deliver. IND vs AUS, 5th Test: Full Scorecard ""Oh, very much,"" Gavaskar responded when asked about the grass on the pitch. ""Justin Langer, who's played in Australia, has said he's never seen so much grass on a pitch. But what you would have noticed is that no former Indian player has complained or whined about it. If a pitch in India is bereft of grass and looks like it's going to turn, so many former players from different parts of the world criticize our pitches. But former Indian players rarely complain because we understand the importance of adapting to overseas conditions."" Openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal fell cheaply, with Shubman Gill, replacing the rested skipper Rohit Sharma, and Virat Kohli also dismissed before making substantial contributions. Amidst the collapse, Rishabh Pant stood tall, absorbing the brunt of Australia's relentless bowling attack. Pant endured a series of painful blows, including hits on the biceps, helmet, and abdomen, necessitating frequent visits from the team physio. Despite his discomfort, Pant showcased his characteristic grit and flair. A straight six off debutant Beau Webster and a cheeky cutoff Nathan Lyon highlighted his aggressive intent, even as he focused on survival. Pant's valiant knock, however, ended on 40 off 98 deliveries when Scott Boland's well-directed short-pitched delivery induced a mistimed shot. Pat Cummins completed the catch at short cover, ending a hard-fought 48-run partnership between Pant and Ravindra Jadeja, which had consumed 151 deliveries. Boland compounded India's woes by dismissing debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy for a golden duck the very next ball. Gavaskar, never one to mince words, was taken aback by the pitch's grass cover. Speaking on Star Sports, he noted, ""I haven’t seen so much grass on a Sydney pitch in the past. Probably, the grass cover is on the higher side compared to other pitches in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25. The batting is tough, and the visiting batters are not able to connect the bat with the ball."" In a lighter vein, he quipped, ""Cows would have grazed confidently on the pitch in Sydney."" The SCG wicket drew comparisons to some of the toughest pitches seen in recent cricket. Gavaskar praised Rishabh Pant for his bravery and adaptability, noting the stark difference between the challenges posed by this wicket and those from the previous Test. ""Rishabh Pant is putting his body on the line for India, and that's exactly what you need to do on a pitch like this, where tough questions will be asked. It’s easy to underestimate how challenging it is.

Kohli's struggles with deliveries outside the off-stump were once again laid bare during India's challenging first innings on Day 1 of the decisive fifth Test against Australia. Kohli, who has been under intense scrutiny throughout the series, fell for a modest 17 after facing a delivery from Scott Boland that exploited his well-known weakness.  IND vs AUS, 5th Test: Full Scorecard The ball, which nipped away slightly and pitched just outside off-stump, found Kohli pushing at it, who edged it into the hands of debutant Beau Webster at slip. This dismissal marked the 22nd time since 2021 that Kohli has been undone by pacers while attempting to play at deliveries outside his off-stump, a recurring flaw that has left him vulnerable to balls that move away. While this was just another instance in a long line of disappointments, the numbers surrounding Kohli's form have raised even more concern. Since 2024, Kohli's average in the first innings of Test matches has plummeted to just 7.00, one of the lowest amongst active players. This statistic is startling when considering that Kohli is widely regarded as one of India's greatest-ever batters. His ongoing slump has raised eyebrows, especially when compared to other players in the team. Kohli's first-innings average of 7.00 in Test cricket since 2024 is the second-lowest for any batter with a minimum of five innings in the same period. Even more alarming is the fact that India's fast-bowling spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, has posted a higher first-innings average—10.00. Bumrah, renowned for his bowling, now boasts a better batting record than the former captain, which speaks volumes about the depth of Kohli's struggles. To put this into perspective, here are the lowest averages in the first innings of Test matches since 2024 (minimum of 5 innings): 5.4 – Keshav Maharaj
7.0 – Virat Kohli
8.0 – Jasprit Bumrah

At the bottom of the list, Jasprit Bumrah has managed just 60 runs at 10.00, while Virat Kohli has only managed 35 runs at a concerning average of 7.00 in five innings.

Wilson made two debatable calls on Day 1 of the Test in Syndey. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-washington-sundar-catch-drs-joel-wilson-third-umpire-controveresy-2659112-2025-01-03,"The Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia has been marred by controversial umpiring calls, with players and pundits questioning the use of technology. On Day 1 of the fifth Test in Sydney, two contentious decisions involved third umpire Joel Wilson, who had already faced criticism for his on-field decisions in the Melbourne Test.  Earlier in the day, a debatable decision went in favour of Virat Kohli, but later, Joel Wilson adjudged Washington Sundar out caught behind following an Australian review of an on-field decision by umpire Saikat Sharfuddoula. Wilson took considerable time examining replays to determine whether Sundar had gloved the bouncer from Australia captain Pat Cummins.   In real-time replays, the dismissal looked questionable as Washington Sundar attempted to pull Cummins’ short delivery. However, the Snickometer, a technology used to detect edges, showed a spike when the ball was close to the gloves. One frame of the replay appeared to show no spike when the ball was nearest to the glove, but the subsequent frame captured a spike on the Snickometer.  AUS vs IND, 5th Test Day 1 Updates Umpire Joel Wilson required conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field umpire's decision, and he deemed the spike in the relevant frame sufficient. When the 'OUT' decision was displayed on the big screen, Washington Sundar appeared incredulous. The all-rounder tried to protest the call but was directed to leave the field. The Australian crowd began booing Sundar, who was dismissed for 14 runs. Former England captain Michael Vaughan expressed his shock at Joel Wilson's decision to give it out.

 



Screengrab from X
 Former India batter Robin Uthappa was more forthright, calling the decision ""crap"" as scrutiny of Wilson's judgement intensified.   ""I’m sorry, but that’s a crap decision! Sure, there was a spike, but from the side angle, there was a clear space between the ball and the glove. There is a lot of ambiguity with these kinds of decisions. The benefit must go to the batter,"" Uthappa said.   However, former umpire Simon Taufel, one of cricket's most respected voices, defended Wilson's call, explaining the reasoning behind it.   ""What Joel Wilson's looking for here is that spike up to one frame past the glove, and he's got that spike. There's nothing else out there, and the ball is underneath the glove. The third umpire is well and truly within his rights, according to the protocols, to determine that's conclusive evidence for ball on glove,"" Taufel said, as quoted by Channel 7.   Earlier in the day, questions were also raised about Joel Wilson's decision to give Virat Kohli not out following an Australian appeal for a catch in the slips. Kohli, who came in to bat after opener Yashasvi Jaiswal fell early, edged a delivery to second slip. Steve Smith dived to his right, getting his fingers under the ball but failed to hold on to the catch cleanly. Smith flicked the ball into the air, and it was eventually caught by Beau Webster.   Joel Wilson reviewed the replays and concluded that the ball had touched the ground when Smith attempted to lob it into the air—a decision that did not sit well with the likes of Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting. India were bowled out for 185 in their first innings as Scott Boland-led Australian pace attack were on fire, making full use of the greenish pitch in Sydney.

The fast bowler did not shy away from confrontation as tensions flared up during the final over on Friday. Bumrah and 19-year-old Sam Konstas were involved in an intense staring contest after the India captain objected to Australia’s time-wasting tactics. Sam Konstas and Jasprit Bumrah had to be separated by the on-field umpires after exchanging words in the middle. The incident occurred during the final over when Bumrah, eager to begin his run-up, noticed that Usman Khawaja was not ready to face the delivery. To Bumrah’s surprise, Sam Konstas, positioned at the non-striker's end, began chirping at the fast bowler. Bumrah did not take kindly to the behaviour and charged towards Konstas, warning him not to overstep the mark. Fired up by the altercation, Bumrah returned to his mark and delivered a searing ball, dismissing Usman Khawaja for just two runs in the third over. His celebration was emphatic as he turned around and roared directly at Sam Konstas, making his feelings clear. It was a crucial wicket for India at the close of the first day, reigniting their hopes of turning the tables on Australia on a pitch that has provided plenty of assistance to seam bowlers. Former India cricketer Irfan Pathan summed up the situation aptly, cautioning the Australians against provoking Bumrah. The Indian pacer has been a constant thorn in Australia’s side throughout the series, claiming 31 wickets so far. He had already gotten the better of Sam Konstas in the second innings of the Melbourne Test, where the 19-year-old made his debut.

After opting to bat first on a spicy Sydney Cricket Ground deck, India were bowled out for just 185 runs. Big names - Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, KL Rahul failed to put up resistance as Australia pacers rolled over the visitors by making use of the full 7mm of grass left on the pitch. The green-tinged wicket mixed with overcast conditions made it perfect conditions for the Australian quartet to dominate the India team, taking the upper hand in the final Test match of the series. Some semblance of balance was brought back into the encounter very late in the day when stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah not only added a crucial 37 runs with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj, but also fired up India with a terrific 2-over-spell in the final minutes on Friday. The Indian team returned to bowl only 3 overs late in the day, and perhaps gave an idea of how this Test match is going to pan out. Jasprit Bumrah bowled India's two of three overs and made Usman Khawaja skip and hop throughout his short spell. Bumrah, managed to hand India the breakthrough of Usman Khawaja in the last ball of Day 1 - something that the team desperately needed for a mental boost after a tough day. Like a typical fast bowler, Bumrah raged with his deliveries, and walked to the Australian openers, demanding accountability for their time-wasting tactics. Bumrah's anger rubbed on the Indian team, who celebrated Khawaja's wicket vociferously, letting Australia know that they were not out of the competition just yet. Bumrah's bowling perhaps provided India with the hope that 185 might just be enough, much like it was in Perth's first innings - the only game that India have won so far in this series. That however, does not take away the fact that the visitors reeled under pressure for the better part of the day in Sydney. IND vs AUS, 5th Test: Day 1 HighlightsIND vs AUS, SCG Test Day 1: As It Happened Drama began at the very start of the day, when Jasprit Bumrah walked out for the toss instead of Rohit Sharma. Bumrah explained that the selfless captain had rested himself so that India can form their best XI. Many did not buy into the logic and slammed the Indian management for not calling a spade a spade - that Rohit had been dropped due to poor form. If the captain's controversy was not enough, India were put on the backfoot at the toss itself after Jasprit Bumrah opted to bowl first on a greenish wicket at the SCG under overcast conditions. While India should not be blamed for opting to bat at the SCG, a track that is expected to break as the game goes on, but India could have taken the call based on more visual evidence than historical data. India chose to once again play 2 spinners on the track, that had 7mm of grass left on it. The result, as it turned out, was a horrible one for India - as they were bowled out for just 185 runs. India batters, already low on confidence, found it difficult to bat on in the seaming conditions and lost two wickets in the first 10 overs of the game (7.4 overs). Pegged back, India dropped anchor with Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill to bring up a steady partnership that lasted till the final over of the morning session. Sunil Gavaskar slammed the layering of grass at the SCG pitch - calling it excessive. He responded to Justin Langer's comments after the former Australia coach said that he had never seen this much grass on any SCG pitch in his entire career. ""Justin Langer, who's played in Australia, has said he's never seen so much grass on a pitch. But what you would have noticed is that no former Indian player has complained or whined about it. If a pitch in India is bereft of grass and looks like it's going to turn, so many former players from different parts of the world criticise our pitches. But former Indian players rarely complain because we understand the importance of adapting to overseas conditions,"" Sunil Gavaskar said on the broadcast. As if the grass was not enough, thunder struck when Shubman Gill's concentration went for a walk after a short exchange with Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne in the 25th over. As the Australia duo complained about Gill's time wasting, Shubman chirped back, reminding the batters that they take their own sweet time as well. The back and forth put a crack in Shubman's concentration and the batter hurled himself down the wicket against Nathan Lyon on the very next ball. Lyon, adept in changing in the length of the ball very late into his stride, dumped it a little short, and an advancing Gill, edged the ball into the hands of Steve Smith at first slip.

— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) January 3, 2025 This marked yet another failure for Gill, who now has failed to cross the score of 40 outside of Asia since 2022. Gill averages 17.93 in 15 innings outside of Asia since 2022, which only widens the batter's home vs away record in Test cricket.Kohli: Edged And Gone, Once Again Virat Kohli now has gotten out 6 times out of his 7 innings by edging the ball outside of off-stump. The only innings that he did not edge the ball to the slips and the keeper was during his gritty innings of 100* in Perth. On the day, Kohli was lucky not to be on a first ball duck. After coming out to bat in the 8th over of the first innings, Kohli edged Boland to Steve Smith. The former Australia skipper almost pulled off a stunning catch at the slips, but the decision was reversed by the third umpire. Joel Wilson, the third umpire, who has faced criticism for contentious decisions against Australia in the past, examined the replays. Initially, he appeared convinced that Smith had his fingers under the ball, but after reviewing multiple angles, he revised his conclusion. This was the 6th time that Kohli got out by edging the ball outside off stump. The Indian No.4 has been challenged in the corridor of uncertainty throughout the series, and has managed to edge the ball every time despite looking set. Kohli's exploits in the series are as follows: 5, 100*, 7, 11, 3, 36, 5 and now 17.Rishabh Pant Takes Body Blows for India After being berated by Rohit Sharma and Sunil Gavaskar for playing silly shots, Rishabh Pant came out with a grit that has not been seen before. Pant, known for his exuberant counter-attacking shot, dropped anchor in Sydney. Rishabh took multiple body blows, including one terrible hit on his right shoulder, that saw the physio rush out and apply ice-pack to the wicketkeeper-batter. Pant and Ravindra Jadeja played out 151 balls together, stabilising the Indian innings. However, Pant, at one point of time, had enough, and got on the counter-attacking train. Pant slammed debutant Beau Webster for a terrific six through the line, but was not able to hold onto that tempo. In the 57th over of the innings, Pant once again top edged a rising ball and handed a simple catch to short mid-wicket while trying to pull Scott Boland.Bumrah Resistance - With the Bat If it were not for the stand-in captain's rearguard action, India could have been bowled out for 150 runs. Jasprit Bumrah hit 22 runs off 17 balls, adding crucial runs in partnerships with the tail. Bumrah's contribution might not have frustrated Australia, but the bowling attack might have to rethink their strategies given they have time and again let the Indian tail wag after bowling out the top-order early. Bumrah hit three boundaries and crunched one to add to his batting repetoire since the third Test in Brisbane.Scott Boland's SCG If any pacer really enjoyed the SCG pitch, it was Scott Boland. After taking 6 wickets in Melbourne, which is much lower than his standards, Boland hit the ground running at the SCG. The pacer laid an early marker with 4 wickets in the first innings. The bit that was most impressive about Boland's bowling was that he did not give India batters even an inch. If it were not for the 3 consecutive boundaries that Bumrah hit of the pacer late in the Indian innings, Boland's figures could have read 20-8-19-4. That is ridiculous accuracy for a third pacer in any team in the world. Boland picked up the wickets of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant and Nitish Reddy to wreck the Indian batting line-up. The pacer's control on a seaming deck helped the Australia team not only take wickets, but keep the run flow in control as well, something that they were not able to in Perth and late in Brisbane when they needed to take out India's tail. On Friday, Boland finished with 20-8-31-4, helping Australia set the early marker on Friday. The team will now hope to press on and move the Test match in at a good pace, before rain hits Sydney on the final day of the series.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  Edged and gone, again: Virat Kohli booed at SCG, dismissed for 17Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-sydney-test-bumrah-konstas-heated-khawaja-out-day-1-2659135-2025-01-03,"Stand-in India captain Jasprit Bumrah was part of an intense drama at the end of Day 1 in the Sydney Test, dismissing Usman Khawaja with the final ball and capping it off with an icy stare-down aimed at 19-year-old Australian opener Sam Konstas. The temperature at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) soared as Bumrah and Konstas were involved in a heated argument just before the close of play. The confrontation proved costly for Australia, as only two balls later, a fired-up Bumrah removed Khawaja for 3 in the final over of the day.
 The drama unfolded when Australian opener Usman Khawaja delayed Bumrah's delivery, signalling that he wasn't ready to take strike just as Bumrah began his run-up. Adding fuel to the fire, Konstas intervened, gesturing at Bumrah to stop. ""What's the problem?"" Bumrah was heard asking as the two approached each other in a tense exchange. The on-field umpire quickly stepped in to diffuse the situation and separate the players.

 Moments later, Bumrah struck with a full-length ball that induced an outside edge from Khawaja, neatly taken by KL Rahul in the slips. Instead of celebrating the wicket, Bumrah turned toward Konstas, delivering a piercing death stare that added another layer of intensity to an already dramatic SCG showdown.  Even Virat Kohli and the Indian team joined in celebrating the wicket in front of Konstas, further heightening the tension. The Australian opener, unshaken, walked off amid the Indian team's cheers and roars.

— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) January 3, 2025 Earlier, India dropped skipper Rohit Sharma, but their batting struggles continued as they were bowled out for 185 on the opening day of the fifth and final Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday. Paceman Scott Boland starred with figures of 4 for 31 as Australia's bowlers thrived in seam-friendly conditions, restricting India's scoring and regularly taking wickets to the delight of a sellout crowd of 48,000. The only consolation for India—and a reason for the home fans to temper their celebrations—was the prospect of Jasprit Bumrah, the series' standout bowler and Rohit's replacement as captain, exploiting the same surface. Bumrah gave a glimpse of his threat by dismissing Usman Khawaja for two with the final ball of the three overs India managed to bowl before the stumps. Teenager Sam Konstas, unbeaten on seven, guided Australia to the close at 9 for 1. Australia, leading the series 2-1, are just a win away from reclaiming the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and securing a place in the World Test Championship final against South Africa. Boland triggered the collapse of India's innings early in the final session. He dismissed Rishabh Pant, who miscued a pull shot to mid-on for 40, and followed it up by removing Melbourne centurion Nitish Kumar Reddy with consecutive deliveries. Washington Sundar survived the hat-trick ball but fell soon after for 14, as a TV review detected a faint glove on a Pat Cummins delivery. Ravindra Jadeja was trapped plumb in front by Mitchell Starc (3 for 49) for 26, leaving India teetering at 134 for 7. Bumrah chipped in with a spirited 22 off 17 balls, but he was eventually caught at mid-wicket off Cummins to end the innings. Virat Kohli, like Rohit, looked out of sorts. He managed just 17 runs from 69 balls before becoming Boland's second victim, edging a delivery outside off stump that was brilliantly caught by Webster in the slips. Despite the grim start, India can still retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a victory, though they appear to be on the back foot after Bumrah’s decision to bat first backfired.

Then, Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj, along with his senior and current Indian skipper Jasprit Bumrah, faced racial slurs. Siraj was allegedly referred to as a ""brown monkey,"" prompting an immediate complaint by the Indian team management to match referee David Boon. On-field umpires Paul Reiffel and Paul Wilson intervened after the issue was raised by then-captain Ajinkya Rahane, leading to the ejection of six spectators and an apology from Cricket Australia.An ever-involved Australian crowd While the Australian crowd is often celebrated for their vocal and passionate involvement in matches, the recurrence of such incidents highlights an ongoing issue in the sport. This series has already seen several tense moments. During the Adelaide Test, Mohammed Siraj faced taunts from the stands following a verbal spat with Australian batter Travis Head. At the MCG Test, 19-year-old Sam Konstas animatedly stirred the home crowd after dismissing India’s star batter Virat Kohli, showcasing how spectators remain an influential element in the series' narrative.A dramatic start to the SCG Test The SCG Test began dramatically, with Rohit Sharma opting to sit out the match amid growing speculation about his exclusion, paving the way for vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah to lead the side. India’s batting woes, however, persisted as they collapsed for a mere 185 runs. The ever-reliable Bumrah struck back, dismissing Australia opener Usman Khawaja with a fiery delivery and celebrating with an intense stare-down against Sam Konstas. This volatile combination of crowd antics and on-field intensity has set the stage for a gripping Test match. As the teams battle for the BGT Trophy and a chance to seal their place in the World Test Championship Final, cricket must also contend with its ongoing fight against racism—a shadow that continues to taint the gentleman’s game.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  India didn't celebrate Perth win together despite coach offering credit card: Report

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-celebrations-perth-win-india-credit-card-coach-2659230-2025-01-03,"Rumours of a rift in the Indian dressing room during the tour of Australia are growing louder. Captain Rohit Sharma’s decision to 'drop' himself for the fifth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, following a tumultuous build-up marked by dressing room leaks, has shifted attention away from the on-field action. Reportedly, signs of discord were evident from the start of the two-month tour. Speaking to Channel 7, journalist Bharat Sundaresan revealed that he had heard about unease in the Indian dressing room as early as after the first Test, which India won in Perth. After a commanding 295-run victory under Jasprit Bumrah’s captaincy in the series opener, the Indian team reportedly chose not to celebrate the historic win together. Sundaresan shared that a senior member of the coaching staff had offered his credit card to encourage the team to celebrate the victory as a group. However, the players opted to spend time with their families and close acquaintances instead of gathering for drinks together. ""After the Perth win, such a significant win in the history of Indian cricket, the fact that they didn’t celebrate that as a team and went their own ways didn’t tell me it was a broken dressing room. But it was a dressing room where there are different blokes, generationally and otherwise, who are just doing their own things,"" he said. ""This, I am told, is despite one of the senior support staff members saying, 'Here, I will put in my credit card, let’s all order some drinks, stick together.' But that was not meant to be. I thought a win like that would bring things together and energise this as one collective. As we’ve seen, as the series has gone on, it took that one bad loss in Melbourne—where it was one bad session, and they lost a Test match they fought hard in—for those simmering uncertainties, not really tensions, to surface and become public,"" he added.

Sidhu said.Mixed Reactions and Rising Pressure Rohit had faced mounting criticism after losing five of his last six Tests as captain. Adding to the scrutiny was India's 3-0 series loss at home to New Zealand last year, marking the end of a 12-year undefeated streak on home soil. His absence from the SCG XI meant India relied on a reshuffled batting lineup, with Shubman Gill stepping in. Despite the controversies, stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah supported Rohit during the toss, referring to him as ""our captain"" and praising his unselfishness. Bumrah highlighted that Rohit’s decision to step aside was in the team's interest, aiming to shift focus from individual form to collective goals.A Familiar Struggle for India However, India's batting woes continued as they were bowled out for just 185 on Day 1, succumbing to Australia’s relentless seam attack. Standout performances were absent, with Virat Kohli managing only 17 runs off 69 balls before falling prey to his persistent issue of edging well-outside off-stump deliveries. At stumps, Australia stood at 9 for 1 after Bumrah struck early to dismiss the struggling Usman Khawaja for 2. The highlight of the day was a spirited exchange between Bumrah and teenage sensation Sam Konstas, who impressed with a boundary off the first ball he faced.

""I feel they had a little chitchat; they wanted to waste some time. I feel that's the reason Konstas had a conversation with Jasprit Bumrah. He said something; I didn't hear it. ""But I feel that's the only thing which he wanted to do—waste some time so we don't get to bowl one more over,"" Pant told reporters after Day 1 in Sydney. The incident occurred as Usman Khawaja, on strike, delayed facing the final ball of the day, aiming to ensure no further overs would be bowled. Bumrah, visibly frustrated, had to abort his run-up. Meanwhile, Konstas, stationed at the non-striker's end, appeared to defend his teammate's tactics, leading to a fiery exchange with Bumrah. Umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat had to step in to de-escalate the situation. As seen in the video, Khawaja paid the price for Konstas' argument with Bumrah. The Indian pace spearhead had not looked at his pristine best in the two overs he bowled on Friday, perhaps struggling to maintain rhythm after spending time at the crease with the bat just minutes earlier and having bowled extensively in the last four Tests. However, on the final ball before stumps, Bumrah delivered a fiery delivery at high pace, pitching it outside Khawaja's off-stump. The batter had no choice but to poke at it. The ball stayed slightly low, but the sheer pace ensured it carried to KL Rahul at second slip, who took a brilliant catch, sparking passionate celebrations from the Indians. AUS vs IND, 5th Test Day 1: Highlights Bumrah turned and celebrated directly in front of Konstas, who was attempting to walk off. Virat Kohli and Prasidh Krishna also had a few words for the youngster as nearly the entire Indian team gathered around the pitch in jubilation. The Indian players rallied around their newly named skipper, a moment that captured the intensity of the contest. Meanwhile, Konstas walked off quietly toward the dressing room, with the celebratory noise of all 11 Indian fielders ringing in his ears. Earlier on Day 1, Australian pacers used the grassy SCG pitch and overcast conditions to bowl India out for a paltry 185 on the opening day of the fifth and final Test. At stumps, Australia were 9 for 1 with Bumrah sending Khawaja (2) back in the hut. Konstas was unbeaten at 7 after hitting Bumrah for a first-ball four.

Ayub twisted his ankle and was seen grimacing in pain before receiving assistance from his teammates and the team physio on the sidelines at Newlands. The 22-year-old was later helped to the dressing room, initially using a cart and then a wheelchair. The injury occurred in the seventh over after South Africa chose to bat first. Ayub appeared to twist his right ankle while chasing a ball played by Ryan Rickelton toward the third-man boundary. While Aamer Jamal slid and flicked the ball back in, Ayub slipped and awkwardly twisted his ankle. In visible pain, Ayub immediately called for a physio as his teammates attended to him. His right ankle was strapped, and he required assistance from substitutes to move to the cart. As of now, there has been no official statement from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), but the injury does not look promising for a quick return. South Africa vs Pakistan, 2nd Test Day 1 Live Ayub lost his footing and tripped backward when he tried to stop a ball from going to a boundary. His full body weight came down on his right ankle, which twisted awkwardly under him. Ayub immediately fell to the ground, clutching his leg in visible pain. Jamal and Pakistan captain Babar Azam rushed to assist him before the medical staff arrived. Ayub's ankle was bandaged on the field before he was taken away on a stretcher. The severity of the injury is unclear, and his return to action remains uncertain. The 22-year-old left-handed batter was in excellent form during the white-ball leg of the tour, scoring 31 and an unbeaten 98 in the T20Is, followed by 109, 25, and 101 in the ODIs. In the first Test, Ayub contributed 14 and 27 runs and also picked up a wicket. He is a key player for Pakistan, particularly with the ICC Champions Trophy coming up next month, where he is expected to be the team's primary opener. Earlier in the day, South African skipper Temba Bavuma won the toss and chose to bat first in the New Year's Test at Newlands, Cape Town. Bavuma explained his decision to bat first: ""It's hot, and we expect the wicket to break up. We want to finish the series on a strong note.""  Pakistan captain Shan Masood expressed satisfaction with his team's decision to bowl first. ""There's a bit less grass than usual on the wicket, but we would have chosen to bowl anyway,"" he said.

Battling a challenging pitch and relentless Australian pacers, Pant played a gutsy knock of 40 runs off 98 balls, earning accolades for his courage and determination. Speaking on Star Sports, Pathan described Pant’s innings as one where the wicketkeeper-batter ""put his body on the line"" to deliver a crucial performance for India. “We talk a lot about Rishabh Pant, but we need to agree that the knock he played today was extremely crucial. It wasn’t easy. No one crossed the 30-run mark, but Rishabh Pant reached 40. He was getting hit repeatedly. He was taking balls on his body. He tried to put his life into it,” Pathan said. Pant endured several painful blows during his stay at the crease, including a severe impact on his arm and another on his helmet from Mitchell Starc’s fiery bouncers. Starc’s short-pitched delivery in the 35th over left a visible blood clot on Pant’s arm, and the helmet blow prompted immediate medical attention. Despite the physical toll, Pant showed remarkable resilience and continued to fight for his team.Rishabh Pant takes blows on body

He was getting hit on the body but he fought despite that. I feel it was an excellent innings,” Pathan added. Pant’s gritty knock came at a time when his temperament and shot selection had been under scrutiny. Critics questioned his rash dismissals during the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne, but the young batter silenced doubters with his determination at the SCG. He even managed to counterattack debutant Beau Webster, stepping down the track to hammer a six over long-on that left the ball stuck in the sight screen. India’s innings ended at 185, with Pant’s fighting effort being the standout performance. In reply, Australia finished the day at 9 for 1, with Jasprit Bumrah dismissing Usman Khawaja on the last ball. Pant’s gladiatorial knock, much like Cheteshwar Pujara’s efforts in the 2020-21 series, reaffirmed his role as a game-changer for India in Test cricket.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Rohit Sharma 'opting out' of SCG Test surprises Ricky PontingMust Watch

The former captain, speaking as a commentator for Channel 7, acknowledged the anticipation surrounding the change but expressed surprise at the phrasing used to announce Sharma’s absence. India, trailing 2-1 in the series, needed a win to retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy and keep their slim hopes of making the World Test Championship final alive. Ponting reflected on the situation, saying, “I think the reaction has been that they all sort of expected that it might happen. The chat’s been for the last couple of days that everyone expected Rohit would not play this game, that Shubman Gill would come back in, and that (Jasprit) Bumrah would probably take over the captaincy again—and that’s the way it’s turned out.” The decision to rest Rohit, particularly for such a crucial game, has raised questions about his future in Test cricket. Ponting noted the challenges ahead for the Indian skipper in the longest format, given his age and form. “You’d think it’s probably a long way back for Rohit Sharma now in this format of the game. India don’t play a Test match, I believe, until the middle or late June, which is a long way away when you’re coming to the back end of your career.” Ponting also lauded Sharma’s contributions to Indian cricket. “I think he’s been a terrific player for India. You wish them all the best and hope to see them back out there again, but as I said, I think it will be a long—and probably difficult—road back for him,” he remarked. However, it was the wording of the announcement that puzzled Ponting. He pointed out the unusual phrasing, stating, “I was very surprised when I heard the term ‘opting out’ coming into such an important game. We know he’s been a great stalwart for Indian cricket over a long period of time. So the way that they’ve actually worded it, you can only take it on face value.” Despite Sharma’s absence, India’s focus remains on the series decider at SCG.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

Nair’s historic feat came during Vidarbha’s match against Uttar Pradesh on January 3, where he smashed his third successive century of the tournament. Chasing a challenging target of 308 runs, Nair played a stellar 112-run knock, which saw him get dismissed for the first time in his last four matches. Partnering with opener Yash Rathod, who also scored a century, Nair’s brilliance was the backbone of Vidarbha’s innings. When he crossed 70 runs in this game, he became the first Indian batter to amass 500 consecutive List A runs without losing his wicket, achieving a milestone few thought possible.  The 33-year-old has been in phenomenal touch throughout the tournament. He began with an unbeaten 112 against Jammu and Kashmir in a successful chase. This was followed by a composed 44 not out against Chhattisgarh. Nair’s form then hit a peak as he delivered back-to-back centuries: an explosive 163 not-out against Chandigarh and a classy 111 not-out against Tamil Nadu. His consistency has helped Vidarbha secure the top position in Group E with 16 points. With this achievement, Nair broke the previous record of 527 runs, held by New Zealand’s James Franklin since 2010. He now has seven List A centuries, four of which have come within a span of eight days, highlighting his exceptional form and focus. Nair’s resurgence comes at a pivotal moment in his career. After going unsold in IPL auctions for two seasons, he was recently acquired by the Delhi Capitals for Rs 50 lakh in the IPL 2025 mega auction. The move followed his determined efforts to regain top form after a long gap since his last international appearance during the 2017-18 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Best remembered for his triple century against England in 2016, Nair’s current performances are a testament to his resilience and skill. Under his leadership, Vidarbha continues to shine, and his recent exploits could open doors for higher honours once again.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  Rohit Sharma deserved more respect, captain should never be dropped: Navjot Sidhu

The 19-year-old, known for his performances and on-field antics, stirred mixed reactions during the series, particularly after his heated exchanges with stand-in Indian captain Jasprit Bumrah. Chopra shared his thoughts via social media, hinting that despite Konstas's promising form, playing in India would be an entirely different challenge. His comments came after a fiery confrontation between Konstas and Bumrah on Day 1 of the Sydney Test, adding fuel to the drama.  The confrontation began when Usman Khawaja delayed Bumrah’s delivery by signalling he wasn’t ready. Konstas then intervened, gesturing at Bumrah to stop, leading to a tense exchange. Bumrah, visibly unimpressed, asked, “What’s the problem?” before the on-field umpire stepped in to defuse the situation. The Indian pacer had the last laugh shortly after when he dismissed Khawaja with a brilliant delivery, inducing an edge caught by KL Rahul in the slips. Instead of a traditional celebration, Bumrah turned to Konstas with an intense stare, setting the SCG crowd alight. The Indian team, including Virat Kohli, celebrated the wicket in front of Konstas, further intensifying the moment. The young Australian remained unfazed as he walked off amidst cheers and roars from the Indian camp. Konstas has been in the spotlight since his debut in the Melbourne Test, where his solid performances and sledging habits made headlines. While his aggression has garnered praise from Australian fans, it has also drawn criticism for crossing the line of sportsmanship. India’s struggles with the bat continued in the SCG Test, as they were bowled out for a modest 185 on a pitch favoring seamers. Scott Boland’s exceptional figures of 4 for 31 led Australia’s charge. However, Bumrah provided a silver lining for India, showcasing his brilliance with the ball by dismissing Khawaja in a fiery end to the day. As the series unfolds, Konstas’s ability to handle the pressure of a potential tour to India remains a hot topic, especially with pitches and conditions vastly different from home.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Tune InAlso Read |  Rohit Sharma deserved more respect, captain should never be dropped: Navjot SidhuMust Watch

Instead of celebrating the wicket, Bumrah turned toward Konstas and delivered a piercing stare, adding drama to an already intense situation. Manjrekar applauded Bumrah’s competitive spirit, noting that even Virat Kohli and other Indian players joined in the celebration, emphasising the emotions running high within the team. “Sam Konstas—there's something about him that gets under the skin of the Indian players.

Thankfully, Gavaskar wasn’t on the air when Pant threw his wicket away in the second innings—a moment that triggered a collapse and dashed India’s hopes of salvaging a draw. Pant has always been a player who dances to his own tune. Known for his flamboyance and counter-attacking prowess, the 26-year-old has earned a reputation as India’s X-factor in Test cricket. Who could forget his Gabba masterclass in 2021? While the veterans in the dressing room were contemplating a draw on the final day, it was Pant’s conviction and fearless strokeplay that helped India chase down 328 and script history. Much like the Virender Sehwags and Adam Gilchrists of the game, Pant’s attacking style is underpinned by a solid defensive technique. When he gets behind the line of the ball with a dead bat, he can appear untouchable. However, the charismatic boldness that makes him a game-changer has also been his Achilles’ heel, with his shot selection and situational awareness frequently coming under scrutiny. Reports of head coach Gautam Gambhir delivering a stern dressing-down after the Melbourne defeat highlighted the need for players to adhere to team plans and strike the right balance between natural flair and game awareness. On Day 1 of the Sydney Test, Pant offered a contrast to his usual self—a subdued, patient innings that reflected a battle not just against the Australian bowlers but also against his own urge to attack. On an uncharacteristically green Sydney pitch offering prodigious seam movement, Pant took blows to the body but resisted the temptation to attempt anything reckless. He faced 98 deliveries—the most by any Indian batter in the first innings, which lasted just 72.2 overs—and scored a gritty 40 before a mistimed pull shot ended his resistance. Speaking to the press after his innings, Pant shed light on his evolving approach to batting and the adjustments he’s trying to make.AWARENESS TO CONDITIONS “I am just thinking about playing to the best of my abilities. That’s the only thing I can do and that’s what I did because the wicket was doing too much and the kind of situation we were in. While playing in the middle, I felt like I could play a little bit of defensive cricket,” he said. This measured approach was a marked departure from the rash shots he played in Melbourne, which drew sharp criticism and reportedly the ire of Gambhir. Chasing a stiff fourth-innings target, India lost seven wickets in the final session, with Pant’s dismissal widely regarded as the turning point. Acknowledging the fine balance between instinct and game awareness, Pant said, “Yes, there is a time to attack, but you have to feel that from inside. You can’t premeditate that. Whatever the game asks me to do on that given day, I have to do that. That’s the mindset.”THE MIND BEHIND THE GRITTY SYDNEY KNOCK Controlling his instincts, however, remains a challenge for Pant. “No, it is very difficult (to control the urge). When you see a ball that’s there to be hit, sometimes you have to play more sensible cricket,” he admitted. The Sydney conditions demanded caution, and Pant responded with maturity. “There might be a 50-50 chance which I could have taken early on in this innings. But, sometimes, you have to play more secure cricket, especially with the way the wicket was behaving. We knew that if we get one more wicket there, we could lose two or three,” he said. Pant’s natural flair has always been his biggest asset, but he understands the need to evolve without losing what makes him special. “Mostly, you have to back the way you play. But, eventually, you have to keep evolving. I feel there is no way to play cricket. But, whatever comes more naturally is always better. But, you’ve got to find that balance between playing aggressive cricket and playing all those shots,” he explained.  That balance, however, is easier said than done. Pant spoke candidly about dealing with self-doubt, especially on tours where runs have been hard to come by. “I am trying not to overthink, trying to keep it simple. Because, when you are not having the best of the tours, you tend to overthink. But, I am trying to keep it simple, and give my 200 percent.” Pant, alongside Ravindra Jadeja, helped steer India out of trouble after they were reduced to 72 for 4 in the second session. The pair batted together for 25.1 overs, ensuring India avoided a complete collapse on Day 1. Eventually, India were bowled out for 185. Whether that total will be enough to put pressure on Australia remains to be seen, as tricky batting conditions are expected to persist on Day 2. After all, 150 proved enough for Jasprit Bumrah to exert pressure on Australia on a similarly spicy pitch in Perth last month.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

Opelka served 16 aces — including one to finish off each set — to earn one of the biggest wins of the American's career. “I was just focused on my spots,” Opelka said. “If I hit them, it’s hard to get them back. If there’s anyone that can, it’s him."" The 37-year-old Djokovic was playing his first tournament of the year. The 24-time Grand Slam champion is preparing for the Australian Open, which starts on Jan. 12 and which he has won 10 times. “We have nothing to lose coming in against him. He’s the greatest player ever,” Opelka added. “So you end up playing more free and you take a lot more risk. If you play your normal level or even above a normal level, he’s going to win every time.

Gavaskar reflected on Konstas' heated exchange with India’s stand-in captain, Jasprit Bumrah, before the final delivery of Day 1 of the 5th Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He felt it wasn’t Konstas’ place to intervene when Bumrah was already upset with the delay caused by on-strike batter Usman Khawaja. Eventually, Bumrah dismissed Khawaja with the final ball of the day and delivered a searing death stare to the 19-year-old. The entire Indian team erupted in celebrations, visibly irked, as they united in their reaction. Konstas’ behaviour reminded Gavaskar of a ""young Kohli"", who had a knack for getting under the skin of opposing teams. ""It's not about the batting; it's about what happens on the field when someone’s behaviour stirs things up. It reminds me of a young Kohli who is upfront and provocative, drawing reactions from the opposition. That’s exactly what we saw here. Just before the delivery that dismissed him, Sam Konstas had something to say to Jasprit Bumrah—something that really wasn’t his business at that stage. "" Naturally, Bumrah and the rest of the team responded, and things escalated from there,” Gavaskar exclusively told India Today.Bumrah vs Konstas battle Gavaskar also recalled the Bumrah vs. Konstas battle during the MCG Test, when the debutant hit India’s premier fast bowler for a couple of boundaries in the first innings. However, Bumrah had his revenge in the second innings by dismissing Konstas and mimicking his earlier celebration after Kohli’s dismissal. “Konstas has suddenly become a figure who gets under the skin of the opposition. He did it in the first innings when no one expected it, and in the second innings, Bumrah had the perfect reply by getting him out.”""Konstas might be getting carried away"" However, the former India great cautioned Konstas not to get carried away with his newfound reputation. “I think Konstas might be getting a bit carried away with this new persona. Even Shane Watson, who knows him well, has remarked that this behavior is surprising, as Konstas is usually a quiet and reserved person. It seems like his teammates may have encouraged this aggressive approach, but it’s something he’ll need to manage as his reputation grows. Whether in the short term or long term, if Konstas continues to be seen as a stirrer, he’ll be the one the opposition targets.”Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

Gavaskar believes that at 37, Rohit might not fit into India’s long-term Test plans. By the time the 2027 cycle culminates, Rohit would be 41, making his inclusion as a player and captain unlikely. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and selectors may start looking at younger leadership options to guide the team through the next WTC phase. Gavaskar, speaking in an exclusive interaction with India Today, suggested that Rohit's absence during the ongoing Sydney Test (SCG) against Australia might be an early indicator of such a transition. India faces a must-win scenario to qualify for the WTC final against South Africa. Should India lose the SCG Test, it could accelerate discussions about grooming a new captain to lead the team into the next WTC cycle. My feeling is that, because the new World Test Championship cycle starts from July, with a series in England, there are no test matches now between the end of this Test match (SCG Test) and that Test match. If India does not qualify for the WTC Final, then I think that the selection committee will want to look, not just at Rohit Sharma, but at some others. They might be saying, 'look, are they going to be available for the 2027 World Test Championship Final?' In case India does well in the next two years. So that should be the selection committees' thinking. And so I think maybe Rohit Sharma, being almost 38 year-old, will not be fitting into their plans because he would be 40-years-old then, Gavaskar said. The SCG Test began on a dramatic note as Rohit Sharma was “rested,” paving the way for Jasprit Bumrah to take over as the stand-in skipper. The decision drew attention, with speculation about Rohit’s recent form and leadership capability. Despite the controversies, Bumrah stood by Rohit at the toss, praising his unselfish decision to sit out. Bumrah referred to Rohit as ""our captain"" and highlighted how the move was in the team's best interest. However, Day 1 exposed India’s persistent struggles with the bat. The team was bowled out for a paltry 185, undone by Australia’s disciplined seam attack. Notable performances were absent, with Virat Kohli managing just 17 runs off 69 balls, again falling prey to the “corridor of uncertainty.” Bumrah, stepping up as both a captain and bowler, provided a spark late in the day. He dismissed the out-of-form Usman Khawaja for 2 with a fiery delivery, giving India a glimmer of hope. Adding to the drama, Bumrah exchanged heated words with teenage Australian sensation Sam Konstas, who responded with a boundary on his first ball faced. As the SCG Test unfolds, Gavaskar’s comments about Rohit Sharma’s future will only fuel discussions on India’s leadership and the direction the team takes post-2023.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  Rohit Sharma deserved more respect, captain should never be dropped: Navjot SidhuMust Watch

The grassy deck at the SCG was a bowler’s paradise, with fast bowlers getting plenty of assistance. India’s batting, however, struggled against the Australian pace attack, and they were bowled out for 185 runs. Infact the last delivery drama added extra spice to the day’s proceedings and set up an exciting prospect for Day 2. Let us understand what Day 2 looks like both pitch and weather-wise. Weather Forecast for Day 2: Sunny and ideal conditions Looking ahead to Day 2, the weather looks promising for another full day of play. The day will start with mostly sunny conditions, with the temperature sitting comfortably at 18°C at 7 AM. There is no chance of rain throughout the day, with the rain drop forecast at 0%. The wind will be light at 11 km/h in the morning but will gradually pick up, reaching up to 32 km/h in the afternoon. While the wind might slightly affect ball movement, it is unlikely to disrupt play. The temperature will gradually rise as the day progresses, reaching a maximum of 27°C at noon, and staying consistent through the afternoon. The UV index will be very high, reaching a peak of 12 between 1 PM and 2 PM, making it important for players to stay hydrated and take care in the sun. Despite the challenging conditions under the high UV index, the wind and fair air quality suggest that the match will proceed smoothly without any weather-related interruptions. Day 2 promises to be an exciting one, with both teams looking to seize control of the game.Pitch Report for Day 2: SCG - A tough challenge for batters? The pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground  has been a challenging one for the batters on Day 1 of the 5th Test, and it is expected to remain difficult on Day 2. According to Mark Nicholas and Simon Katich, the wicket has been lively, with plenty of bounce and movement throughout the day. Mark Nicholas highlighted that the final 15 minutes of Day 1, with the confrontation between Sam Konstas and Jasprit Bumrah, added more intensity, but the pitch itself was never easy.If this evening had ended with no wicket, no aggro, tomorrow morning would have been tough. "" But now they’ll wake up tomorrow morning wanting to get to the ground and be ready to play,"" he said.  Simon Katich, commenting on the conditions, emphasised that this is one of the bounciest wickets at the SCG in recent years. ""This SCG wicket is probably the bounciest wicket I’ve seen here in a long time. "" It wasn’t easy—it moved around all day,"" Katich noted. The pitch has offered assistance to both fast bowlers and spinners, with the bounce and movement keeping the batsmen on their toes. With this in mind, the expectation for Day 2 is that the wicket will continue to be lively, at least. India should look to make use of the new ball as the pitch might ease out as the day progresses. The game is set to be an exciting contest, and with the forecast of a sunny day and fair weather, both sides will be keen to make the most of this surface.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  Sam Konstas's antics remind me of a young Virat Kohli, says Sunil GavaskarMust Watch

The message is clear: the India captain may have already played his last Test match.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-rohit-sharma-dropped-or-rested-sydney-test-right-call-2659476-2025-01-03,"""Australia is a beautiful country to visit, but a tough place to tour,"" remarked coach Gautam Gambhir during his address at the Australian Prime Minister's residence in Sydney on New Year's Day. Gambhir's words aptly encapsulated the challenge of being an overseas cricketer Down Under. Many players have seen their careers unravel on Australia’s fast, bouncy pitches. VVS Laxman, a perennial thorn in Australia’s side, saw his Test career conclude after a forgettable tour in 2012. Two years later, MS Dhoni retired from Tests midway through a tour of Australia. More recently, R Ashwin surprised many by retiring at the conclusion of the third Test of the current series in Brisbane. Now, it seems Rohit Sharma’s Test career may also have hit the Australian roadblock. Few could have foreseen the celebrated opener, who basked in glory parading the T20 World Cup trophy in Mumbai just six months ago, being deemed unfit—or deeming himself unfit—to play a Test. Yet, that is exactly what transpired. For the first time in over 50 years, a captain was excluded from a Test match due to poor form. Rohit was absent from the playing XI for the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Sydney. On Friday, 3 January, Jasprit Bumrah stepped in as stand-in captain, attempting to quell the controversy by stating that Rohit had chosen to ""rest"" and emphasising the unity within the team. On the eve of the Test, conflicting media reports surfaced - some claimed Rohit had been dropped, others that he had rested. Regardless of the semantics, the message was clear: the captain no longer merited a place in the side. Selectors have reportedly decided to move on from the 37-year-old, indicating that his last Test may have been in Melbourne.DIP IN NUMBERS  The writing had been on the wall. Rohit’s dismal run in Test cricket during the 2024-25 season invited criticism. Across eight Tests, he managed just 164 runs in 15 innings, averaging 10.93. Against Australia’s formidable pace attack, he looked out of depth and bereft of confidence. While Virat Kohli’s numbers during the same period were not much better—barring a century in the second innings of India’s Perth win—Kohli, at least, displayed intent. Rohit, by contrast, appeared helpless with the bat in hand. Rohit had been one of India’s best batters since the introduction of the World Test Championship. His promotion to the opening slot coincided with the start of the WTC. Between 2019 and the first half of the 2024 season, Rohit was India’s leading run-scorer in Tests with 2,552 runs at an average of 50.03. He was among the best openers in the championship. Yet, his numbers over the last six months have nosedived.CAPTAIN REACTIVE  Rohit’s captaincy, too, has come under scrutiny. He often appeared bereft of ideas when things did not go the team’s way. Under pressure, Rohit seemed to lack a plan B. His reactive approach to field settings and bowling changes often denied India the chance to seize control of Test matches. Losing a home Test series 0-3 to New Zealand in October-November was unprecedented, marking India’s first-ever whitewash on home soil. His dismissive response -- ""12 saal mein ek baar toh allowed hai yaar (it is allowed once in 12 years)"" -- only added to the growing dissatisfaction. The contrast became starker when Jasprit Bumrah led India to a commanding win in Perth in Rohit’s absence, while Pat Cummins continued to lead Australia with aplomb. As Aakash Chopra noted, Rohit appeared to prioritise himself over the team’s needs for the first time in his decorated captaincy career—returning to open in Melbourne after dropping Shubman Gill from the XI, disrupting a more reliable opening partnership between KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal. Reports of dressing room unrest and leaked chatter following the Melbourne Test further sullied Rohit’s standing as captain. Head coach Gautam Gambhir’s reluctance to confirm Rohit’s place in the Sydney Test XI underscored shifting priorities. When, if ever, has a captain’s selection hinged on conditions? Rohit’s decline is all the more striking given his stellar record since the inception of the World Test Championship. Promoted to the opening role, he was India’s leading run-scorer between 2019 and mid-2024, amassing 2,552 runs at an average of 50.03. Yet, his recent form has been impossible to ignore. Sunil Gavaskar, one of the few Indian legends to retire on his own terms, reflected on the inevitability of Rohit’s departure. ""The new World Test Championship cycle starts in July with a series in England. If India does not qualify for the WTC Final, the selectors will look at players who might still be available for the 2027 cycle. At almost 38, Rohit may not fit into their plans,"" Gavaskar told India Today on Friday.  Despite his struggles in red-ball cricket, Rohit is likely to continue leading India in ODIs. He remains the favourite to captain the side in the Champions Trophy, beginning in February. Regardless of what has transpired in Australia, Rohit is likely to retain the selectors’ and team management’s backing to lead another ICC trophy hunt. Few would deny he deserves that opportunity, given his transformational leadership in the ODI and T20 World Cups. Rohit remodelled his batting and consistently put the team above himself. For red-ball cricket, however, Rohit needs to get his timing right for one last time.  Some of cricket’s biggest names have prolonged their careers, inviting criticism. Sachin Tendulkar silenced the “Endulkar” columns with his bat, yet questions were raised when he continued beyond the 2011 World Cup. Kapil Dev’s final two years of international cricket similarly fell short of his lofty standards. Rohit may have already overstayed his welcome in Tests. If Virat Kohli continues to appear vulnerable against deliveries bowled in the uncertainty corridor, the chatter around him will also grow louder.

With 283 runs scored and 13 wickets falling on the day, the game remains finely poised. Resuming on 6 for 0, Zimbabwe initially struggled against disciplined Afghan bowling. A top-order collapse left them reeling at 41 for 4. Joylord Gumbie edged Fareed Ahmad to second slip, while Takudzwanashe Kaitano fell down the leg side to Yamin Ahmadzai. Ben Curran briefly steadied the innings with a couple of boundaries but was trapped lbw by a sharp in-ducker from Fareed. Dion Myers, promoted in place of the injured Sean Williams, attempted a counter-attack but edged behind for just 6. However, Zimbabwe’s middle-order resilience shone through. Raza, playing his first Test since 2021, rode his luck after being dropped early in his innings. Partnering with Ervine, the duo stitched a crucial 71-run stand, relying on singles and occasional boundaries. Raza reached his half-century with a stylish drive off Rashid Khan, while Ervine anchored the innings with a composed 75.Zimbabwe hold upper hand

With the ball, Zimbabwe maintained their dominance in the final session. Blessing Muzarabani struck twice with the new ball, removing both Afghan openers. He dismissed Ibrahim Zadran and Abdul Malik with precision, leaving Afghanistan reeling. Sikandar Raza chipped in with the key wicket of Hashmatullah Shahidi, Afghanistan’s skipper and first-Test hero, to cap off a remarkable day for the hosts. Afghanistan ended the day at 40 for 3, trailing by 46 runs with Rahmat Shah holding the fort. With the pitch offering increasing assistance to the bowlers, Zimbabwe held a slight edge heading into Day 3. Afghanistan will need a strong batting performance to claw their way back into the contest, while Zimbabwe will look to press home their advantage. The match is delicately poised, with both teams having everything to play for in what promises to be an enthralling third day.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Also Read |  AUS vs IND 5th Test: How will rain and pitch impact Day 2 proceedings in Sydney

Rohit spoke in detail about the alleged dressing room leaks from the Indian team and how it affected the players on this marquee tour. Rohit also shut down the speculation about him getting dropped from the SCG game and if Melbourne was the final Test match of his career.advertisementRohit Sharma’s Full Interview From SydneyIND vs AUS, 5th Test: Full ScorecardDropped, rested or opted out? IND vs AUS, 5th Test: Full ScorecardDropped, rested or opted out? Not any of these three (rested, opted out, and dropped). I stood down. That is what I would say. Look, if I would say something, but it can be interpreted in 50 different ways. Basically, the chat that I had with the coach and the selector was very simple: I am not scoring runs, I am not in form, it’s an important match, anyways the batting unit is struggling a bit. So, you can’t carry a lot of out-of-form players in the team. It was as simple as this and it was going in my mind. I was keen on telling this to the coach and the selector, I told them, they backed my decision. They told me ‘you are playing for these many years, you would know better about what you can do and what you can’t’. For me, making the decision was difficult. But keeping everything in front, it was a sensible decision.  I won’t think too far ahead. At this time, what the team needed, that was what I was thinking. Apart from this, I didn’t think about anything else. Did you take this decision after the Melbourne Test?  I took this decision after coming here because after the Melbourne Test, we had only two days (turnaround). In that, one was New Year’s Day. On New Year’s Day, I thought it would be right to inform about such a decision to the coach and the selectors. But, it was playing in my mind. I was trying my best and it was not happening. It’s important to accept that it was not happening for me. And it was important for me to step aside.  When I arrived in Perth. Why did we win that game? We got out bowled out for 150 and then we bowled them out for 100. We had a 50-run lead. And then, the game could have gone anywhere. In the second innings, there was a partnership of 200. That was the game-changer. That is where won the game. We knew that the pitches here offers help to the bowlers. Bowlers will do their job, there was no doubt. But, for the batters, it was a challenge. KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal handled those challenges really well. They got us into a position from where we couldn’t lose the Test.  Everything was on my mind. I thought it was not needed to disturb that opening pair.  I want to say one more thing. Whenever I captain, I don’t think about what’s going to happen five months later, six months later. I don’t believe in that. Because it’s important to focus on what’s needed now.  Our focus was on these five matches. We wanted to win the series, and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. All the decisions that were taken were for the team. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full CoverageRohit Sharma, the captain, what is the road ahead for him? Look, like I said, this decision is not a retirement decision. Nor I am going to step away from the game. I am out of this game because I am not getting runs. There’s no guarantee that I won’t be scoring runs five months later. We have seen a lot in cricket, every minute, every second, every moment, life changes.  I am confident things will change. At the same time, I have to be realistic as well. At the same time, some person is sitting with a mic, laptop or a pen and writing stuff, our lives do not change because of what that person is writing or saying.  We have seen the game for so many years. These people can’t decide when we have to go, when we can’t play, and when we can’t captain the side. I am a sensible person, a mature person, father of two children. I have enough sense to understand what I want in life.How does the chatter of leaks from the dressing room affect the players? It doesn’t affect us because the players here are made of steel. We have tried our best to make players like this. See, we can’t control certain things, and we don’t want to fret about those things. We don’t want to waste time on it.  Let it happen (the leaks). What can we do about it? Just focus on winning the match and getting better in our game, that’s what we want to do.'We don’t want players, captains who don’t put the team ahead' When you can’t think for the team, we don’t want those kinds of players or captains. Only team and team. Why do we call it a team? It’s because 11 players play the game. That’s why it’s called a team.  I don’t want to speak for the others. This is my thinking. That’s how I have played my cricket. That’s how I am in life, outside the field also. I don’t want to portray something else. Who I am is what you see. If you don’t like it, pardon me. What I feel is right, I will do that.What do you make of Jasprit Bumrah’s evolution and captaincy? Yes, definitely. He has a good idea of the game. He is class in the way he sets an example for others with the way he bowls. He has class. He keeps the team ahead always.  I have seen him for the last 11 years. His graph has gone upwards. He has evolved a lot. He has taken his game and thinking ahead. Bowling, the entire world is seeing it. He has become very good. Who do you think can captain India in Test going forward? Very difficult to answer this. There are a lot of good guys. But, I want to tell something to the young boys: ‘first understand the importance of cricket. Understand the gravity of international cricket’. I know they should be given responsibility. But, let them earn it. Let’s them play some hard-fought cricket for the next few years. Let them earn it.  See, there is Jasprit Bumrah now, before that there was Virat Kohli, before that there was MS Dhoni. Everybody earned it. No one got it on a platter.  I don’t think anyone should get it that way. They should earn it. The young boys have a lot of talent. I also want to say one thing: Captaining India is not a simple thing. There is pressure, but there it is a great honour. Looking at our history and looking at the way we are playing our crikcet, it’s a great honour.  Let them earn it, they will get their opportunity. 'Won't doubt myself because of criticism' See as a leader, every day can’t be a good day. You have to accept that. And what you were doing right three months before, it doesn’t go bad in three months. Your mindset is the same. The captaincy I was doing 5-6 months ago, I have the same mindset, same idelogy, same thought process, same messaging. But, sometimes, the results don’t come our way. Then people say ‘this guys is bad, what’s happening?’.  I know 140 crore people judge you in India. That’s what it is. But, I believe in my methods and idealogy as a captain. I don’t want to change that.  People will say things, but that doesn’t mean I will doubt myself. No one goes into a match thinking about losing it. Everybody wants to win. Look at the crowd here, look at their involvement. We all want to shut them down.  Tell me, which other team has won series here twice? We have the golden opportunity to.. Not win the series, but can draw it now. We don’t want them to retain the trophy. I am not going anywhere.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Tune InAlso Read |  Pic: 'Rested' Rohit Sharma walks onto field, chats with bowlers during breakMust Watch

Notably, Rohit opened up on the decision to drop himself from the ongoing fifth Test against Australia on Day 2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The India skipper decided to rest himself from the game owing to his poor form as youngster Shubman Gill was brought into the playing XI in his place. Rohit further gave clarification on his decision at lunch on Day 2 and mentioned that the team couldn’t carry too many out-of-form batters. The comment attracted strong praise from Manjrekar, who hailed the India skipper for his honesty. AUS vs IND 5th Test Day 2 Live “Hats off to Rohit! What a candid chat on @StarSportsIndia. Honesty to the core. ‘We could not carry too many out of form batters into Sydney, that’s why I opted out” #INDvsAUS’,” wrote Manjrekar on his X account.

 “The chat that I had with the coach and selector was very simple, that 'I’m not able to score runs. I’m not in form, it’s an important game, we need batters with good form and our batting line-up is already struggling'. Hence, I told them that we cannot carry too many out-of-form batters in the team,” said Rohit on Star Sports. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “All of these things were going in my head and hence I decided to share it with the coach and selectors who backed my decision. It was a difficult decision for me to take but if I look at it, it was a sensible decision. I won’t think too much ahead into it, it’s just that what the team needed at this point and that was the only thought behind it,” he added. Rohit didn’t have a memorable time in the series, having scored just 31 runs from three matches (5 innings) at an average of 6.20 with a highest score of 10. Hence, he decided to rest himself after his prolonged poor form in the ongoing Sydney Test.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also Read |  I stood down: Rohit Sharma breaks silence on missing Sydney Test in bold interview

In the second innings, the visitors got off to a fine start thanks to Yashasvi Jaiswal.

Pant reached the milestone in just 29 balls, smashing six fours and three sixes. Although he narrowly missed his record of a 28-ball fifty against Sri Lanka in 2022, Pant's SCG knock marked the fastest fifty ever by a visiting batter on Australian soil, eclipsing the 33-ball fifties by England's John Brown (Melbourne, 1895) and West Indies' Roy Fredericks (Perth, 1975).  

 Pant entered the fray after Virat Kohli's dismissal and wasted no time in taking the attack to the Australian bowlers. From the very first ball, which he dispatched for a six off Scott Boland, Pant dominated the bowlers with fearless aggression. His destructive batting, particularly against Boland and Beau Webster, left the Australian side scrambling for answers. This counterattacking knock was in stark contrast to his first-innings effort, where he scored a composed 40 runs off 98 balls. In the second innings, however, Pant discarded his conservative approach, opting for audacious stroke play to extend India’s lead beyond 100 runs. Critics who questioned his shot selection in the fourth Test were silenced as he delivered a performance that blended power and precision. Fastest 50s for India in Tests (by balls faced)

Nevertheless, his effort stood as the fastest fifty by a visiting batter in Australia, an achievement that underlined his impact on the game. Pant’s thrilling innings came to an end on 61 runs off just 33 balls. Attempting to capitalise on a wide delivery from Pat Cummins, Pant edged the ball to Alex Carey behind the stumps. Though his dismissal was a setback for India, his aggressive knock had already put the visitors in a commanding position. Cummins celebrated the crucial wicket with visible joy, recognising the significance of removing the in-form batter.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Tune InRead More |  Masterclass: Acting captain Virat Kohli earns praise in Sydney Test after India take lead

Pant scored 61 off 32 balls to put Australia on the backfoot. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/border-gavaskar-trophy-rishabh-pant-fifty-sydney-sachin-tendulkar-reaction-2659662-2025-01-04,"Sachin Tendulkar was left in awe of Rishabh Pant's blitz on Day 2 of the Sydney Test on Saturday, January 4 as the Indian wicketkeeper stunned Australia with an incredible counter-attacking knock. Pant scored 61 off just 33 balls and had come in to bat with India in a spot of bother in the second innings.  After a fiery start to their innings, thanks to Yashasvi Jaiswal, India were pegged back by Scott Boland, who picked up both the openers. Virat Kohli was yet again dismissed by Boland while trying to play a delivery outside off-stump and this brought Pant to the crease. The Indian wicketkeeper showed no fear from the very first ball as he charged down the crease and hit Boland for a massive six.  The onslaught from Pant would continue as he started to score runs freely as the fans were left on the edge of their seats with his batting. The wicketkeeper would hit two consecutive sixes off Mitchell Starc to get to his fifty in Sydney on Saturday. Pant would score the 2nd fastest fifty by an Indian batter as he reached the landmark in 29 balls, just missing out on breaking his own record. Pant's batting received heavy praise from Tendulkar, who said the wicketkeeper's knock with a strike-rate of 184 was truly remarkable as the rest of the batters were struggling.  AUS vs IND, Sydney Test Day 2: Live Updates The Indian legend claimed that Pant rattled Australia from the very first ball and claimed it is always entertaining to watch the 27-year-old bat.  ""On a wicket where majority of the batters have batted at a SR of 50 or less, @RishabhPant17's knock with a SR of 184 is truly remarkable. He has rattled Australia from ball one. It is always entertaining to watch him bat. What an impactful innings!"" said Tendulkar. 
 


 Pant would hit six fours and four sixes in his knock, which left the match on a knife-edge. India would end the day on 141 for 6 with a 145-run lead heading into Day 3.

While this series might not have the final day drama of the Gabba, the Sydney Test has once again been set up for a thrilling finish after a fast-moving Day 2 of Saturday, January 4. 15 wickets fell on Day 2 of the Test match as the pitch kept getting better for the fast bowlers despite the sun beating down at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday. It was Rishabh Pant - India's hero at the Gabba in 2020/21, who once again played a crucial part in keeping India alive in the Test match. Pant’s innings helped India take a lead of 145 runs. At the close of the day, India were 141/6 with Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar in the crease. Pant's rapid fifty - the fastest by any Indian on Australian soil helped India break the shackles late on Day 2, when Scott Boland was breathing fire on the SCG pitch. Pant's 29-ball fifty, in his typical counterattacking style, helped India put pressure back on the fast bowlers, who were enjoying the ever-improving SCG surface. Coming into bat after 78/4, after Virat Kohli was once again edged to the slips, Pant began his innings with a slap through the line against Boland - hitting the pacer for a six. The wicketkeeper-batter - criticised for his mode of dismissals in this innings threw caution to the win and backed his style of cricket. Pant's attack saw Australia lose their bearings despite having a sustained period of pressure over the India batters. Pant 6 fours and 4 sixes in his 33-ball innings, breaking the game open, at a time when it looked like India would fold below 150 runs. Batting has been very hard at the SCG due to the amount of seam, swing and bounce that the pacers have extracted from the pitch. Pant made a mockery of everything, and hit 61 runs off 33 balls, making sure that Australian pacers do not dictate terms to the Indian side.Fastest Test Fifties by Indians 28 Rishabh Pant vs SL Bengaluru 2022 29 Rishabh Pant vs Aus Sydney 2025 * 30 Kapil Dev vs Pak Karachi 1982 31 Shardul Thakur vs Eng The Oval 2021 31 Yashasvi Jaiswal vs Ban Kanpur 2024 On Day 2 at the SCG, India’s innings could easily be divided into two parts. One with Pant at the crease and one without. Apart from the swashbuckling start provided by Yashasvi Jaiswal, India struggled to keep the scoreboard moving. Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, KL Rahul fell cheaply once again, handing Australia control in the Test match. After Pant did his thing and got out to Pat Cummins, the Indian innings once again went back into a rut with Ravindra Jadeja and Nitish Kumar Reddy failing to keep the scoreboard ticking. By then, it was clear that there was no point surviving at the SCG, and the only way to win this match was to put on a decent score by hook or crook and then unleash the fast bowlers on the green deck at the venue. India’s lack of rotation built up pressure on the batters and eventually resulted in the wicket of Nitish Reddy in the 28th over of the match. And it was once again Scott Boland, whose persistent lines and lengths helped him reap the reward on Saturday. Boland closed the day with 4/42, once again impressing the crowd in the absence of Josh Hazlewood.Jasprit Bumrah's Injury It cannot be stressed enough how important Pant's counter-attacking innings was. The invaluable 61 runs helped the Indian team get a decent cushion at the close of play in case captain Jasprit Bumrah is not able to bowl on Sunday. Bumrah got off the field after bowling just 8 overs in the day. Not only did Bumrah leave the field, he also went off the stadium to get his back checked at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney.  Losing Bumrah would be a huge miss for India given the pacer has marshalled the entire attack on his shoulder in this series. 2 wickets in India's first outing with the ball in Sydney helped Bumrah reach a tally of 32 wickets in this series - a record by any Indian bowler against Australia. India would find a little solace in the fact that Mohammed Siraj finally looked like the Mohammed Siraj of 2020/21, bowling his heart out with incredible fierceness in every step. Saturday was perhaps the first time that the Indian bowling unit grew in stature with every ball they bowled. After an inconsistent start, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna found their lengths and stepped up in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah - their captain. Siraj, Prasidh finished with 3 wickets each, while Nitish Reddy picked up 2 valuable wickets of Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. If Bumrah does not play on Day 3, it will be a deja vu moment for this bowling attack, who had missed the services of the pacer in the 2020/21 series as well. Siraj would have to step up, like he did on Saturday if India were to have a chance in this Test match.Rohit's Interview, Kohli's Failure: Drama Aplenty There were plenty of dramatic - TV-worthy moments on Day 2 of the Test match. It began with India chirping at the Australian batters, giving back some of the Aussie treatment that they had received in the tour. Things got entertaining when Yashasvi Jaiswal tried to sledge Sam Konstas in the most desi style - the video of which has since gone viral.

— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) January 4, 2025 If Jaiswal vs Konstas was the teaser, the full movie came out at Lunch when Rohit Sharma stepped out for a candid chat with the broadcasters about the rumours in the Indian team. A candid Sharma revealed that he was going nowhere and said that he decided to step down from his position only in this Test match, thinking about the team. While Rohit was lauded for his honesty and candour, Virat Kohli faced some stick later in the day, once again edging the ball back to the slips.  On Saturday, Kohli got out to Scott Boland, who has explicitly talked about Australia's game plan to Kohli after the first innings at Sydney. Boland had said that Kohli had a knack of going for outside off-stump balls after settling in, and Australia were happy to shift their lines accordingly. What unfolded at the SCG on Saturday was word to word highlight of the description. “We've got pretty set plans on how we want to bowl to Virat Kohli’... we just want to switch our lines a little bit to fifth stump and it's working at the moment...” Boland had said. Kohli's exploits in series as follows: 5, 100*, 7, 11, 3, 36, 5, 17, and now 6. The batter finished the series with 190 runs at an average of 23.75.Day 3 Outlook As things stands, there is no reason why batting should get easier at the SCG. It is expected to seem once again and batters are once again supposed to be troubled by the bounce. It is a question of what India think is a defendable target here. There will be one crucial condition that India will bear in mind - do India bowl with Bumrah or without Bumrah. India are at the moment 145 runs ahead of the Australians - with Jadeja and Sundar at the crease - players who have scored runs in this series. If India can somehow cross the 200-run threshold, it might be near impossible for Australia to chase down the target.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also Read |  Virat Kohli, you're done: Fans furious as Australian horror endsMust Watch

Concerned about the impact of the altercation, McDonald revealed that he checked on Konstas' well-being on Friday night. While McDonald criticised the Indian players' intensity, it was Konstas who provoked Bumrah, sparking unnecessary controversy. However, the confrontation proved costly for Australia, as only two balls later, a fired-up Bumrah removed Khawaja for 3 in the final over of the day. ""My conversation with him was around whether he was OK. Clearly, the way India celebrated that was quite intimidating,"" he told reporters. Known for his calm and composed demeanour, Bumrah uncharacteristically lost his cool after the Australian teenager made remarks to him from the non-striker's end. India's frustrations stemmed from Khawaja's perceived time-wasting tactics to avoid an over late in the day. The situation escalated when Konstas confronted Bumrah, prompting the umpire to intervene.  Khawaja's wicket on the final ball of the day sparked a passionate display of unity from the Indian team, with Virat Kohli and KL Rahul joining Bumrah in the exuberant celebrations. McDonald expressed concern about the way several Indian players ran to celebrate directly in front of Konstas after Bumrah dismissed Khawaja. ""It's clearly within the laws of the game ... there's been no charges laid but to have an opposition swarm the non-striker like that, we have a duty of care to make sure our player is OK and in a headspace to go out the next day and perform. That's all those conversations were."" Asked if he thought it went too far, McDonald was coy. ""It's clear that it was acceptable because there were no fines or punishments,"" he said. ""I'll leave that up to the ICC. Obviously, Andy Pycroft being the match referee and umpires out there, if they thought it was satisfactory I suppose that's the benchmark we're playing amongst.""Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Read More |  Kohli tried everything in his capabilities, now battling with self-doubt: Manjrekar

The right-handed batter fell prey to Scott Boland for the fourth time in the series as the Australian seamer continued to exploit his weakness. Analysing Kohli’s dismissal after the end of the day’s play, Manjrekar said that after several years he’s gone back to batting inside his crease.

There's another quick point I want to make if you see that dismissal and you've got to feel for Virat Kohli. There were occasions when he was trying to leave balls outside the off on this occasion, after many years, Mark and Simon, you see that he's actually deep inside the batting crease,” Manjrekar on Star Sports. Further speaking ahead, he mentioned that the India star has tried everything under his control and now seems to be suffering from self-doubt with the same mode of dismissals. “I mean, he's gone back and he's inside the batting crease. Now that is a very rare thing for Virat Kohli to do. You know, Virat Kohli loves getting outside the batting crease going forward. He's tried everything within his, you know, capabilities and on this occasion he tried being inside the batting crease, same result. What do you do?

The injury is expected to sideline him for at least six weeks, jeopardizing his participation in the mega event. Ayub sustained the injury during the seventh over of the Test when he slipped and badly damaged his ankle, requiring him to be stretchered off the field. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed in a statement that the 22-year-old will be out of action for at least six weeks. “Pakistan opener Saim Ayub has been ruled out of competitive cricket for up to six weeks due to a right ankle fracture sustained while fielding on the opening day of the second men’s cricket Test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday,"" the PCB announced. ""An MRI conducted Friday afternoon confirmed the fracture, which has been immobilised in an Ankle Medical Moon Boot.” The injury reduces Pakistan to 10 men in the ongoing Cape Town Test, with Ayub taking no further part in the match. He now faces a race against time to recover for the Champions Trophy, set to begin on February 19 at the National Stadium in Karachi, approximately 45 days from now.  Hence, Saim is also certain to miss the two-Test series at home against the West Indies later this month and also the tri-series with South Africa and New Zealand in Februar. The setback is unfortunate for Ayub, who has enjoyed a stellar start to his ODI career, averaging 64.37 in nine matches. Last month, he scored two centuries as Pakistan whitewashed South Africa in a three-match ODI series. His absence could pave the way for discarded opener Imam-ul-Haq to return for Tests, while Fakhar Zaman is a potential replacement for ODIs.

""First of all, it's not surprising, the way he plays. We were in fact a little bit surprised in the first innings, the way he went about his work. He's got an incredible ability to put pressure back on to bowlers,"" McDonald said in the press conference after the day’s play. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage The left-handed Pant was also involved in a partnership of 46 runs for the fifth wicket along with Ravindra Jadeja. McDonald said that Pant took the attack to the boundary riders and did not shy away from playing his shots.  ""We're planning for that though, we'll plan leading into the summer. We bounced in and out of a few plans there and clearly kept taking on the boundary riders and was getting away with it and no, it was an innings that you would say was right for that time,” McDonald added. At Stumps on Day 2, India led by 145 runs in their second innings with four wickets in hand. Barring Pant, none of the Indian batters have managed to dominate the Australian bowlers, especially Scott Boland, who has taken four wickets in the second innings.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also Read |  Prasidh confirms Jasprit Bumrah's injury, SCG Test participation under cloudMust Watch

His composed innings featured exquisite timing and shot selection, countering Pakistan's improved bowling with the second new ball. This was the 19th double century scored on South African soil, with Newlands hosting seven of them-more than any other venue in the country. Against Pakistan, it was the fourth double ton for a South African batter, following in the footsteps of legends like AB de Villiers and Herschelle Gibbs. Rickelton's 204* is also the highest individual score by a South African against Pakistan since Graeme Smith's 234 in 2013. With his performance, Rickelton has scripted his name in South Africa's cricketing history, signalling the arrival of a remarkable talent.

The pacer credited bowling coach Morne Morkel's guidance and shared how tactical adjustments during lunch helped him fine-tune his performance on a challenging track.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/prasidh-krishna-credits-bowling-coach-morne-morkel-after-three-scalps-at-scg-2659756-2025-01-04,"Indian pacer Prasidh Krishna delivered a crucial performance on Day 2 of the Sydney Test, taking 3/42 to help India bowl out Australia for 181 in their first innings. His scalps included Steve Smith, Alex Carey, and Beau Webster, vital wickets that kept India in contention despite a modest lead of 145 at stumps. Prasidh credited bowling coach Morne Morkel for his growth, acknowledging the South African’s role in refining his bowling strategies and mental approach. “Morne and myself, we kind of have a lot of discussions about what has to be done, and things are going well for now,” Prasidh said during the post-match media interaction. Their collaboration has been instrumental in shaping Prasidh’s ability to adapt to varying conditions, especially on unpredictable tracks like the SCG, which featured variable bounce and low carry. “The ball is keeping low sometimes, but there is enough bounce for us to be in the game and look for those edges. Try and beat them on either side of the bat,” Prasidh explained. AUS vs IND, Sydney Test Day 2: HighlightsPrasidh's impressive return The Karnataka seamer admitted he struggled with his lengths early in the session, but a discussion with the team analyst during lunch helped him recalibrate. “When I got back from lunch, I actually looked at where I was bowling. I sat with the analyst and we had a better idea of what my reference point is. When I came in to bowl next, that really helped,” he revealed. Prasidh also reflected on his journey, highlighting the challenges of transitioning from new-ball duties for Karnataka to bowling one change for the national team. “That was a really good learning curve for me because every time I played for my state, I was bowling with a new ball. Coming here, having to bowl one change, it was about trying to give control to the team and being consistent in the lines and lengths.” Returning to the Test setup after nearly a year due to back surgery, Prasidh emphasised the importance of preparation. “I did get a bit of confidence bowling in Australia and having played some red-ball cricket previously in the Duleep Trophy. When I got the ball in hand, there were a bit of nerves initially, but I have enough people in the team to discuss what could be better.” With Morkel’s guidance and his own adaptability, Prasidh has shown why he remains a key asset in India’s pace arsenal.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also Read |  Watch: Rohit Sharma's 'mai kahin nahi jaara' remark leaves Irfan in splitsMust Watch

46b40d03-f0a0-4c81-84ca-03712c34ff4f,"Maverick Sydney Test knock shows why Rishabh Pant shouldn't be tamedRishabh Pant's electrifying 33-ball 61 on Day 2 of the Sydney Test was a masterclass in counter-attacking cricket, reigniting India's hopes of retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. With audacious stroke play and fearless intent, Pant reminded his critics that he cannot be tamed.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-rishabh-pant-sydney-knock-critics-x-factor-attack-test-cricket-2659751-2025-01-04,"Sticking to his aggressive style, Rishabh Pant bulldozed the Australian attack with his strokeplay in the second innings and unleashed a stunning 33-ball 61 to keep India alive in the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. This came just a day after the wicketkeeper turned heads with a version of himself that no one quite recognised: patient, measured, and—wait for it—defensive. Day 1's version was Pant's response to the multiple reports suggesting India's head coach Gautam Gambhir was not happy with Pant's reckless approach to batting. On a challenging pitch, Pant faced a barrage of short-pitched deliveries from Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, and Scott Boland. His gritty 98-ball innings saw him endure multiple body blows, which he later described as “badges of honour.” This disciplined effort looked like a significant departure from the impulsive strokes that had previously drawn criticism. In Melbourne, Pant’s ill-timed dismissal was viewed as the turning point in a narrow defeat, raising questions about his ability to balance aggression with caution. Reflecting on his approach, Pant openly admitted, “I’m trying not to overthink and keep it simple. When you’re not having a great tour, overthinking can creep in. I’m focusing on giving my 200 percent.” Even the Australian coach, Andrew McDonald, was surprised by Pant's ultra-defensive approach on the opening day. ""First of all, it's not surprising, the way he plays. We were in fact a little bit surprised in the first innings, the way he went about his work. He's got an incredible ability to put pressure back on to bowlers,"" McDonald said. Pant, however, is not one to stay subdued for long. Known for his flamboyance and ability to turn games on their head, the 26-year-old has built a reputation as India’s ultimate X-factor. After having spent almost 150 minutes being someone else on the opening day in Sydney, crawling to 40 off 98 balls, the real Pant stood up on the second day. Having curbed his natural instinct to attack during a sedate 40 in the first essay after being torn to shreds by the most important member of the Indian coaching staff for indiscreet shot selection at the MCG, Pant perhaps cleared his mind about what he needed to do, especially when defending on a pitch that was seaming aplenty didn’t help his top-order teammates.  Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Walking in with India in trouble, he faced a fiery attack from a confident Boland and an impressive debutant, Beau Webster, who was moving the ball prodigiously. With steep bounce troubling the Indian top order, including the dismissals of KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and even Virat Kohli, Pant stepped up with flair. His very first ball was sent soaring into the long-on stands. The fallen pull shot returned, and so did the unmistakable swagger. Pant countered the bounce with ease, launching Webster over point and smashing Starc for two outrageous sixes into the heritage Ladies Members’ Stand—moments etched for posterity. Pant's fireworks forced Australia into bowling T20 lines and lengths. By then, Pat Cummins had deployed six fielders on the boundary, yet Pant remained unstoppable. Cummins himself eventually induced an edge to dismiss him, but not before Pant received a standing ovation from both Indian and Australian fans. In the process, Pant narrowly missed breaking his own record for the fastest fifty by an Indian in Test cricket, reaching the mark in 29 balls—second only to himself. His milestone came with a helicoptered six over midwicket off Starc, followed by another thunderous six in the same region on the very next ball.PANT KEEPS INDIA ALIVE Pant's knock could prove to be a game-changing, series-changing inning. If India are still breathing in the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, it is only because of Rishabh Pant’s counter-attacking half-century. And Pant delivered it in his signature, unpredictable style.  Let's be honest, it's not Pant’s approach that's baffling, but it’s our obsession with questioning it. He’s been around for six years now, and this maverick method has been his magic. Consider this: It took him 19 balls to smash his way to 40 on Day 2. Compare that to his painstaking crawl to the same score in 97 balls just the day before. But don’t mistake this for reckless slogging. Pant wasn’t swinging blindly; he was playing chess on the field, exploiting gaps and pushing India ahead. In just a handful of deliveries, he transformed what looked like a flatlining innings into a fighting total. Without him, India might have been toast. For perspective, in the last 25 years, a score above 200 has been chased successfully at the SCG only once. ""I like both personalities. I like what I saw from him yesterday, it was hard work out there and he applied himself beautifully, particularly after the criticism he copped for his knocks at the MCG, which ultimately led to India losing that Test,"" Simon Katich said on Star Sports after Day 2's play. ""What we saw him from the first innings was discipline and game awareness, today it was a different type of game awareness. Maybe the hierarchy said to him, go for it, let’s see if Australia put their fielders out after that. He probably had the licence,"" Katich added. Pant picked his battles with precision. He dealt in singles against Boland, doubles off Cummins, and saved the fireworks for Webster—the weakest link in the Aussie attack—blasting 23 runs off just 10 balls. Around him, Indian batters scratched, poked, and perished. Even Jadeja, his partner in the sixth-wicket stand, looked like he was glued to his score of two for nearly an hour. Right now, India’s lead stands at 145. Without Pant, it could have been far less on a day when 15 wickets fell. Pant's Sydney madness has confirmed that he is the best when left alone to fly and not caged. Sure, for every SCG masterclass, there will be a reckless dismissal like the one at the MCG. The falling pull won’t always find the boundary. The reverse lap will occasionally look ridiculous. But that’s the deal you make when you have generational talent in your XI. Pant isn’t the guy who’ll carry you home every time. But when you’re lost in the woods, he’ll show up with a torch, a map, and the audacity to make you believe you’ll make it out alive.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Tune InRead More |  AUS vs IND: Prasidh Krishna explains how SCG's variable bounce will help India

At Stumps on Day 2, India led by 145 runs with four wickets left in their second innings. After getting bowled out for 185 runs in their first innings, India eked out a small lead of two runs. In their second innings, India got themselves up to 141 for seven in 32 balls. They could have been seven down had Steve Smith not dropped Ravindra Jadeja off Beau Webster at the fag end of the day’s play. Rishabh Pant stole the limelight with his 61-run knock off 33 balls, laced with six fours and four sixes. Had it not been for Pant’s knock, India could have been in deeper trouble.

Out of the 33 chases in Sydney, Australia feature 26 times. England feature in the list six times while Pakistan chased 32 back in January 1977. In fact, the Aussies are the only team to chase down a target of more than 200 six times at the SCG. List of successful run-chases at the SCG 
 


Well within range  In the 21st century, there have been eight successful chases in Sydney, all by Australia. Going by India’s current lead of 145 in the match, Australia are in control of the New Year’s Test. Back in January 2001, they chased down 173 against the West Indies and won by six wickets. Then in October 2003, they won by nine wickets against Zimbabwe after chasing down 172. Hence, Australia would feel that they are well and truly in the game and within sights of a victory.

In their second innings, India struggled with wickets falling at regular intervals. However, Rishabh Pant's explosive half-century provided a crucial boost, pushing India's lead to over 130. By stumps on Day 3, the visitors were at 141/6, holding a lead of 145 runs. Sunil Gavaskar highlighted a remark made by former Australia pacer Glenn McGrath, who stated that he had never seen so much grass on a Sydney pitch.

After a string of low scores, he did not feature in the playing XI for the New Year’s Test. Kohli, on the other hand, scored a masterful hundred in the second innings of the Perth Test and helped India win by 295 runs. But apart from that, he has found it tough to get going. Moreover, balls outside the off stump have troubled him and Kohli has got out caught behind quite a few times. Manjrekar said that Kohli is suffering from a lack of confidence despite trying his heart out to nullify his technical deficiency of poking at balls outside the off-stump. Manjrekar mentioned that by playing county cricket, Kohli and Rohit should try and convince the selectors they are good enough to continue playing Test cricket. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “Kohli, with the body of work he has had, his impact and tenacity every time he comes, he’s giving his very best. All the confidence he had is getting eroded.

Rashford, 27, has endured a challenging period, having been excluded from United's squad for four consecutive matches earlier in December due to perceived poor performances and attitude concerns. Though he was named on the bench for the 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United on December 30, the England international did not feature, marking his fourth consecutive game without playing time. Amorim addressed the situation ahead of the Liverpool match, stating: ""At the moment, he is ill. He is not training, and this week he is out. It's the same situation as before. We will see in the future, but right now, he is a normal player like anyone else, and I make selections accordingly."" Rashford's absence comes amid one of Manchester United's most turbulent campaigns in decades. The club sits 14th in the Premier League standings with just 22 points from 19 matches, marking their lowest end-of-year position since 1989. United's recent form has been abysmal, with five losses in their last six league games and three straight matches without a goal. Speculation over Rashford's long-term future at United has intensified after he publicly stated his desire for a ""new challenge"" in mid-December. The academy graduate, who has been with the club since the age of seven, has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances, securing the Europa League, two FA Cups, and two League Cups along the way. Serie A giants Napoli are reportedly interested in acquiring Rashford, with United open to a loan deal if his substantial wages-exceeding £300,000 a week-are covered. Amorim also addressed the club's ongoing leadership crisis, calling for improvement from senior players. While confirming that United will activate an extension in Harry Maguire's contract until 2026, Amorim stressed the need for the defender to grow into a stronger leader. ""We are starving for leaders on the pitch,"" Amorim said. Meanwhile, United are close to securing a long-term contract extension for Amad Diallo, who has been one of the standout performers during Amorim's tenure. The Ivorian scored the winner in last month's Manchester derby and is expected to sign a deal keeping him at the club until 2029.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Read More |  Real Madrid eyeing Trent Alexander Arnold free transfer from Liverpool: ReportsMust Watch

On Day 2 of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Bumrah bowled only eight overs as Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna shouldered a chunk of the workload. Bumrah bowled only a solitary over after the lunch break and was seen leaving the ground in a van to a nearby hospital. Thereafter, Virat Kohli took charge of the Indian team on the field. But in a big relief for the Indian cricket team fans, Bumrah returned to the dressing room before the end of the day’s play at the SCG. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage But there is no update on the scans that Bumrah underwent. On Day 1, Bumrah got the wicket of Usman Khawaja and dismissed Marnus Labuschagne on Day 2. Gavaskar said that without Bumrah, it is going to need Herculean efforts from Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj and the rest of the bowlers to guide India through to a win. “Not too much (chance). Without Jasprit Bumrah, it’s going to be very difficult for India to win the Test match,” Gavaskar told India Today in an exclusive interview.  ‘Siraj, Prasidh not the same’ Gavaskar lauded Prasidh, who got the wickets of Steve Smith, Beau Webster and Alex Carey to have figures of 16-2-51-3 in the first innings, but said that India need Bumrah for making early inroads into the Australian attack. “I’m not saying it’s impossible as funny things have happened in cricket. Prasidh Krishna, after a disappointing first spell, came back brilliantly to get rid of Steve Smith and Alex Carey. If he bowls the way he did maybe he can be effective, but you need Bumrah for the initial breakthroughs. Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh may not have the same effect that Bumrah will bring,” Gavaskar added. At Stumps on Day 2, India got their lead up to 145 with six wickets left in their second innings. India could have been seven down, but Ravindra Jadeja got a reprieve after Steve Smith dropped him in the slip cordon.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Rishabh Pant's knock in first innings surprised us, says Andrew McDonaldMust Watch

Kohli’s tour to Australia ended on a disappointing note, with only one significant performance—a hundred in Perth. His current form has raised concerns, with immense criticism surrounding his spot in the team. Amidst these questions, Gavaskar feels it’s ultimately the selectors' responsibility to determine Kohli’s future in the red-ball format. He emphasised the importance of looking ahead, especially considering who will be available for the 2027 World Test Championship final. ""As a non-decision maker, I believe it’s up to the selection committee to decide the way forward. Ajit Agarkar is someone who will make the right decision for Indian cricket. What I’ve been emphasising over the last 8–10 days is that we need to consider who will be available for the 2027 World Test Championship final. The new cycle begins with the England series in June, and it’s important to assess which players are likely to be around in 2027. "" This should guide the selection process,"" Gavaskar exclusively told India Today.A tough outing for Kohli Kohli, who has historically enjoyed touring Australia, managed only 190 runs in 9 innings this time, at an average of 23.75. Overall, he had a tough year in Test cricket, scoring just 440 runs in 21 innings at an average of 23.15, with one fifty and one hundred. ""Ultimately, the selectors, led by Ajit Agarkar, need to look at who will be available for the 2027 final and who will still be selectable. As for this match, if India wins tomorrow, they still have a chance to make it to the World Test Championship final. "" After that, the focus will shift to the England tour,"" added Gavaskar.""Virat has technical fault"" Gavaskar also pointed out a technical flaw in Kohli’s technique, knowing that the batter was dismissed 8 out of 9 times by nicking the ball outside the off-stump. ""It’s not a temperament issue; it’s a technical fault. He's so front-footed that when the ball bounces, he's unable to adjust, which leads to him hanging his bat outside the line and getting out. This flaw has become embedded in his technique, and on pitches with significant bounce, he will continue to struggle.""Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also Read |  Yuzvendra Chahal and Dhanashree Verma unfollow each other, spark divorce rumoursMust Watch

Thanks to Pant's breathtaking innings, India ended the second day at 141 for 6, holding an overall lead of 145. Pant enthralled the packed SCG crowd with four monstrous sixes and six boundaries, keeping India afloat even as Australia remained in the driver's seat in the fifth Test. ""I think it was a brilliant knock, which is something you'd expect from Rishabh Pant, given the way he plays. What I liked about the innings was that he was playing in front of the stumps. He's got the power, he's got the timing, and he can hit the ball a long distance,"" Sunil Gavaskar said during exclusive interaction with India Today. ""It's when he is looking to play the premeditated shots, like the scoop or reverse scoop, that he can get into trouble because he doesn't have the same level of control over those as he does with shots in front of the wicket. His knock of 61 is what got India to this total. So without that knock, I think India probably won't even be 100 today,"" Gavaskar added. Pant's knock was the glue that held India's second innings together as the rest of the batting lineup struggled against Australia's relentless attack on a pitch offering both seam and bounce. After playing a restrained 40 in the first innings—following criticism for his shot selection at the MCG—Pant seemed to have a clear plan this time. AUS vs IND, Sydney Test Day 2: Report | Highlights He walked in when Australia, led by Boland and debutant Beau Webster, had the ball moving sharply off the deck. The steep bounce, especially from the Randwick End, caused trouble for several batters, including Virat Kohli, who edged one to slips off Boland. Earlier, KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal had also fallen to unplayable deliveries. Pant, however, came in with intent and smashed the first ball he faced into the long-on stands. He unleashed a flurry of aggressive strokes, including his trademark pull shots and a spectacular hit over point off Webster. His two sixes against Starc were particularly memorable. Despite dealing with unsolicited advice from a member of the coaching staff, which had reportedly unsettled him earlier, Pant played freely and decisively. His innings left Pat Cummins scrambling for answers, forcing the Australian skipper to push six fielders to the boundary. Pant eventually fell to Cummins, edging a rising delivery, but not before receiving a standing ovation from fans on both sides for his brilliant knock.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Tune InRead More |  Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma should play county cricket: Sanjay Manjrekar

Midfielder Olmo, 26, who helped Spain to European Championship glory last year, has been an integral part of Barcelona's team this season, while forward Victor, 23, has been largely restricted to substitute appearances. Barca are third in LaLiga, five points behind leaders Real Madrid. They had signed Olmo in August for around 55 million euros ($56.7 million) and Victor in July, but only registered them for the first half of the season due to LaLiga wage cap considerations. The Spanish football federation (RFEF) and LaLiga said in a joint statement they had rejected a request to register them both for the second half, saying a cancelled licence could not be revived for a player by the same club in the same season. ""The Monitoring Committee agrees not to grant the prior approval or the definitive licence requested by FC Barcelona for the players Daniel Olmo Carvajal and Pau Victor Delgado,"" the RFEF said. Two courts had previously rejected the club's requests. LaLiga had previously welcomed the legal rulings, saying additional spending is allowed so long-term injuries do not weaken a team, but the rule should not be exploited to allow the registration of players whose salaries exceed the limit. Spanish media said Barcelona plan to file a complaint to the Spanish government in a last-ditch attempt to allow the pair to play.

Despite Bumrah bowling just 10 overs, the Indian bowlers delivered a spirited performance, skittling Australia for 181 and securing a slender 4-run lead. Bumrah's fitness remains a concern after a scan, but Pant’s quick-fire 61 helped India extend their lead to 145. With the pitch continuing to assist the bowlers, India will look to capitalise on their advantage on Day 3. Let’s look at what the weather and pitch might offer on this potentially decisive day of the 5th Test. advertisementWeather report for Day 3 On Day 3 of the 5th Test, expect mostly sunny conditions throughout the day, with temperatures ranging from 24°C in the morning to a high of 32°C in the afternoon. Winds will be coming from the north-east at speeds between 13 to 30 km/h. The UV index will be high during the midday hours, with an extreme reading of 11 around 12 PM and 1 PM, so players and spectators should take precautions. Air quality is expected to be fair, with no rain forecast for the day. Cloud cover will increase towards the late afternoon, but conditions should remain favourable for cricket.Sydney pitch reportThe pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground has been quite challenging so far, with uneven bounce and excessive seam movement making life difficult for the batters. As Gavaskar pointed out, it’s not an ideal surface for Test cricket, with the unpredictable bounce posing a serious threat to the players.

The excessive movement off the pitch has led to 15 wickets falling in the match, highlighting the surface’s tricky nature. As we head into Day 3, there might be slight improvements for the batters. The sun has been playing its part, and with the grass beginning to dry and wear off, the pitch is expected to ease up marginally. However, don’t expect the conditions to drastically change. While it might become a little easier to bat as the day progresses, the surface will still be tough. Gavaskar pointed out that any total above 200 or 220 could put significant pressure on the Australian side, especially with the uneven bounce still a factor. ""To be honest, it's not an ideal pitch for Test cricket. A surface where the ball bounces unpredictably and seams excessively isn't conducive to good cricket. If this had happened in India, with 15 wickets falling, the Australian media and former players would have been criticising it relentlessly. This kind of pitch doesn't serve as a good advertisement for Test cricket,"" Sunil Gavaskar told India Today. Batting will remain challenging, and bowlers who can extract movement will have the advantage. India will aim for a target of at least 185 to 190 to make it tough for the Australians, with the pitch continuing to offer assistance to the bowlers. The key for both sides will be to adapt quickly to the conditions and make the most of any slight improvements in the surface.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Tune InAlso Read |  Virat Kohli's future in Test cricket depends on Indian selectors: Sunil GavaskarMust Watch

The 37-year-old Rohit had a disastrous outing in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. After missing the Perth Test due to personal reasons, Rohit returned for the Day-Night Test at the Adelaide Oval, but could not find his feet. In three Tests, Rohit scored only 31 runs at an average of 6.20 and a strike-rate of 28.18 with a top score of 10. In fact, in four out of five innings that he has batted in, Rohit failed to go past single digits. Gavaskar said that the Indian batter needs to play first-class matches to find his feet with the bat in hand. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “Well, there are not much of four-day games that are available, but if there are some like the Ranji Trophy, if Mumbai do qualify for the knockout stages, he should be looking to play some matches,” Gavaskar told India Today in an exclusive interview.   “I know it's a little bit unfair on some of the boys who've been playing in the initial and qualifying stages to make way for him. But in the larger interest of Indian cricket, I think if there is a spot for him to play, he should be doing that because that's the one way that he will be giving himself time out in the middle,” Gavaskar said. Gavaskar said that Rohit will only get his confidence back if he gets a big score under his belt after grinding hard for four to five hours in the middle. “It's not just about playing 15–20 overs or 35 overs in a 50-over game. It's about batting for a whole day, batting for 4.5 and 5 hours, and getting a big score. That is what is going to give him confidence for the Test matches,” Gavaskar added. Due to his poor run of form, Rohit also did not take part in the New Year’s Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. As far as Mumbai are concerned, they are placed third in Elite Group A in the Ranji Trophy and will next face Jammu and Kashmir.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also Read |  Without Jasprit Bumrah, India will find it difficult to win SCG Test: Sunil GavaskarMust Watch

— Proteas Men (@ProteasMenCSA) January 4, 2025 South Africa added 137 runs in the second session, surging to 566 for 7 by tea. Rickelton’s double hundred and Jansen's quick scoring ensured the hosts reached their highest home total in four years. Pakistan’s bowlers toiled hard, but the flat pitch and settled batters made their efforts seem fruitless. Mohammad Abbas yet again shone with the ball by picking three scalps and completed 100 wickets in Test cricket for Pakistan.  The visitors’ woes extended with the bat. Shan Masood’s side, already down a player with Saim Ayub injured, suffered a dismal start. Jansen dismissed Abdullah Shafique and Muhammad Ghulam in quick succession, while Kagiso Rabada sent back Saud Shakeel for a duck. The trio of early dismissals reduced Pakistan to 20/3, effectively 20/4. Babar Azam, opening for the first time in Test cricket, partnered with Mohammad Rizwan to provide some stability before stumps. However, with a mammoth deficit to overcome and South Africa’s bowlers in rhythm, Pakistan faced an uphill battle to save the match. This Test also marked the third instance in South Africa since 2016 where both teams scored over 300 runs across the first two days. South Africa’s commanding performance with both bat and ball has left them just six wickets away from forcing Pakistan to follow on, putting them on the brink of another home victory.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 4, 2025Also Read |  Shivam Dube and his wife blessed with baby girl: Our hearts grew biggerMust Watch

— Afghanistan Cricket Board (@ACBofficials) January 4, 2025 Ismat Alam, playing his debut Test, joined Rahmat and the duo began to turn the tide. Despite facing a bouncer barrage and a blow to the helmet, Ismat remained composed. Rahmat, meanwhile, survived an lbw scare against Sikandar Raza and responded with attacking strokes, eventually reaching his century off 209 balls. Ismat played the ideal support role, showcasing maturity beyond his years. He shifted gears after settling in, striking boundaries to relieve pressure. He brought up his maiden Test fifty shortly before the day’s play was interrupted by rain. For Zimbabwe, Muzarabani was the standout bowler, claiming 4 for 48. Ngarava contributed with two wickets, while Raza toiled through 23 overs without success. Despite their efforts, Zimbabwe struggled on a pitch that slowed down as the ball aged, making batting easier for Afghanistan. Rahmat’s marathon innings ended when Muzarabani trapped him lbw with a delivery that nipped back sharply. Without DRS in the series, Rahmat had to walk back, visibly disappointed. Rashid Khan added quick runs before rain cut short the day, leaving Afghanistan with a solid lead and three wickets in hand. With a daunting target likely for Zimbabwe to chase on a deteriorating surface, Afghanistan’s recovery has firmly tilted the balance in their favour.

Notably, Pant played a blistering knock of 61 (33) on Day 2 of the fifth Test against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney. The southpaw registered the second-fastest half-century by an Indian batter in Tests off 29 balls and helped India build on their second innings lead. Pant’s knock came on the back of severe criticism from the legendary India batter Sunil Gavaskar who lashed out at him for his shot selection in the previous Test in Melbourne. AUS vs IND 5th Test Day 3 Live Recently, Manjrekar hailed Pant for his innings, saying that his knock could prove to be the difference between the two teams in the ongoing Test. He also mentioned how he would not be averaging over 40 through mad batting. “If India go on to win the game and Australia don't quite get there, it’s Rishabh Pant’s innings that's going to be the difference. He took the pitch out of the equation, on that same pitch where top class batters are struggling. He's forced the Australian captain to have fielders in the deep. And if it was just him, taking a chance, if it was madness, he would not be averaging over 40 in test cricket. He would not have what seven 90s and six 100s. I keep forgetting that number. I mean he wouldn't have had that kind of a record, so you've got to respect what he has,” Manjrekar said on ESPNCricinfo. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full CoveragePant has to play the way he thinks is best: Manjrekar Further speaking ahead, Manjrekar said that there’s no need for the management to get into Pant’s head and the youngster should be allowed to bat the way he thinks is the best. “And when he got out, if you saw his reaction, he aims for the sky. He would have got a big one, he would have got 120, 130 in quick time, and then the match is sealed for Australia. They have no chance, and that is what you get with Pant. And you don't want to get into his software in any way. He has to play the way he thinks best,” he added. Meanwhile, courtesy of Pant’s quick-fire innings, India finished Day 2 on 142/6 leading by 146 runs.

After having missed the Perth Testr, which India won, Rohit came in to the side and decided to relinquish his spot as the opener to KL Rahul. The experiment as a No.6 batter turned out to be a failure as Rohit struggled to get off the blocks and was restored back at opener's spot in the Melbourne Test.  However, the India captain scored 12 runs across both innings as India lost the game. Rohit then decided to step down for the side for the crucial match in Sydney and handed the captaincy to Jasprit Bumrah. In the 5 innings he batted, Rohit scored just 31 runs at an average of 6.20.  With India not playing Test until the England tour, questions have been raised on Rohit's spot in the side.

India needed to win the Sydney Test to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but their batters failed on a spicy pitch to allow Australia to end there 10-year-long wait.

Coming into the day, India were on 141/6, leading by 145 runs in the second innings with Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja at the crease. The duo couldn’t add much to their overnight scores with captain Cummins getting both crucial scalps for his team. Following their dismissals, the Indian tail also couldn’t add much to the score as they were bowled out for 157 setting Australia a target of 162 runs in the fourth innings. AUS vs IND 5th Test Day 3 Highlights| Full Scorecard In reply, Australia got off to a good start, thanks to some wayward bowling by India, as Sam Konstas (22 off 17) and Usman Khawaja added 39 runs for the first wicket. However, Prasidh Krishna did bring India back in the game with his three strikes but Usman Khawaja (41), Travis Head (34*) and Beau Webster (39*) made sure there were no more hiccups in the chase for the hosts. As a result, Australia chased down the target in 27 overs and won the series by 3-1.

India lost the 5th Test by 6 wickets, surrendering the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in 10 years.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ind-vs-aus-india-lose-border-gavaskar-trophy-sydney-test-match-jasprit-bumrah-injury-2659900-2025-01-05,"India's decade long domination of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy came to a grinding halt as Australia hammered the Jasprit Bumrah side by 6 wickets on Sunday, January 5. Playing on Day 3 of the final Test match in Sydney, India simply failed to contain the Australian batting line-up as the hosts chased down a target of 162 runs in just 27 overs. AUS vs IND, 5th Test Match: Full Scorecard Jasprit Bumrah's terrific tour of Australia came to an anti-climactic end as the fast bowler was not able to take the field in India's bowling innings on Day 3. The stand-in captain was forced out of action on the previous day due to back spasm and could not take even field in the final innings of the match. India fail to reach WTC Final for first time in 3 editions In the absence of Bumrah, India bowled like headless chickens, spraying the ball everywhere. It was in stark contrast to how Scott Boland and Pat Cummins operated in the Test, especially on Day 3 morning to knock over the last four Indian wickets for just 16 runs. India would have hoped for more fight with the bat from Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, but it was not meant to be on a pitch that had excessive seam movement, unlike the Sydney Test.   AUS vs IND, 5th Test: Day 3 Highlights Mohammed Siraj, who showed signs of returning to form on Day 2, started off with 5-wides in his first over. Youngster Prasidh Krishna followed suit in the very next over, adding to India's misery. Australia accepted the New Year's gift with open arms and got off to a rapid start - almost mimicking the powerplay in T20 cricket. Chasing 162 runs, Australia were 50/1 in 6 overs, which any team would have gleefully accepted even in T20 cricket, let alone Test. The only pressure that India were able to realistically put was during a 3-over block by Prasidh Krishna, who was able to pick up wickets of Marnus Labuschange and Steve Smith just before Lunch. Post Lunch, Australia once again came out looking to take the attack to India. Travis Head and Usman Khawaja deposited the Indian pacers for boundaries and took away hope of winning the Test match in no time. There was a slight skip in India's step after removing Khawaja for 41, but by that time the muted celebrations suggested that India had already accepted their fate in this series. Khawaja's departure did not deter Australia's resolve. Debutant Beau Webster, who scored a fifty in the first innings, showed no signs of nerves at all and combined INDIA DROP BGT AFTER 10 YEARS Since India's fateful tour of 2014/15, where then-captain MS Dhoni retired from Test cricket midway through the series, this was the first series that India lost against Australia. Under the captaincy of Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane India had dominated the competition over the past 10 years, winning memorable series both home and away. Kohli's historic win in 2018/19 in Australia made the rivalry one of the most marketable bilateral series in the cricketing world. In Kohli's temporary absence, India grew in stature by winning the 2020/21 series with a thrilling finish at the Gabba. However, things turned out to be very very different in 2024/25 series as India not only failed to perform with the bat but also got drawn into multiple controversies, almost reminding fans of the terrible tour 10 years ago.INDIAN BATTING UNIT BRINGS TEAM'S DOWNFALL The main reason behind India's series loss was their woeful batting performance. Out of the 10 innings that India batted in - 6 of them saw totals less than 200. Only 3 times India were able to break the barrier of 200 runs - once in their winning Test at Perth (487/6d), and one time each in Melbourne (369) and Brisbane (260). This in turn put incredible pressure on the bowling unit, who simply did not get enough rest between their overs. Only twice in the series India batted more than 100 overs in a single innings. They mostly hovered between 35-78 overs, which resulted in two injuries to the Indian bowling line-up. While Akash Deep got ruled out from the final Test of the series, Bumrah's body broke down in Sydney after bowling a record number of overs in the previous Test match in Melbourne.FAULTY TEAM SELECTION Australia's team for this Test series was set from a long time back. This current unit under the leadership of Pat Cummins has played for a long time together. In fact, in the final Test of the series, this team did not have a single player in their 20s. Barring Sam Konstas who debuted at the age of 19, every player was over 30 years of age. In the series, Australia played just one player in their 20s - Nathan McSweeney who was 25 years of age. The argument here is that the Australian team knew what they were doing and set up the conditions to their strengths - which was fast bowling. They left a lot of grass on the pitch, made the surfaces hard and let the natural degradation of the pitch do its thing throughout the course of the series. While Australia played at least 4 fast bowlers + one spinner in every Test, India inexplicably played 2 spinners in the final two Test matches of the series. The team could not settle into one line-up, playing three different spinners in the first three Test matches of the series, and then resorting to 3 pacers + two spinners + Nitish Reddy. The team selection reflected in India's performance on the field, as the pace of all fast bowlers consistently came down as the series progressed. Jasprit Bumrah, who is known for consistently bowling above 140 KMPH, dropped himself down to 125s, after simply failing to cope with the added workload.BUMRAH'S LEGENDARY SERIES At one point of the series, the Indian attack looked so toothless that it became a running joke on social media that the the bowling unit was Bumrah and nothing. Memes flooded the internet as Bumrah kept rescuing the bowling attack by picking up timely wickets. Bumrah was the saving grace for India's batting unit as well, who kept getting out for below-par totals in all of the Test matches. If Bumrah would not have kept the Australian line-up in check, this series could have looked much uglier for India. Bumrah picked 32 wickets at an average of 13.06, which is not only other-wordly, but the best-ever by any Indian bowler against Australia in a Test series. Bumrah perhaps deserved a little better from the entire Indian unit, who simply failed to find the edge in the marquee tour.RETIREMENTS, CONTROVERSIES, LEAKS The signs of fraction in the Indian team presented themselves when Ravichandran Ashwin retired from the tour midway after the 3rd Test match in Brisbane. Ashwin's father lashed out after his son returned home, stating that his son had been humiliated enough and could not take it anymore. After India lost the Melbourne Test, their first in the last 3 tours, dressing room leaks took over the media, which reported of a Mr. Fixit, who had the ambition to become the interim captain of the Indian team, which is in its transitory phase. By this time, it was clear that Rohit Sharma was not going to play the Test match and either had stood down, or had been dropped from the side. Sharma was quick to clarify the situation, in the most unprecedented manner. Rohit, not a part of the 5th Test gave a full interview to the Indian broadcaster on Day 2 and said that no one dropped him from the team, but that he had stepped down. Rohit added that this was a one-off, and he was not retiring from the format, contrary to the media reports. The BGT 2024/25, would be remembered as one of the most dramatic series in the recent past. On-field controversies, off-field shenanigans, multiple crunch moments, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was truly one to remember.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  Sydney Test: No Jasprit Bumrah with ball in huge blow for India on Day 3Must Watch

We were in the game today also. It was not totally one-sided...I think yeah it was a well fought series.

Addressing the press after India’s six-wicket loss in the Sydney Test, which led to conceding the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Gambhir said he is confident that the two senior batters would make decisions that are in the best interests of the Indian team. | Sydney Test: Full Scorecard | Both Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma struggled to deliver with the bat during the five-Test series, which highlighted India’s broader batting failures. Rohit Sharma opted to sit out the fifth Test after acknowledging his dismal form, while Virat Kohli played in Sydney but failed in both innings. Questions surrounding their places in the Test team have grown louder, particularly with the start of a new cycle in the World Test Championship. India are set to begin their new campaign in June next year with a five-Test series in England. “I can’t talk about the future of any player,” Gambhir said in Sydney on Sunday, 5th January. “It’s up to them. But, yes, what I can say is they still have the hunger, they still have the passion. They are tough people. I hope they will do everything they can to take Indian cricket forward.

He would also pull off some crucial knocks with the bat as he and Akash Deep helped India to avoid follow-on at the Gabba.

Bumrah wasn't in action with the ball on Day 3 of the crucial match due to a back spasm that limited his overs to just 10 in the game across both innings.  This meant that India went into defending the total of 162 without their main weapon in the ranks and Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj were forced to take up the main workload. Australia were able to nullify the threat from the Bumrah-less attack effectively and ended up winning the match by 6 wickets and claimed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 3-1.  | Sydney Test: Full Scorecard | Speaking at the post-match press conference, Gambhir claimed that it wasn't due to Bumrah's absence the team was unable to get the win. The India coach said that they still had a good side and weren't able to get the result.  ""First of all, I don't want to say that, since Jasprit Bumrah wasn't there, we couldn't get the result. We had our moments, and it would have been nice if he had been there. We still had 5 bowlers and a good team that shouldn't be dependent on one individual. We didn't get the result, as simple as it gets,"" said Gambhir. Absolutely oustanding Bumrah ended up picking 32 wickets in the series at a stunning average of 13.06. Gambhir said it was an outstanding performance from the pacer and did everything possible from his side during the series. Gambhir also claimed that Bumrah got support from the other side from Mohammed Siraj and some of the young bowlers.  ""Absolutely outstanding. I can't say more than that. Whenever he has come on to bowl, he has done a fabulous job. He has done everything possible from his side. He has also been helped from the other side by Mohammed Siraj and some of the young boys as well,"" said Gambhir.  Bumrah would end up being adjudged as the Player Of The Series for his performance.

Katich delivered a strong assessment, saying Rohit's numbers in the last six months in Tests are far from impressive, and that 37-year-olds aren't ideally suited to playing at the top of the order against the red ball. Sydney Test: Full Scorecard Rohit Sharma's future in the Test side has been a subject of debate. The India captain ended the Australia tour with just 31 runs in three Tests before he 'stood down' from the final Test in Sydney. Despite the change in the team, India lost the Sydney Test by six wickets following another batting failure. India opted to bat first and managed 185 on a green top under dark clouds on Day 1. Despite losing Jasprit Bumrah to an injury on Day 2, India bowled Australia out for 181, taking a four-run lead. However, when they needed to step up with the bat, India flopped again, managing just 157 before Australia chased down 162 with relative ease against a Bumrah-led attack. Rohit ended the 2024–25 Test season with 164 runs in eight Tests at an average of 10.93 runs per innings. ""Only he knows whether he has the hunger and drive at 37 to go again. England is not going to be an easy series. England are on their way up. They have some good young quicks coming through. Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse are doing well,"" Katich said when asked if Rohit should play the England tour, starting 20th June. ""I dare say that will be a tough tour if he chooses to go on it and the Indian selectors pick him, first and foremost. Those numbers are not for pretty reading. ""Test cricket isn’t a place for 37-year-olds at the top of the order. History suggests that, and only Rohit Sharma knows whether he has got the hunger to go on,"" he said.ROHIT HAS GOOD FUTURE IN STAND-UP COMEDY: KATICH Despite not featuring in the XI in Sydney, Rohit remained adamant that his decision to miss the final Test was taken based on form and it was not a retirement call. In a candid interview on Day 2 of the Test match, Rohit said he ""was not going anywhere"" when asked about his Test future. The 37-year-old also lashed out at critics, saying he was hopeful of a change in fortunes in his Test form in five months' time. ""I am confident things will change. At the same time, I have to be realistic as well. At the same time, some person is sitting with a mic, laptop or a pen and writing stuff; our lives do not change because of what that person is writing or saying,"" he had said. Responding to the interview, Katich made a tongue-in-cheek remark, saying Rohit has a good future as a stand-up comedian after he hangs up his boots. ""Well, if you look at the numbers, they are damning. We saw it in this Test. It was very selfless of him to opt out of the Test. I saw in that interview, very well-spoken. There’s no doubt he has a future after he is done playing cricket in stand-up comedy because his humour was very good,"" Katich added.

Notably, Kohli continued his poor form in the recent five-match Test series against Australia, accumulating just 190 runs from five matches (9 innings) at an average of 23.75 with one hundred to his name. Following his poor show, Irfan Pathan heavily criticised the star India batter highlighting his poor average in the first innings. He also goes on to mention Kohli’s depleting numbers in the post-covid era and said that even a youngster can average between 25-30 with regular chances. AUS vs IND 5th Test Day 3 Highlights| Full Scorecard “In 2024, in the first innings where the game is set up, Virat Kohli averages just 15. If we take out his numbers in the last five years, he doesn’t even average 30. Is this what the Indian team deserves from his senior player? Instead of him, you give regular chances to a youngster, give him time to get prepared, even he can average 25-30. Because we are discussing about the team here not the individuals,” said Pathan on Star Sports. “India don’t need superstar culture, they need team culture. Tell me the last time when Virat Kohli played domestic cricket when he was free? When was the last time it happened? It has almost been a decade. Since then even the legendary Sachin Tendulkar played it and has retired altogether. He didn’t have to play, but even he came to play,” he added. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full CoverageKohli's poor form since 2020 Since 2020, Kohli has scored 2028 runs from 39 matches (69 innings) at an average of 30.72 with three hundreds and nine fifties. Since 2024, he’s accumulated 440 runs from 11 matches (21 innings) at an average of 23.15 with one hundred and one fifty. His first innings average since 2024 is 15.63 compared to 33.50 in the second innings. Due to his prolonged poor form, Kohli’s Test average has gone from 54.97 in 2019 to 46.85 now. Hence, Kohli has gone through one of the worst slumps in Test cricket as his place in the team is also being questioned repeatedly. It remains to be seen how long the star will be allowed to continue or will the management finally take a harsh call on his Test future with the England tour lined up.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Virat Kohli riles-up Australian fans with 'sandpaper' gestures on Day 3

Gavaskar added that it would have been nice to hand over the trophy alongside his good friend Allan Border.

“I certainly would have loved to have been there for the presentation. After all, it is the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and it is about Australia and India,” Gavaskar was quoted by Code Sports.  “I mean, I am here on the ground. To me, it should not matter that Australia won when it comes to the presentation. They played better cricket so they won. That’s fine. Just because I am an Indian (I did not present the trophy). I would have been happy to present the trophy with my good friend Allan Border,” he added. Gavaskar however mentioned himself that the organisers told him that he was not needed for the presentation if Australia won the series and took back the BGT. Gavaskar said that he was perplexed at the decision given the series was named after him and Border. ""I was told just before the Test started that was going to be the situation. If India didn't win or draw the series I wouldn't be required...I'm not feeling sad, but I'm just feeling a little perplexed.

Will Young’s unbeaten 90 off 86 balls capped a comprehensive performance on a chilly, wind-swept Wellington day. On a green-tinged pitch, New Zealand’s pacers exploited the conditions to devastating effect, reducing Sri Lanka to 23 for 4 inside the powerplay. Matt Henry led the charge with a sensational spell, finishing with 4 for 19 from 10 overs. He removed Pathum Nissanka with a full, seaming delivery that induced a leading edge, while conceding just six runs in his first five overs. Perfect Perth, sore Sydney: Jasprit Bumrah vs Australia ends in an anti-climax At the other end, Jacob Duffy added to the carnage, unsettling Kusal Mendis with a sharp bouncer that the batter inside-edged onto his stumps. Kamindu Mendis compounded Sri Lanka's woes with a reckless run-out, as Mitchell Santner’s pinpoint underarm throw hit the stumps. Captain Charith Asalanka fell for a duck after being undone by Nathan Smith’s short-pitched delivery, confirmed on review to have brushed his bat. By the time Janith Liyanage joined Avishka Fernando, Sri Lanka was reeling, struggling to mount a recovery. Avishka Fernando led a valiant fightback, crafting an enterprising 50 while adding 87 for the fifth wicket with Liyanage. The pair capitalized on the reduced lateral movement, finding boundaries square of the wicket and handling the short ball effectively. However, Liyanage’s dismissal for 36, mistiming a Santner delivery to deep midwicket, signaled the beginning of the end. Wanindu Hasaranga contributed a brisk 35, and Chamindu Wickramasinghe chipped in with 22, but New Zealand never relinquished control. Exceptional fielding, led by Mark Chapman’s agility at point, compounded Sri Lanka’s struggles as they were bowled out for 178 in the 44th over. The target of 179 was made to look trivial by New Zealand’s top three. Rachin Ravindra set the tone with a flurry of boundaries through the off-side during the powerplay, while Will Young punished anything short with authoritative pulls and hooks. The hosts raced to 70 without loss after 10 overs, capitalising on Sri Lanka’s inconsistent lines. Ravindra departed for 39, trying to flick a leg-side delivery but falling to a simple catch. However, Young remained imperious, driving and pulling with confidence as he brought up his tenth ODI fifty. Mark Chapman supported him with a steady 32*, and the duo’s unbroken partnership of 87 ensured a smooth finish. New Zealand reached the target with 23.4 overs to spare, underscoring their dominance with both bat and ball.

Kohli was dismissed multiple times in the same fashion during the series. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/border-gavaskar-trophy-australia-vs-india-virat-kohli-off-side-woes-ab-de-villiers-2659983-2025-01-05,"AB de Villiers suggested that Virat Kohli needs to refocus after each delivery to overcome his off-side woes after the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Kohli, despite a hundred in the first match of the series, struggled to find consistency in the remaining games with Australia exploiting his weakness outside off-stump regularly. The star batter was dismissed 8 out of 9 times with deliveries outside the off-stump during the series.  Kohli was left frustrated at himself after his final innings in the Sydney Test as India slumped to a loss in the match and lost the series 1-3. Speaking in a live show on his X account, De Villiers backed the Indian star to overcome the weakness and pointed out how he also struggled with certain deliveries during his playing career.  AUS vs IND, 5th Test Day 3: Highlights | Scorecard | Report ""Of course, he can. Every single batter in the world has got some sort of a weakness. For me it was the straight ball hitting my pads. Even towards the back end of my career and in the form of my life, all the experience that I needed to go out and score runs.""  ""I remember a series against England. I started off well and scored runs in Durban, everything was brilliant. Then I ran into James Anderson and Stuart Broad with the new ball,"" said De Villiers. Reset your mind De Villiers went on to say that the issue with Kohli has been the fact that he has been too involved in the game and concerned about his performance for the side that he tends to forget to reset his mind. The former Proteas skipper suggested that the Indian star needs to refocus himself after each delivery.  ""It takes a lot of character, a lot of hunger, lot of hours in the nets. I think the thing is to reset your mind, everytime. I think with Virat, he gets involved with the battle on the field. That's one of his biggest strengths and it can also be a weakness. During this series, we saw him have individual battles with some of the players, the crowd got under his skin. Virat loves the fight, but when you're not in the form of your life, it's best to get rid of those things. As a batter, it is to reset every single and realise every ball is an event and just forget about the bowler.""  ""I think sometimes Virat forgets about that because of his fighting spirit and the nature of the man wanting to be involved and show the whole of India he is there to fight for them.""  ""The skill, experience and greatness of the guy are not an issue. It's about the refocus after every single ball. Maybe sometimes he gets too involved,"" said De Villiers.

— CODE Cricket (@codecricketau) January 5, 2025 On the day, India's decade-long domination of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy came to a grinding halt as Australia hammered the Jasprit Bumrah side by 6 wickets. Playing on Day 3 of the final Test match in Sydney, India simply failed to contain the Australian batting line-up as the hosts chased down a target of 162 runs in just 27 overs. In the absence of Bumrah, India bowled like headless chickens, spraying the ball everywhere. It was in stark contrast to how Scott Boland and Pat Cummins operated in the Test, especially on Day 3 morning to knock over the last four Indian wickets for just 16 runs. India would have hoped for more fight with the bat from Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, but it was not meant to be on a pitch that had excessive seam movement, unlike the Sydney Test. Mohammed Siraj, who showed signs of returning to form on Day 2, started off with 5-wides in his first over. Youngster Prasidh Krishna followed suit in the very next over, adding to India's misery. Australia accepted the New Year's gift with open arms and got off to a rapid start - almost mimicking the powerplay in T20 cricket. Chasing 162 runs, Australia were 50/1 in 6 overs, which any team would have gleefully accepted even in T20 cricket, let alone Test. The only pressure that India were able to realistically put was during a 3-over block by Prasidh Krishna, who was able to pick up wickets of Marnus Labuschange and Steve Smith just before Lunch. Post Lunch, Australia once again came out looking to take the attack to India. Travis Head and Usman Khawaja deposited the Indian pacers for boundaries and took away hope of winning the Test match in no time. There was a slight skip in India's step after removing Khawaja for 41, but by that time the muted celebrations suggested that India had already accepted their fate in this series. Khawaja's departure did not deter Australia's resolve. Debutant Beau Webster, who scored a fifty in the first innings, showed no signs of nerves at all and got Australia to the winning total with ease.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  No Bumrah, no joy: India surrender Border-Gavaskar Trophy after 7 years in SydneyMust Watch

Manjrekar referred to Gautam Gambhir's pre-match press conference, in which the head coach refused to confirm whether Rohit would play the fifth Test. However, stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah clarified that the decision not to play the Sydney Test was Rohit's own choice. ""Obviously, our captain, you know, has shown his leadership as well.

The former India batter-turned-pundit was responding to Rohit's comments from the interview, where he stated he was not retiring anytime soon and criticised those questioning his place in the side. ""I loved that interview. That first bit where he said, I couldn’t have another out-of-form batter in the XI, and that’s why he opted out. But there were some other emotions too. ""One thing that a lot of players say is that ‘I will decide my future’. I have a problem with that. You can decide your future with regards to retirement, but somebody else has got the job to decide your future as a player and captain. ""That’s the chairman of selectors. You have got to respect the hierarchy, however big you are. If the chairman of selectors is strong and he believes in the long-term health of Indian cricket, he has the power to decide whether your career should end now, or you get a few more matches, or one more series.

Sabalenka is bidding to become the first woman to lift three straight Australian Open trophies since Swiss Martina Hingis won from 1997 to 1999, and she will head to Melbourne Park brimming with confidence. ""I'm super happy to lift this trophy,"" said Sabalenka. ""It's a really important tournament before heading into the Australian Open. The final match was a bit tricky, (both of us) were over-hitting. ""I'm really curious about the average speed of our shots. It was a crazy match, and I'm really glad I got this win."" The world No.1 from Belarus, outclassed in last year's final by Elena Rybakina before going on to win a second straight Melbourne Park crown, appeared off the pace against Kudermetova and lost the first set by dropping her serve for a second time.

""That was really great tennis from her,"" Sabalenka said. ""It was really aggressive. She has some variations and she was using it really well. She definitely deserved to be in the final. I'm pretty sure if she continues working the way she is, then she will be in the top 50 soon."" A delicate drop shot handed Sabalenka the break, and the 26-year-old appeared much more like her usual dominant self in the rest of the set as she forced a decider, much to the delight of fans at a packed Pat Rafter Arena. Sabalenka offered another reminder of her class by breaking in the deciding set with a neat crosscourt forehand winner and staved off a late comeback attempt from Kudermetova to win her first title of the season.

For the first time in 10 years, Australia beat India in a Test series as the Asian giants' bid to complete an Australian hat-trick came to a grinding halt. AUS vs IND, 5th Test Match: Full Scorecard Gavaskar, speaking to the broadcasters after India lost the Sydney Test by six wickets, said that while players deserve criticism for not stepping up in Australia, the coaches should also be held accountable. The former captain highlighted that India's batting failures began in the home series against New Zealand and continued without resolution during the Australian tour, adding that it was something the coaching group of Gautam Gambhir, Abhishek Nayar, and Ryan ten Doeschate failed to address in time. India crossed the 200-run mark only thrice in 10 innings as they failed to make use of the edge gained after winning the series opener in Perth. The Australian flop show came after the humiliation at home when New Zealand out-batted and out-bowled India to clinch an unprecedented 3-0 series win in India. ""What was the coaching staff doing? Batting coach? Against New Zealand, India were bowled out for 46. In the remaining matches, they were not able to do well, and they lost the series. There was no character in the batting order. In Australia too, India lacked solidity in the batting order,"" Gavaskar told Star Sports. ""We have to ask questions: 'Brothers, what did you do? Why is there no improvement?' If you tell me the bowling was unplayable (in both series) and then our batters were not able to stand up to it, then it's okay. Even the best players can't face unplayable bowling. But it was not the case. ""Tell me, what have you done?""SHOULD COACHING STAFF CONTINUE? Gavaskar emphasised that if players are scrutinised for their poor performances and their futures are questioned, coaches shouldn't be exempt. There has been plenty of debate about the Test futures of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma after their failures with the bat in Australia. While Rohit managed just 31 runs in three Tests before dropping himself for the fifth Test, Kohli scored 194 runs across five Tests at an average of 23.75. However, after the hundred in Perth, he managed just 85 runs in the last four Tests of the series. ""In these programmes, we keep asking whether this player should play in the future, that player should play in the future... I am saying we should also ask whether the coaching staff should continue. ""We have two-three months before the England tour. I am not talking about the Champions Trophy. I am a Test player. I understand ODI cricket, but not that much. ""I want to ask, 'What did you do?' In what way will you improve them? These 'throwdowns, throwdowns', nothing happens because of that. You had to help improve their technique and temperament. You didn't do it. ""Yes, definitely question the players for not scoring runs. But ask the question to the coaches: 'What were you doing?'"" The Gambhir era has got off to a rocky start, with India losing an ODI series in Sri Lanka and back-to-back Test series.

The Asian Giants ended up losing the fifth and final Test by six wickets in Sydney and failed to retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2015. A lot of things went wrong for India across five Tests, be it the change of leadership, constant shuffling of the batting line-up and the misfiring of the bowling attack. There were several reasons which collectively brought India’s downfall in Australia, preventing them from scripting a hat-trick of series wins down under despite getting off to a good start in the series. As India ended their second cycle of the World Test  Championship (WTC) on a disappointing note with the Australia series loss, let’s have a look at what exactly went wrong for the Rohit Sharma-led side down under: AUS vs IND 5th Test Day 3 Highlights| Full ScorecardBatting failure Apart from the second innings of the first Test, Indian batting hardly looked in any control as they surrendered in front of the relentless Australian bowling attack. The Indian batting crossed the 300-run mark just once out of the nine innings as compared to Australia who crossed 300 runs thrice in the series. Yashasvi Jaiswal (391 runs) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (298 runs) were the top two scorers for the visitors as the senior players such as Virat Kohli (190 runs) and Rohit Sharma (31 runs) failed to play impactful knocks. In Adelaide and Melbourne, India needed some more runs on the board which could well have shifted the balance of the game.Team Selection India went in with three specialist seamers and two all-rounders in the first Test which pretty much turned out to be their template for the rest of the tour. The move worked in Perth as the visitors managed to register a massive 295-run win to go 1-0 up in the series. However, as the series progressed, India were forced to do a lot of chopping and changing -- first to include captain Rohit Sharma in the playing XI, who missed the first Test and later to allow him to open the innings. As a result, the top order could never settle, resulting in the loss of form for KL Rahul. Furthermore, the fragile batting lineup also didn't allow the inclusion of a specialist seamer, which again proved to be disastrous. Border Gavaskar Trophy: Full CoverageLack of support for Jasprit Bumrah Jasprit Bumrah etched his name in the history books as he registered the best-ever performance by an Indian bowler in a Test series in Australia. The right-arm speedster finished as the highest wicket-taker across five Tests with 32 wickets from five matches (nine innings) at an average of 13.06 with three five-wicket hauls. As a result, he was deservedly adjudged Player of the Series despite India ending up on the losing side. However, Bumrah failed to get support from his teammates who just failed to emulate his heroics. Bumrah’s new-ball partner, Mohammed Siraj, picked 20 wickets from five matches at an average of 31.15 with best figures of 4/98. Apart from Siraj, the inexperienced trio of Akash Deep (5 wickets at an average of 54), Harshit Rana (4 wickets at an average of 50.75) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (5 wickets at an average of 38) also failed to shine on their maiden tour to Australia. As a result, Bumrah had to do much of the heavy lifting and was often the lone warrior in the Indian pace attack.Poor Captaincy India captain Rohit Sharma came into the limelight time and again throughout the series for his failure to maintain control of the game. Whenever India had Australia on the backfoot after a flurry of wickets, the hosts managed to claw their way back into the match with a game-changing partnership. Rohit was often seen going into ultra-defensive mode, especially in the second innings of the Melbourne Test when India could’ve pressed on Australia and bundled them out quickly to set up the match. However, the India skipper played the waiting game, allowing Australia to make a comeback. The same happened in Brisbane when his lack of proactive captaincy allowed Travis Head and Steve Smith to forge a massive partnership.Virat Kohli-Rohit Sharma failure Indian seniors Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma failed to have an impact in the series as they were found out big time against the potent Australian attack. Rohit Sharma joined the team after missing the first Test and came on to bat in the middle order. The India skipper failed to adapt to the new batting position and forced himself to open again in Melbourne, but failure followed him everywhere. Rohit could only accumulate 31 runs from six innings with even the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep outscoring him. Apart from Rohit, Kohli also didn’t have a memorable time with the bat despite scoring a century in the first Test in Perth. Since then, the India batter continued to fall prey to his outside-off weakness, which was very well exploited by Australian bowlers who managed to keep him quiet throughout the series. As a result, the Indian batting star could only accumulate 190 runs from nine innings and became one of the major reasons for India’s downfall.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  AUS vs IND: Virat Kohli riles-up Australian fans with 'sandpaper' gestures on Day 3

The Australian skipper heaped praise on Kohli after the hosts won the Sydney Test by six wickets to claim the series 3-1. “It’s always been a wonderful contest.

Gavaskar’s comments come in the wake of Gambhir’s press conference in Sydney on January 5, where he urged players to prioritise red-ball cricket to address their poor form following an ordinary Border-Gavaskar Trophy performance. Speaking to India Today, Gavaskar expressed concern over India’s ongoing batting woes, pointing out disappointing performances during the 0-3 defeat to New Zealand at home and the recent 1-3 loss in the five-Test series against Australia. Sydney Test: Full Scorecard “Well, we will find out whether it’s lip service,” Gavaskar said. “There is some domestic cricket happening in the next 15 days. We will find out whether what the coach wants actually happens and what the players do. There are some players who have taken their places for granted, thinking they cannot be dropped, no matter what. Let us see if they obey the coach’s call and play. Let’s wait and see.” The second phase of the Ranji Trophy begins on January 23, featuring two rounds of group stage matches before the knockout stages in January-February. However, India’s limited-overs series against England is set to commence on January 22, raising concerns about the availability of star players for the premier domestic competition.  Notably, after former BCCI secretary Jay Shah’s directive last season, more players have participated in domestic red-ball competitions like the Duleep Trophy and Ranji Trophy. However,  a few senior players, including Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have not featured in domestic cricket in recent years. In fact, Kohli has not played domestic cricket since the 2012-13 season. India’s batters, barring Yashasvi Jaiswal and Nitish Reddy, failed to deliver consistently in the Australian series. Rohit managed just 31 runs in three Tests before dropping himself for the final match in Sydney, while Kohli, despite a hundred in Perth, struggled for runs, scoring just 85 across the last four Tests. Kohli’s recurring dismissals outside the off-stump underscored his inability to address a long-standing technical issue, leaving the star batter visibly frustrated. DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY 2 PRACTICE GAMES?  Gavaskar also criticised India’s reluctance to schedule practice matches during overseas tours, arguing that warm-up games could have addressed the team’s issues with form and rhythm. India played just one truncated two-day game against the Prime Minister’s XI before the Adelaide Test, which was affected by rain and reduced to a single day. The former batting great highlighted the importance of preparation for India’s upcoming five-Test series in England, scheduled to begin on June 22. Having failed to qualify for the World Test Championship final, Gavaskar believes the England tour is an opportunity for India to recalibrate. “India has enough talent and a strong bench strength, but it needs to be utilised,” Gavaskar said. “Practice matches help those out of form, whether batters or bowlers, regain rhythm. When the Indian team arrived in Australia, there were 57 days until the last day of the series. Out of those 57 days, they played cricket for only 27 days, including five Tests and one two-day game. Are you telling me that, in the remaining 24 days, you couldn’t organise two three-day practice matches?” Gavaskar dismissed the argument about a lack of quality opposition for warm-up games, stressing that match practice matters more than the quality of the opponent. “It’s about rhythm and flow—for both batters and bowlers. Practice matches also give reserves a chance to show their mettle and help out-of-form players regain confidence. Hopefully, this will be taken into account for the England tour.”Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Must Watch

Following the 1-3 Border-Gavaskar Trophy loss, he demanded strict measures from the BCCI to restore accountability and focus on the team.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/sunil-gavaskar-slams-star-culture-in-indian-team-after-australia-test-series-loss-2660073-2025-01-05,"Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has strongly criticised the “star culture” prevalent in the Indian cricket team, raising concerns about its impact on the future of Indian cricket. Gavaskar’s sharp remarks came in the wake of India’s 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. Australia, led by Pat Cummins, secured a commanding six-wicket victory in the fifth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, reclaiming the coveted trophy after a decade.  Gavaskar did not hold back while speaking to India Today and said that players need to show their commitment to the sport and urged the BCCI to put their foot down and take strict measures to restore accountability. Gavaskar, visibly disappointed, stressed the need for players to demonstrate an unwavering commitment to Indian cricket. “I think the next 8–10 days are crucial for Indian cricket to take a good, honest look at itself. Most importantly, the star culture has to end. Total commitment to Indian cricket is non-negotiable. Players must make themselves available every single time unless there’s a genuine medical emergency. If someone isn’t fully committed, they shouldn’t be considered for selection,” he stated. AUS vs IND, 5th Test Match: Full Scorecard ""Time to stop pampering"" This marked India’s first Test series loss to Australia in ten years. Gavaskar also highlighted the missed opportunity to qualify for the World Test Championship (WTC) final—a spot that was secured by South Africa and Australia. “We don’t need players who are partly here and partly elsewhere. It’s time to stop pampering anyone. The recent results have been disappointing—we should have been in the World Test Championship final but didn’t make it,” he added. Gavaskar's remarks come after many Indian players have shown reluctance in playing domestic cricket. Lately, there has been a growing noise over the need for the Indian players to also play in domestic cricket before participating in international matches.  The series saw senior players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli fail to deliver. Rohit Sharma opted out of the final Test due to poor form, while Kohli’s struggles against deliveries outside the off-stump remained a recurring theme throughout the series, with his lone bright spot being a century in Perth. Gavaskar called for strict action from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) following the series defeat. “The cricket board needs to stop acting like admirers and put their foot down. They must tell the players that Indian cricket comes first. It’s either a full commitment to Indian cricket or other priorities—you can’t have it both ways. If Indian cricket is your priority, only then should you be selected,” Gavaskar concluded.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  SA vs PAK: Kwena Maphaka dismisses well-set Babar Azam to claim maiden Test wicketMust Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/scott-boland-brett-lee-stuart-macgill-australia-vs-india-2660068-2025-01-05,"Brett Lee has likened Scott Boland’s fate to that of former leg-spinner Stuart MacGill. When Shane Warne used to rule the roost, MacGill only used to get a chance when the spin wizard did not play. Despite not being a regular member of the Australian setup, MacGill did not let his team down, picking up 208 wickets from 44 Tests. As far as Boland is concerned, he gets a chance in Australia’s Test XI only when one of their big guns amongst Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, misses out. Boland grabbed his chance with both hands when Hazlewood had his troubles with injury concerns in the recently-concluded five-match Test series against India. AUS vs IND 5th Test Day 3 Highlights| Full Scorecard Boland finished as the third-highest wicket-taker of the series after he took 21 scalps from three games at an average of 13.19. Lee said that Boland plays as a back-up bowler, but the quality he brings is similar to a frontline bowler. “It’s a bit like MacGill and Warne, that’s probably the best analogy I could say. Stuart MacGill took 200 Test wickets as a back-up bowler to Shane Warne. But he wasn’t a back-up bowler; he was a number one spinner anywhere in the world,” Lee was quoted as saying on Indigenous Business News. “I think Boland’s got that same unlucky thing, being born at the wrong time when Australian fast-bowling is so good, so strong,” Lee said.‘Boland is the world’s nicest guy’ Boland won the Player of the Match award in the Sydney Test, which Australia won by six wickets to claim the series 3-1. Boland took four wickets in the first innings after which he rattled the Indian batting line-up with a six-wicket haul. “This guy (Boland) is a freak. His action makes him good, his consistency, his temperament. And he’s under the radar. He’s literally the world’s nicest guy, he doesn’t ask for the accolades, and he catches people off guard,” Lee added.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  5 reasons why India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in AustraliaMust Watch

Sarfaraz expressed heartfelt gratitude towards his father, who had been his coach since childhood, saying it felt like a significant burden had been lifted off his shoulders.

After reaching the landmark, the 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batter celebrated with a salute, honouring his father’s service and fulfilling a childhood tradition. The gesture was inspired by a conversation the night before, where his father subtly asked him to perform the salute, a symbol of their bond since Dhruv’s early days.

This was Virat Kohli's fifth tour Down Under, and what a journey it has been. He has experienced it all — the love, the hate, the highs, the lows, the criticism, and the milestones. | Sydney Test: Full Scorecard | Virat Kohli's journey on Australian soil has been a roller-coaster of emotions. A tale of a fiery beginning, relentless determination, an ultimate triumph and a less-than-perfect ending. It's a love-hate relationship that mirrors the intensity of the sport itself. Australia gave Kohli some of the highest highs of his career, but as he boards his flight home after the Border-Gavaskar Trophy defeat, he might reflect that this isn't the ending he had envisioned. At 23, on his first tour to Australia as a Test cricketer, Kohli was riled up by the Australian crowd and vilified by the media. However, he quickly went on to earn their respect, along with that of the players. Before long, Kohli became the poster boy of the high-profile series, with his name splashed across newspapers. Such was his aura that he thrived on the aggression thrown at him by the mighty Aussies. Even they had to admit they had hardly encountered someone like Kohli — someone who counterpunched instead of backing down, someone who was more Australian than many of the Australians who played against him. Over time, Australians learned that riling him up wasn’t the best option. Former Australian cricketers warned the home team to leave Kohli alone. The land Down Under gave him moments that defined his greatness. But it all ended with him punching his bat in frustration after his dismissal in the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. That reaction reflected not only what the game meant to him but also how that ending left a bitter aftertaste. With India not scheduled to play a Test series in Australia until the end of 2027, Virat Kohli may not return to Australia in whites again.KOHLI ANNOUNCES HIS ARRIVAL IN STYLE  It all began in 2012 with a hostile welcome. Kohli, a fiery young batter, was targeted by the Australian crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Instead of backing down, he responded with a gesture that made headlines -- he flashed his middle finger at a section of hostile crowd. Years later, he went on to regret his gesture, but Kohli never shied away from giving it back in Australia.  Amid the hostility, Kohli also showcased his talent and announced his arrival in red-ball cricket by scoring his maiden Test century in Adelaide later that series. That 116 was more than just a century -- it was a statement. It signaled the arrival of a batter who wouldn't just survive the cauldron of Australia but thrive in it. THE MAKING OF THE KING IN 2014 Fast forward to 2014, and Kohli was back in Australia, this time with a point to prove after a horror series in England earlier in the year. Kohli was scrutinised heavily after a horror show against the moving ball in England -- 134 runs in five Tests.  Kohli was written off before the Australia tour, but he thrived under pressure.  Four centuries in four Tests, including twin tons in Adelaide, cemented his place among the greats. It was during this tour Kohli showed his love for the captain's armband. It was in this series when MS Dhoni handed over the baton to Virat Kohli after seeing glimpses of what was to come in the series opener in Adelaide.  ""You have to play hard against the Australians. That's the only way they respect you,"" Kohli remarked during the series. His aggression was not just in his batting but in the way he led his team. As captain, Kohli infused his side with a fearless approach, refusing to back down.  In Adelaide, India decided to go for a 364-run chase with their captain leading from the front. Despite not winning, India gave the mighty Aussies a massive scare. There was something different in there way India played their cricket under Kohli, a marked shift from the way MS Dhoni's teams played in 2011-12.   WHEN KOHLI SCRIPTED HISTORY This fighting spirit was on full display in Perth in 2018, where he crafted a scintillating 123 on a testing pitch. Though India lost the game, Kohli's innings stood as a testament to his skill and mental fortitude. The pinnacle of Kohli's journey came in 2018-19 when he led India to their first-ever Test series victory in Australia. It was a monumental achievement for an Indian or Asian captain, breaking a barrier many believed to be insurmountable. Kohli's words after the series summed it up perfectly: ""When we won in Melbourne, I knew this was going to be a landmark moment for Indian cricket."" Throughout this journey, Kohli's passion and aggression reshaped India's approach to playing in Australia. His belief in taking the fight to the opposition inspired his teammates, which left an indelible mark on Indian cricket.

— BCCI (@BCCI) January 7, 2020 Virat Kohli began the 2020-2021 tour of Australia with a fighting 74 in India's infamous 36-all-out debacle in Adelaide, finishing as the team's top scorer in the match. After the loss, Kohli returned home on paternity leave, missing the remainder of the series. In his absence, Ajinkya Rahane led India to an incredible comeback, scripting history with a 2–1 series win, including a famous victory at the Gabba. This triumph remains one of Indian cricket's greatest underdog stories.A TOUR TO FORGET Coming to Australia for the fifth time, Virat Kohli carried a wealth of expectations. However, the 36-year-old ended the tour with just 190 runs in nine innings, averaging 23.75. The series began on a high, with Kohli achieving a record milestone by becoming the batter with the most Test hundreds on Australian soil, registering his 7th ton during the Perth Test. Yet, the defining narrative of the tour turned out to be Kohli's troubling ""love affair""-not with Australia, but with deliveries outside the off-stump. He was dismissed in this manner in 8 of his 9 innings, a recurring theme that overshadowed his milestone and left a lingering question about what could have been. He managed just 85 runs across seven innings in the last four Tests of the series that India lost 1-3.

Dr. Mamrez, who is overseeing Ayub’s treatment in Pakistan, has already sent all the medical reports to the specialists in London. Ayub is expected to fly from Cape Town to London on the first available flight, accompanied by stunt coach Azhar Mahmood. The PCB confirmed that Ayub would be treated at one of the world’s best hospitals, with London’s top sports orthopaedic surgeons leading the procedure.Why would Pakistan need Saim Ayub The injury comes as a major blow to Pakistan, as Ayub has been in remarkable form. He averages 64.37 in ODIs and recently scored two centuries during Pakistan’s whitewash of South Africa in a three-match ODI series. Ayub also impressed on tours of Australia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, amassing three centuries. His absence is likely to impact the team’s preparations for the Champions Trophy. Ayub’s unavailability could pave the way for Imam-ul-Haq’s return to the Test squad and Fakhar Zaman’s inclusion in the ODI setup. However, PCB Chairman Naqvi expressed hope for Ayub’s full recovery before the Champions Trophy. “We are confident that Saim will recover in time and continue to serve Pakistan cricket with his outstanding performances,” he said. The Champions Trophy is just 45 days away, and Ayub now faces a race against time to regain fitness. Fans and teammates will be hoping for a swift and successful recovery for one of Pakistan’s brightest cricketing talents.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  King dethroned?

After being asked to follow-on, Pakistan’s hopes were revived by their resilient stand of 205, the highest opening partnership in Pakistan's Test history while following on. Earlier in the day, Pakistan resumed their first innings at 64/3, trailing South Africa by a massive 357 runs. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan displayed grit in the morning session, tackling challenging spells from Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen. Babar brought up his half-century before falling to debutant Kwena Maphaka, who angled one down leg for a sharp catch by Kyle Verreynne. Rizwan also failed to capitalise on his start, under-edging a drive onto his stumps while attempting to reach his fifty. The middle and lower order collapsed around them, with Pakistan losing six wickets for just 76 runs.

— Proteas Men (@ProteasMenCSA) January 5, 2025 South Africa enforced the follow-on, aiming for a quick finish. However, Shan Masood and Babar Azam had other plans. Coming out with positive intent, the duo tackled the new-ball pair of Rabada and Jansen, who lacked their usual sharpness. Masood, ending a poor run of nine innings without a 30-plus score, showcased immense composure as he built his innings. Babar, opening in place of the injured Saim Ayub, complemented Masood perfectly. The pair navigated through tricky spells, including Maharaj's turn and Rabada’s short-ball tactics. Masood reached his sixth Test century with a confident flick off Jansen, celebrating with a skyward glance. Babar, too, looked set for a ton but fell late in the day on 81, chasing a wide ball from Jansen and edging to slip. Despite the setback, Pakistan’s opening partnership had taken a significant chunk out of South Africa's lead, leaving the visitors trailing by 208 at stumps. South Africa’s bowlers toiled hard but were guilty of lapses in discipline, sending down 23 no-balls across both innings. The surface, resembling subcontinental conditions, offered little assistance, though Maharaj found some turn. Tempers flared briefly when Wiaan Mulder threw the ball back at Babar, but the situation was quickly defused by the umpires. At the close of play, nightwatchman Khurram Shahzad joined Masood, who remained unbeaten on 102. Pakistan’s solid recovery gives them a slim chance of salvaging the match. However, they still face an uphill battle, trailing by 208 runs with two days to play. Masood’s leadership and Pakistan’s collective resolve will be critical in shaping the final outcome.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  Saim Ayub to undergo ankle surgery in London, recovery expected by Champions Trophy

Sunil Gavaskar doesn't think soBorder Gavaskar Trophy, IND vs AUS: In an interview with India Today, former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar spoke about Jasprit Bumrah and the workload he had throughout the five-match series against Australia. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/jasprit-bumrah-workload-sunil-gavaskar-border-gavaskar-trophy-interview-2660109-2025-01-05,"Sunil Gavaskar said that India did not mismanage Jasprit Bumrah during their Test series on Australian soil. Bumrah won the Player of the Series award, but it was Australia, who ran away with a 3-1 victory. The speedster finished as the leading wicket-taker of the series with 32 wickets from five Tests at an incredible average of 13.06 with three five-wicket hauls to his name. But Bumrah had his fair share of trouble in the Sydney Test where a back spasm did not let him bowl at all in the second innings. India lost the New Year’s Test against Pat Cummins’ men by six wickets to let go of the Border Gavaskar Trophy after seven years. Gavaskar said that the Indian team management did what was best for the team. “I think they did what was best for the team, because without him, India would not have been in any position in the series. And therefore, when you have a bowler, who's taking the wickets, you tend to overbowl him to an extent and that is totally understandable. I don't think we can blame the team management for this because they and Bumrah were only looking to do what was good for the team at that particular point in time,” Gavaskar told India Today in an interview. AUS vs IND, 5th Test Match: Full Scorecard‘I was praying overnight’ On Day 2 of the Sydney Test, Bumrah went off the park after bowling only 10 overs. He was seen going to a hospital in van to undergo scans. Although he returned to the SCG and also batted in India’s second innings, he wasn’t fit enough to bowl when India were defending 162. Gavaskar said that had Bumrah bowled at least with the new ball, India could have given themselves a chance of winning.  “Yes, they would have. Look, it's a back injury. Bumrah is a very, very dedicated cricketer. And so I think even if he had been a little bit able to bowl, he would have come out and bowled. Therefore, I was praying overnight that, he could maybe come and bowl just four or five overs with the new ball. And I knew that India would not be able to set Australia a target of more than 190 and 200. So if he could have come in bowl, four or five overs at the start, then that would have made a big difference,” Gavaskar said.‘Little too much load’ Gavaskar said that the workload started taking a toll on Bumrah’s body in the second innings of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. Gavaskar said that bowling eight to nine spells in challenging conditions did not help Bumrah by any means. “I think what really took the load for him was the fourth day in Melbourne, where he bowled eight to nine different spells of three to four overs. And I think that really took a toll on his body. And there was actually a video of him saying to Rohit Sharma, ‘ab bass ho gaya’, and which actually tells you that even for a man who loves bowling, who enjoys taking wickets for India, the load had just got a little too much,” Gavaskar added. Bumrah helped India win the Perth Test and also won the Player of the Match. Later, Bumrah would go on to become the fastest Indian pacer to the landmark of 200 wickets and broke several other records.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  Can't win Tests if you score 170-180: Sourav Ganguly on India's debacle in AustraliaMust Watch

The match was delicately poised with Zimbabwe requiring 73 runs to win, but only two wickets in hand. Craig Ervine, the Zimbabwean captain, remains at the crease alongside Richard Ngarava, and their fight will determine the outcome. Afghanistan's dominance on Day 4 was built around a stellar performance by Rashid Khan, who claimed a remarkable six wickets, including a vital double strike that left Zimbabwe in deep trouble. Rashid’s spell of magic began when he removed Sikandar Raza, followed by the crucial wickets of Sean Williams and Brian Bennett.

— Afghanistan Cricket Board (@ACBofficials) January 5, 2025 Earlier in the day, Afghanistan’s debutant Ismat Alam stole the spotlight by scoring a brilliant century, helping his side finish with 363 runs on the board. Ismat, who came into the match with an impressive first-class average of 92, had already converted four of his fifties into centuries at the domestic level. His 101, which included 14 boundaries, was a well-deserved achievement, especially after his duck in his first international innings. Afghanistan set Zimbabwe a challenging target of 278 runs to win. Zimbabwe started their chase of 278 with optimism as Ben Curran and Joylord Gumbie played positive strokes, taking early runs. However, Afghanistan’s bowlers tightened their grip, drying up the runs and increasing the pressure. Zia-ur-Rehman made the breakthrough with the ball, dismissing Gumbie with a clever delivery, and Rashid Khan followed suit with a brilliant spell that saw Curran and Kaitano dismissed. Despite these early breakthroughs, Zimbabwe’s resistance was strong, led by captain Ervine and Raza. The pair formed a crucial partnership, scoring 58 runs without taking unnecessary risks, and frustrating Afghanistan’s bowlers. But Rashid Khan’s persistent pressure finally broke the stand, dismissing Raza after he played a poor shot. Shortly after, Williams and Bennett fell in quick succession to Rashid, leaving Zimbabwe with their backs against the wall. Ervine has shown great resilience, and his 50 in the second innings is a testament to his fighting spirit. But Zimbabwe’s task remains daunting with only two wickets left and 73 runs required. The key question now is whether Ervine can drag Zimbabwe into a dramatic final-day finish. Afghanistan, on the other hand, will be looking to wrap up the series with just two wickets standing between them and victory. With Rashid Khan in top form and Afghanistan needing only two wickets, the final day promises to be a nail-biting contest.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 5, 2025Also Read |  Babar Azam-Shan Masood's historic partnership keeps Pakistan afloat vs South Africa

The incident occurred when South African pacer Wiaan Mulder aggressively threw the ball toward Babar Azam, hitting the Pakistani batter on the pads. This took place during the 32nd over of Pakistan’s second innings after a follow-on was enforced on the visiting team. Babar had played a steady drive back to the bowler, and Mulder collected the ball in his follow-through before hurling it back, missing the stumps by a wide margin. Babar, who was slightly outside the crease, was visibly unhappy with the unnecessary throw. The situation escalated further when the wicketkeeper attempted a cheeky run-out as Babar stepped out of his crease to respond to Mulder. The exchange led to a heated moment on the field, prompting the umpires to step in and calm the players down. Aiden Markram and Shan Masood also spoke to Babar in an attempt to defuse the tension.

— Ahtasham Riaz (@ahtashamriaz22) January 5, 2025 Pakistan showed a great fightback on Day 3 of the Cape Town Test against South Africa, led by a record-breaking opening partnership between Shan Masood and Babar Azam. Following on after being bowled out for 194 in their first innings, Pakistan’s hopes were revived by a 205-run stand, the highest opening partnership for the team while following on in Tests.

 Resuming the day at 64/3 in the first innings, Pakistan struggled against South Africa’s disciplined bowling attack. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan added valuable runs before both fell short of half-centuries. The lower order crumbled as Kagiso Rabada and Keshav Maharaj shared eight wickets, giving South Africa a massive 421-run lead.

 In the second innings, Masood and Babar countered South Africa’s pace and spin with determination. Masood ended a poor run of form by registering his sixth Test century, while Babar contributed a fluent 81. Their partnership frustrated the hosts, who struggled with discipline, conceding 23 no-balls in the match.

 South Africa enforced the follow-on, aiming for a quick finish, but Pakistan’s fightback left them trailing by 208 runs at stumps. With Masood unbeaten on 102, the visitors have a slim chance of forcing a result, setting up an intriguing final two days.

The 19-year-old is eager to dive into new tournaments and refine his skills, starting with the upcoming Tata Steel tournament in Wijk aan Zee, Netherlands, set to begin on January 17. The event will feature top players, including Anish Giri, Arjun Erigaisi, Fabiano Caruana, and R Praggnanandhaa. Speaking during a felicitation ceremony organised by WestBridge Capital, Gukesh shared his excitement about the year ahead. “2025 will offer a very tough challenge. A lot of new and interesting tournaments are coming up. The World Championship was in the past. I’m very happy about it and all the awards and receptions,” he said.  “But now, I have started thinking about new goals, new tournaments, and new ways to prepare. The goal, and approach will be the same, to give my best, to keep improving myself, and win as many tournaments as possible. So, I am looking forward to a fun year with a lot of learning, a lot of improvements and hopefully a lot of good results.” Despite the heightened expectations that come with his world champion title, Gukesh remains unfazed by the added scrutiny. He expressed confidence in handling the spotlight, stating, “Yeah, I have been used to being under the attention for a while. Obviously, after the World Championship, it will be more. But the basic things I remember are to keep improving myself and accepting failures when they come. I think, in general, I have high expectations of myself. So, I think my aim is to meet my own expectations rather than that of others.” Reflecting on the overwhelming attention since his World Championship victory, Gukesh admitted it was more intense than he had anticipated. “I had thought that it (winning the World Championship) would be somewhat similar to the Candidates, but obviously it’s much more. I’m grateful for all the attention and recognition,” he said. “I guess one thing is to manage these things with the training. But after the (World Championship) match, I also need some recovery period. I’ve started training a bit. But it will be more serious soon.” Viswanathan Anand, Gukesh's mentor and a five-time world champion, praised his young ward's victory, noting that it has brought much-needed attention back to chess. “I think it brings back the spotlight to chess. If you project this forward, it’s possible that in every single tournament there is some Indian playing that you can look forward to watching. So, I hope a lot of the dots are connected. The audience numbers in India are very good. Now, we have regular broadcasts and everything. So, I think it will be a sport in the main line,” Anand said. He further added that Gukesh's triumph would inspire younger generations to take up the game. “Of course, Gukesh will spearhead that, especially as being the world champion. But now people are interested to see if there will be Indians playing in a tournament. So there’s a lot of excitement at all stages. And the second effect, which is maybe even more profound, is that young players will be inspired to take up the game.”Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Chess champion Koneru Humpy thrilled after meeting PM Modi: Incredible honourMust Watch

Notably, India lost 1-3 in the five-match series against Australia as they failed to reach the World Test Championship (WTC) final for the first time. Analysing India’s loss, Kaif called India ‘white ball bullies’ who’re lagging too far behind in Test cricket. He also mentioned how the entire nation will forget about the Australia series loss if we manage to beat Pakistan in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025. ""On 23rd February India will earn a lot of praise by beating Pakistan (in Champions Trophy) and everyone will say we are a champion team in white-ball cricket. But if India want to team the World Test Championship then we will have to make a Test match team, will have to learn to play on seaming tracks. The truth is that we are just white-ball bullies. We are lagging too far behind. If we have to win WTC, then players will have to play domestic cricket on turning tracks, will have to practice on seaming tracks, otherwise we will not be able to win,"" he said in a video posted on his social media page. Further speaking ahead, the former batter said that it was a wake-up call for the team who must shift their attention towards Test cricket and focus on playing domestic cricket.It's not just Gautam Gambhir who is at fault: Kaif ""India lost 1-3, and I think this is a wake-up call, because now we have to pay our attention towards Test cricket. It's not just Gautam Gambhir who is at fault. All players get the chance to play Ranji Trophy, but it gets tiresome for the players and they prefer rest over playing Ranji Trophy. They don't play Ranji Trophy, they don't play practice matches then how will they become better players? It's tough to play on turning tracks in India and tougher to play on seaming tracks in Australia and South Africa. So if you don't practice well, WTC will keep eluding you. What has happened, it has happened for the good and now Team India needs to work hard in Test cricket,"" Kaif added. The next round of the Ranji Trophy 2024-25 begins from January 23, it remains to be seen whether the senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will return to play domestic cricket as the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is also on the horizon. India don’t play any more Test cricket till their tour to England in June later this year. Hence, the senior players will have to find a way to regain their form for the betterment of the team if India are to start the next cycle of the World Test Championship (WTC) on a good note.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  5 reasons why India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia

The constant changes and lack of having the right combination for conditions led to the 1-3 series loss. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/aus-vs-ind-ind-vs-aus-border-gavaskar-trophy-gautam-gambhir-rohit-sharma-virat-kohli-2660153-2025-01-06,"Since taking over as the coach of the Indian team, one of the repeated phrases used by Gautam Gambhir has been that they will put out a side depending on the conditions. This would mean that players fitting to the profile of a certain ground and its conditions would be brought on to ensure that team gets the win. But in India's case during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, this was a promise that didn't get fulfilled and ultimately led to India's downfall.  Australia were able to reclaim the BGT title with a 6-wicket win in the Sydney Test, while a dejected Indian team saw their hopes of making it to the World Test Championship final for a third straight time, come to an end. While India's batting and lack of support for a champion bowler like Jasprit Bumrah has been some of the main causes for the loss, the team management would also need to look at how they failed to put in the right players for all 5 matches.  We start with the bowling and the very first Test match. Washington Sundar, who impressed in the New Zealand series, was given the nod ahead of veterans R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja for the match. Ashwin and Jadeja have been stalwarts for India during their previous tours down under, with the former having 40 wickets in 11 matches that he played. He could have played the same role that Sundar was assigned to do.  After having backed the youngster in the first game, India decided to drop Sundar and bring Ashwin back in and the veteran struggled and picked just 1 wicket and scored a total of 29 runs across both the innings. In the third match, India would then avoid Ashwin and Sundar to bring in Jadeja, in a bid to improve their batting depth.  Coming to the pacers, this is where India genuinely missed a trick. Harshit Rana was given the nod in the first game and the young speedster did well to impress everyone. While still raw, he did do a commendable job complimenting Bumrah and Siraj.  However, the Adelaide track was one where India could have and should have gone with Akash Deep as it was the kind of track that would have aided the Bengal bowler. As someone who bowls at the stumps, and seeing Scott Boland get success on the same ground, India were left to rue their mistake as Harshit leaked runs and ended with figures of 86 for no wickets in 16 overs.  After the youngster was backed by the management following his Adelaide horror show, the Gabba wicket was one where he could have thrived. Instead, India decided to bring Akash Deep in for the match and the Delhi pacer has remained out of the lineup since then.  The last 2 matches saw India decide to go with 2 spinners in their lineup in the form of Sundar and Jadeja when they could have easily brought in an extra pacer. Australia would stick to their plan of 4 pacers with Mitchell Marsh and Beau Webster doing the job in Melbourne and Sydney respectively.  Sundar and Jadeja were never used as attacking options during the matches and India's reluctance to use Nitish Kumar Reddy much like Webster and Marsh left many stunned. The batting merry-go round Probably the most puzzling thing for the Indian fans was to see the batting performance. India scored more than 200 runs just 3 times in the series and much of it was down to the constant chopping and changing amongst the ranks.  The arrival of Rohit Sharma after the Perth Test started the mayhem from a selection point of view as the Indian captain decided to bat at No.6, a role he last did almost 6 years ago. This was done to help KL Rahul continue his good form. But Rohit struggled in Adelaide and Brisbane, while Rahul did well, especially to save the match at the Gabba. But soon enough, in a bid to accomodate Rohit, India decided that their captain was best up top.  This came at the cost of Shubman Gill, who had made the No.3 spot his own after Cheteshwar Pujara's exit. But it resulted in more instability as Rohit failed again and ended the series with just 31 runs from 5 innings and an average of 6.2. He would then go on to drop himself for final match in Sydney while Rahul's form also died out and a return to the opening spot didn't help.  In the end, all this led to India being completely outplayed in the batting department by their counterparts. India will now have time till the England tour to recover from the loss, but the big question will be if India can find the right combination.  Teams like England and Australia have already started announcing their sides on the eve of matches, showing their confidence in the line-up. While India may want to hold the cards close to their chest, are yet to find their right combinations for matches and the horses seem to be easily tied up in their stables by the opponents.

Notably, Bumrah finished as the highest wicket-taker across five Tests with 32 wickets from nine innings at an average of 13.06 with three five-wicket hauls to his name. However, despite his sensational performance, India ended up losing the series by 1-3 as Australia beat them for the first time in a bilateral series since 2014-15. Recently, Ponting shared his thoughts on Bumrah’s fast bowling in the series and said that the Indian fast bowler looked batting the hardest across both teams. ""No doubt, it's probably the best series of fast bowling I've ever seen. Yes, they had good conditions, the fast bowlers, for most of this series. But when you watched him (Bumrah) bowl compared to anyone else in the series, he made batting look so much harder,"" Ponting was quoted as saying by the ICC website. Further speaking ahead, Ponting also mentioned how he made the Australian top order look silly at different times. ""There's a lot of quality batting in that Australian top-order as well but he (Bumrah) made all of them at different times look silly,"" he added. Bumrah etched his name in the history books as he registered the most wickets by an Indian bowler in a single series in Australia, surpassing Bishan Singh Bedi’s tally of 31 wickets from 1977-78. During the series, he also broke the record of legendary Kapil Dev (51 wickets) to register the most Test wickets by an Indian bowler in Australia.Uncertainty on Bumrah's return after Sydney Test Bumrah has scalped 64 wickets from 12 matches (23 innings) in Australia at an average of 17.15 with four five-wicket hauls to his name, with best match figures of 9/86. His magnificent performance has also made him climb to the top of the ICC Test rankings for bowlers, where he now holds the highest ever ratings registered by an Indian bowler (907 ratings). Meanwhile, following the Test series against Australia, it remains to be seen when does the fast bowler return on the field again, as he opted out of bowling midway through the first innings in fifth Test as a precautionary measure.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  5 reasons why India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia

Notably, Konstas made headlines during his Test debut as he got involved in banter with star India batter Virat Kohli and kept on gesturing his shoulder charge towards the crowd. Later in the fifth Test, Konstas tried to delay the proceedings late on Day 1 which annoyed India’s stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah, who gave him a stare right after getting a wicket on the next delivery. Sharing his thoughts on the youngster’s demeanour in the series, Cummins said that he was impressed with the 19-year-old and said that people mistook his confidence with bullying. ""First of all, obviously, ICC set the rules and set the punishments. We saw that in Melbourne with Virat, getting 20% fine, that's what they thought. So obviously, that's the standard that they're happy with. In regards to Sam, I've been really impressed with how he's gone about it. I think people mistake a bit of confidence with bullying or abuse,” said Cummins in the post-match press conference. Further speaking ahead, Cummins also took a dig at Kohli saying that it’s not illegal for the youngster to walk around confidently and play a few shots which offended people. “You're allowed to walk around with your shoulders puffed back and play a few cricket shots. I don't think that's illegal, but some people really take offence to that and want to kind of put him back in his place,"" he added.Konstas scored 113 runs from two games Konstas played a brilliant knock on his debut during the fourth Test in Melbourne, scoring a brilliant 60 (65) as he took on Jasprit Bumrah. The 19-year-old put his fearless strokeplay on display as he reverse-scooped the India fast bowler for boundaries.   He finished the series with 113 runs from two matches (four innings) at an average of 28.25 and a strike rate of 81.88. Having got his career off to a terrific start, Konstas will be eager to continue his form as Australia also have the all-important Ashes series lined up later this year.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  5 reasons why India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-fast-bowlers-reasons-worry-india-vs-australia-test-series-2660126-2025-01-06,"Australia had every reason to cheer for after they won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in seven years. On Sunday, Pat Cummins’ men hammered India by six wickets in the New Year’s Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground to claim the series 3-1. Cummins led from the front and made sure that Australia came back after losing the Perth Test by 295 runs. Once they smelled blood in the Day-Night Test at the Adelaide Oval, there was no stopping them. They could also have won the third Test at The Gabba in Brisbane had rain not played spoilsport. Mitchell Starc took India apart in the pink-ball Test with a six-wicket haul, after which Scott Boland, who replaced an injured Josh Hazlewood, stepped up big time. AUS vs IND, 5th Test Match: Full Scorecard With the win in the Sydney Test, Australia also sealed their spot in the final of the World Test Championship where they will meet South Africa. But amidst the dominating run, Australia might be nearing a phase where they would be forced to think, especially in the fast bowling department.The indispensible members  Australia have depended heavily on the trio of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood over the last five years. Cummins has been a workhorse for them with 155 scalps while Starc has accounted for 136 wickets since January 2020. Hazlewood has been effective as well, with 84 wickets in 21 games during that period. Scott Boland has been a back-up for the Aussies and chips in only when one of the three pacers amongst Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins, gets injured. In fact, Boland’s average of 17.66 is the best amongst all the pacers who have taken more than 10 wickets for Australia in the last five years. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Coverage But barring Boland, Hazlewood, Starc and Cummins, the Aussies haven’t had many pacers playing for them. Jhye Richardson, Michael Neser and James Pattinson got chances in Test matches here and there, but could never become a consistent member of their squads, let alone break into playing XIs. Australian fast bowlers since January 2020
 


The worrying element  Although Australia have a strong pace attack at the present point in time, history suggests that they might be in for a tough phase after a year and a half or so. After turning 35, barring Glenn McGrath, very few Australian pacers have gone on to extend their career for long. In 18 Tests after the age of 35, McGrath picked up 82 wickets with four five-wicket hauls. Next on the list is Boland, who is already 35 and has taken 21 wickets from three Tests against India, but it goes without saying that he is not getting any younger. Starc would touch 35 by the end of January while Hazlewood would turn 34 in a couple of days' time. At the age of 31, Pat Cummins is the youngest member of the Australian pacer attack. Pacers find it tough to extend their longevity after they enter the wrong side of their 30s. Starc recently faced issues with his back, while Hazlewood could not play three out of the five Tests against India. Given the past, unless any of the four speedsters show the level of tenacity that McGrath did, it might be tough for them to show the same effectiveness 12 to 18 months down the line. If the quartet loses its effectiveness, Australia might struggle to find their appropriate replacements. Australian pacers in 21st century after 35 years 
 


Challenging times ahead In the last 24 years, Australia have won multiple ICC tournaments across formats on the back of their incredible fast bowling. It’s because they have always had a potent pace attack good enough to rattle any batting line-up in the world. Most importantly, players have come forward to carry forward the legacy set by some of the best in the business. After the legendary Glenn McGrath left the game, Hazlewood took charge of terrorising batters with his accurate line and lengths. But who can take it over from Hazlewood, who is starting to feel the heat with his body with injuries creeping in? Brett Lee used to be fierce and ruthless, after which Mitchell Johnson ruffled opposition batters with his raw pace. When Johnson was nearing the end of his career, Starc took charge with his attacking approach. But after Starc goes, who can fill his boots? Australia have had quite a few debutants in the limited-overs formats. From Nathan Ellis, Sean Abbott, Spencer Johnson, Xavier Bartlett, Ben Dwarshuis and many others, the Aussies have made plenty of pacers who forayed into white-ball cricket. But in red-ball cricket, concerns remain over who takes over once the famous four steps away.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Did India mismanage Jasprit Bumrah vs Australia?

Manjrekar has called out the selection of one particular player.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ind-vs-aus-bgt-sanjay-manjrekar-analysis-team-selection-washington-sundar-2660194-2025-01-06,"India surrendered the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia after losing the final Test match in Sydney. India lost the final game in just three and a half days after a terrible batting show in the final innings of the game. Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar called out the team selection for the final Test after the conclusion of the series. AUS vs IND, 5th Test Match: Full Scorecard Speaking on ESPNcricinfo, Manjrekar called out the selection of Washington Sundar on a green-ish track in Sydney which offered plenty of help for the pacers. India played with two spinners in the Test match - Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar, resulting in a bigger workload for the pacers. Due to the bigger workload, captain Jasprit Bumrah was forced off the field and did not return to bowl in the final innings of the match when India were defending 162 runs vs Australia. ""It's crazy when you think of an important place in that Indian Test XI in a marquee series. Barring that fifty, Washington Sundar hasn't contributed with the bat much. I think he's a highly talented bowler. But, he has a place when the pitch is turning overseas. And with Jadeja already there, Nitish Kumar Reddy as well, plus Washington Sundar as well. I thought his selection was a blunder on a pitch like this,"" Sanjay Manjrekar said.  ""The last two tours to Australia, India didn't have a single player who was played because of his second skill. They always focused on his main skill and that was good enough to get him into the side. The other skill was a bonus. Here, I thought India went the England way, when England was not winning,"" he further added. India fail to reach WTC Final for first time in 3 editions Washington Sundar played 3 Test matches but bowled only 37 overs for India. The spin-bowling all-rounder picked up 3 wickets at an economy of 3.13. With the bat, Washington Sundar played a couple of gritty knocks and finished with 114 runs to his name. Washington hit a solitary fifty in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Many had questioned the player's selection during the series, as it always left the team one pacer short in the spicy Australian pitches. However, it was argued by the team management that India wanted to elongate their tail with the bat so that they could score crucial runs if the top order failed in the series.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Did India get 'horses for courses' approach wrong in Border-Gavaskar Trophy loss?Must Watch

Manager Ruben Amorim hailed the players after the result and said that on Sunday, Manchester United were truly a team.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/football/story/premier-league-manchester-united-vs-liverpool-ruben-amorim-2660190-2025-01-06,"Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim expressed pride in his side’s collective effort after their thrilling 2-2 draw with Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday, stating, “Today we were a team.” The United manager was pleased with the intensity his players displayed at Anfield but emphasised that there is still room for improvement in their overall performance. A week after raising concerns about the team’s form and the threat of relegation, Amorim saw a significant change in his side’s mentality. Goals from Lisandro Martinez and Amad Diallo saw United score their first goals at Anfield since 2018, going toe-to-toe with Liverpool, who remain at the top of the league. Despite the challenging nature of the match, the team showed resilience and determination, with the travelling United fans leaving the stadium feeling optimistic about the result. ""Today I'm allowed to be the only guy upset with the team,"" Amorim told reporters after the match. ""But today we were a team. I want to see my team play so much better, but I think the most important thing to address today is the mentality. That is the key for everything. Today, we were a different team, not because of the system, not because of the technical aspect of the game, the tactical aspect of the game. We faced the competition in the way that we are supposed to face every day, training and match. It doesn't matter the place... we need to face every day like that."" The draw, which lifted United to 13th in the Premier League standings, came with mixed emotions. Despite climbing a spot in the table, United still find themselves 11 points behind sixth-placed Manchester City and 13 points off the top four. For the fans, however, the result felt like a small victory, given the team’s spirited performance against the league leaders. United captain Bruno Fernandes, one of the standout players of the match, voiced frustration after the game. ""I'm pretty upset,"" he said. ""If we show this level at Liverpool, first in the league, why can't we do this everywhere?"" Amorim agreed with Fernandes, acknowledging the inconsistency that has plagued United’s season. “It's really clear,” he said. “We lost three games in a row at home, some of the games we suffered two goals without doing nothing (defensively)."" The Portuguese coach had hoped that with no mid-week fixtures, he would finally get a full week of training with his squad to implement his tactical ideas. But he refrained from using that as an excuse. ""I don't want to use that, but of course, when you train, you understand better the way we play, the positioning, the characteristics of the teammates, the things that are really important. But I don't want to use that today."" Amorim focused on the key element of his team's display: mentality. ""Today is all about the focus when you are playing football, the focus on set pieces, the focus on passing the ball, not in the sloppy way, but in the way that we cannot lose one ball because in the other part of the pitch is (Mohamed) Salah, is (Luis) Diaz, so you don't lose the ball,"" he explained. ""If you lose the ball in some parts of the pitch, you know that we are going to suffer. If you have that mentality every day, you are a different team and I think that is really clear."" The match almost ended with a last-minute victory for United, but Harry Maguire’s missed chance in the dying seconds of the game left them with only a draw. Former United captain Roy Keane, reflecting on the performance, noted that while the result was encouraging, consistency remains a key challenge for Amorim’s side. ""I don't think anyone would have predicted them scoring two goals today or nearly nicking it at the end. But the key is that they have to back it up,"" Keane said during the Sky Sports broadcast. He also added, “The argument to all of this though is that you can't just pick and choose when you want to turn up for a game at Manchester United."" As United prepares for upcoming fixtures, Amorim will be hoping to build on this performance, pushing his side to maintain the intensity and mentality that saw them compete with the league’s best.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Uruguayan player Mathias Acuna's death presumed suicide, his club saysTrending Reel

Notably, Babar was asked to open the innings after Saim Ayyub was ruled out of the Test due to an ankle injury. The Pakistan star took the challenge head on as he top-scored for his team in the first innings with a magnificent knock of 58 (127), his second consecutive half-century in the format. However, he failed to convert it into a big knock, getting strangled down the leg side by Kwena Maphaka. Later in the second innings, he was once again batting well on 81 and was nearing his long-awaited hundred, but he ended up chasing a wide delivery from Marco Jansen which went straight to gully. Speaking about his dismissal at the end of the day’s play, Babar revealed how he was left disappointed for throwing his wicket away with not much time left in the day. ""I'm very disappointed with both innings. I started well but didn't finish well. If you settle, you must go much bigger. That is why I was a bit upset. There were just 15 minutes left. The conditions here are different from Centurion. When you come to South Africa, you don't expect that [the pitch will be so flat]. With the new ball, it was a bit challenging, but once you settled down and built a partnership, it became easier,"" said Babar in the press conference.

India's Border-Gavaskar Trophy defeat raises urgent questions about the Test futures of stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-india-series-defeat-transition-virat-kohli-rohit-sharma-test-future-2660210-2025-01-06,"“Retirement is in your hand, but playing for India is not,” remarked Sanjay Manjrekar in a candid and pointed assessment of the future of Indian cricket's superstar players. “One thing we hear players often say is, ‘I will decide my future.’ I have a problem with that. You can decide your future regarding retirement, but it’s someone else’s job to decide your future as a player and captain,” the former batter-turned-pundit said, responding to Rohit Sharma’s revealing interview with the broadcasters on Day 2 of the Sydney Test, the final chapter of the fiercely-contested Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The Indian captain chose to ‘stand down’ from the series finale due to poor form—a rare decision in Indian cricket’s recent history. Bold as it was, it was also the correct one. How can a batter, who accumulated just 31 runs in the preceding three Tests, justify a place in the playing XI? While it was heartening to see Rohit Sharma acknowledge his poor form, the second half of his widely publicised interview revealed a stubborn streak. “I am not going anywhere,” Rohit asserted. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage “Look, as I said, this is not a retirement decision, nor am I stepping away from the game. I am out of this game because I am not scoring runs. There’s no guarantee I won’t be scoring runs five months from now. We’ve seen how quickly life and cricket can change,” he added. Rohit scored just 164 runs in 15 innings during India’s critical 2024-25 Test season, averaging a paltry 10.93. In the shocking 0-3 whitewash against New Zealand, he managed only 91 runs. In Australia, it wasn’t just his poor form but his lack of clarity as captain that hindered India. Bereft of runs, Rohit seemed to lose the conviction that once defined his leadership, particularly during India’s T20 World Cup triumph. Meanwhile, Virat Kohli, India’s stalwart, showed flashes of his former self with a century in Perth at the start of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, his performance dwindled under pressure, amassing just 85 runs in the last four Tests. More troubling than the numbers was Kohli’s vulnerability. Once known for his ‘eat-sleep-score hundreds-repeat’ routine, his struggles against deliveries in the fourth to sixth stump channels became glaringly apparent.  Opposition bowlers openly discussed targeting his off-stump vulnerability on live broadcasts, making Kohli’s dismissals feel almost inevitable.  A frustrated Kohli punched his bat after being caught in the slips during the Sydney Test’s second innings—a telling image of a once-dominant player now grappling with self-doubt. If this was indeed his last Test in Australia, it wasn’t a fitting end to his remarkable journey Down Under. Kohli, who started as a brash youngster and rose to become ‘The King,’ finished this series as a shadow of his prime self.

— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) January 4, 2025 The Border-Gavaskar Trophy slipped from India’s grasp for the first time in nearly a decade, along with their hopes of reaching a third consecutive World Test Championship final. India had 10 Tests in the final phase of the World Test Championship cycle to secure a spot in the final. Their tally? Three wins, six losses, and one rain-affected draw. For a team that once prided itself on its dominance in whites, the last few months have been nothing short of a nightmare. The home whitewash by New Zealand—a first in history—exposed India’s vulnerability. In Australia, Pat Cummins and his team reiterated that India are no longer the invincibles they once prided themselves on being. The common denominator in both series defeats was the batting collapse. At home, Indian batters were outspun by New Zealand’s bowlers. In Australia, they crossed the 200-run mark only three times in five Tests. The Sydney finale was a microcosm of India’s struggles. After opting to bat on a green top, India managed a mere 185 runs in the first innings. Their bowlers salvaged a narrow four-run lead, but the batting imploded again in the second innings, mustering only 157 runs despite a valiant effort from Rishabh Pant. While Australia’s batting line-up had its flaws, their senior players—Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne—delivered crucial knocks when it mattered most. For India, the experienced players faltered.TRANSITION TIME: TOO EARLY OR ALREADY LATE? After the series defeat, head coach Gautam Gambhir refused to comment on the futures of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, deferring the decision to the players themselves. He also suggested that talk of an imminent transition in the Test team was premature. But is it really too soon? Or is it already too late? India’s disappointing World Test Championship campaign demands introspection. When they tour England for a five-Test series in June, they should focus on the future, not cling to baggage. At 37, Rohit Sharma’s belief in a turnaround might be misplaced. England’s swinging and seaming conditions are unlikely to offer respite for a struggling red-ball opener.  ""Test cricket isn’t a place for 37-year-olds at the top of the order. History suggests that, and only Rohit Sharma knows whether he has got the hunger to go on. But, those numbers are not pretty reading,” noted former Australian opener Simon Katich, who questioned Rohit’s viability at the top of the order in Test cricket at this stage. Meanwhile, Virat Kohli faces a familiar demon in England—the off-stump line. First exploited by James Anderson in 2014, this weakness could haunt him again unless resolved. Even casual fans can predict how to dismiss him, with edges to the slip cordon becoming all too familiar.

In his last 40 Tests, he averages just 32—a stark decline for a player of his stature. Comparatively, even during a similarly long lean phase, Sachin Tendulkar’s average did not dip below 42.

Karthik expects Rohit Sharma to take a few big calls during his brief rest before the England ODIs.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ind-vs-aus-5th-test-rohit-sharma-sydney-interview-dinesh-karthik-2660248-2025-01-06,"India captain Rohit Sharma gave his unexpected interview to calm down the public who had started demanding answers, feels former cricketer Dinesh Karthik. The former India player reacted to Rohit's candid chat with Star Sports - the Indian broadcaster - where the captain clarified that he had stood down from the playing XI for the betterment of the team. Karthik said that Rohit did the interview because there were a lot of different media reports floating around about the environment of the Indian dressing room. Speaking on Cricbuzz, Karthik said that Rohit Sharma will have a lot to process in the next couple of weeks before he returns to action in the ODI series against England. Karthik said that with Sharma confirming that he is not going to retire from Test cricket, he would need to streamline his thoughts to return to his best self. ""I am sure that Rohit Sharma will be part of the ODI series vs England and the Champions Trophy, and whatever form he finds, he will need to find it there. If he finds form, he will feel that he can come back as a Test batter in England. Knowing Sharma, I think that he gave that interview because there was a lot of news floating around. But I do think when he goes back, for the next couple of weeks he has no cricket, he will take his time, talk with his family and then take a call on his future,"" Dinesh Karthik said on Cricbuzz. ""Before coming to the series, he has had the birth of the baby as well. I think he will spend time with his little ones but he will also make some decisions. There will be a lot of thoughts in his mind, which he will have to streamline and think what he needs to do. There are decisions to be taken on his behalf and on Team India's behalf because at this point he has made it clear that he is not retiring. It was a good thing that he gave the interview to just cool down and calm down the public because there were a lot of speculations,"" he added.SANJAY MANJREKAR'S TAKE Earlier, former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar had opened up on Rohit Sharma's interview and said that the Indian captain was forced to clarify the rumours as coach Gautam Gambhir had been credited for making tough changes to the Indian team. ""But there was also another reason why he was doing that interview. To clear the air. Somewhere I think Gambhir was getting all the credit for a brave call by leaving Rohit Sharma out. He wanted to set the record straight. Let’s be honest,"" Sanjay Manjrekar had said after India lost the Sydney Test on Sunday, 5th January. Manjrekar referred to Gautam Gambhir's pre-match press conference, in which the head coach refused to confirm whether Rohit would play the fifth Test. However, stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah later clarified that the decision not to play the Sydney Test was Rohit's own choice. ""Obviously, our captain, you know, has shown his leadership as well. He's opted to rest in this game. So that shows that, you know, there's a lot of unity in our team, there's no selfishness that, you know,"" Bumrah had said at the toss in Sydney.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Cricket Australia breaks silence on not inviting Gavaskar for trophy presentationMust Watch

Slot credited United's attacking quality for Trent's performance and reaffirmed the defender's importance to Liverpool's plans despite speculation about his future.,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/football/story/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-vs-manchester-united-arne-slot-not-real-madrid-transfer-rumour-2660244-2025-01-06,"Liverpool manager Arne Slot has backed Trent Alexander-Arnold after the full-back’s underwhelming performance in his side’s 2-2 draw against Manchester United, dismissing speculation that transfer rumors are affecting the player’s focus. Alexander-Arnold, long linked with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid, faced criticism for his struggles in containing United’s attacking threats at Old Trafford. The English full-back, whose Anfield contract expires in June 2025, has become a key figure in the transfer rumor mill. With Real Madrid reportedly keen to secure his services, speculation has swirled about his future, potentially on a free transfer through a pre-contract agreement. However, Slot firmly ruled out these rumors as a distraction, instead attributing Alexander-Arnold’s struggles to the quality of United’s attacking players, including Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, and Rasmus Hojlund. The Dutch manager defended his player, emphasising that even the best defenders can face tough outings against opponents of Manchester United’s calibre. “I think nine out of 10 people will tell you that it affected him, but I’m one of the 10 that tells you that I don’t think that affected him. What affected him is that he had to play Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot, two starters for Portugal, great, great, great players,” Slot said during the post-match press conference. “We have a fantastic player here with Diogo Jota, and he’s not even playing for Portugal. So that tells you how much quality United has. Probably everybody’s going to tell you that it had to do with the rumours. But my opinion is different,” he added. Alexander-Arnold endured a difficult evening, with United repeatedly targeting his side of the pitch. Dalot’s overlapping runs and Hojlund’s movement proved challenging to contain, while Fernandes, operating in a free role, exploited spaces effectively. Despite his struggles, Slot maintained that the Liverpool star remains an integral part of the team and that one off-day should not overshadow his importance to the squad. For Manchester United, the draw was a small step forward. It lifted them to 13th in the Premier League table, though they remain significantly off the pace in the race for European qualification. For fans, the result was a morale boost, showcasing the team’s ability to compete with the league leaders despite ongoing challenges.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Today we were a team: Amorim after spirited draw with table-toppers Liverpool

Notably, Australia beat India by 3-1 in the five-match Test series as they beat them for the first time since 2015 to stake claim on the silverware named after legendary cricketers Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar. However, only one of the two legends was present at the podium to hand over the trophy to the winners as Border presented it to Australia captain Pat Cummins. The move didn’t seem to go down well with Gavaskar, who was left upset with him not being invited for the trophy presentation. A CA spokesperson finally broke his silence on the matter and acknowledged that it would’ve been preferable had both Border and Gavaskar were there on the stage to present the trophy. ""We acknowledge it would have been preferable if both Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar had been asked to go on stage,” a CA spokesperson said. CA also revealed that Gavaskar was informed that he would be invited onto the stage had India won the Sydney Test and retained the trophy. The India cricketer also acknowledged that he was aware of the situation but mentioned that he was left a bit perplexed as the trophy is named after both players. ""I was told just before the Test started that was going to be the situation. If India didn't win or draw the series I wouldn't be required...I'm not feeling sad, but I'm just feeling a little perplexed. It's the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, both of us should have been there,"" Gavaskar told Code Sports. Meanwhile, Australia beat India by six wickets in the fifth and final Test of the series and sealed it by 3-1. India came into Day 3 leading by 145 runs in the second innings, having four wickets in hand. However, Pat Cummins and Scott Boland cleaned up the Indian tail quickly and set up a 162-run target for the hosts, which they chased down with the loss of four wickets.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  5 reasons why India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia

Speaking on the day that India lost their final Test match in Sydney, Yograj pointed out that at the elite level, Gautam Gambhir needed to be less of a coach and more man-manager. Yograj pointed out the dismissals of Virat Kohli, who got out 8 times edging the ball. The former player hinted that it was Gautam Gambhir's responsibility to go and tell Kohli to not play the off-stump channel balls through covers. The father of Yuvraj Singh said that Gambhir should have told Virat to play those balls straight which could have helped him in the Australian pitches. AUS vs IND, 5th Test Match: Full Scorecard ""The role of a coach becomes a significant question when you are playing for India. When you're an exceptional player representing India, you might not necessarily need coaching in the traditional sense. What you truly need is someone for man management. Sometimes, a player's mind gets blocked; they might not be scoring runs, or they keep getting out. No matter how great a player is, they can't be bigger than the game itself,"" Yograj Singh said in an interview with the IANS. ""Such players need someone to guide them, to say, 'Let's go to the nets and work on this'. For example, Virat Kohli got out many times playing his favourite shot - the right-hand push. That shot works on Indian pitches, in England, and elsewhere. But on certain pitches where the ball bounces and carries more, someone should have told him, 'Virat, don't play this shot'. Just play straight or leave this ball,"" he added. India fail to reach WTC Final for first time in 3 editions ""This illustrates the difference between coaching and management. Identifying and pointing out a player's technical fault is coaching. Someone needs to recognise and convey these technical issues to the players. But who will tell Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli? Even they want someone to come and tell them what's going wrong,"" concluded Yuvraj Singh's father. Asked if what could be changed in the Indian team management, Yograj said that a proper management will keep reassuring the players when they are going through a rough patch. ""I believe what's needed is proper management - someone who understands when a player's mind is blocked, when they're feeling low, and reassures them, saying, 'Don't worry, we're here for you. You'll do it because you're a great player.' Every player faces a downfall, even the greatest ones. It's part of the game,"" Yograj concluded on the matter. Gautam Gambhir, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli's futures hang in balance after India's loss to Australia. While Rohit Sharma has confirmed that he is not going to retire from the format, it is yet to be seen how the selection committee reacts to India dropping the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade-long dominance.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Sanjay Manjrekar calls out India's team selection after series loss vs AustraliaMust Watch

As he gears up for the 2024 Australian Open with Andy Murray as coach, Djokovic eyes redemption and a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/tennis/story/novak-djokovic-melbourne-airport-trauma-covid-19-memory-australian-open-2660266-2025-01-06,"Novak Djokovic, the Serbian tennis legend, recently admitted that he still experiences stress when arriving at Melbourne airport, a lingering effect of his turbulent 2022 Australian Open saga. Three years ago, Djokovic faced deportation for not adhering to Australia’s COVID-19 vaccination requirements, a chapter he now describes as a ""trauma"" that stays with him to this day. In a candid conversation with Melbourne's Herald Sun ahead of the 2024 Australian Open, Djokovic shared how the ordeal remains etched in his memory. Detained in a hotel for ten days while awaiting the court’s decision on his entry, the experience left a lasting impression.  ""I have to be quite frank...The last couple of times I landed in Australia, to go through passport control and immigration – I had a bit of trauma from three years ago. And some traces still stay there when I'm passing passport control, just checking out if someone from the immigration zone is ­approaching,"" Djokovic said. ""The person checking my passport – are they going to take me, detain me again or let me go? I must admit I have that feeling.I don't hold any resentment, to be honest...I don't hold a grudge. I came right away the year after ... and I won,"" he added. The 36-year-old, ranked seventh globally, is preparing to compete for an unprecedented 25th Grand Slam title at this year’s Australian Open, which kicks off next Sunday. Despite his past challenges, Djokovic has always had a special connection with the tournament, having claimed the Melbourne crown a record ten times. This year, Djokovic will return with a new dynamic—his former rival, Andy Murray, will join him as coach. The pairing has sparked intrigue, with many wondering how Murray's insights will influence Djokovic’s approach to his favorite Grand Slam. The Serbian ace is also looking to rebound after a disappointing quarterfinal exit at the Brisbane International earlier this month. For Djokovic, Melbourne remains a stage of redemption and resilience. While the shadows of 2022 loom, his determination to dominate the Australian Open once again stands firm. Fans will eagerly watch as he aims to put the past behind him and cement his legacy with yet another historic victory.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 6, 2025

The report suggested that ICC chief Jay Shah is leading the charge with Australia, India and England to incorporate a system where top teams play more often.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/test-cricket-2-tier-format-jay-shah-icc-president-ind-vs-aus-sa-vs-pak-2660261-2025-01-06,"Newly-elected International Cricket Council chairman Jay Shah is driving the idea of a 2-tier Test cricket, if reports are to be believed. Australian media outlet The Age reported on Monday, January 6 that Shah was leading the charge alongside cricket boards from India, Australia and England to host more marquee Test series in the cricketing calendar. The move, if it is to be believed, comes after the record attendance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy where India and Australia played 5 Test matches. The BGT was the most attended non-Ashes series in the history of cricket in Australia, with 837,879 people attending the games in stadiums. This was the fourth most attended series in the history of Australian cricket behind the Ashes series of 1936-37, 2017-18 and 1946-47.HOW DOES THE 2-TIER FORMAT WORK? In the 2-tier format - the top teams in the current cricketing environment like India, Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand will play each other more often than they do. While the other teams like Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Ireland and Zimbabwe - who are not known for their Test prowess would be demoted to the 2nd tier of the format. This might include teams like Bangladesh and West Indies, who have not found success in Test cricket in the recent past.  This format will see the top-tier teams compete against each other, while the lower-tier teams only stick to their division. There is no confirmation if this system will also include a provision for promotion and relegation. The idea of a 2-tier Test format was floated back in 2016, but was shot down by the then-Indian cricket board president Anurag Thakur after opposition from the smaller teams. Thakur had said that the 2-tier structure would marginalise the small teams and would not be fair to the spirit of cricket. “The BCCI is against the two-tier Test system because the smaller countries will lose out and the BCCI wants to take care of them,” then-BCCI president Anurag Thakur said in 2016. “It is necessary to protect their interests. In the two-tier system, they will lose out on a lot, including revenue and the opportunity to play against top teams. We don’t want that to happen. We want to work in the best interests of world cricket and that is why our team plays against all the countries,” Thakur added. However, there has been growing support from certain sections of broadcasters, who want to be even more profitable than they already are. Ravi Shastri, while commentating on the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy said that there was merit in the argument that big teams playing big teams would ensure the survival of Test cricket. “I’ve been a firm believer in that if you want Test cricket to survive and be alive and thriving, I think that’s the way to go,” Shastri said on SEN during the final Test match of the series. “The top teams play against each other more often, so there is a contest; you want contests,” he added.Possible teams in 2-tier structure 1st Division South Africa, Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. 2nd Division West Indies, Bangladesh, Ireland, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Rohit Sharma-Virat Kohli conundrum: Can India afford to delay tough calls?Must Watch

Bumrah, who was India's stand-out player with 32 wickets in their 1-3 thrashing at the hands of Australia in the just-concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy, couldn't bowl in the final innings of the series here after suffering back spasms.

The 30-year-old Bumrah bowled more than 150 overs in the series. The injury has a direct link to his excessive workload in the series, and the BCCI medical team will try to ensure the new Test captain is ready for the ICC showpiece where his presence is mandatory to India’s fortunes.

According to sources privy to the development, the grade of Bumrah's back spasm has not yet been ascertained. India will open their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai.

If Bumrah’s injury is in grade 1 category, then it will take a minimum of two to three weeks of rehabilitation before Return to Play (RTP). In case of Grade 2 injury, the recovery can go up to six weeks, while Grade 3, the most severe in nature, requires a minimum three months of rest and rehabilitation programmes.

It was always known that Bumrah would not play the T20I bilateral series as this is not the World Cup year, but with the Champions Trophy around the corner, he would have certainly played two if not three ODIs against England as it's the 50-over format.

But now, the grade of his injury will decide whether Bumrah plays the England series at all or at least the last match at his home ground in Ahmedabad on February 12 to check on his fitness. India will face England in five T20Is and three ODIs from January 22.Published By: alan johnPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Read More: |  Cricket Australia breaks silence on not inviting Gavaskar for trophy presentationMust Watch

If you want to take senior players on tour, you have to make sure they play county cricket before the England series,"" Harbhajan said on his YouTube channel.Everything was fine till Rahul Dravid was there: Harbhajan Singh Further speaking ahead, the former spinner also questioned what went wrong with the Indian team suddenly, as everything was fine until Rahul Dravid was there. ""In the past six months, we lost to Sri Lanka, a series whitewash against New Zealand and now a 3-1 defeat in Australia. Everything was fine till Rahul Dravid was there. India won the World Cup, and everything was fine. But what happened suddenly?"" he added. Meanwhile, after the Australia series, India will host England for five T20Is and three ODIs beginning from January 22. The sole focus of the team will shift to limited overs cricket with the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 also on the horizon. The Indian team will be desperate to put their recent losses behind them and start the white-ball events on a winning note.Published By: Rishabh BeniwalPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  5 reasons why India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia

Grealish played a vital role in City's treble-winning 2022/23 campaign when they claimed the UEFA Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup titles. The 29-year-old scored five goals and registered 11 assists in 50 appearances during City's record-breaking season.  However, the last 2 seasons have been a struggle for Grealish as he hasn't scored in more than a year and has found himself relegated to the bench. Savinho was chosen ahead of Grealish for the West Ham United game. Guardiola, as quoted by Reuters, said that the Brazilian was in better shape than Grealish at the moment.  Also Read: Arne Slot rubbishes Real Madrid reason for Alexander Arnold's poor United show The City boss further stated that the England midfielder will need to fight for his place and should prove he deserves to play in the side.  ""Savinho is in better shape and everything than Jack, and that's why I played Savinho,"" Guardiola told reporters. ""Do I want the Jack that won the treble? Yeah, I want it, but I try to be honest with myself for that. They have to fight. You can say it's unfair."" ""If you think that, then it's fine, but you have to prove (to me), 'Okay, I'm going to fight with Savinho, to deserve to play in that position', every single day, every single week and every single month.""No doubt about Grealish's quality Guardiola went on to say that he doesn't doubt Grealish's quality but feels that the England midfielder needs to show his level in training as well.  ""Two weeks ago, he was injured and he needs rhythm, and to play, but players need training,"" Guardiola said. ""I don't have any doubt about the quality of Jack or any of these players. They would not be here (otherwise). ""I know that he can do it because I saw him. I saw his level and I want that, every single training session and every single game.""

Australia managed to beat India in a bilateral series for the first time since 2015 as they clinched the five-match series by 3-1. Following Australia’s victory, Johnson mentioned how the Indian team tried their best to put the Australian batters under pressure in the middle with their verbal volleys. However, the former speedster said that all of their efforts ended in futility as Australia ran away with the series. ""The Indian side appeared to embrace the mindset that it was 'two against 11' out in the middle, aiming to make the Aussie batters feel isolated and under pressure. The focus was not just on testing technical skills but also on challenging mental toughness. In Test cricket, it's crucial to create that environment, but their efforts didn't really pay off,” Johnson wrote in his column for The Nightly. Further ahead, Johnson also touched upon Sam Konstas’ verbal battle late on Day 1 with Jasprit Bumrah and said that the timing of it was wrong as there could only be one winner at that stage. ""I appreciate what Konstas was trying to do by supporting his teammate, but it was simply the wrong time for that kind of engagement. At that late stage of the day, there could only be one winner. This highlights a crucial aspect of introducing new players to the team: they need the guidance of experienced teammates to understand how to handle various scenarios within the game's dynamics,"" he added. Konstas tried to delay the proceedings late on Day 1 in the fifth Test, which annoyed India’s stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah, who came forward to even have a chat with him. Bumrah managed to dismiss his opening partner Usman Khawaja on the very next ball and even gave Konstas a stare right after getting the wicket. Meanwhile, following their loss against Australia, India will next play Test cricket on the tour to England in June later this year. The Rohit Sharma-led side will be eager to put their past performances behind them and start the new WTC cycle on a positive note.

Jaiswal was India's best batter during the recently-concluded series. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/border-gavaskar-trophy-australia-vs-india-yashasvi-jaiswal-performance-sunil-gavaskar-2660327-2025-01-06,"Sunil Gavaskar admitted that he was skeptical about Yashasvi Jaiswal performing well in Australia before praising the youngster for being consistent down under. Jaiswal was India's best batter during the series against Australia, scoring 391 runs across the 5 matches at an average of 43.44.  Jaiswal hit a hundred and 2 fifties during the series in challenging conditions, which Gavaskar did doubt he could pull off. Speaking to Star Sports, the Indian legend pointed to Jaiswal's dismissals in the South Africa series in similar conditions and claimed that the youngster's biggest virtue has been the way he has learnt from his mistakes.  Rohit Sharma-Virat Kohli conundrum: Can India afford to delay tough calls? ""This player's biggest virtue is that he learns a lot from his first mistake. The way he got out last year in both Test matches in South Africa, I had a slight doubt in my mind whether he would be able to score runs on similar pitches in Australia,"" said Gavaskar. ""In the first innings in Perth, he opened the face of his bat slightly and got caught at gully. In the second innings, he played with an absolutely straight bat to mid-off and mid-on, and when he was flicking, he was playing wide of mid-on and not towards square leg. He batted solidly.""Give yourself some time Gavaskar praised how Jaiswal was able to improve each game and pointed out how he was able to tackle the Aussie pacers effectively during the series.  ""He was standing outside the crease when it was swinging, especially when (Scott) Boland was bowling as his length is quite predictable. The other bowlers, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins, bowl different lengths, some balls are short, but Boland bowls very few bouncers. So it's praiseworthy how he kept improving in every match,"" said Gavaskar. However, the Indian legend advised Jaiswal to give himself some time at the beginning of his innings.  ""I just felt that he was getting overaggressive at times at the start. These are Test matches, so you have a lot of time, it is played over five days. No matter how the pitch might be, give yourself a little time at the start and the bowling becomes easy to face,"" Gavaskar elaborated. Jaiswal ended as the second-highest run-getter in the recently-concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

He emphasized that while Reddy’s batting has already turned heads, further development in his bowling could make him a match-winning all-rounder. Nitish Kumar Reddy’s performances in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy have been nothing short of remarkable, particularly given the challenges of debuting against a dominant Australian side. Pathan highlighted Reddy’s maiden century in the Melbourne Test as evidence of his capability to rise to the occasion in challenging conditions. Pathan highlighted Reddy’s maiden century in the Melbourne Test as evidence of his capability to rise to the occasion in challenging conditions. ""You have got an excellent prospect. It's not easy at all for any batter to make his debut in Australia. We might show his century, but he was batting very well before that, he was reaching the 40-run mark regularly,"" Irfan told Star Sports. ""However, when he scored a century, all of us started to feel that we got a player who could bat not at No. 8 or No. 7 but at No. 6. If he can consistently bat at No. 6, I feel he has that potential, India have got a terrific player, who can solve the combination to a large extent,"" he added. The young all-rounder delivered a standout moment in the Melbourne Test, scoring a gritty 114 in the first innings despite India succumbing to a 184-run defeat. Batting at No. 8, Reddy showcased his ability to counter a world-class bowling attack featuring Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc, and Scott Boland.Stellar Performances Under Pressure Reddy’s century in Melbourne was not just a personal milestone but also a testament to his composure in high-pressure situations. Adding an emotional touch, his father was present at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to witness his breakthrough moment. This knock followed consistent performances earlier in the series, where Reddy chipped in with valuable 40-run contributions in Perth and Adelaide, establishing himself as a reliable option in India’s middle order.Consistency Across the Series Over the course of the four-match series, Nitish Kumar Reddy accumulated 294 runs and picked up three wickets, underlining his all-round potential. His adaptability and determination on one of the most challenging tours for a debutant have made him a player to watch in the coming years. While his batting has been a revelation, Reddy’s bowling remains a work in progress. Enhancing this aspect of his game could elevate him to the ranks of India’s elite all-rounders. With his performances already sparking conversations about his future, Nitish Kumar Reddy is undoubtedly a valuable asset for Indian cricket, poised to make a lasting impact.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  2-tier Test cricket in the works, ICC chief Jay Shah leading the charge: Report

""The coach should not be talking about the Indian intimidation.

Rashid Khan, their star spinner, delivered a masterful performance, picking up a career-best 7 for 66 in the second innings and finishing with match figures of 11 for 160. The day began with Zimbabwe needing 73 runs to win with two wickets in hand. Rashid nearly struck on the fourth ball of the day, but captain Hashmatullah Shahidi dropped a skier off Richard Ngarava. The reprieve was short-lived as a direct hit from Shahidullah ran Ngarava out in the following over. Craig Ervine, the last recognised batter, was trapped lbw by Rashid moments later, sealing Afghanistan’s thrilling comeback win within just 15 deliveries on Day 5.advertisementAfghanistan win Test series

However, the introduction of spinners brought wickets in quick succession. Sikandar Raza (61) and Ervine (53) steadied the ship with two fifty-plus partnerships, but Rashid’s late-day heroics on Day 4 left Zimbabwe struggling at 205/8 overnight. The series win highlighted Afghanistan’s growing depth. Alongside Rashid’s brilliance, Ismat Alam and Afsar Zazai recorded maiden centuries, showcasing the team’s potential with both bat and ball. This historic win also marked Afghanistan’s fourth Test victory, adding to triumphs in Dehradun, Chattogram, and Abu Dhabi. It was a spirited performance against a Zimbabwe side that relied heavily on its senior players. After a high-scoring draw in the first Test, this match offered a more competitive contest, with Afghanistan proving their mettle under pressure to secure their first-ever Test series victory against Zimbabwe.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Must Watch

Last year, the Pole served a one-month ban after testing positive for a banned substance, named trimetazidine (TMZ), which is used as a heart medication.  Swiatek was provisionally suspended on September 12, 2024 before she missed three tournaments: the WTA 500 Hana Bank Korea Open, WTA 1000 China Open and WTA 1000 Dongfeng Voyah Wuhan Open. Recalling the tough times, Swiatek revealed that she was prosecuted and treated like a liar. “You can be at peace with yourself that you didn't do anything wrong, but no one actually treats you like that... Especially the people that are kind of prosecuting you. Even when you’re telling the truth, you feel like they treat you like a liar,” Swiatek told Tennis Insider Club. “I fought for everything so hard the past years. What if people are going to, in their head, take it away from me? What if they're going to look at me differently? I was home at the time and still there were people coming for autographs or for a selfie. And I was like 'Well, are you going to do that in one month?’” Swiatek added.

Leading the charge are Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, alongside rising stars like Lakshya Sen and seasoned campaigners like HS Prannoy. Fresh from a stellar 2024 season, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, seeded seventh, will look to begin the year on a high. The duo narrowly missed the title at this event last year but bounced back to reach three finals, clinching two victories. Their exceptional form saw them crowned Asian Games gold medallists, and they’ll aim to replicate that success this year. Reuniting with Malaysian coach Kim Tan Her has bolstered their preparations, but the road ahead is challenging. Their campaign opens against Chinese Taipei’s Ming Che Lu and Tang Kai Wei. Should they advance, a potential quarterfinal clash with Indonesia’s fourth seeds, Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto, looms large—a matchup that promises fireworks. In men’s singles, Lakshya Sen enters the tournament with renewed confidence after ending a title drought with a win at the Syed Modi International Super 300 and a podium finish at the King Cup International. Buoyed by these results, the 22-year-old will aim for a deep run in the highly competitive Super 1000 event. Veteran shuttler HS Prannoy makes his return after a five-month layoff due to chikungunya and fitness issues. The 32-year-old’s last appearance was a pre-quarterfinal exit at the Paris Olympics. Prannoy will face Canada’s Brian Yang in his opening match, hoping to regain his rhythm and shake off any rust. Priyanshu Rajawat faces a stern test against China’s seventh seed, Li Shi Feng. The young Indian has shown potential but needs to find consistency to challenge the top tier. In women’s singles, India will miss PV Sindhu, who is absent following her recent marriage. In her stead, Malvika Bansod, Aakarshi Kashyap, and Anupama Upadhyaya will represent the nation. Malvika begins her campaign against Malaysia’s Goh Jin Wei, Aakarshi takes on Denmark’s Julie Dawall Jakobsen, and Anupama faces a tough opener against Thailand’s eighth-seeded Pornpawee Chochuwong. The duo of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand, seeded sixth, will aim to build on their Super 300 title win in Lucknow and their strong showing at the BWF World Tour Finals. They face Thailand’s Ornnicha Jongsathapornparn and Sukitta Suwachai in their opening match. Eighth seeds Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa, fresh from their Guwahati Masters Super 100 title defence, will meet Japan’s Misaki Matsutomo and Chiharu Shida in the first round. Rutuparna and Swetaparna Panda, also competing, will hope to make their presence felt. Tanisha Crasto will team up with Dhruv Kapila, while Sathish Karunakaran and Aadya Variyath, along with Ashith Surya and Amrutha Pramuthesh, will represent India in mixed doubles. With a mix of seasoned champions and emerging talent, India’s badminton contingent is set for an exciting campaign at the Malaysia Super 1000.Malaysia Open 2025: Schedule Round of 32 - January 7 and 8 Round of 16 - January 9 Quarterfinals - January 10 Semi-finals - January 11 Finals - January 12Malaysia Open 2025: Where to watch The live telecast of Malaysia Open 2025 will be available on Sports 18-3.

Bumrah was India's standout player during the 1-3 series loss as he picked up a total of 32 wickets across the 5 matches. However, the pacer was forced to do a lot of work as he bowled a total of 151.2 overs during the series.  This would ultimately take a toll on the pacer as he suffered back spasms and was unable to bowl on Day 3 of the Sydney Test and India ended up losing the match. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Harbhajan claimed that Bumrah was squeezed like a sugarcane and was reduced to such a condition that he was not available in the end.  The former spinner feels if Bumrah had been available on Day 3, Australia would still have won the game, but it would have been a closer affair. Harbhajan ended up saying that the team management broke the pacer's 'back' and they should have planned his workload better.  “He was used like you squeezed juice from sugarcane. It was like ‘Travis Head has come, give the ball to Bumrah, Marnus has come, give the ball to Bumrah, Steve Smith has come, give the ball to Bumrah’,"" Harbhajan said on his YouTube channel.“How many overs will Bumrah bowl? He has been reduced to such a condition that he was not available at the end. If he was there, Australia may have won the fifth Test but they would have lost eight wickets, it would have been tough for them. You broke his back and the management should have decided on how many overs he should be given.""Harbhajan also slammed India's selection of 2 spinners on a spicy Sydney pitch. “The team selection was not right. Two spinners were played on a spicy pitch, you saw green patches. It is beyond my understanding that despite playing so much cricket and watching so much cricket you do not understand such a small thing... what to do on such pitch,"" said Harbhajan.The latest reports suggest that Bumrah could end up missing the majority of the England white-ball series in a bid to be ready and fit for the Champions Trophy.

Christian, who retired from professional cricket last year, came out of retirement to support the injury-depleted Thunder squad, where he also serves as an assistant coach. His cameo of 23 runs off 15 balls, punctuated by two towering sixes, injected energy into the Thunder’s innings of 8-173. The seasoned all-rounder showcased his timeless skill and adaptability as he stepped up in a moment of crisis. Christian's powerful sixes were a nostalgic reminder of his finishing prowess, proving that his touch remains intact despite stepping away from professional cricket. His return was prompted by injuries to key players like Daniel Sams and Cameron Bancroft, both sidelined following a devastating collision during the Thunder’s match against Perth Scorchers. Sams sustained a concussion, while Bancroft suffered a fractured shoulder blade, broken nose, and concussion, leaving the team short-handed.Watch the video here:

— KFC Big Bash League (@BBL) January 6, 2025 Christian, considered a T20 specialist with 409 matches for 18 teams across six countries, was a natural choice as a replacement player. Despite not playing a professional game since the Sydney Sixers' BBL12 semi-final loss to Brisbane Heat, Christian remained active and fit, competing in the NSW Premier Cricket competition. His experience and leadership were invaluable additions to a Thunder side grappling with an injury crisis that has also sidelined Jason Sangha, Nic Maddinson, and Tanveer Sangha. Christian’s career includes representing Australia in 43 white-ball matches and winning three BBL titles with Brisbane Heat, Melbourne Renegades, and Sydney Sixers. Known for his globetrotting exploits and adaptability, he remains one of the most reliable T20 players. In a game that could have been overshadowed by injuries and setbacks, Dan Christian turned back the clock, showcasing his enduring class and proving why he remains a cherished figure in Australian cricket. His return added a layer of excitement and resilience to Sydney Thunder’s campaign, offering hope amidst adversity.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  2-tier Test cricket in the works, ICC chief Jay Shah leading the charge: Report

Alexander-Arnold endured a challenging outing in Liverpool's 2-2 draw against Manchester United at Anfield, with the England international at fault for the visitors’ opening goal. His overall performance fell well short of the high standards he has consistently set, adding to a frustrating evening for the full-back. Earlier in the week, reports emerged linking Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid, who had reportedly enquired about the possibility of signing the 26-year-old during the ongoing transfer window. With his contract set to expire in the summer, Real Madrid’s interest was unsurprising. However, Liverpool swiftly dismissed the approach, making it clear that the defender is not available for a January move. The timing of the inquiry, combined with Alexander-Arnold's subpar display against United, has sparked speculation about the potential impact of the transfer chatter on his performance. Arne Slot has denied the claims and Van Dijk has come to the defence of his teammate.  The Liverpool captain, whose own contract will come to an end this summer, said he has no concerns about his own situation. Van Dijk said that Alexander-Arnold is trying to perform in the best way possible for the club and that's his main focus.  “I am fine with it. Trent has his own people around him, his family and we are there as well,” he said. “He wants to perform in the best way possible like we all do. That is the main focus."" “In my opinion, maybe ask him, that is the distraction... the game.” Van Dijk also said that Liverpool should have done better in their game against United at Anfield on Sunday. The Reds captain admitted his side were sloppy allowed United to comeback into the game while they were leading 2-1.  “I think we should have done better especially after going 2-1 up,” he added. “We were sloppy and let them come back. United came back into the game because of their quality but we lost the ball too easily in difficult moments."" “Spaces became much bigger than they should have been."" “We are playing against a good opponent. I think everyone from the outside world forgets that by the sound that had been going around before the game."" “They have good players. They are obviously a work in progress like we are but they made it difficult for us."" Liverpool will next face Tottenham Hotspur in the first leg of the EFL Cup semi-final on January 8.

Keane’s comments came after Alexander-Arnold’s underwhelming performance during Liverpool's 2-2 draw against United. The full-back struggled to contain the relentless attacking trio of Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, and Rasmus Hojlund, who exploited his defensive frailties throughout the game. Fernandes, roaming freely in midfield, orchestrated several probing attacks, while Dalot's overlaps and Hojlund's clever movement caused repeated problems for the Liverpool defence.

— Tranmere Rovers FC (@TranmereRovers) January 5, 2025 Despite Keane’s jibe, Alexander-Arnold remains a hot property in the transfer market. With his Anfield contract set to expire in June 2025, the 25-year-old has reportedly caught the attention of Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are believed to be exploring the possibility of securing the England international on a pre-contract agreement, much like their approach with previous high-profile signings. Tranmere Rovers, clearly entertained by Keane’s quip, cheekily responded on social media, playfully denying any plans to sign the Liverpool defender. The humorous exchange quickly went viral, adding levity to an otherwise intense discussion about Alexander-Arnold’s current form and future prospects. While his offensive contributions and passing range remain among the best in the Premier League, Alexander-Arnold’s defensive shortcomings have often drawn criticism. Matches like the one against United highlight the challenges he faces against top-tier attackers, raising questions about his suitability for a club like Real Madrid. For now, Alexander-Arnold continues to divide opinions. His ability to bounce back from this performance will be crucial, both for Liverpool's campaign and his growing reputation amidst swirling transfer speculation.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Manchester City wants 'treble-winner' Jack Grealish back in side: Pep Guardiola

 Shafali Verma’s wait for a comeback to the national team has prolonged after again being left out. After missing the ODIs in Australia and the limited-overs series at home against the West Indies, the youngster won’t be a part of the series against Ireland either. Earlier, Harmanpreet Kaur had said that Shafali needed to be ‘in the zone’ to stake her claim back to the Indian setup. Shafali was stupendous in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy where she finished as the leading run-scorer. In seven games, she scored 527 runs at an average of 75.29 and a strike-rate of 152.31 with two centuries and two fifties. Against Bengal, she blasted 197 runs off 115 balls, although in a losing cause. But for her, her efforts in the domestic competition couldn’t suffice for a berth in the squad for the Ireland ODIs. India have persisted with Pratika Rawal as Smriti Mandhana’s opening partner after she was impressive in her maiden ODI series against the West Indies.Arundhati Reddy left out once again

 Arundhati Reddy was India’s joint-highest wicket-taker in the Women’s T20 World Cup, where she accounted for seven scalps at an economy rate of six. In Australia, the speedster played only a solitary ODI where she rattled the opposition top order with figures of 10-2-26-4. But since then, mysteriously, she hasn’t donned the national jersey in any format. Despite performing to the best of her ability, Arundhati has struggled to be a regular member of India’s national team. For the series against Ireland, India have Saima Thakor and Titas Sadhu as their frontline fast bowlers.India keep experimenting aggressively

 Since the T20 World Cup, India have gone on a massive experimental spree in the ODI format. Minnu Mani, Tejal Hasabnis, Pratika Rawal, Titas Sadhu, Saima Thakor, Priya Mishra and Tanuja Kanwar are the ones to have made their debuts for India in the last two and a half months. For the upcoming series, India handed a maiden ODI call-up to Raghvi Bist. They also recalled Mumbai all-rounder Sayali Satghare. Sayali, who plays for the Gujarat Giants in the WPL, was also a part of the ODIs against New Zealand back in October, but did not get a chance to play. Before the ODI World Cup to be held next year on home soil, India are trying to build a pool of players for the future and have enough replacements and options up their sleeves.Raghvi Bist rewarded

 Raghvi Bist, the hard-hitting batter from Uttarakhand, earned her maiden ODI call-up for the Ireland series. The 20-year-old recently made her debut in the T20I series against West Indies and grabbed the limelight with her ability to strike the ball cleanly. Although she failed on debut, she scored an unbeaten 31 in her second appearance for the national team. Raghvi registered her first boundary for India with a powerful strike over mid-wicket off Karishma Ramharack. After the match, the youngster earned praise from Smriti Mandhana, who said, “The way Raghvi batted was impressive. She came in with lots of intent and hitting her fourth or fifth ball for six, I would not have been able to do that in my second match.” After getting scores of 82, 70 and 53 against Australia A back in August, Raghvi hasn’t taken a backward step. Raghvi also had her fair share of success in the Senior Women’s One-Day Trophy where she made 172 runs with two half-centuries.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  India Women in 2025: Litmus test for Harmanpreet, U19 title defence and WPL festival

Yet, the inconsistency against lower-ranked sides raises a compelling question: can this team channel brilliance into consistent success across all battles?",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/football/story/manchester-united-vs-liverpool-big-six-shine-rune-amorim-consistency-problem-2660543-2025-01-06,"Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United continues to be a riddle—erratic against lower-ranked teams yet transforming into a formidable force when facing the Premier League’s “Big Six.” Their latest spectacle, a thrilling 2-2 draw against table-toppers Liverpool, showcased both tactical brilliance and unwavering spirit, leaving fans hopeful and puzzled in equal measure. Amorim’s biggest challenge lies in unravelling the mystery of why his side thrives under the spotlight of high-stakes clashes but falters against more modest opposition. For a manager known for his tactical ingenuity at Sporting CP, the answer might lie in turning sporadic brilliance into an enduring trait. Even in the post-match interview after the Liverpool draw, United captain Bruno Fernandes shared the same sentiment, which only brings the problem out in the open.advertisementA Tactical Masterclass Against LiverpoolThe clash with Liverpool wasn’t just about salvaging a point—it was a lesson in adaptability. Amorim, mindful of United’s red-card troubles in previous matches, introduced a more measured defensive strategy. Gone were the reckless tackles; instead, United’s defenders shielded the ball with precision, frustrating Liverpool’s relentless pressing machine. The clash with Liverpool wasn’t just about salvaging a point—it was a lesson in adaptability. Amorim, mindful of United’s red-card troubles in previous matches, introduced a more measured defensive strategy. Gone were the reckless tackles; instead, United’s defenders shielded the ball with precision, frustrating Liverpool’s relentless pressing machine. This adjustment, coupled with incisive attacking runs, disrupted Arne Slot’s meticulously drilled Liverpool side. It wasn’t just about containing the opposition; it was about asserting themselves in the moments that mattered. United proved, yet again, that when the stakes are high, their performance rises to meet them.How United Has Fared Against the Big Six Manchester United vs Arsenal
A 2-0 defeat to Arsenal earlier this season could have been disheartening, but the performance painted a different picture. Players like Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo were relentless, creating openings against Mikel Arteta’s polished side. The corner woes that cost them the game were overshadowed by the grit and character Amorim instilled. Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur
In the Carabao Cup quarter-final, United trailed 3-0 to Tottenham until the 55th minute. Then came a fiery resurgence. Two quick goals turned the match on its head, and even after conceding a fourth late on, United responded with their own third in stoppage time. The relentless fighting spirit was unmistakable, even in defeat. Manchester United vs Manchester City
Amorim’s tactical genius truly shone in a dramatic 2-1 victory at the Etihad. United’s intensity and precision overwhelmed Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City, making the December 15 clash one to remember. It wasn’t just about the win—it was a statement of intent against the reigning champions. Amorim’s men are yet to face Chelsea, a team oscillating between brilliance and inconsistency this season. Given United’s pattern, fans can expect a high-intensity performance against Enzo Maresca’s side, making it a clash to watch.The Consistency Conundrum Amorim’s United has proven they can compete with the best. Now, the task is to replicate this fire against every opponent. If Amorim can channel this potential consistently, Manchester United’s resurgence might become more than a fleeting promise—it could signal a genuine return to glory.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  3rd Division club trolls Trent Alexander-Arnold after disaster show vs Man United

— Afghanistan Cricket Board (@ACBofficials) January 5, 2025 Ismat, alongside Rahmat Shah (139), turned the tide for Afghanistan with a crucial 132-run partnership for the seventh wicket. Their resilience helped the team recover from 69/5 to post 363 runs, setting Zimbabwe a challenging target of 278. Rashid Khan then produced a bowling masterclass, taking 7 for 66 in the second innings and finishing with match figures of 11 for 160. On the final day, Zimbabwe, needing 73 runs with two wickets in hand, collapsed within just 15 deliveries. Reflecting on the team’s achievement, Hashmatullah remarked: “We played good cricket throughout the series. This win shows we have the talent to beat any side in any format. We’ll believe in ourselves going forward.” Afghanistan’s first-ever Test series win against Zimbabwe showcased the team’s growing depth. Ismat’s century not only honoured his father’s legacy as a founding figure of Afghan cricket but also symbolised the team’s ability to rise under pressure. Alongside Rashid’s brilliance, the victory sets a promising tone as Afghanistan eyes the Champions Trophy.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Michael Vaughan and Usman Khawaja praise Yashasvi Jaiswal in Instagram comments

Nagal started strong, edging out the opening set in a nail-biting tie-break, showcasing his resilience under pressure. He saved 70% of the break points he faced and remained competitive on return, winning 58% of points on Michelsen’s second serve. However, as the match progressed, Michelsen raised his game, relying on a powerful serve and improved consistency. The American’s six aces and a dominant first-serve performance proved crucial in shifting the momentum. Nagal, meanwhile, struggled on his second serve, winning just 33% of those points, which allowed Michelsen to take control in the latter stages. Despite Nagal’s valiant efforts, Michelsen capitalised on these opportunities to secure a place in the pre-quarterfinals.Balaji and Reyes-Varela down Bopanna-Barrientos The Indo-Mexican duo of N.

Bopanna, who recently teamed up with Barrientos following the end of his two-year partnership with Australia’s Matthew Ebden, displayed an impressive first-serve performance. The pair boasted an 81% first-serve accuracy, winning 76% of those points, which gave them an early edge and secured the opening set. However, Balaji and Reyes-Varela regrouped in the second set, capitalizing on a dip in their opponents’ serve and return game. Their aggressive strategy paid dividends as they secured multiple breaks of serve to take the set convincingly and force a match tiebreak. In the decider, the unseeded pair held their nerve, displaying excellent composure and teamwork to seal the victory in just over 75 minutes.

The Aussies recently bagged the Border Gavaskar Trophy after beating India 3-1 in the recently-concluded five-match Test series. O'Keeffe said that Australia struggled against Jasprit Bumrah, the Player of the Series, after taking 32 wickets, but they managed to get under Rohit’s skin to the extent that the Indian captain pulled out of the New Year’s Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Covarege “They couldn’t bring down (Jasprit) Bumrah. He was too good. But then the baton was passed to Rohit Sharma, and they brought him down straight away, to the extent that he withdrew from the final Test,” O'Keeffe told Fox Sports. “So that’s a tactic they seem to want to do if they can, if they can break the skipper and make him anonymous, it empowers them,” O'Keeffe said. With the win in the Sydney Test, Australia also sealed their berth in the World Test Championship final to be held later this year against South Africa at the Lord’s Cricket Ground. O'Keeffe lauded the Aussies for successfully putting pressure on visiting captains, including Rohit, Shan Masood, Kraigg Brathwaite and Tim Southee. “But if you look at the captains they’ve brought down in recent times, Sharma. Tick. Shan Masood with Pakistan. It was three-nil. Kraigg Brathwaite, it was one-all, but they were on top of Kraigg. They went to New Zealand and brought down Tim Southee, winning two-nil,” O’Keeffe added. As far as Rohit is concerned, he had a forgettable tour of Australia. In three games, he scored only 31 runs at an average of 6.20 before not playing in the Sydney Test.

He never gives up and it's like that session after session – he'll come at you with the ball."" Shastri also praised Cummins for bringing Australia back into the game vs India, as a captain, bowler and even a batter.  “And just when the chips were down, various times in the series, he rose to the occasion.

All of this happened in one and a half year as the Australian star enjoys a purple patch in his captaincy tenure.  For Shastri, the captivating narratives and compelling storylines were too enticing to just simply watch on television. They’ve drawn massive crowds, with many even travelling from abroad to witness history being made in person. “For people to get out there and watch cricket when there is television, when there is OTT platforms, where all that is there, still for 375,000 people to come (to Melbourne) and then replicate that in Sydney with full houses, it’s unreal,” Shastri added.

With just four Tests in 2025, Mathews fears disrupted careers and missed milestones as Sri Lanka's Test future hangs in the balance.",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/angelo-mathews-slams-icc-for-sri-lankas-limited-2025-test-schedule-shocking-2660617-2025-01-06,"Sri Lanka's star all-rounder Angelo Mathews has raised concerns over the diminishing opportunities for Test cricket, urging the International Cricket Council (ICC) to take immediate action to address the inequalities in international scheduling. His call to action comes amid Sri Lanka’s sharply reduced Test commitments, with only four matches scheduled for 2025 and six for 2026.   ""Absolutely shocking to hear that Srilanka is only playing 4 test matches this entire year, including the aus tests this month . @ICC,"" Mathews tweeted.  Mathews, a cornerstone of Sri Lankan cricket, expressed frustration in a Sri Lankan newspaper over the sidelining of Test cricket in favour of shorter, commercially lucrative formats. “It’s very disappointing not to get that many Tests,” Mathews remarked. “It’s really disheartening to wait a year between Tests. Cricket is about rhythm, and such long breaks disrupt everything, affecting players’ careers. I hope ICC and SLC will look into this and work out a much fairer scheduling.”

Sri Lanka's 2025 schedule Absolutely shocking to hear that srilanka is only playing 4 test matches this entire year including the aus tests this month @ICC .
— Angelo Mathews (@Angelo69Mathews) January 6, 2025 Sri Lanka’s Test schedule paints a grim picture. In 2025, they begin with a two-Test series against Australia, critical for their World Test Championship (WTC) aspirations. However, a five-month gap follows before their next series against Bangladesh. In 2026, Sri Lanka will play just six Tests—two each against the West Indies, India, and Pakistan.   At 37, Mathews is nearing the twilight of his career, yet the lack of Tests has dimmed his hopes of joining the exclusive 10,000-run club. With 8,042 runs in 116 Tests, he needs 1,958 more to achieve this milestone. “It’s very disappointing,” Mathews admitted, adding that consistent opportunities are essential for maintaining form and fitness.   Similarly, former Test captain Dimuth Karunaratne faces uncertainty. The 36-year-old opener, with 7,165 runs in 98 matches, shares Mathews’ goal but expressed doubt about his future in the format. “I haven’t given up hopes of getting there (10,000 runs), but it all depends on my form and fitness. This lack of Test matches isn’t helping me,” Karunaratne said.   The impact of this scheduling crisis extends beyond veterans. Without adequate exposure to Test cricket, young players miss opportunities to develop endurance, tactical acumen, and mental resilience.   Despite the challenges, Mathews remains optimistic about Sri Lanka’s WTC aspirations. A 2-0 victory against Australia in their upcoming series could secure their maiden WTC final berth, provided other results align. “We’re determined to give it our all against the Aussies,” he said.   Sri Lanka’s plight highlights the urgency for ICC intervention to preserve the legacy of Test cricket, ensuring fair opportunities for all nations and safeguarding the format’s future.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/sam-konstas-pink-test-sydney-cousin-grandfather-cancer-2660613-2025-01-06,"Sam Konstas opened up on why the Pink Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground holds a ‘special’ place for him. On Sunday, the youngster was a part of the Australian team that beat India by six wickets at the SCG to win the five-match Test series 3-1. The Sydney Test is celebrated as the Pink Test since 2009 in the honour of legendary fast bowler Glenn McGrath’s wife Jane, who passed away with breast cancer back in 2008. Border Gavaskar Trophy Full Covarege Talking about his affinity for the Pink Test, Konstas recalled that his cousin died of leukaemia while his beloved grandfather passed away with bowel cancer. ""Obviously it's a special event, the McGrath Foundation, and hopefully we spread more awareness for cancer, get the funds in, because I remember my cousin passed away with leukaemia and my grandpa with bowel cancer. So obviously we hope we spread awareness and get the cure,"" Konstas said in an interview with Triple M cricket.‘Probably my fault’ Konstas also talked about the heated exchange with Jasprit Bumrah, who won the Player of the Series award. After he confronted Bumrah in the Sydney Test, the Indian speedster dismissed Usman Khawaja. Konstas admitted that it was his “fault” and also credited Bumrah. ""Oh, I didn't get too fazed. Unfortunately, Uzi got out. He was trying to buy some time a little bit. It was probably my fault, but it happens. It's cricket. Credit to Bumrah. He got the wicket, but obviously great performance from the team,” Konstas added. Konstas came to the limelight after playing some audacious strokes of Bumrah to score his maiden Test fifty in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In two Tests, Konstas scored 113 runs at an average of 28.25 with scores of 60, 8, 23 and 22 to his name.Published By: sabyasachi chowdhuryPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  SA vs PAK: Shan Masood shatters 27-year-old record to make history for PakistanMust Watch

Captain Shan Masood fell in the first over, and the team struggled against a disciplined South African bowling attack. Babar Azam top-scored with 58, while Mohammad Rizwan contributed 46, but the middle and lower order offered little resistance. Kagiso Rabada was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets, while Keshav Maharaj and Marco Jansen chipped in with two wickets each. Pakistan were forced to follow on, trailing by 421 runs. Pakistan put up a spirited fight in the second innings, led by a defiant 145 from skipper Masood, who stitched a 205-run opening partnership with Babar (81). Despite losing quick wickets after the second new ball, Mohammad Rizwan (41) and Salman Agha (48) built a solid partnership to frustrate South Africa. Maharaj, who returned to the XI, broke the stand, dismissing both batters and ending Pakistan’s resistance. Aamer Jamal’s quick-fire 34 helped Pakistan reach 478, avoiding an innings defeat but leaving South Africa a mere 58-run target. South Africa wasted no time in chasing the target, reaching it in just 7.1 overs. David Bedingham smashed an unbeaten 47 off 30 balls, including five fours and three sixes, while Aiden Markram remained not out on 14. This victory marked South Africa's second 10-wicket win over Pakistan in Tests, the first being in Durban in 2002. It also extended their remarkable unbeaten streak in the WTC cycle. Pakistan, on the other hand, sit second-last on the WTC table, with their next challenge being a home series against West Indies. For South Africa, the win highlighted their all-round strength, with contributions from both bat and ball. Pakistan's fighting second-innings performance showed glimpses of potential, but their poor first innings proved costly in the end.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Ravi Shastri reveals admiration for Pat Cummins since coaching era: He amazes meMust Watch

The youngster fractured his right ankle and was stretchered off midway through the second Test between South Africa and Pakistan at Newlands in Cape Town. Babar scored two fifties in the New Year's Test, but his efforts were not enough to help Pakistan secure a win. Since Pakistan were playing with just 10 players, Masood praised Babar for his resilience. ""It was unfortunate that Babar got out to a shot that he plays really well. His character, stepping up and raising his hand when we lost Saim to open the innings and score back-to-back fifties, those are things that please you more than anything.

Despite Pakistan’s fightback in the second innings, where they posted 478 runs, it wasn’t enough. South Africa only needed to chase a modest target of 57 runs, which they did with ease in just 7.1 overs. Masood pointed out that the team needed to capitalise on crucial moments, something they couldn’t do in both Tests despite giving a tough fight. ""A lot of good things. We did very well in Centurion, but didn’t close it out in the crunch situations. Credit to South Africa there. Even here, we didn’t start well, both with bat and ball. We conceded too many runs initially, and then with the bat, we folded quite early on what was a really battable wicket. It was a really nice surface, something that surprised everyone. The fightback after that—those are the responses you look for. Individually, people stepped up, and as a team, we stepped up in many moments. We need to learn how to win the crucial moments,"" he added.Published By: Diya KakkarPublished On: Jan 6, 2025Also Read |  Angelo Mathews slams ICC for Sri Lanka's limited 2025 Test schedule: ShockingMust Watch

In Australia's first innings of the fifth Test, Smith edged a delivery to slip five runs shy of the landmark. Prasidh Krishna's delivery rose sharply in the second innings from a short length. Smith advanced down the pitch, only to fend it into the gully, leaving him stranded on 9,999 Test runs. ""I got chainsawed, didn’t I! Pretty nasty delivery, actually—back of a length. I thought, 'Oh, there's one to punch through point,' and it just took off,"" the former Australian captain told Triple M after their six-wicket win on Sunday, which secured the trophy for Australia after a decade. ""It wasn’t to be (reaching 10k Test runs), but that’s alright—we got the result we were after. ""Absolutely (toughest SCG pitch I’ve played on). By a mile. It was two-paced, up and down, seaming all over the place, and swinging. I’ve never played on a wicket like that at the SCG before. It was incredibly difficult to bat."" Smith scored 33 in the first innings and 4 in the second, failing to sign off on a high after notching two centuries in the series. ""I love the game; it’s been a fun series. India are an unbelievable team. There have been some great challenges—Bumrah in particular. It’s been great fun, and we were fortunate to get the result in the end,"" the 35-year-old added. Left-arm quick Mitchell Starc highlighted the collective effort of the squad, support staff, and families that contributed to the successful outcome. ""Five Test matches against India are always gruelling, especially when Tests four and five are so close together,"" Starc told Fox Cricket. ""We’ve all worked our backsides off to get to this series. We knew it was a big one on the calendar, and I think that’s just reward for all the hard work—from the support staff, the families, the extended squad, and everyone who’s been involved. It’s a fantastic result, and today caps it off. ""I like staying out of the scanner, but sometimes I’m made to get in there. It’s always, 'If I can make it worse, what does worse look like?' and if not, then kick on. I always want to be a part of it, to contribute—I don’t want to leave the guys a man short. Once I knew I wouldn’t let them down, I was ready to go."" India lost the series 1-3 after defeats in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, while winning the opener in Perth. Veteran spinner Nathan Lyon described the triumph as special: ""It has been a long time. There are only a few of us who’ve held this trophy before. It’s a special moment and something we’ve all wanted to achieve as a team, especially when you’re up against a great side. ""The boys have been pretty amazing. There were nerves—there are always nerves when you care—but the boys were fantastic,"" Lyon told Fox Cricket. Reflecting on the challenging series, Australia’s number three batter Marnus Labuschagne said: ""I love the Baggy Green, I love Test cricket, and I love playing with these boys.

The bilateral series shattered the records to become the most attended non-Ashes series in the history of Australian  cricket. A total of 837,879 people attended the games in the stadiums, which awed the commentators during the tenure of the series. The BGT was the fourth most attended series in Australian cricket history, behind the 1936-37, 2017-18, and 1946-47 Ashes series. Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting was asked about the growing popularity of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and whether it had surpassed the Ashes. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Ponting said that there was no doubt that the BGT was growing by leaps and bounds, but the fans will get to know which series is more popular when England visit Australia later in 2025. “I had a look at the numbers yesterday, it was something like 837,000 people came to watch the Test matches, which is unheard of here in Australia,” Ponting told The ICC Review. “So now that this series has happened, Australia have England coming out next summer so we'll get a better idea then. If the numbers aren't the same, then there'll be no doubt that the (Border-Gavaskar) rivalry (is bigger), certainly from the fans’ point of view,"" Ponting added. “There's two separate parts to this: There's what the fans want to see and the rivalry that they want to make of it, but it's also how the players view the rivalry between the three teams now,” Ponting said. Ponting rightly pointed out the series figures could have been even bigger if the Test matches went all 5 days. Only the Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne went to the final day in the entire series. Matches in Adelaide and Sydney finished in just 3 days. “Perth only went four days, Adelaide only went three days, Sydney only went three days,” Ponting continued. “Those numbers would have been astronomical if those Test matches all went five days. So exactly this time next year, we'll have a great idea of the biggest rivalry in world cricket,” concluded the legendary cricketer.Published By: Kingshuk KusariPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Also Read |  2-tier Test cricket in the works, ICC chief Jay Shah leading the charge: ReportMust Watch

Rabada issued a warning directed at favourites Australia, saying that the Proteas knew how to beat the Pat Cummins-led side. South Africa secured their place in the WTC final in emphatic fashion, cruising to a ten-wicket win over Pakistan. This marked their seventh straight Test win. The victory was hard-fought, as the Proteas toiled for two and a half days to dismiss Pakistan for 478 in the third innings. A courageous century from Pakistan captain Shan Masood, supported by multiple contributions from his teammates, kept the contest alive. Pakistan managed to overcome the second-highest first-innings deficit in Test history, forcing South Africa to bat again. However, the modest target of 58 proved to be mere formality, and South Africa chased it down in just 7.1 overs. Rabada's six-wicket haul in the match once again underlined his importance to South Africa's aspirations of lifting the WTC trophy at Lord's this June. His devastating spells showcased why he will be central to their hopes in the final. While Rabada acknowledges that South Africa will enter the contest as underdogs against the reigning champions, he remains confident. Having played a significant role in South Africa's historic series victories over Australia in 2016-17 and 2017-18, he believes the Proteas have what it takes to upset the odds at the home of cricket. ""It's actually quite some distance away, but a big occasion like the World Test Championship final gets you up for it,"" Rabada said in an interview with SuperSport after the match. ""South Africa versus Australia has always been an intense rivalry because we play cricket quite similarly. We play hard – and they're going to come hard at us, and we know that. But we also know how to beat them. One hundred per cent, Test cricket is still alive. It's our best format that we've been playing right now."" Rabada also highlighted the significance of Test cricket in South Africa's rich cricketing history. ""When you look at South African cricket and all our legends, they've all been great Test cricketers. The world's best players are Test cricketers, and this series against Pakistan has been a wonderful advertisement for Test cricket, especially in South Africa."" With the WTC final looming, Rabada and his teammates are poised to reignite the fierce rivalry between South Africa and Australia, with hopes of bringing home the ultimate prize in Test cricket.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: Jan 7, 2025Read More |  Steve Smith attributes missing out on 10,000 Test runs milestone to tough SCG pitch
