Psychologists have an innovative solution to help you stick to your resolutions – start them in December.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/why-now-december-is-a-better-time-to-start-your-new-year-resolutions-2652036-2024-12-19,"At the start of every new year, many people create a list of resolutions to improve their lives. For some, it’s finally taking the plunge and joining a gym, committing to never pick up a cigarette again, or embarking on a journey of eating healthily every day. They wait for 1 January to give themselves a fresh start and channel the infamous “new year, new me” energy. And when January actually arrives and it is time to execute those resolutions, many find themselves struggling to follow through as the initial burst of motivation fades and old habits prove difficult to break. Psychologists, meanwhile, have an innovative solution to making your new year resolutions – start them in December.Start your new year resolution right away Experts say that starting new year resolutions in December can improve the chances of sustaining them. The reasons why it works are ample. Firstly, it puts you into a soft practice and a habit-building zone. Building the foundation for habit change takes time; it often requires multiple attempts and some experimentation to identify the best ways to disrupt the context that supports unwanted habits.

“December's built-in challenges – like holiday treats and busy schedules – create an ideal testing ground. If someone can maintain their resolution during this demanding month, they're more likely to sustain it during less challenging times. Think of it as training with weights before running a race – when January arrives, the path feels lighter and more manageable,” explains Dr Chandni Tugnait, a psychotherapist, life and business coach, and founder-director of Gateway of Healing.The December strategy also helps overcome the ‘all-or-nothing’ mindset. After the initial excitement of a New Year’s resolution fades, it’s easy for the goal to lose priority, leading you to revert to old habits. Taking a test run in December can mentally prepare you for the changes you plan to implement in the year ahead. “December's built-in challenges – like holiday treats and busy schedules – create an ideal testing ground.

After the initial excitement of a New Year’s resolution fades, it’s easy for the goal to lose priority, leading you to revert to old habits. Taking a test run in December can mentally prepare you for the changes you plan to implement in the year ahead. “According to the Change Theory, when building new behaviours, a person goes through a cycle of precontemplation, contemplation, decision-making, action, maintenance, and relapse many times. So, if one is unable to maintain their new year resolution for a day or more, instead of taking it as a failure, view it as a slippage and start again,” explains Charu Prabhakar, clinical psychologist at online mental health service platform Lissun. By starting your resolution in December, you allow yourself to experience this cycle early, making it easier to stay resilient and recommit after a slip-up instead of losing hope and abandoning your resolution. Yash Sharma, a fitness coach who practises this approach himself, has already started working on his New Year’s resolution of training early in the morning. He explains that the mind often perceives a New Year’s resolution as an overwhelming task. “When the New Year begins, you spend time deciding what to do, then push yourself to start, all while thinking you need to maintain it for the entire year. It feels like a massive challenge. However, if you start pushing yourself in December, it becomes easier for your mind to continue the habit into the next year,” he shares.

 According to Dr Rahul Chandhok, Senior Consultant and Head Psychiatry at Artemis Lite Hospital, New Delhi, “December is the ‘soft start’ into resolutions. There is not as much tension and anxiety since the change in behaviour has been going on for weeks rather than just a cold turkey kind of change.” When you start those resolutions in December, habits already take root, making the transition into the new year smoother. “The brain has already begun adapting to the changes, whether it's a new exercise routine or a different eating pattern,” explains Dr Tugnait. Additionally, there is also an advantage to fine-tuning goals before the official new year begins. “Rather than diving in headfirst on 1 January, December provides time to adjust strategies and identify potential obstacles. This trial period helps create more realistic and sustainable resolutions, increasing the likelihood of long-term success,” says Dr Tugnait.More ways to make your new resolutions successful Of course, you can introduce or develop a habit at any time of the year. However, many people tend to join the craze for New Year’s resolutions, even though habits require time and consistency to build. It is also very important to be realistic with the resolution you set. Here are some helpful hacks to give a longer life to your new year resolutions:

Set SMART goals
Always set realistic, specific, and achievable goals.
“The goals should be Specific (example: I want to lose 5 kg), Measurable (I’ll measure it on the weighing scale), Achievable (this has to be achieved in a span of 3 months), Relevant (This is relevant for me as I want to work on my physical health), and have a fixed Time of execution (I’ll exercise between 6–7 pm). This approach of SMART goals has scientifically shown to enhance chances of sustaining them,” suggests psychologist Charu Prabhakar.

This approach of SMART goals has scientifically shown to enhance chances of sustaining them,” suggests psychologist Charu Prabhakar.
 Micro-milestone method
Dr Tugnait suggests breaking down your main resolution into monthly mini-goals. Instead of saying, ""I'll save Rs 50,000 this year,"" commit to saving at least Rs 3,000–Rs 4,000 each month. These smaller targets feel more achievable and provide regular wins to celebrate.


 Follow the two-day rule
Never skip your resolution-related activity for more than two consecutive days.
“This flexibility prevents the ‘all-or-nothing’ mindset while maintaining consistency. It's particularly effective for habits like exercise, meditation, or learning a new skill,” says Dr Tugnait.


 Habit stacking
Link your new habits to existing daily routines. If you want to read more, pair it with your morning coffee or evening wind-down. These connections make new habits feel more natural and sustainable.

Celebrities worldwide, from Hollywood A-listers to Indian fitness enthusiasts, are singing its praises, calling it the “magic molecule” for youth, energy, and longevity. But what is NAD+, why are stars obsessed with it, and how is it impacting the Indian wellness market? Dr Anjali Hooda, a renowned MD and Internist, explains, “NAD+ is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It plays a critical role in energy production, DNA repair, and slowing the ageing process. As we age, NAD+ levels decline, leading to fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and visible signs of ageing. Boosting NAD+ levels can help rejuvenate the body at a cellular level.”Why celebrities are hooked From Kendall Jenner to Hailey Beiber, celebrities are reportedly using NAD+ therapies for their anti-ageing and energy-boosting effects. Intravenous (IV) NAD+ drips have become a sought-after treatment among the elite, promising to enhance mental clarity, physical performance, and even recovery from jet lag or rigorous schedules.

 Bollywood has not been left behind. Indian stars, under the guidance of experts like Dr Hooda, are embracing NAD+ to maintain their hectic lifestyles and youthful appearances. “Actors and performers need peak energy levels and radiant skin, which NAD+ helps achieve. It’s no surprise they’re obsessed with it,” she says.How NAD+ works its magic NAD+ supports mitochondrial function - the powerhouse of our cells - helping convert food into energy. It also activates sirtuins, proteins associated with longevity and repair. By replenishing NAD+ levels, individuals may experience improved metabolism, better focus, and resistance to age-related diseases. Dr Hooda points out that while IV treatments are popular among celebrities, oral supplements, NAD+ precursors like NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), and even topical applications are entering the mainstream.Impact on the Indian market India’s wellness industry, already booming with trends like IV therapy bars and biohacking clinics, is rapidly adopting NAD+ treatments. Luxury wellness centers in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru are offering NAD+ IV drips, priced between Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000 per session. “The Indian market is seeing a surge in demand for high-end, evidence-based treatments,” says Dr Hooda. “NAD+ fits perfectly into this space, appealing to health-conscious millennials and the ultra-wealthy alike.” Affordable NAD+ supplements, manufactured by Indian pharmaceutical companies, are also making their way into drugstores and e-commerce platforms. Experts believe this accessibility could make NAD+ the next big thing in India’s burgeoning nutraceutical market.The science vs the hype While NAD+ shows immense promise, skeptics caution against over-reliance on it as a miracle cure. Dr Hooda advises, “It’s important to pair NAD+ therapies with a balanced diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. The molecule is a tool, not a standalone solution.”The verdict As awareness of NAD+ grows, India stands poised to become a major player in this global trend. With celebrities endorsing it and experts advocating its benefits, the “magic molecule” might just be the future of wellness. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast or simply looking to age gracefully, NAD+ offers a compelling promise: a chance to biohack your way to better health.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

Microdosing Ozempic has gained momentum online, with people hoping to use the weight-loss benefits while dodging the side effects. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-microdosing-on-ozempic-help-you-lose-weight-without-any-side-effects-2651165-2024-12-18,"The weight-loss market is evolving more than ever. Crash diets, wellness programmes, injectables, supplements, and more are expected to create a massive global market worth USD 405 billion by 2030. India’s market is also anticipated to reach USD 52.3 billion by 2032. Among all these products and treatments, one that has garnered significant attention, especially after notable personalities like Elon Musk spoke about it, is Ozempic. However, it’s important to note that Ozempic was never originally intended as a weight-loss drug.What is Ozempic? Unless you've been living under a rock, you must have heard of Ozempic, which is actually a brand name for a semaglutide, an injectable medication used primarily to manage Type 2 diabetes. 

 



Microdosing Ozempic is gaining attention online. Photo: Getty Images

It belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which work by mimicking the action of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
This hormone helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes insulin production, and reduces the production of glucose in the liver. One of its notable effects is slowing down stomach emptying, which increases the feeling of fullness.
Although Ozempic was initially developed to manage diabetes, it has gained attention for its potential to aid in weight loss.
Some studies suggest that it can help users shed 5-10 per cent of their body weight when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. This weight loss effect has led to a growing interest in its off-label use for obesity management.
What are the side effects? While Ozempic is effective for managing blood sugar and promoting weight loss, it is not free from side effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Some people may also experience fatigue, dizziness, or mild headaches. These side effects are more common when starting the medication and tend to subside as the body adjusts.

 



Ozempic comes with various side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Photo: Unsplash
 In rare cases, serious side effects such as pancreatitis, gallbladder issues, or allergic reactions may occur. Dr Archana Batra, a dietician and certified diabetes educator, tells India Today, “Some people have experienced side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and fatigue, which create various problems in their daily lives.”  However, if there’s one side effect that almost all people who take Ozempic is losing muscle mass, while losing weight. This has also given rise to terms like “Ozempic face” and “Ozempic body”, which often occur when people lose muscle mass drastically due to taking Ozempic.  To avoid these side effects, and to avoid “Ozempic face and body” and still lose weight, some experts came up with the mircodosing of the drug, and it is now gaining more attention as a better way to take Ozempic. Can microdosing Ozempic actually help?  One of the first people to mention microdosing Ozempic was Dr Craig Koniver, a medical professional with over 1,20,000 followers on Instagram, in October 2024. Craig spoke on the Huberman Lab podcast, where he discussed how he had observed individuals taking Ozempic in much smaller amounts than the conventional doses. According to him, “these people were avoiding the side effects, essentially the loss of muscle mass”.

— Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D. (@hubermanlab) October 8, 2024 For context, microdosing involves administering smaller-than-usual doses of a drug to help the body adapt gradually. For Ozempic, this means starting with a very low dose and slowly increasing it over time.  According to Dr Aprajita Pradhan, senior consultant and unit head of endocrinology at Max Super Speciality Hospital, “Ozempic is usually started with a low weekly dose for 4 weeks, then the dose is up-titrated to reach the desired blood glucose control. This method of starting at a low dose helps in decreasing the side effects of Ozempic.” Dr Bhatra also seems to agree that using this approach, you can reduce the intensity of side effects. However, Niharikka Budhwani, a doctor of medicine and co-founder of Health Hatch, a wellness company, advises caution, stating, “Microdosing of any medication must be done under the supervision of a licenced doctor and is highly subjective, varying on a case-to-case basis. While this method appears promising, it should always be done with medical guidance.”Can other drugs be ‘microdosed’?  Microdosing is the practice of administering subtherapeutic doses of a drug (like Ozempic) to enhance tolerance, minimise side effects, or explore its effects at lower concentrations. The core principle is to allow the body to gradually adjust to the medication, thereby avoiding the ""shock"" that might come with a full dose. Experts suggest that this technique is not unique to Ozempic and is often used for other medications (including other weight-loss drugs), particularly those with strong side effects. Dr Batra says, “By using this approach, you can reduce the intensity of side effects. For example, in the beginning, users should start with low doses and extend to the titration period.” 

 



Experts agree that microdosing can possibly help in avoiding side effects. Photo: Unsplash
 This gradual increase helps users avoid sudden reactions, which can be particularly helpful for drugs with gastrointestinal side effects. Dr Pradhan adds that this could work for other weight-loss drugs too, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro are likely to be launched in India by 2025-26, and can also benefit from microdosing.  He further says, “Most of the recently approved injectable weight loss medications are initially started with a lower dose to improve patient tolerability and reduce side effects.” Experts believe that apart from weight-loss drugs, microdosing can also be applied to other medications as well. For instance, antidepressants are often microdosed to avoid sudden side effects like insomnia or restlessness.  But not all drugs are suitable for microdosing. The feasibility depends on the drug’s mechanism of action, its half-life, and the body’s ability to adapt to it over time.advertisementRememberOzempic’s potential for weight loss has brought it into the spotlight, but its side effects have raised concerns for many users.

db2bfbe8-64b7-468d-9da2-8553dc09fd2a,"You've been misunderstanding Trauma Bonding all along. It's a toxic trapMany may assume trauma bonding is a positive bond shared over a past trauma, but you will be surprised that it is absolutely not what you think.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/youve-been-misunderstanding-trauma-bonding-all-along-its-a-toxic-trap-2651160-2024-12-17,"When we say ""trauma bonding""—what comes to mind? Many might assume it’s a connection formed through shared trauma, but it’s more complex—and far more toxic—than it seems at first instance. Trauma bonding isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a psychological phenomenon that traps individuals in harmful relationships through cycles of abuse and affection.What is trauma bonding? According to Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, trauma bonding occurs when an abuser creates a cycle of manipulation by alternating between abusive behaviour and affectionate gestures. This unpredictable pattern makes the victim emotionally dependent, confusing love with control and harm. “The abuser alternates between harmful behaviour (abuse, manipulation) and positive behaviour (affection, apologies), creating confusion and dependency in the victim. This cycle makes the relationship feel unpredictable yet difficult to leave, as moments of ‘kindness’ can create a 'euphoric recall' of all the good memories,” says Ruuh.

 Relationship expert Shahzeen Shivdasani adds that trauma bonding is not about shared past traumas but staying in a toxic relationship where emotional abuse is followed by periods of kindness. This pattern fosters dependency, keeping victims emotionally hooked. Ekta Khurana, another Delhi-based psychologist and therapist mentions that sometimes victims are absolutely aware that the person showcasing the behaviour is toxic but yet, they cannot break free from the relationship.How does it affect mental health? The psychological toll of trauma bonding is severe. Ruuh explains that the constant highs and lows can lead to anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Victims often internalise blame, suffer from low self-esteem, and mistakenly believe they are responsible for the abuse.

 She also mentions that one of the downsides of forming such a bond is that the abuser’s approval becomes the source of the victim’s worth and safety, creating unhealthy reliance. This creates a unique kind of dependency on the abusers and victims stay too long trying to make sense of this relationship.How does trauma bonding develop? Shivdasani attributes the development of trauma bonding to intermittent reinforcement, where periods of affection follow abusive episodes. Victims try to rationalise their partner’s erratic behaviour, hoping for lasting change, which rarely comes. Additionally, people with insecure attachment styles or unresolved childhood trauma are more prone to falling into such toxic cycles, says Ruuh. “Over time, the tension-abuse-reconciliation cycle becomes normalised, making it harder to recognise the toxicity. Abusers often isolate their victim from their support systems like family and friends, making the abusive relationship the only emotional outlet for the victims,” mentions Ruuh.Breaking free and healing Ekta Khurana outlines the essential steps to break free:
Awareness: Recognise that the relationship is toxic and built on manipulation.
Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, join support groups, or seek therapy.
Document patterns: Keep a journal of abusive incidents to combat gaslighting.
Set boundaries: Establish physical and emotional distance from the abuser.
Rebuild self-worth: Invest in self-care, hobbies, and healthy social connections.
Therapeutic help: Consider therapies like CBT or EMDR for deep-rooted trauma.
Red flags to watch for Shahzeen Shivdasani highlights warning signs of trauma bonding:
The relationship alternates between intense affection and mistreatment.
The abuser justifies harmful behaviour as ‘for your own good’.
You feel isolated from friends and family.
Ending the relationship triggers anxiety or guilt.
Misconceptions about trauma bonding Contrary to popular belief, trauma bonding isn’t mutual or limited to romantic relationships. It can occur in friendships, workplaces, and family dynamics where power imbalances exist. So, watch out!Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 17, 2024

There are several struggles that often go unnoticed despite the ever-growing Indian pet market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/pet-dog-owners-struggles-india-2650652-2024-12-17,"When 20-year-old art student Gargy Sharma from Delhi finally convinced her parents to go on a long-awaited family outing, she was thrilled. More than for herself, she was excited for Cheddar, her 2-year-old poodle, as it was his birthday month. The destination was pre-decided: a high-end, pet-friendly hangout street in Gurugram. However, her excitement quickly turned to disappointment when she discovered that Cheddar wasn’t allowed inside most restaurants there. Pets were restricted to the outdoor street area only. When you bring a pet into your home, it becomes a beloved family member. Your travel plans, daily routines, and overall lifestyle naturally adjust to accommodate their needs and presence. You willingly make compromises in various aspects of your life to prioritise the well-being of your furry companion. Indian pet parents, especially dog owners, however, feel that India is yet to become more accommodating for pets. There are several struggles that often go unnoticed despite the ever-growing Indian pet market. According to the Ken Research report published in July 2024, the Indian pet market was valued at USD 9.85 billion in 2023. This growth is driven by increasing pet ownership, rising disposable incomes, and a shift in consumer attitudes that view pets as family members. Additionally, the rise of DINK (Double Income, No Kids) couples, who often choose pets over having children, has also contributed to this trend. Consequently, there has been a proliferation of pet care products and services, including premium pet food, grooming, and veterinary care.

Dogs dominate the pet market in India. The overall population of pet dogs in India was over 33 million in 2023, and it is is likely to reach more than 51 million by 2028.Yet, pet dog owners in India often witness challenges at basic levels, such as travelling with their pets or gaining acceptance in housing societies.Healthcare hassles Dogs dominate the pet market in India. The overall population of pet dogs in India was over 33 million in 2023, and it is is likely to reach more than 51 million by 2028. Yet, pet dog owners in India often witness challenges at basic levels, such as travelling with their pets or gaining acceptance in housing societies.Healthcare hassles “Although the pet clinic culture is thriving in India, access to proper pet hospitals remains a significant challenge. There is a dire shortage,” says Koustav Das, a Noida resident and owner of a Labrador. “A friend took his dog to a regular veterinarian, where the pet was misdiagnosed. The dog is still suffering because of it,” he shares. Rashi Narang, founder of the leading pet care brand Heads Up For Tails and owner of two pet dogs, agrees and adds, “Reliable veterinary services and specialised care can still be hard to find in certain parts of India. Many pet parents struggle to access timely medical advice, emergency care, or advanced treatments, especially in smaller towns.”Travel woes Travelling with pets is another significant issue. Whether you wish to take a cab, train, or flight – you are likely to encounter several challenges if you are travelling with your pet. Limited carriers allow pet travel, and in India, Air India is one of them. While smaller pets, such as dogs weighing under 10 kg, are permitted to travel in the cabin, larger dogs must travel in the cargo hold. Rashi recalls having an exceptionally difficult experience while travelling with her pets on a flight. “The process involved a significant amount of paperwork, and I had to drop my dog off at the cargo terminal many hours before the flight. She had to stay in a crate for several hours, which was incredibly stressful for both of us. While there are options for very small dogs to travel in the cabin on select airlines, we need to do much more to accommodate dogs of all sizes. Larger dogs are often restricted to travelling in cargo, where they face altitude changes, loud noises, and unfamiliar surroundings. It’s a scary and isolating experience for them, and as pet parents, it’s heartbreaking to think of our pets enduring such stress,” she tells India Today.

 Many pet parents enrol their dogs in air travel training programmes to help them remain calm and unaffected during long-haul journeys in a cargo hold. Rashi, meanwhile, suggests introducing innovative solutions such as pet-friendly cabin options, specialised compartments for pets, and enhanced safety and comfort measures in cargo. “Travelling with a pet should be a positive experience, not a daunting one, and I hope we can work towards a future where all pets, regardless of size, can travel safely and comfortably with their families,” she tells India Today. Among cab providers, Ola does not yet offer a pet-friendly option. Uber, on the other hand, has launched a pet travel service, but it is currently available only in Bengaluru. In terms of train travel, the pet parent is supposed to book a two-seater coupe or a four-berth cabin to travel with their fur buddies. So, availability becomes a huge factor. In case you have to travel urgently, it is really difficult to take your pet along. Alternatively, some trains provide dog boxes where pets travel like 'luggage.' They are placed in a designated dog box located in second-class compartments. If you have a kitten or a puppy that can be carried in a basket, they can be carried by owners in any class after payment of the usual booking charges.advertisementPet boarding – Difficult to find good optionsIf travelling is an issue, leaving behind your pet at a boarding centre is no less challenging.“I discovered a pet boarding centre in Chhatarpur through Just Dial when I had to travel with my family to Dubai for a week. However, during a basic inspection visit, we were shocked by the conditions. It was a simple residential setup with barely any outdoor space for the dogs. Beer bottles were scattered around, suggesting a party had taken place the night before. Naturally, we decided not to leave our Golden Retriever there. The most alarming part was that such boarding centres operate without skilled staff,” Divya Arora, a 32-year-old professional in Delhi, tells India Today.Bengaluru-based Shobhit Mohanty, who founded the pet parent community and educational platform ThePack.in after encountering several hurdles and challenges in his pet parenting journey, shares similar thoughts.“India’s pet-friendliness is improving but lags significantly behind countries like the US, Germany, and the UK. Challenges such as limited access to quality veterinary care, behaviour trainers, pet-friendly parks, trustworthy boarding centres, and pet-friendly travel options remain significant,” he says.advertisementShobhit also highlights the need for stronger pet laws and, more importantly, better enforcement in India.“While laws against illegal breeding and animal cruelty exist, their implementation is weak, leading to widespread illegal breeding and frequent animal cruelty cases,” he says.Housing issuesKoustav adds how Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and housing society managements often impose unreasonable rules on pet owners, such as requiring dogs to be muzzled even when walking in parks.Finding pet-friendly housing remains a significant struggle. Many landlords are hesitant about pets, leaving families in tough situations. This is a deeply emotional issue for pet parents.

“There’s still a lack of understanding about pet behaviour in some communities. Pet parents often find themselves defending their decision to bring pets home or navigating situations where pets are misunderstood or even feared,” she adds.Pet attacks cannot be ignored either, with instances of pet dogs biting people in shared public spaces like elevators. The solution? Pet parent education.Need of the hour: Pet parent educationIn the last few years, India has certainly taken measures to become more pet-friendly. Dedicated festivals and events like Pet Fed and Kukur Tihar (an initiative by the Bengaluru municipal department), along with an increasing number of pet-friendly cafes and holiday properties, have gained prominence. Pet parks are also being set up by governments.The lack of pet parent training is also a reason why pet abandonment is a complex issue in India.“People need to understand that having a pet is a full-time responsibility. It’s their duty to train the pet properly, understand its personality, consult relevant professionals, and take ownership of its behaviour in public. From registering the pet to ensuring it receives annual booster shots, many are unaware of these essential responsibilities,” shares Koustav.He believes that as pet parents become more responsible and better informed, society’s perception of pet dogs will gradually change. “It requires a collective effort from both the government and pet parents,” he adds.“New pet parents need education on basics like toilet training, puppy biting, diet, and health.

 If travelling is an issue, leaving behind your pet at a boarding centre is no less challenging. “I discovered a pet boarding centre in Chhatarpur through Just Dial when I had to travel with my family to Dubai for a week. However, during a basic inspection visit, we were shocked by the conditions. It was a simple residential setup with barely any outdoor space for the dogs. Beer bottles were scattered around, suggesting a party had taken place the night before. Naturally, we decided not to leave our Golden Retriever there. The most alarming part was that such boarding centres operate without skilled staff,” Divya Arora, a 32-year-old professional in Delhi, tells India Today. Bengaluru-based Shobhit Mohanty, who founded the pet parent community and educational platform ThePack.in after encountering several hurdles and challenges in his pet parenting journey, shares similar thoughts. “India’s pet-friendliness is improving but lags significantly behind countries like the US, Germany, and the UK. Challenges such as limited access to quality veterinary care, behaviour trainers, pet-friendly parks, trustworthy boarding centres, and pet-friendly travel options remain significant,” he says. Shobhit also highlights the need for stronger pet laws and, more importantly, better enforcement in India. “While laws against illegal breeding and animal cruelty exist, their implementation is weak, leading to widespread illegal breeding and frequent animal cruelty cases,” he says.Housing issues Koustav adds how Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and housing society managements often impose unreasonable rules on pet owners, such as requiring dogs to be muzzled even when walking in parks. Finding pet-friendly housing remains a significant struggle. Many landlords are hesitant about pets, leaving families in tough situations. This is a deeply emotional issue for pet parents.

 “There’s still a lack of understanding about pet behaviour in some communities. Pet parents often find themselves defending their decision to bring pets home or navigating situations where pets are misunderstood or even feared,” she adds. Pet attacks cannot be ignored either, with instances of pet dogs biting people in shared public spaces like elevators. The solution? Pet parent education.Need of the hour: Pet parent education In the last few years, India has certainly taken measures to become more pet-friendly. Dedicated festivals and events like Pet Fed and Kukur Tihar (an initiative by the Bengaluru municipal department), along with an increasing number of pet-friendly cafes and holiday properties, have gained prominence. Pet parks are also being set up by governments. The lack of pet parent training is also a reason why pet abandonment is a complex issue in India. “People need to understand that having a pet is a full-time responsibility. It’s their duty to train the pet properly, understand its personality, consult relevant professionals, and take ownership of its behaviour in public. From registering the pet to ensuring it receives annual booster shots, many are unaware of these essential responsibilities,” shares Koustav. He believes that as pet parents become more responsible and better informed, society’s perception of pet dogs will gradually change. “It requires a collective effort from both the government and pet parents,” he adds. “New pet parents need education on basics like toilet training, puppy biting, diet, and health. Raising awareness should be a top priority to prevent challenges from arising early. While mandatory training sounds appealing, it’s not feasible due to the shortage of qualified trainers and the lack of dog training programmes in India. Without sufficient trainers, enforcing mandatory training would be impractical,” Shobhit, a vocal voice in the pet parenting community, highlights.

Over time, many of us have begun relying on social media for information, particularly on health-related topics and advice on what we should or shouldn't consume. Recently, one fruit that has been gaining traction across platforms like Instagram and Facebook for its purported anti-cancer properties is soursop (Graviola), a prickly, dark green fruit that commonly grows in tropical and subtropical regions around the world.Soursop for cancer? Soursop, a close cousin of the famous custard apple, is gaining buzz on social media for its anti-cancerous properties. This has led to a surge in products in the market, from supplements to juices to protein powders, with soursop as the main ingredient.

 Since the fruit is primarily grown in tropical areas, its reputation as a cancer-killing agent started gaining hype in the West. Now, it seems that this misinformation has reached India as well, with several influencer doctors promoting the fruit as being as effective as chemotherapy.Here’s what experts have to say India Today spoke to various experts and all of them agreed that even though the fruit is high in antioxidants, there’s no study that shows it can heal cancer.  Chintamani, chairman and head of the department of surgical oncology at Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, emphasises that there is ""no clear evidence to suggest that it is effective and safe for treatment of cancer in humans"".   He highlights that while soursop has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, these benefits have not been objectively assessed in human clinical trials.

 According to him, ""This product has a doubtful role as an anticancer agent and its safety is not established in humans."" Dr Suman S Karanth, senior consultant in medical oncology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, points out that while laboratory studies on animal tissue and cancer cells have demonstrated some anti-cancer activity in prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancer cells, ""these studies are not in humans"".   She warns that without clinical trials, there is no concrete evidence to support soursop’s efficacy in treating cancer in humans. Dr Karanth also raises concerns about the toxic effects of soursop’s acetogenin compounds, which can cause neurotoxicity and immune suppression.

 



Excessive consumption of soursop may cause nausea. Photo: Pexels
 Dr Pooja Babbar, a consultant in medical oncology at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, further explains that even though soursop contains acetogenins, which may have cytotoxic effects (toxic effects on cell function) on cancer cells by inhibiting specific compounds found in cancer cell membranes.  The consensus among experts is clear: While soursop’s potential as a cancer-fighting agent is supported by preclinical studies (on animals), there is no substantial human evidence to validate its use as a cancer treatment. But does it mean that the fruit has no benefits? Well, no. Does it have any benefits? Soursop offers several potential health benefits due to its rich nutritional content. The fruit is a source of essential vitamins (like Vitamin C, B1, and B2), minerals (like potassium, magnesium, and calcium), antioxidants, and dietary fibre. According to Dr Shilpa M R, a consultant and dietitian at Kshemavana Yoga and Naturopathy Centre, Bengaluru, the fruit: 
Boosts immunity: Soursop can ""boost immunity"" through its high Vitamin C content, which promotes the generation of white blood cells.
Rich in antioxidants: Soursop’s ""antioxidant property prevents cancer"" by combating oxidative stress in the body.
Promotes digestive health: Soursop's high fibre content helps maintain gut health and prevent constipation.
Regulates blood pressure: Dr Shilpa M R notes that its potassium content helps control blood pressure by balancing sodium levels and relaxing blood vessels.

Reduces inflammation: Soursop has anti-inflammatory properties, which may offer relief for joint pain and other inflammatory conditions.
Promotes skin and hair health: The antioxidants and Vitamin C in soursop support collagen production and fight signs of ageing.
May help stabilise blood sugar levels: Dr Babbar notes that soursop may help stabilise blood sugar levels, which could benefit those managing diabetes.
 Experts recommend consuming soursop in its natural form as a fruit, as it is considered safe for most people. However, they urge caution when using soursop supplements and other products as they are yet to be approved officially by the Food and Drug Administration. Potential side effects Despite its numerous health benefits, soursop also carries potential side effects. Experts caution that excessive consumption or unsupervised use of soursop could lead to adverse effects, particularly for those with pre-existing health conditions.
Neurotoxicity: Prof Chintamani warns that soursop ""is not very safe for those on treatment for neurological disorders like Parkinson disease"", as it may worsen symptoms and interfere with neurological treatments.
Toxic effects: Dr Karanth highlights that soursop’s fatty acid derivatives, called acetogenins, are ""toxic"" and linked to neurotoxicity, which can cause hair loss and immune system suppression.
Interference with cardiovascular treatments: Soursop could interfere with cardiovascular treatments and metabolic activities, urging caution and the supervision of a medical expert or nutritionist.
Nausea and vomiting: Dr Babbar mentions that soursop consumption can cause ""nausea, vomiting"" and a drop in blood pressure.
Allergic reactions: Dr Shilpa points out that some individuals may experience allergic responses like rashes or itching after consuming soursop.

However, it is certainly possible to keep the spark alive.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/indian-married-couples-romance-alive-while-living-with-family-2648573-2024-12-15,"The thought of cooking a meal together with your spouse, sneaking in playful cuddles along the way, or sharing an evening of passionate romance while curled up on the couch watching a favourite movie, are a few things many couples dream of. These dreams, however, often remain just that for couples living in joint family setups. Couples living with families find it difficult to cherish romance-filled moments owing to a lack of privacy, constant interruptions, and some unspoken expectations. Sometimes, you don’t even have the bandwidth to think of such things because you are so engrossed in family life, children, and all its demands. Sounds like the reality of your life? But does this mean living with family is a bad idea? No! Does it also mean that you let romance take a backseat due to family obligations? Definitely not! Marriage counsellors say finding privacy and keeping romance alive is a common issue for Indian couples who live under the same roof as their families – as it limits privacy and intimacy and creates obstacles for meaningful couple time. Not just physical intimacy, but emotional intimacy can also take a backseat. “Often, couples fall into routines where romance takes a backseat. This happens because their focus shifts to caregiving, household responsibilities, and managing complex family dynamics,” Dr Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based marriage counsellor, tells India Today.

“Many clients seek counselling for these concerns. Common issues include the lack of private time, one partner prioritising time with parents over the couple’s relationship, overwhelming household responsibilities, and the pressures of living with in-laws. If children are involved, the added responsibilities can further strain the relationship,” she adds. “Many clients seek counselling for these concerns. Common issues include the lack of private time, one partner prioritising time with parents over the couple’s relationship, overwhelming household responsibilities, and the pressures of living with in-laws. If children are involved, the added responsibilities can further strain the relationship,” she adds. This dynamic can negatively impact your marriage. Such challenges can leave couples feeling overwhelmed, leading to frustration and resentment. But there is a way out, of course! All you need is an intention along with a bit of creativity.Firstly, be intentional You and your partner need to have an intention to keep the romance alive—only then can you create the mental space and find creative solutions. You have to sit together, talk it out, and express your expectations. “When living with family, keeping the romance alive requires creativity and intentional effort. Couples must ensure that intimacy doesn’t take a backseat by prioritising alone time and setting boundaries with family members,” says Shahzeen Shivdasani, a Mumbai-based relationship expert and author. Be intentional about maintaining physical intimacy.

 “It requires both partners to work intentionally and proactively as a team,” adds Dr Khanna.Set boundaries with family members Setting boundaries with family members is essential for maintaining romance after marriage. It’s never too late to make changes for the better. Your parents or in-laws might not have prioritised such moments with their respective partners due to household responsibilities, but you don’t have to take the same route. It is possible to respect family and have your own personal space as a couple while living in the same house. “Designate time after everyone goes to sleep as your private moments or create a dedicated space in the house that’s just for the two of you,” suggests Shahzeen. Communicate your need for quality time with your partner to your family, and explain it respectfully. Be consistent with your efforts, and present this as non-negotiable. To maintain balance, ensure to encourage family activities on separate occasions.Carve out ‘us’ time – staycations, walks, date nights Stealing those flirty, playful moments beyond the four walls of your bedroom or at unexpected times of the day might be your idea of keeping the romance alive, but there is so much more you can do to keep the spark burning. Dr Khanna, a marriage counsellor with over 15 years of experience, recommends scheduling regular date nights or outings. This could include having lunch or dinner together, going to a movie, enjoying a long drive, or simply spending private moments as a couple. These small gestures create meaningful experiences that strengthen the bond. “To break the monotony of being confined to the bedroom, find creative ways to add excitement while living with family. Couples could perhaps plan activities that take them out of the house, such as walks, short drives, or outdoor picnics, to enjoy private moments in a different setting. Setting up a cosy nook in the living room or balcony for intimate conversations or movie nights might create a change of scene,” suggests Delhi-based marriage counsellor Shivani Sadhoo. If space is limited at home, plan monthly staycations to enjoy quality time together.

 



Go on weekly dates or plan monthly staycations with your partner. (Photo: Pexels)
 At least dedicate one hour to just each other, where no third party is there to interrupt. “Couples often face challenges when one partner feels the other is overly involved with their family. To address this, I suggest dedicating at least an hour each day exclusively to each other, during which family matters are not discussed,” says Dr Khanna. This could be your chai time in the morning, a long walk or a badminton date in the evening, or a little time on the terrace.Little gestures matter Give your partner a peck when they least expect it, don’t shy away from holding their hands or hugging them in front of the family. Plan those little surprises. Leave love-filled notes. These little gestures matter and can keep you two connected. Even activities like solving a puzzle or playing board games help. You can also send playful texts, emojis, or memes to stay connected even while at home. “Scheduling time when other family members are out or engaged may also help. Small surprises such as a home-cooked meal, surprise gifts, or planned activities can bring novelty and joy to their relationship,” suggests Shivani Sadhoo. Intimacy is a vital part of any relationship, and living with family might mean working a bit harder to nurture it. But by being creative, working as a team, and being excited and proactive – your connection is sure to remain strong and vibrant.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 15, 2024Tune InALSO READ |  Should newlyweds live on their own for the first few years of marriage?Trending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/how-to-manage-your-childs-anger-and-stubbornness-2649430-2024-12-14,"When you have a child around, it's common to see them get upset or angry when they don't get what they want. A simple wish can quickly turn into a tantrum, with crying and howling when it's unmet. But when their desires are fulfilled, their faces light up with a big grin. Parenting isn’t easy, and parents often find themselves criticised no matter what they do. If they give in to their child’s demands, they're accused of spoiling them. If they refuse, they’re labelled as heartless or uncaring. But the question here is: should parents give in to their child's stubbornness and anger, or is there a better way to navigate these moments?The loud display of anger Dr Sarthak Dave, an Ahmedabad-based psychiatrist, tells India Today that kids become stubborn and express their anger loudly because they absorb behaviours from their surroundings and consider them normal. If they frequently observe their parents displaying anger or reacting loudly, they learn to replicate this behaviour, believing it to be acceptable. He explains, ""At a young age, their id—the instinctual drive to fulfil their desires—is very strong, while their ego (logical reasoning) and superego (moral understanding) are still underdeveloped and grow with age and experience. When children want something, they struggle to think logically or anticipate the consequences of their actions. If they don’t get what they want, they feel distress and express it in ways they’ve learnt from their environment.""

Additionally, if they’ve previously received what they wanted by acting out, this behaviour gets reinforced, encouraging them to repeat it. Additionally, if they’ve previously received what they wanted by acting out, this behaviour gets reinforced, encouraging them to repeat it. Further, Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, tells us that kids can be stubborn or loud because they don’t yet have the words or skills to express their emotions or because they feel ignored or misunderstood by adults. She mentions that these outbursts are their way of coping with emotions they can’t fully control or explain. According to Patel, while kids do learn from their environment and often replicate their parents, stubbornness is also a natural part of development as children learn to assert themselves. It doesn’t always mean parents are at fault.What does this stubbornness say about your kid? A child’s stubbornness, anger, and loud reactions are often ways of acting out due to their limited ability to handle emotions and distress. ""These behaviours indicate that the child may not yet be developing the emotional tools needed to cope effectively. If such reactions are not addressed or discouraged, they can become ingrained as primitive defence mechanisms, suggesting that the child’s emotional growth is not progressing as it should,"" says Dr Dave. Meanwhile, Patel feels that stubbornness and anger are signs that a child:
Is seeking attention, understanding, or control.
May be feeling overwhelmed, insecure, or unsure how to handle a situation.
Is in a stage of development where they’re learning to test limits and establish independence.
Impact on mental health According to the experts, if left unchecked, constant anger and stubbornness can lead to issues such as difficulty managing emotions later in life, strained relationships with peers and family, and increased feelings of frustration or anxiety.

 



Anger and stubbornness can have long-term effects on a child's emotional development (Photo: Getty Images)
What should you do as a parent? Dr Sajeela Maini, senior consultant, department of psychiatry and behavioural sciences, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, states that parents should not give in to their child’s stubbornness and anger, as this will only make the child more stubborn, and their anger levels will increase multifold. Parents should make sure they are not rewarding such behaviour. By rewarding them, you are feeding stubbornness and anger, and this will only increase the tantrums. While Riddhi Doshi Patel agrees, she mentions that this doesn’t mean parents should ignore their child’s feelings. Instead, they should acknowledge their child’s emotions, set clear and consistent boundaries, and stay calm while avoiding engaging in a power struggle. To this, Dr Sarthak Dave adds that parents should prioritise guiding their children toward healthier ways of expressing their needs and help them move from immature defence mechanisms to more mature ones. Teaching effective and constructive communication methods is vital for their emotional development. To manage a difficult situation, you must...
Stay calm: Children often mirror your emotions. Responding with calmness can help de-escalate the situation.
Acknowledge their feelings: Show empathy by saying, ""I see you’re upset. Do you want to talk about it?""
Set clear boundaries: Be consistent with rules and consequences. Children feel safer when they know what to expect.
Offer choices: Giving children small choices helps them feel in control, reducing the need for stubborn behaviour. 
Teach problem-solving skills: Encourage them to use words to express their feelings or brainstorm solutions together.
Model healthy behaviour: Show them how to handle frustration calmly. For example, say, ""I feel frustrated too sometimes, and I take deep breaths to help.""

It’s spicy. It’s warm. It’s comfort in a bowl. For many Indians, Ema Datshi has become the ultimate go-to comfort food. You can enjoy it with rice or stick to tradition by pairing it with tingmo - a soft, steamed bread from Tibetan cuisine. For Sherya, a 26-year-old working professional from Delhi NCR, it’s the dish she “makes in no time” and whenever she’s craving something spicy yet indulgently cheesy.  “I cook it when I don’t have the time to make anything, and when I am feeling lazy. It’s my comfort food now,” she says.  And Shreya is far from alone. Google India’s year-end report, Year in Search 2024: What Sparked Curiosity Across India on Google, revealed that Ema Datshi was one of the top 10 most-searched recipes in the country. Interestingly, while it has captured Indian hearts (and taste buds), Ema Datshi is actually a culinary treasure from Bhutan and is often known as the country's national dish.   But how did this humble Bhutanese classic become one of India’s most searched recipes this year? The answer lies in the magic of social media,  and, of course, Deepika Padukone.  Let’s whip this up from scratch, and tell you a little about this dish first. Bhutan and their love for “Ema” The picturesque Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan boasts a cuisine that varies from region to region. Yet, if there’s one thing that unites the nation’s palate, it’s their deep-rooted love for chillies. Ema Datshi is a hearty, soul-warming stew where chillies take centre stage, paired with a unique local cheese that melts into a luscious, creamy sauce.  The name itself captures its essence - “Ema” means chilli and “Datshi” means cheese in Dzongkha, the national language of Bhutan. But for the Bhutanese, it’s more than just food; it’s a reflection of culture and tradition served on a plate. No meal in Bhutan is complete without Ema Datshi, and it shows the nation’s enduring love affair with chillies. For generations, it has been a household staple, enjoyed with red rice or tingmo.

 Ema Datshi evolved to meet the specific requirements of Bhutan and its people – the dish is extremely high in fats, and the addition of chillies was meant to help improve circulation and offer warmth in the colder winter months. 
You can also try making different kinds of Datshi. Apart from the OG Ema Datshi, there is Kewa Datshi, which offers a milder twist with thinly sliced potatoes simmered in the same rich, cheesy broth, resulting in a hearty, comforting dish. 
Shamu Datshi, on the other hand, uses mushrooms, and combines them with the signature cheese sauce to create a dish that’s savoury and umami-rich. 
Beyond these classics, there are other creative versions like Goong Datshi (made with spinach) and mixed Datshi, which blends multiple vegetables like cabbage, radish, or green beans into the stew. 
How did it gain fame? In India, however, out of all the types, it is the chillies that have gained more attention for various reasons. Let us discuss each one of them. The Viral Deepika’s video  About a year ago, Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone mentioned a Bhutanese dish in an interview with Curly Tales, noting its similarity to Indian pickles - but with cheese instead of spices. “I forget the name of it, but they have this dish almost a national dish, if I’m not mistaken, which is basically chillies and cheese mashed together. And it’s an achaar equivalent, and they eat it with rice,” Deepika shared in the viral interview.

 Although she couldn’t recall the name at that time, it didn’t take long for the internet to figure it out, the dish she was referring to was none other than Ema Datshi. The clip from the interview quickly went viral, sparking a wave of curiosity.  Food vloggers and social media foodies also jumped on the trend, reimagining the dish in their own creative ways. As the dish is made out of simple ingredients, Ema Datshi became a must-try for home cooks (as it also became viral on YouTube) and food enthusiasts alike, ultimately earning its place as one of India’s most-searched recipes.

 Several eateries have benefited from this growing interest in Ema Datshi. Lha Kitchen, is a Delhi-based restaurant known for its authentic Himalayan cuisine. Amongst its most popular offerings is, unsurprisingly, Ema Datshi. Akshay, the restaurant’s manager of over three years, believes Deepika’s video played a key role in driving interest. Speaking to India Today, he shared, “It was a video by Deepika that also somehow sparked interest, even though there was some interest already for the dish to begin with.” Today, Lha Kitchen serves an average of at least 10 plates of Ema Datshi daily, a significant increase since Deepika's mention put the dish on India’s culinary map.‘Modern Indians have an adventurous palate’ Indians are travelling more than ever. This has also impacted their need and desire to explore various cuisines as authentically as possible. Shivani Sharma, a chefpreneur and founder of Gourmestan, says that the modern Indian is well-travelled, has an adventurous palate, and a desire to explore hitherto underexplored cuisines and dishes.

 “This is further amplified by social media, which have made the world smaller and, at the same time, more intriguing than ever before,” she says. With Bhutan opening its doors to tourists only relatively recently (in the mid-70s), there is a lot of curiosity about the culture and people of one of the happiest countries on earth, Shivani says.Increase curiosity amongst Indians about cuisines  Chef Ishijyot Surri, the executive chef and founder of Mulk, Miniyaturk & SJI Gourmet tells India Today that there is a surge in the popularity of Tibetan and Bhutanese food cultures, especially among urban food lovers.  “These cuisines stand out for their soulful and wholesome nature. I also believe the demand for niche food items such as Ema Datshi has increased in accordance with the rising demand for more commonly known Tibetan dishes such as thukpa and momos,” he says.  He also says this likeness to Indian comfort foods such as dal or curry makes it more approachable for Indians.  Shivani also credits this increased demand for such cuisines to a section of Indians who are becoming more exploratory diners. “There is a deeper understanding of and appreciation for how local cuisines are inextricably tied in to the narratives of the place and its people. Dishes such as Ema Datshi are made with local produce and can be found in nearly every home in Bhutan, the simplicity of such foods and their pastoral roots definitely make them immediate favourites,” Shivani says. Make Ema Datshi, the expert way  We asked experts to share their take on how to make Ema Datshi, so if haven’t tried the dish yet, here’s how you can make it, according to Ishijyot.  “Ema Datshi is all about balance—balancing the heat of the chilies with the creaminess of the cheese,” he says. 
Use fresh green and red chilies for authentic flavour and heat.
Traditionally, yak cheese is used; but a mix of feta and mozzarella works well as a substitute in India.
Simmer the chilies with garlic, onions, and tomatoes in a little water to build a robust base.

Shivani gives us a healthier way to make the Datshi.“Our take on Ema Datshi replaces the full-fat cheese with heart-healthier vegan alternatives, and also adds mushrooms to amplify the innate umami flavour of the yak cheese (Datshi),” she says. Check out the healthier recipe: 
Melt the butter in a thick-bottomed pan and sauté the onion and peppers.
Add the chillies and garlic and sauté until fragrant.
Add the mushrooms and tomato. Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins over medium heat.

   Shivani also credits this increased demand for such cuisines to a section of Indians who are becoming more exploratory diners.  “There is a deeper understanding of and appreciation for how local cuisines are inextricably tied in to the narratives of the place and its people. Dishes such as Ema Datshi are made with local produce and can be found in nearly every home in Bhutan, the simplicity of such foods and their pastoral roots definitely make them immediate favourites,” Shivani says. Make Ema Datshi, the expert way   We asked experts to share their take on how to make Ema Datshi, so if haven’t tried the dish yet, here’s how you can make it, according to Ishijyot.   “Ema Datshi is all about balance—balancing the heat of the chilies with the creaminess of the cheese,” he says. 
Use fresh green and red chilies for authentic flavour and heat.
Traditionally, yak cheese is used; but a mix of feta and mozzarella works well as a substitute in India.
Simmer the chilies with garlic, onions, and tomatoes in a little water to build a robust base.

This buzzword has sparked a wave of obsession, prompting beauty brands to invest heavily in the trend.
How, you ask? By launching a range of collagen-based products - from supplements and protein powders to moisturisers - capturing the attention of beauty influencers everywhere.  However, unlike other trends, which come and go, collagen stayed for all the right reasons, and looks like it is here to stay.But what is collagen?  Debjani Gupta, a nutritionist and wellness expert from Mumbai, tells India Today that collagen is a vital protein that makes up about 30 per cent of the body's total protein.

 It plays a key role in supporting the skin’s elasticity, plumpness, and firmness. In our twenties and thirties, when collagen levels are higher, the skin appears firm, toned, and radiant, especially if diet and lifestyle habits are healthy.  However, as we age into our forties and fifties, collagen production declines, leading to signs of ageing like sagging skin and reduced skin tone. Functions of collagen in the body Collagen serves several vital functions in the body, such as:
Replacing dead cells: It promotes the growth of new cells.
Protecting organs: Collagen serves as a protective layer for vital organs.
Maintaining skin elasticity: It provides the skin with structure, elasticity, suppleness, and strength.
Assisting blood clotting: Collagen plays a key role in blood clotting when injuries occur.
 All these functions (especially skin elasticity) have made collagen quite popular. However, supplements, powders made out of collagen actually is pretty expensive (avg price goes Rs 2,500 for 500 gm), which has made Indians, especially, turned to “juggad” and are opting natural recipes that allegedly help in boosting collagen production in our body. The viral natural collagen  In the quest for youthful, glowing skin, the spotlight has turned to humble kitchen staples- amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple.

 Today, Skinfluencers are calling it the ""OG collagen boosters"" on social media sites like Instagram. But are these everyday fruits and veggies really capable of turning back the clock on ageing skin? We asked the experts. Breaking down the viral ingredients Amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are often known for their antioxidant and Vitamin C content. But Dr Rinky Kapoor, a consultant dermatologist and surgeon at The Esthetic Clinics, Mumbai, says, “Ingredients like amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are called natural collagen boosters because they are rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants. These nutrients help support your body to produce more collagen for better skin health.""

 



Amla is high in antioxidants. Photo: Getty Images
 However, before you start gulping down litres of juice, here’s a reality check. ""While these ingredients are healthy, they may not work as effectively as collagen supplements,"" Dr Kapoor warns.  ""Juicing them can negatively affect their fibre and nutrient properties, so it’s best to consume them raw or cooked,"" she says.  Sujit Shanshanwal, a Mumbai-based dermatologist, highlights the role of Vitamin C in this process.  ""Vitamin C plays a vital role in collagen production, but not directly. It supports the enzyme activity required for collagen synthesis and slows down collagen degradation,"" he adds. Debjani agrees. She adds that the health of the gut is directly linked to skin health and collagen production. Food (like amla, apple and beet) are rich in fibre, antioxidants, and essential vitamins (like vitamin C) promote better gut health. A healthy gut ensures much clearer and firmer skin.  So, are these the ""OG"" collagen boosters? Not quite. But they do support collagen production indirectly by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants that keep your existing collagen healthy.But If you’re picturing a bowl of carrot-beet-apple salad turning into collagen for your skin, hold that thought. Science is a little more complex. Sujit explains, ""To create collagen, your body needs amino acids like proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline, which are primarily found in animal sources like meat, fish, and eggs. For vegetarians, plant-based sources include soy products, mushrooms, cabbage, legumes, spinach, nuts, and seeds.""

 In short, you need more than just amla and beetroot to get that coveted collagen glow. ""Amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple support collagen health by providing antioxidants and Vitamin C, but they alone are not sufficient to create collagen,"" adds Sujit. The star of the collagen world is marine collagen, which comes from fish skin, bones, and scales. ""Marine collagen is considered a rich source of collagen, typically found in the form of collagen peptides or hydrolysed collagen,"" he adds.The side effects  While amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are nutrient powerhouses, experts suggest they’re not without potential side effects if consumed in excess. 
Gastric discomfort: Debjani says, if you’re not used to raw juices or high-fibre fruits, suddenly drinking a large glass of beetroot-carrot-apple juice could leave you feeling bloated. This happens because fibre needs time to adjust in your system.

Digestive sensitivity: People with sensitive digestion may experience bloating, gas, or even diarrhoea if they consume too much of these fruits or their juices. Dr Kapoor recommends starting with small portions and slowly increasing your intake.

Nutrient loss during juicing: According to Shanshanwal, juicing strips away fibre and, if heat is involved, it can also degrade Vitamin C, a key player in collagen production. So, while juice may be trendy, whole fruits and veggies are the better option for overall nutrition.
 Pro tip: If you’re juicing these ingredients, don’t throw away the pulp. Use it to make parathas, tikkis, or even smoothies to retain the fibre.Tips to produce collagen naturally in your body So, if amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple aren’t magic collagen factories, what is? Here's what experts have to say. 
Eat a collagen-friendly diet: Your body needs amino acids like proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline to produce collagen. These amino acids are abundant in animal products like meat, fish, and eggs. Vegetarians can rely on soy products, mushrooms, legumes, spinach, nuts, and seeds.
Amp up your antioxidants: Foods like amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are rich in antioxidants, which protect your existing collagen from damage caused by free radicals (but they can’t produce collagen in your body). Think of them as a shield for your skin’s natural protein.
Get your dose of Vitamin C: No, you don’t have to chug litres of orange juice. Incorporate Vitamin C-rich foods like amla, citrus fruits, guava, and bell peppers into your daily diet. Vitamin C activates the enzymes that support collagen production.
Stay hydrated: Your skin cells are made of water, so staying hydrated keeps your skin plump and supple, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Exercise regularly: Sweat it out! Regular physical activity increases blood circulation, which promotes oxygen and nutrient delivery to the skin, boosting collagen production.
Protect your skin from UV damage: UV rays from the sun break down collagen in your skin, so wearing sunscreen is essential to maintain that youthful glow.
Consider marine collagen: If you’re open to supplements, marine collagen is a strong contender. Derived from fish, it’s often found in hydrolysed form, making it easier for your body to absorb. But, as Dr Kapoor cautions, ""Do not take collagen supplements without consulting a doctor as it may not be suitable for everyone."" Supplements should be your last resort. 
Remember  The hype around amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple as ""OG collagen boosters"" is both right and wrong. These ingredients don’t directly increase collagen production, but they support it by providing essential antioxidants, Vitamin C, and other nutrients that keep existing collagen strong. ""One should understand that no single ingredient or type of juice can help replace the need to adopt a healthy lifestyle,"" Dr Kapoor concludes.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 13, 2024

But can they truly be a game-changer in treating cracked heels and dry feet?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-viral-silicone-moisturising-socks-treat-cracked-heels-and-dry-feet-in-winter-2649006-2024-12-12,"Winter brings a host of skincare challenges, and our feet often bear the brunt of the season's harshness. Dryness and cracked heels are common issues many of us face during the colder months.
While slathering on moisturiser becomes a priority, it’s not always enough—particularly for tackling severely dry feet and cracked heels. So, what to do? The internet, meanwhile, appears to have a solution – using silicone socks. Unlike regular fabric socks, silicone socks function like a snug silicone glove for your feet. To use them, simply wash your feet thoroughly, slip on the socks, and leave them on for 15–30 minutes (or overnight). These reusable socks are easily available on platforms such as Amazon, Meesho, and Nykaa.

 



Silicone socks on sale on Amazon India.
 There is also a single-use moisturising socks variant – also widely available across online platforms. Single-use moisturising socks are infused with nourishing ingredients like shea butter and essential oils. In contrast, reusable silicone socks require you to apply your own moisturiser, balm, or serum before use. Essentially, they are designed to act as an occlusive layer, trapping moisture and enhancing the efficacy of any hydrating products. Both gel and silicone socks are expected to create a spa-like environment, promoting better hydration and healing, ultimately resulting in smoother, softer feet. Sounds great, right? But are these moisturising socks as good as they claim to be? Dermatologists want you to know a few things!Gel socks – a good addition to your winter routine According to experts, moisturising socks can be beneficial for feet during winter, but they are not a magical cure for cracked and dry feet. “Moisturising and gel socks, infused with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, or essential oils, can indeed be a valuable addition to foot care routines, especially during winter. The occlusive nature of these socks helps lock in moisture, promoting better absorption of the active ingredients. They can improve skin hydration, reduce dryness, and even help with cracked heels if used consistently,” says Dr Pratiksha Jain, associate consultant cosmetologist, SPARSH Hospital, Infantry Road, Bengaluru. “Think of them as sheet masks for your feet. These serum-soaked socks promise 20-30 minutes to baby-soft soles. But here’s the tea: they’re more like a band-aid than a cure. The star ingredient, usually butylene glycol, gives temporary hydration but doesn’t fix deep cracks,” adds Dr Geetika Srivastava, dermatologist and founder of Influennz Skin and Hair Clinic, Delhi.

 



Moisturising socks, available for purchase on Nykaa.
 We all love our sheet masks for an instant glow or as a pre-makeup ritual, right? However, the results are often quick but not long-lasting. The same applies to moisturising socks. Alternatively, you can incorporate them into an elaborate at-home pedicure session to give your feet some extra pampering.What about silicone socks? Silicone socks wherein you use your own foot cream or balm before putting these on are also dermat-approved. They can be worn for 15-20 minutes or overnight as well. “These beauties work via occlusion therapy. You slather on your favourite foot cream and wear the socks overnight. This locks in moisture and helps the cream penetrate deeper. It’s like tucking your feet into a spa cocoon while you snooze. We dermatologists love this technique for stubborn dryness,” says Dr Srivastava. For best results, use them with thick, emollient-rich foot creams containing ingredients like urea or hyaluronic acid. The prolonged contact overnight helps in repairing cracked heels and very dry skin.

 However, a few precautions should certainly be taken before using these silicone socks. “Clean and dry silicone socks properly after and before every use to prevent bacterial or fungal growth,” says Dr Jain. It is also very important to clean and dry your feet before using these socks. Wearing them for too long or without proper foot hygiene may create a moist environment, which could promote fungal infections like athlete’s foot. If you have cuts, wounds, or severe skin conditions, consult a dermatologist before using these socks.A good foot care routine Having soft and supple feet even in winter does not essentially require these gel or silicone socks. All you need is a good foot care routine. You can follow the expert-approved tips mentioned below:

Hydrate regularly: Apply a thick, emollient-rich foot cream with ingredients like urea, glycerin, or shea butter twice daily.
Exfoliate weekly: Use a gentle scrub or pumice stone to remove dead skin cells and prevent calluses.
Soak your feet: A warm foot soak with Epsom salts once a week can help soften skin and relieve dryness.
Wear socks: Opt for breathable cotton or wool socks to keep feet warm and protected.
Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from within.
Protect from cold: Avoid walking barefoot on cold floors, and moisturise immediately after bathing or washing your feet to lock in moisture.
So, are these socks a game-changer? For a quick fix, yes! But for long-term care? Stick to the classic winter foot care tips.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Should you wash your feet before going to bed? Doctors have THE answer

44925c52-5c56-496d-b596-6adf4b8baaf6,Does living together before marriage lower the chance of divorce?Thinking about marriage but unsure if you'll be able to adjust to living together? Why not try a live-in relationship first to see how things go before taking the next step?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/does-living-together-before-marriage-lower-the-chance-of-divorce-2648781-2024-12-12,"Being with someone you love is an amazing feeling, right? But where there's love, there are bound to be disagreements. And during those moments, we sometimes say things we've been holding back, like, ""Had I known this about you, I wouldn't have married you."" The truth is, being in a relationship is different from being married and sharing a life together. With the patience levels many have these days, it's no surprise divorce rates are on the rise. But if couples lived together before marriage, would it help the relationship? Could being in a live-in arrangement first be the secret to avoiding a split later? Let's find out from experts.Giving up easily Aarti Chawla, a Mumbai-based relationship psychotherapist and life coach, tells India Today that people are giving up on marriages for a variety of reasons. Fast-paced lifestyles, lack of patience, and low tolerance are key factors. Gone are the days when lovers waited a year to meet, convinced their parents, and wrote letters to woo someone. Now, it's easier to swipe left and right. If things don't work out, people are more willing to move on. Chawla adds that it's become easier to find another 'option' when things don't work out in a relationship. Financial stress is another contributor. With both partners often working and earning, financial issues can create tension. If couples can't meet the financial goals they had when they got married, it leads to disappointment and conflicts. Meanwhile, Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, feels modern society places a high value on personal growth and happiness, which can lead people to leave relationships that feel stagnant or unfulfilling. ""Divorce is no longer seen as a taboo or social stigma, making it an easier option for people,"" she adds. Many individuals have higher or unrealistic expectations of their partners, love, and relationships, often influenced by media portrayals that clash with reality. Ruuh also mentions that there’s a growing recognition that toxic or unbalanced relationships can affect mental well-being, prompting people to prioritise their mental health.Can live-in be a saviour? ""Research shows mixed results: some studies suggest that couples who live together before marriage report higher satisfaction, understanding, and stability, while others suggest it leads to 'cohabitation inertia,' meaning couples marry out of convenience rather than compatibility,"" says Ruchi Ruuh. For her, the answer is nuanced. While living together before marriage isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, it can help partners understand each other's habits, compatibility, and ability to navigate conflicts. Aarti Chawla agrees that a live-in arrangement helps couples understand each other more deeply.

 



A live-in setup helps you understand your partner better (Photo: Pexels/Cottonbro studio)
 ""It helps them see the nuances of living together—not just as roommates, but as companions for the next 40-50 years. Mental preparedness is key. For a couple to thrive, they need to consider all areas of life, including mental wavelength, physical compatibility, basic values, and financial goals. Live-in gives them time to truly understand each other at all levels,"" she says. Living together allows couples to learn each other’s routines and habits, reducing the chances of surprises down the line. In many cases, this makes divorce less likely, as the basics are in place.The pros of a live-in relationship Living together before marriage can serve as a compatibility check. It lets you observe your partner’s behaviour in real-life situations, including finances, responsibilities, stressful life events, and decision-making. Sharing space can also improve communication and conflict-resolution skills. ""You learn to see your partner as a whole person, beyond the idealised version,"" says Ruuh, adding, ""This is invaluable to understanding their true self."" Being in a live-in relationship also allows couples to break up without the fear of family or societal pressure, which can be a relief for those wanting to make the decision on their own terms.Don't skip the downsides However, a live-in relationship has its downsides. One major con is the lack of commitment. Often, after years of living together, couples part ways because there’s no formal commitment. This arrangement gives both partners the freedom to walk away without consequences. Additionally, live-in relationships can attract judgement, especially in conservative societies and cultures. Sometimes, living together can create a false sense of commitment, even when the relationship isn't solid. If the relationship ends, untangling shared living arrangements can be emotionally and financially taxing—often as painful as a divorce.

Thinking of giving it a try? If you’re considering a live-in arrangement before tying the knot, keep a few things in mind:
Clarify your goals: Discuss what the live-in arrangement means for both of you, including long-term plans like marriage. Clear goals keep things on track.
Split expenses: Agree on how to divide rent, groceries, and utilities.
Divide household tasks: Set expectations for chores and responsibilities to avoid resentment.
Check in regularly: Have regular conversations to ensure you're both satisfied with the arrangement.
Plan for the worst: Be clear about what will happen if the relationship doesn't work out, making any potential transition smoother.
Respect personal space: Living together doesn't mean you have to spend every moment together. Make sure you both have time for personal interests and friends.
Set financial expectations: List out your financial goals and expectations ahead of time.
Discuss non-negotiables: Be upfront about what’s acceptable and what isn’t in the relationship.
 If done thoughtfully, a live-in relationship can give you a better sense of whether marriage is the right step for you and your partner.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Move over grand gestures, micro-mance your way to loveTrending Reel

Here's how to deal with airplane ear If you feel a strange sensation in your ear as soon as your flight takes off, you might be dealing with airplane ear. While it can be uncomfortable, it can be relieved with some simple tricks.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/no-more-ear-ritation-heres-how-to-deal-with-airplane-ear-2648173-2024-12-11,"Does the excitement of your much-awaited trip suddenly fade the moment your flight takes off, thanks to a sharp, annoying pain in your ears? And worse, it doesn't just disappear mid-flight—it lingers even after you land. Even if you haven't experienced this yourself, chances are you know someone who can't stop complaining about the discomfort during their flight. This issue is real, and it can be more than just the constant popping of ears—airplane ear can be downright painful.So, why does it happen? ""Airplane ear, also called barotrauma, occurs when the pressure in the middle ear doesn't equalise with the air pressure outside. This may cause ear pain, uneasiness, and even lead to hearing impairment,"" Dr Girish Anand MS, consultant - ENT surgery, Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, tells India Today. The doctor explains that as an airplane takes off or lands, the air pressure in the cabin changes. He states, ""Normally, the Eustachian tube, a small canal connecting the middle ear to the back of the nasal cavity, equalises the pressure. However, sometimes, this tube can get blocked, preventing pressure equalisation."" To this, Dr Amitabh Malik, chief and HOD, department of ENT, Paras Health, Gurugram, adds that factors like sinus congestion, colds, or allergies can also affect the function of the Eustachian tube, making it more difficult for the ear to adjust to changes in pressure.It's quite common As per Dr Malik, airplane ear is a common phenomenon, particularly during flights. ""Almost everyone experiences some level of ear discomfort when flying, but some are more susceptible. People with sinus issues, colds, nasal congestion, or allergies are at higher risk because these conditions can interfere with the Eustachian tube's function,"" the doctor says. Additionally, infants and young children are more likely to struggle with airplane ear because their Eustachian tubes are smaller and may not work as effectively. Those with a history of ear infections or certain anatomical issues may also experience more severe symptoms.

 



You're not alone in dealing with airplane ear (Photo: Getty Images)
Know the symptoms Dr Manjunath MK, senior consultant - ENT surgeon, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, mentions that the most common symptom of airplane ear is a feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear. One may also experience ringing in the ears or temporary hearing loss. In more severe cases, it can lead to ear pain, and rarely, there may be a perforation of the eardrum.Save your ears
To help prevent or relieve the discomfort of airplane ear, try yawning or swallowing frequently, as this helps open the Eustachian tubes and equalise pressure.
Chewing gum or sucking on candy can encourage swallowing, which also balances pressure in the ear.
If you're dealing with sinus congestion or a cold, using a decongestant or nasal spray before your flight may reduce the risk of discomfort.
Valsalva maneuver, gently blowing your nose with your mouth closed, can also help open the Eustachian tubes.
It's best to avoid flying when you're sick, especially if you have a cold, allergies, or sinus infections, and if possible, delay your trip until you're symptom-free.
During the flight, try not to sleep during take-off or landing, as staying alert can help you manage pressure changes.
Keep chewing gum or munching sugar candies to encourage swallowing. You can also gently pop your ears by blowing your nose while pinching your nostrils closed.
When to seek professional help? According to the experts, in most cases, airplane ear resolves on its own after the flight without the need for medical treatment. However, if the symptoms persist, worsen, or cause significant discomfort, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional. If there is an infection or a ruptured eardrum, medical treatment such as antibiotics, pain relief, or ear drops may be required. In extreme cases, a doctor may recommend a procedure to help equalise the pressure in the ear.

 



Don't shy away from seeking help (Photo: Getty Images)
Now, before you check-in... You can easily avoid airplane ear by keeping a few simple tips in mind. Stay well-hydrated throughout your flight and steer clear of alcohol and caffeine. A helpful trick is sipping hot water during the journey to soothe your ears. And don’t forget to pack some chewing gum in your carry-on, it’s a handy way to help manage pressure changes.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 11, 2024ALSO READ |  Unpacking your bags after a vacation is tough.

In fact, even in India, where winter often marks the season of festivities and weddings, many of us also feel our mental well-being taking a hit. As this season approaches, our couch becomes our best friend, and leaving it - or even our bed - starts to feel like a monumental task. More often than not, all we want to do is lie around with our thoughts. Urban slang even has a name for it - seasonal depression - which hits us as sharply as the cold breeze that accompanies winter. But is “wintertime sadness”, aka ""winter depression"", actually real? Or is it just the weather messing with us? A quick scroll through Reddit or Quora reveals that plenty of people are asking the same thing — why does the mood shift as the sun sets or the seasons change?

Is mental health related to season change? Jasreen Birgi, counselling psychologist at Lissun, a digital mental health platform Delhi NCR, explains that winters in India are months of several festivities, but they are also filled with gloom and melancholy due to the chilling winds and shorter days.  She highlights that Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of sadness more prevalent in specific seasons, typically autumn and winter. It’s commonly referred to as ""winter depression,"" she says.   Dr Shilpi Saraswat, clinical psychologist at Sakra World Hospital, Bengaluru, agrees and tells India Today that, “SAD, is a recognised mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide.”  She adds that, like most depressive disorders, it ""affects mood, energy levels, sleep patterns, and appetite,"" and its symptoms include persistent feelings of sadness, low energy, and changes in sleep and eating habits.

 



A query on Quora. Photo: Quora
 Dr Arvind Otta, senior psychologist and mental health activist, further points out that it ""follows a seasonal pattern and typically worsens during autumn and winter months when daylight hours are shorter.”  He explains that ""the biological basis of SAD involves disruptions to circadian rhythms and changes in neurotransmitter levels, especially serotonin and melatonin.”Does science also agree? Experts unanimously agree that the link between weather and mood is undeniable. Birgi explains that reduced exposure to sunlight causes changes in brain chemistry, and this reduction ""triggers an increase in anxiety symptoms throughout the winter.”  According to Birgi, the decrease in sunlight affects our circadian rhythm and, in turn, impacts our sleep-wake cycles, increasing feelings of sluggishness and low energy.  “People also avoid going outside due to the cold weather, further limiting their exposure to natural light and physical activity, both of which are vital for mental health,” she says.

— NHS London (@NHSEnglandLDN) December 9, 2024 Dr Otta points to the role of sunlight in regulating serotonin levels, stating that people with SAD have increased serotonin transporter proteins during winter, leading to lower serotonin availability. He also notes the influence of atmospheric pressure changes, stating that gloomy weather characterised by overcast skies is associated with low serotonin levels, leading to feelings of depression or low mood. However, note that there aren't enough studies done on this area, so more studies are required to understand the illness better. How to deal with it? If the cold weather’s got you feeling blue, here’s what experts have to say on how to manage it. Increase exposure to natural light Mehezabin Dordi, a clinical psychologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, recommends spending time outside during daylight hours, even if it’s cloudy. She says natural light exposure can improve symptoms.   You can also keep curtains and blinds open to let in as much natural light as possible. Rearrange furniture to sit near windows.advertisementStay physically active
Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, increases serotonin levels, which help regulate mood.
If the weather permits, outdoor exercise combines physical activity with exposure to sunlight.
Maintain a healthy routine
Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Avoid oversleeping, as it can worsen symptoms.
Dr Otta suggests that healthy eating not only makes for a healthy weight but also balanced moods. “Omega-3 fatty acids, fruits and vegetables are, to some extent, good for the brain and quite very important with respect to one’s overall well-being. Prepare a menu for the winter so as not to get caught up by events,” he says. 
Be socially active 
Spend time with family and friends to avoid isolation, which can worsen depression. Experts like Dr Otta call it “talk therapy”.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT and other counselling therapies can support one in times of despair and provide strategies for coping. 
“Through this, you can learn to identify their negative thought patterns and ways to change the thinking for healthy counterparts, which seems very appropriate in cases of seasonal depression,” he says. 
Remember, sometimes, just discussing your feelings can make a big difference.
Meditate
Mindfulness practices like meditation can help you stay present and reduce feelings of hopelessness.
Try aromatherapy (avoid scented candles, though) with certain essential oils, like citrus and lavender, which may have mood-boosting effects.
However, if symptoms persist or significantly affect daily life, it’s important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can create a personalised treatment plan tailored to your needs.BottomlineWhether it’s cosy winters, wedding festivities, or grand celebrations, understanding your mental health triggers can help you stay balanced.

It is believed that urinating after sex is not merely a good hygiene practice but also keeps issues like UTI (urinary tract infection) and other infections away, especially among women.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-peeing-after-sex-really-prevent-uti-2647827-2024-12-10,"When Tanya, a 30-year-old writer from Delhi, got married, her mother shared a vital sexual wellness tip: always remember to pee after sex. “It will keep most infections away,” she told her. Sexual health is an essential part of overall well-being, and it comes with the responsibility of maintaining good hygiene to prevent infections. Among the many tips often recommended, one of the simplest (and most popular) is urinating after sexual intercourse. It is believed that doing so is not merely a good hygiene practice but also keeps issues like UTI (urinary tract infection) and other infections away – especially among women. UTIs are a common concern for sexually active women. Why? Well, Dr Vaishali Joshi, senior obstetrician and gynaecologist at Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, points out, ""Women are more prone to UTIs than men due to the proximity of their urinary and genital systems."" “After first intercourse, some women may develop a UTI. This is not uncommon and can occur due to bacteria entering the urinary tract during sexual activity. Common symptoms include burning during urination, frequent urination, or pain in the lower abdomen,” adds Dr Joshi.

But how important is this habit of peeing after intercourse, and does it truly help in preventing infections? We asked experts.Does peeing after sex matter?Dr Geeta Shroff, director of NuBella Centre for Women’s Health, emphasises that urination after intercourse is vital. But how important is this habit of peeing after intercourse, and does it truly help in preventing infections? We asked experts.Does peeing after sex matter? Dr Geeta Shroff, director of NuBella Centre for Women’s Health, emphasises that urination after intercourse is vital. “Peeing after sex can help prevent a urinary tract infection or even other infections, especially in females. During sexual intercourse, bacteria from the genital or anal areas can find their way into the urethra. Urinating after sexual intercourse ensures that these bacteria are expelled before they cause an infection,” Dr Shroff adds. Dr Kanika Jain, vice president of the Association of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Delhi (AOGD), professor and senior consultant, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, further explains, ""Sexual activity can introduce bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), into the urethra. Peeing afterward flushes these out before they ascend to the bladder, lowering the risk of infection."" It is recommended to urinate within 15–30 minutes of intercourse to flush out bacteria. “The first step is to drink plenty of water to help flush out the infection. If symptoms persist, antibiotics may be required to clear it. Prompt treatment is essential, as untreated UTIs can worsen, but they are generally not serious if addressed in time,” adds Dr Joshi.

 



Experts say peeing after sex does not ensure 100 per cent prevention but a reduced risk of getting a UTI. (Photo: Getty)
 Experts, however, add that peeing after sex does not ensure 100 per cent protection but certainly reduces the chances of getting a UTI. While not a foolproof method, it is an effective and simple precautionary measure for urinary health. Hydration also plays a key role here. “Drink enough water to enable you to urinate after sex,” says Dr Shroff. It is important to note while urinating after intercourse can help prevent a urinary infection, it plays no role in preventing STIs or vaginal infection. “Peeing specifically helps prevent UTIs but has no significant impact on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or vaginal infections,” says Dr Jain.Good hygiene tips to follow after intercourse Practising good post-sex hygiene can significantly reduce the risk of UTIs and other infections. It is important to use protection, avoid douching, and maintain overall genital and perineal hygiene. You may feel exhausted or not want to step out of bed and sleep right away, but getting up to pee, changing clothes, and gently cleansing your genitals can go a long way in keeping infections at bay. Here are some more expert-recommended tips:
advertisementGentle cleansing: Dr Shroff advises washing the genital area with warm water. Avoid harsh or scented soaps, which can disrupt the natural pH balance.
Change clothes: Avoid wearing tight clothes or non-breathable fabrics post-sex. Tight or damp clothing can encourage bacterial growth. Opt for loose-fitting, breathable cotton underwear to keep the area dry and fresh.
Wash your hands: Dr Joshi stresses the importance of clean hands before and after intercourse to prevent the transfer of germs.
Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water ensures regular urination, naturally flushing bacteria from the urinary tract.
Practise safe sex: Using condoms helps prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Monitor symptoms: If you notice signs of irritation, pain, or unusual discharge, seek a doctor. ""Ignoring symptoms can worsen infections, requiring more intensive treatment,"" warns Dr Joshi.
Wear breathable underwear: Choose cotton fabrics to prevent moisture build-up, which can encourage bacterial growth.
Clean sex toys: The sex toy culture is rising in India, with these products being just a BlinkIt away. While they are sure to make things exciting for you in the bedroom, cleaning them properly is essential to keep infections at bay. Doctors suggest washing toys with warm water and an appropriate cleanser after use to prevent bacterial transfer.
When to see a doctorRecurrent UTIs—defined as more than two to three infections within six months—may require specialist intervention.In the case of repeated UTIs, “routine tests performed are urine microscopic examination and urine culture and sensitivity. This will pick up the type of bacteria causing UTI and the effective antibiotics to clear the infection. The sonography of the kidney and bladder may be needed to look for after-effects of UTI,” shares Dr Joshi.Lastly...While peeing after sex is not a guarantee against UTIs or other infections, it is a simple and highly recommended practice to reduce risk. Combined with good hygiene habits and adequate hydration, it supports overall sexual and urinary health. As Dr Shroff puts it, ""It’s a small habit, but one that can make a big difference in your health and comfort.""Signs of suggestive infection, like burning while passing urine or frequent urination or pain in the lower part of the tummy, first thing, drink a lot of water, which helps to flush out the infection.

72ca3196-3bc0-42a6-9c8e-a9f8ad3a228e,"How long can you wear makeup without risking skin damage?Who doesn't love showing off flawless skin? While makeup can definitely help you achieve that perfect look, how long should you actually keep these products on?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/how-long-can-you-wear-makeup-without-risking-skin-damage-2647586-2024-12-10,"You might be the 'just a little blush, and I'm good to go' type, or perhaps you're all about that full-glam look—but one thing is for sure: makeup is a crucial part of our daily routine. And now, with men also embracing cosmetics to enhance their appearance, makeup has become even more universal. But here's the thing: as important as applying makeup is, removing it properly is even more crucial. We all know the cardinal rule—never go to bed with makeup on—but do you know how long you can actually wear makeup before it starts taking a toll on your skin?Bidding adieu is crucial Removing makeup well is important to allow your skin to breathe, repair, and regenerate. Dr Vidushi Jain, dermatologist and medical head at Dermalinks, NCR, tells India Today that if makeup is not removed properly, it clogs pores, disrupts the skin's natural barrier, and increases the risk of breakouts and premature ageing. To this, Dr Shifa Yadav, consultant - dermatology and cosmetology at Artemis Hospitals, Gurugram, adds that makeup residue can irritate the skin, causing redness, dryness, and other skin problems. Not only that, but long-term exposure to makeup residue can lead to skin discolouration and hyperpigmentation. It can also hinder the absorption of skincare products, as clean skin absorbs them more effectively, maximising their benefits.For how long should you wear makeup? According to Dr Jain, ideally, makeup should only be used for 8-12 hours at most. She mentions that wearing makeup for long periods can cause the products to settle into the skin and lead to issues, especially if they are non-comedogenic. On the other hand, Dr Yadav states that there's no definitive answer, as it depends on various factors like skin type, product quality, and individual sensitivity. ""However, it's generally recommended to limit makeup wear to a maximum of 10-12 hours per day,"" she adds. As per Dr Yadav, wearing makeup for too long can have the same impact on the skin as leaving residue—clogging pores, skin irritation, premature ageing, and drying out the skin. While makeup creates a protective layer on the skin, it can also disrupt its natural oil balance.

 Meanwhile, Dr Shireen Furtado, senior consultant - medical and cosmetic dermatology at Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, states that it is advisable to limit the application of makeup to a period that allows the skin to breathe and recover. It is often recommended that one should pay attention to their skin's response to prolonged makeup wear. Dr Furtado further tells us that wearing makeup can also have a positive impact. ""It can enhance the appearance of the skin by providing coverage for imperfections, evening out skin tone, and adding a healthy glow. Many formulations contain beneficial ingredients that can hydrate and protect the skin, contributing to a more polished look,"" she says. However, prolonged wear of products that contain harmful chemicals can compromise skin health.Reversing skin troubles To reverse the skin issues caused by wearing makeup for too long, you must detox your skin with a skincare routine that includes double cleansing, exfoliation, hydration, and nourishing serums that contain antioxidants, niacinamide, or hyaluronic acid for healing and rebalancing the skin. Focusing on makeup removal is very important. Make sure to follow a thorough cleansing routine so that no residue is left behind. Apart from this, you also need to focus on what you put in your body, as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and water can help improve skin health. However, if you have severe skin issues, consult a dermatologist for professional advice.

 



Make sure to thoroughly clean your skin after wearing makeup for an extended period (Photo: Getty Images)
Before long hours of makeup wear... Those who apply makeup for extended periods should make certain changes to their skincare regimen to maintain skin health and prevent potential damage. Remember to always use products that are non-comedogenic and do not strip the skin of its natural oils. Additionally, the inclusion of a broad-spectrum sunscreen is crucial, as it protects the skin from harmful UV rays, especially when makeup is worn throughout the day. The way you prep your skin before putting on makeup makes a big difference. Taking a break is vital. Try to minimise makeup wear, especially on days when you're not going out. Lastly, don't forget to include exfoliation and masking once a week.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 10, 2024ALSO READ |  Essential oils are Shraddha Kapoor's beauty secret.

US tech millionaire Bryan Johnson thinks so.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-you-live-forever-like-bryan-johnson-wants-to-2647404-2024-12-10,"Who doesn’t want to live forever? The idea of living a long, healthy life appeals to almost everyone. The quest for immortality has fascinated humans for centuries, serving as a central theme in numerous Bollywood and Hollywood films. But one man is taking this dream seriously—Bryan Johnson, a millionaire from the US, is actively trying to reverse his biological age and achieve what many fictional characters have only dreamed of: living forever. In fact, he believes it’s possible. Bryan even shares his daily routine on his website, offering people the chance to “subscribe” to his “Blueprint” if they want to follow in his footsteps. But is it really possible to extend your lifespan or, better yet, live forever? What do experts have to say about Bryan's lifestyle? And could you apply his routine to your own life? Before diving into these questions, let’s explore exactly what Bryan Johnson is doing in his pursuit of immortality. Bryan Johnson’s blueprint In 2013, after selling his company to eBay’s PayPal for $800 million, Bryan had plenty of options on how to spend his fortune. He could have travelled the world, bought a mansion, and lived a life of luxury. But instead, he decided to dedicate his life to chasing immortality — a quest that has earned him significant attention, especially after making headlines with his ""Project Blueprint"", a protocol-based lifestyle designed to help people live longer. The Blueprint, which is available for free, outlines Bryan's daily routine and how it has allegedly helped him achieve the biological age of an 18-year-old. For context, biological age refers to how old your cells are, and some experts consider it a more accurate measure of ageing than chronological age.

His daily routine includes light therapy, and taking 111 supplements, including the widely discussed 'Rapamycin' (he paused taking it after a few years). Good sleep and daily workouts are also a few key aspects of Bryan’s lifestyle. He consumes precisely 1,977 calories a day and eats 70 pounds of vegetables per month. His breakfast consists of a standard mix of broccoli, cauliflower, black lentils, mushrooms, garlic, and ginger. His next meal is ""nutty pudding"" with nuts and berries, and his final meal includes vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, 15 grams of 100% dark chocolate, and 30 millilitres of extra virgin olive oil.He also allows himself 'three' ounces of wine to end his day.Managing stress is vital for him, and he claims it plays a key role in living longer.PS: Although Bryan's Blueprint is technically free to access, he also sells products like protein powder and (soon-to-be-released) sunscreen under the guise of promoting health and longevity.What has Bryan achieved so far?advertisementBryan claims his lifestyle has helped him reverse his biological age by over 5 years, and his blood transfusion has helped his father do the same.

Here's what they had to say about its key components. 1. Working outBryan prioritises workouts, recommending three days of strength training and three days of cardio each week. Dr Aijaaz Ashai, a physiotherapist and celebrity fitness expert, supports this, stating that exercise can delay age-related diseases, preserve mobility, and enhance mental sharpness.On a cellular level, regular exercise helps maintain the length of telomeres—protective caps on DNA—which slow down the ageing process. ""While no one lives forever, a regular exercise routine can certainly add to your lifespan and improve the quality of your remaining years,” says Dr Ashai.2. Mental healthadvertisementAccording to Bryan’s Blueprint, if you buy his products — especially his “Best-selling longevity kit” with 70+ health actives — you’ll be able to manage daily challenges “with ease as stress-reducing ingredients promote calm and balanced emotions”.While managing stress is undoubtedly a priority for Bryan, can it help you live forever? According to mental health expert Shreya Kaul, the answer is a firm no.“Our bodies naturally start to deteriorate after a certain point. Our cells, organs, and genetics all begin to disintegrate. No living being is truly immortal,” she says.However, she does agree that managing stress is essential for leading a better, healthier life. She highlights that mental and physical health are deeply connected, with better mental health leading to improved immunity, energy, and agility.3. Clean diet and supplementsOne of the biggest pillars of Bryan’s Blueprint is his ultra-clean diet and daily consumption of 111 supplements. While research does show that healthy eating can reduce the risk of premature death by nearly 20%, it’s unlikely to guarantee immortality.Dr Nivedita Pandey, a senior gastroenterologist and director of Dr Good Deed Clinic, Patna, agrees. She highlights that free radicals (unstable molecules generated during digestion) damage our organs, leading to ageing. Eating natural, whole foods can help reduce free radicals, promoting longer and healthier lives.

Dr Aijaaz Ashai, a physiotherapist and celebrity fitness expert, supports this, stating that exercise can delay age-related diseases, preserve mobility, and enhance mental sharpness. On a cellular level, regular exercise helps maintain the length of telomeres—protective caps on DNA—which slow down the ageing process. ""While no one lives forever, a regular exercise routine can certainly add to your lifespan and improve the quality of your remaining years,” says Dr Ashai.2. Mental health According to Bryan’s Blueprint, if you buy his products — especially his “Best-selling longevity kit” with 70+ health actives — you’ll be able to manage daily challenges “with ease as stress-reducing ingredients promote calm and balanced emotions”. While managing stress is undoubtedly a priority for Bryan, can it help you live forever? According to mental health expert Shreya Kaul, the answer is a firm no. “Our bodies naturally start to deteriorate after a certain point. Our cells, organs, and genetics all begin to disintegrate. No living being is truly immortal,” she says. However, she does agree that managing stress is essential for leading a better, healthier life. She highlights that mental and physical health are deeply connected, with better mental health leading to improved immunity, energy, and agility.3. Clean diet and supplements One of the biggest pillars of Bryan’s Blueprint is his ultra-clean diet and daily consumption of 111 supplements. While research does show that healthy eating can reduce the risk of premature death by nearly 20%, it’s unlikely to guarantee immortality. Dr Nivedita Pandey, a senior gastroenterologist and director of Dr Good Deed Clinic, Patna, agrees. She highlights that free radicals (unstable molecules generated during digestion) damage our organs, leading to ageing. Eating natural, whole foods can help reduce free radicals, promoting longer and healthier lives.

 Now let's talk about supplements. When it comes to supplements, dietician Sohom Singh Roy, Redcliffe Labs, says they can bridge nutrient gaps in our diet. Targeted supplements can support immunity, brain function, and overall health. However, Kumaar Bagrodia, a neuroscientist from Mumbai and founder of various companies like HALE, NeuroLeap, Arkni and PhotoBioLife, tells us, not all supplements have enough scientific evidence as to their benefits. He notes that while calcium, iron, Vitamin D, folic acid, and omega-3 have strong evidence supporting their benefits, supplements alone can never replace a balanced diet.4. Sleep, sleep, sleep Bryan treats sleep as a non-negotiable part of his day. Experts agree. Kumaar calls it the ""golden hour"" for mental health, as it helps with memory consolidation, emotional processing, and tissue repair.

 “Sleep is crucial for mood regulation. It reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression and promotes emotional balance. It also supports biological well-being by enhancing energy levels and strengthening immunity,” he says. 5. Light therapy Bryan’s routine also includes light therapy - a growing trend, with even celebrities like Kim Kardashian adopting it.

 Kumaar explains that light of specific wavelengths can stimulate, heal, and regenerate cells and tissues. ""It naturally improves cellular mitochondria function. The therapy is non-invasive and promotes cellular repair, similar to how sunlight influences vitamin D synthesis,"" he says.The final breath: Can you live forever? After speaking with various experts, one thing becomes clear - biological immortality is still a fantasy. While Bryan’s lifestyle may help him maintain youthful biomarkers, there’s no scientific evidence that it will prevent death. ""Biologically, the human body is subject to the processes of ageing and senescence,"" says Kumaar. ""Cells accumulate damage over time due to oxidative stress, DNA mutations, and telomere shortening. Despite advances in regenerative medicine and anti-ageing therapies, these natural constraints make true immortality unlikely,"" he adds. Shreya also points out that discussions on health and longevity are often rooted in privilege. ""Bryan Johnson's 'Don't die' movement is great. Everyone wants to live longer and healthier, so why not? But not everyone has the luxury of prioritising longevity,” she explains. ""For people struggling to survive day to day, thoughts like 'This is killing me faster' don't even cross their minds. Their main concern is, 'How will I get food on the table tomorrow?,"" Shreya adds.  While Bryan Johnson's efforts are admirable, the idea of living forever remains a distant dream. For now, the best we can do is strive for a healthier, longer, and more meaningful life, so think twice before investing in someone's blueprint of living forever.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 10, 2024Must Watch

The alarm rings, but you're so cosy under your layers of blankets that the snooze button is just too tempting. You give in and drift back into sweet sleep, only to be awakened by the alarm again a few minutes later. You may hit snooze once more, but eventually, you know it's time to muster the courage to face the bone-chilling cold. As you prepare for the day, you begin the usual routine - brushing your teeth, enjoying a hot shower, and finally gearing up to pick your OOTD. You want something that keeps you warm while also checking the style box. Sounds like a daily sartorial conundrum? You're not alone. But here's the good news—we have a suggestion: befriend a few turtlenecks.

 Warm and cosy, turtlenecks are a basic winter staple, but when styled well, they can be the secret to a fabulous winter wardrobe. On mornings when you're running late and don't want to spend hours deciding what to wear, turtlenecks come in handy. Pair one with a pair of jeans, and you're good to go! If it’s too cold, layer up with a faux-leather jacket or an overcoat, and you’re all set. For party nights when you want to slay without freezing, pair your turtleneck with a leather skirt and boots. It’s as simple as that! Stylists highly recommend including turtlenecks, even when building a minimalist winter capsule wardrobe. Think of it as the white T-shirt of your summer wardrobe. From beach outings to workdays and brunch dates, your favourite white T-shirt works for almost any occasion, right? A turtleneck serves the same purpose during winter. And let’s not forget how it keeps your neck warm, protecting it from the winter chill. Its versatility is its biggest strength! It goes well with just about anything. You can wear it on its own or layer it with an open jacket or a cosy cardigan. No surprises here that celebrity winter looks are incomplete without a few iconic turtleneck moments every year!
This winter, it has already begun! Priyanka Chopra recently flaunted an ivory turtleneck that she teamed with matching trousers and a black jacket with faux fur accents. So luxe!

 Priyanka has had several stunning turtleneck moments in the last few years! She often throws over long overcoats. Deepika Padukone is the quintessential poster girl for turtleneck sweaters. Whenever the temperatures dip in Mumbai, she turns to her trusted turtlenecks – especially for her airport looks.

 Some pro tips:
Invest in basic turtlenecks like black, beige, fawn, and maroon first.
To give a glam makeover to a turtleneck, add a statement piece – it can be a skirt, a stunning jacket, or a quirky jewellery piece.
Turn to vibrant or multi-coloured turtlenecks to make winter fashion look edgy.
Pair an oversized turtleneck with your favourite jeans and sneakers for a relaxed look.
Layer a neutral-coloured turtleneck under a tailored blazer or a coat to ace the ‘office chic’ vibe.
A black or metallic turtleneck paired with a leather skirt and knee-high boots is the ultimate party combo.
To keep it sporty and athleisure, style a loose turtleneck with tights and chunky sneakers.

20f0639d-7181-4151-935c-51c36a740dcb,"Why solo trips are essential, even when you have a partner or kidsTravelling solo might seem odd when you have a partner, but it offers unique benefits that strengthen both your relationship and personal growth.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/why-solo-trips-are-essential-even-when-you-have-a-partner-or-kids-2646687-2024-12-08,"Happily married with two kids and always vacationing as a family. Does this sound like your story? Then keep reading. You’ve probably heard people say, “It was so much fun when I was single, but things have changed now that I’m married and have kids.”  For many, once a relationship deepens or a family grows, self-care quietly takes a backseat. Prioritising others' needs and happiness often becomes the default - even if it means sacrificing something that once brought you immense joy. Solo travel is often one of the first casualties. Society doesn’t make it any easier. The moment you mention travelling alone post-marriage or post-kids, the raised eyebrows and unsolicited comments begin. “How can you enjoy yourself alone?” or “Won’t you feel guilty leaving your kids behind?” These are just a couple of the judgemental remarks people endure. But pause for a moment and think: Are you holding yourself back because of societal expectations or fear of how your family might cope without you? If so, it’s time you needed some changes. Suppressing your passion - especially something as fulfilling as solo travel - does no good. Neglecting what you love only takes a toll on your mental well-being, and in the long run, this can affect your relationships too.
 


Why is it important to travel solo?An Indian household typical when a girl just randomly asks her parents – can I visit Goa with my college friends, please? Or let’s say she asks – I am going on a solo trip to Himachal Pradesh. Could you lend me some money? The cliché response would be – shaadi ke baad jahaan jana hai jao, not before!And then, after some years, when that girl finally gets married – she has a so-called “permanent travelling partner” for life. So, when is it her time to go and explore the world solo? More than men, it’s women who often have to give up on their aspirations and hobbies. However, irrespective of your relationship status, gender, or profession, everyone should travel solo, and experts highly recommend it.Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai, tells India Today, that travelling solo allows people to explore their preferences, dislikes, goals, and visions for life. It cultivates a sense of autonomy and freedom that is crucial for personal growth.“In the Indian context, where societal norms often emphasise the collective ‘we’ system, marriage or relationships are frequently associated with a sense of responsibility. A solo trip, therefore, becomes a form of self-care, helping you nurture your individuality while still existing as a partner to someone else,” she adds.

Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, says, that in relationships, solo travelling helps maintain a sense of self that is often crucial for a healthy dynamic.“Healthy relationships are built on a concept called differentiation, which simply means that you celebrate being individuals while coming together to be a couple.

98ae2a9c-b5a7-4bb0-a779-8f1a0515a3e2,Pilates vs weight training: Which one helps you lose weight faster?Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century during World War I as a method to rehabilitate injured soldiers and dancers. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/pilates-vs-weight-training-which-one-helps-you-lose-weight-faster-2646112-2024-12-07,"If there’s one thing Bollywood icons like Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, and Janhvi Kapoor all have in common in their fitness routines, it isn’t a magical elixir for their youth and glamour - it’s their dedication to Pilates. In the past few years, Pilates has become quite the buzzword in the fitness industry. Though in India, it is gaining prominence now, Bollywood celebs have been obsessed with pilates for some time now.  But if you’re not aware, let us give you a crash course. What exactly is Pilates? Pilates is a form of low-impact exercise that focusses on strengthening muscles and improving flexibility, balance, and posture.  “The practice emphasises controlled movements, core strength, and proper alignment,” says Dr Vipul Lunawat, a fitness expert and the founder-director of the Institute of Sports Science and Technology of Pune.

 Dr Lunawat says that there are a few core principles of Pilates, like:
1. Concentration: Mindful engagement with each movement.
2. Control: Precision and mastery of your body’s movements.
3. Centering: Focus on your core, often referred to as the ""powerhouse"".
4. Flow: Smooth, continuous movements.
5. Precision: Attention to detail in form and technique.
6. Breathing: Proper breath control to enhance movement and relaxation.From World War I to celeb favorite Meenal Pathak, tells India Today that Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century during World War I as a method to rehabilitate injured soldiers and dancers.

 “Today, it has become particularly relevant because of our sedentary lifestyles, poor posture, and long sitting hours, which often lead to issues like wrist pain, shoulder pain, and joint discomfort,” says Meenal.  According to her, Pilates is highly effective (for both men and women) for addressing these problems as it, focuses on improving mobility and flexibility, alongside other benefits. It works wonders for posture, core strength, and spinal health. Pilates is all about strengthening, lengthening, and protecting your spine, which makes it an excellent choice. Now, there are two ways of doing Pilates: mat Pilates (which is done with very minimal or no equipment) and the more famous and preferred one by celebs is the other type - which uses a machine called reformer.

 This reformer Pilates has not only made quite a buzz on social media, as they are preferred by not only Bollywood celebs but by also influencers.  According to Meenal, “Mat Pilates is a fantastic way to start. It allows you to build strength and learn proper alignment without any tools. Small props like resistance bands can enhance the workout, but they’re not essential.” For those who want more variety, reformer Pilates uses machines with springs and straps to add resistance. Abhishek Bhadauria, Head Coach at MultiFit, notes, “The essence of Pilates lies in core engagement, and that can be achieved with or without equipment.”Weight training and Pilates: which can help you lose weight faster? Now, the question of the hour is, if you are trying to lose weight, which one can help to reach the goal faster, and which one should you prefer? We spoke to experts, and let’s have a look at both of them in depth.   1. Calorie burn
advertisementWeight training: A single high-intensity session burns more calories than Pilates and induces the afterburn effect (EPOC), where the body continues to burn calories post-workout.
Pilates: While it generally burns fewer calories, advanced Pilates sessions incorporating faster transitions or reformer machines can boost calorie expenditure.
2. Muscle building and metabolism
Weight training: Builds lean muscle, increasing resting metabolic rate (RMR) for long-term calorie burn.
Pilates: Tones muscles and enhances functional strength, but its impact on RMR is less significant.
Abhishek says, “Pilates excels in improving flexibility, balance, and core strength, making it an excellent choice for those seeking low-impact exercise or rehabilitation. Weight training, on the other hand, is ideal for building muscle mass and boosting metabolism. Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual goals and preferences.”3. Functional benefits
Pilates: Excels in flexibility, balance, and posture, reducing injury risk. As Dr Lunawat, explains, “Pilates is crucial for mobility and flexibility, which are often overlooked in traditional strength training but are vital for long-term health and injury prevention.”
Weight training: Improves bone density and overall strength, which is essential for physical resilience and metabolism.
Finally, as Jashan Bhumkar, fitness enthusiast, notes, “Both have their merits, but if Pilates motivates you to stay active, it’s just as effective in the long term.”advertisementWhich is faster for weight loss?In simple terms, weight training has the edge for rapid weight loss, largely due to its calorie-burning potential and metabolic benefits. A 2019 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that resistance training significantly improves body composition by reducing fat while preserving lean muscle.Dr Lunawat adds, “A combination of weight training and a calorie-controlled diet is ideal for quicker results. But Pilates can play a complementary role, improving mobility and aiding recovery.”Meenal says, “If your goal is to lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit. Pilates tones and builds functional strength, but adding weight training will help preserve muscle mass.”Why not combine the two?For maximum benefits, a balanced routine combining Pilates and weight training is ideal.

Rida, a content creator based in Bengaluru, currently has over a million followers on Instagram. However, she admits in her video that she hadn’t expected her vision board to become a reality. From spending more time with her friends and family to going on international solo trips and even buying an expensive piece of jewellery, Rida claims her vision board turned into reality.

But Rida is not alone. A quick search on the Internet today will reveal hundreds, uhm perhaps thousands, of influencers sharing videos on vision boards and how ""it has actually worked for them."" Vision boards have become the ""IT"" trend right now, and as each year comes to a close, such videos resurface in full force. From DIY vision board tutorials to ""vision board vs reality"" comparisons, and how they have ""manifested their vision board"" these videos are everywhere. But can a vision board actually help you achieve your goals for the next year, or is it just another passing trend? We asked the experts.What exactly is a vision board? If you haven’t seen the viral videos, let us tell you, a vision board is a creative visual representation of one’s goals, dreams, and aspirations. It typically takes the form of a collage made up of images, quotes, and affirmations that reflect what you aim to achieve in life. Think of it as a personal roadmap in picture form, offering a daily reminder of where you’re headed. As Aamish Dhingra, ICF-PCC certified life coach and co-founder of Cocoweave Coaching International, puts it for India Today, “Vision boards are like a compass. They provide clarity and direction but require you to take the journey.”   But can a vision board actually help you achieve your goals for the next year, or is it just another passing trend?

Absy Sam, a Mumbai-based psychologist, explains, “When we talk about the visual or the images that are created, the brain is able to process them much faster than words. This visual aid helps with clarity, memory retention, and emotional connect.” Today, vision boards are all over all the social media platforms, like YouTube, and is becoming an influencer's way of achieving goals. In fact, a lot of people (read: influencers) are hosting get-togethers so that they can make their vision boards together.

What does science have to say about vision boards? A post shared by Lisa | Toronto (@li.gorbunova)
 The effectiveness of vision boards is backed by psychology and neuroscience. The concept revolves around the brain’s Reticular Activating System (RAS), a network of neurons. Technically, it is a network of nerves in the brainstem that controls wakefulness, sleep-wake transitions, and behaviour. In simple terms, it acts as filtering out the things that are important to our brain.   Clinical psychologist Mehezabin Dordi from Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital explains, “When you visualise a goal, your brain activates neural pathways similar to when you physically work toward that goal. The RAS filters information and directs your focus toward things relevant to your goals.” She explains that if an individual has an exam and makes a vision board about it, it will help them. “Having a look at the vision board on a daily basis keeps your mind aware of your target and your brain functions in a way that syncs with your goal. For instance, if your vision board has a picture of obtaining first position in your final exam, your mind automatically starts functioning in the process of attaining those goals in the form of habits and actions and seeks out opportunities to fulfil that dream,” she says.

 Aamish elaborates, “If you repeatedly and persistently visualise your aspiration in life, your subconscious mind helps you take steps toward it by spotting opportunities or people that align with your goal.” This is why people often feel as though “luck” is on their side when, in reality, they have simply trained their minds to recognise opportunities.Benefits of making a vision board Creating a vision board can bring several emotional, mental, and practical benefits. Here’s a look at how it can make a difference (expert approved):
Clarity of goals: Vision boards make abstract desires concrete. Absy highlights that “when you use a vision board, it helps you bring all your abstract ideas into something visual and more structured.” This clarity allows for more precise goal-setting and action planning.
Motivation and inspiration: Looking at a vision board daily can be a powerful motivator. Aamish says, “The vision boards are quite motivating by giving you an imaginary perspective of success. This motivates you towards goal accomplishment to take needful actions.”
Emotional connection: The use of images and affirmations creates an emotional link with your goals. Shreans Daga, an approved life coach and spiritual teacher and chairman of Pyramid Valley International, says, “It’s not enough to think about a goal; you need to feel it with your entire being.” 
Focus and reduced distractions: Vision boards direct your mind’s focus on what matters. Absy tells India Today, “The ultimate goal of a vision board is to limit your distracted mind towards an image that has your dream encapsulated in a physical form.” This focus is essential for overcoming daily distractions and staying on track.
Increased self-belief and confidence: Visualisation strengthens positive neural pathways in the brain. Mehezabin notes that “visualizing success helps reinforce positive beliefs, boosting confidence and reducing self-doubt.”
advertisement‘Vision board alone can’t help you achieve your dreams’Experts caution that a vision board alone isn’t a magical solution. Shreans says that vision boards are not magic wands; they are tools for focus and intentionality. advertisement“The real magic happens when your thoughts, feelings, and actions align. Visualisation must be paired with action and effort for tangible results,” he says. Mehezabin agrees. She says that a vision board by itself cannot guarantee success, but it can be a valuable tool when combined with action and effort. “Creating a vision board helps clarify goals and serves as a visual reminder of what you want to achieve. It can strengthen motivation by keeping your focus on the end result, especially during challenging times,” she says.

All these have made vision boards popular amongst people, as they have a mix of both scientific and spiritual ways of achieving what you want in life, and working towards it. Social media have further amplified their appeal, with platforms showcasing creative, aesthetic and visually inspiring content that encourages people to adopt this practice. How to make your own vision boardCreating a vision board is a personal and creative process, and there’s no single right way to do it. But if vision boards still interests you, and here’s a quick step-by-step guide to get you started:
Define your goals: Start by reflecting on what you want in key areas of your life—career, relationships, health, personal growth, and finances. Think about where you want to be next year (since this trend focuses on making a new vision board every year).
Gather materials: You’ll need a board (corkboard, cardboard, or even a large piece of paper), scissors, glue, tape, and a collection of magazines, printouts, or photographs. If you prefer a digital version, there are plenty of online vision board tools and apps. But here we are talking about the offline one. 
Select images and words: Choose images, affirmations, and words that resonate with your goals. For example, if you aim to achieve fitness goals, you might add pictures of healthy food, active people, or motivational phrases that match the vibes. 
Organise and design: Arrange your images and words on the board in a way that feels right to you. You can divide it into sections for different life areas or create a free-flowing collage.
Add emotional elements: Make sure your vision board is personal to you. Include words that inspire your feelings of excitement, gratitude, or joy.
Pro tip: Place your vision board somewhere you’ll see it daily—on your bedroom wall, in your workspace, or as a screensaver on your phone.Absy Sam says that setting realistic, manageable goals on your vision board is essential to avoid disappointment. Small, actionable steps are key to maintaining motivation.“One thing that is very crucial for dream fulfilment is action. Vision boards can control your subconscious mind by aligning it with your goal, but physical action has to be done by you,” Aamish concludes.

 Are you also wondering what makes these creams trigger that warming effect on your skin? Well, menthol and capsaicin are mostly the key ingredients in this case. “Warming creams contain specific ingredients like capsicum extract, menthol, or certain essential oils that trigger a warming sensation on the skin. These components improve blood circulation in the applied area, which generates a sense of warmth,” says Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant - aesthetic physician, Gleneagles Hospital, Bengaluru. These lotions, essentially, stimulate the sensory receptors in the skin leading to the warming effect. “The active ingredients include capsaicin, menthol, or camphor. These interact with the nerve endings in the skin, creating a heat response. Capsaicin increases blood flow to the applied area, thereby producing warmth. Menthol initially causes a cooling effect, but this can be followed by a warming effect. This helps to relax the muscles, calm the tension, and comfort at the cold temperature,” explains Dr Shivani Yadav, consultant - dermatology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Gurugram. Warming lotions are popular in the West, and are also being created by Indian brands. Clensta, a skincare brand backed by Parineeti Chopra, has a product in this category. They use ingredients like ginger oil and Vanillyl Butyl Ether to create the warming effect.Are these safe to use? Dermatologists say these creams are mostly harmless, but a patch test is always recommended. Additionally, those with sensitive skin, pre-existing skin conditions, or allergies should exercise caution, as these creams can sometimes cause irritation, redness, or discomfort. Patch test “Generally, most people do not have to worry if winter warming creams are applied correctly, but caution must always be taken. They normally include capsaicin or menthol, causing the skin to feel like it is heating up. This can sometimes cause an irritation of sensitive skin and allergy reactions. One must conduct a patch test before a full application. Use them with great care on broken or inflamed skin,” suggests Dr Yadav. Avoid sensitive areas Dr Sachdev suggests not applying warming lotions on broken skin, near the eyes, or mucous membranes. Follow instructions Read the ingredients and buy from reputable brands. Always read the package to use the recommended amount and avoid excess application. Winter warming creams can be beneficial for providing temporary relief and comfort during cold weather. But individuals with sensitive skin, pre-existing skin conditions, or allergies should exercise caution, as these creams can sometimes cause irritation, redness, or discomfort. If you witness burning, itching or prolonged redness, it is better to stop using the product immediately. Consult a dermatologist immediately in case of allergy issues.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

What is OCD, really? A post shared by Ekta Khurana | PSYCHOLOGIST | THERAPIST (@ektakhurana_)
 We often toss around the term OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) casually, but it is a mental health condition characterised by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) that a person feels driven to perform. These compulsions are not done for fun or preference but to ease the intense anxiety caused by the obsessions. Delhi-based psychologist and therapist Ekta Khurana says, “OCD is a serious issue that many people face daily. It’s not just about occasional intrusive thoughts or habits that people joke about. While it’s normal to have random thoughts, if they’re persistent, intrusive, and cause anxiety, it’s important to take them seriously.” For example: Obsession: Fear of harming loved ones unintentionally. Compulsion: Repeating specific prayers or rituals to prevent harm. While compulsive cleaning can be one symptom, it’s just one possibility in a broad spectrum.Common misconceptions Dr Rajiv Mehta, vice-chairperson of psychiatry at Sir Gangaram Hospital, says, “The most common misconception about OCD is that it is a weakness of self. It is not a disorder, but the person is deliberately repetitively doing the things.” “The other misconception is that as the person is deliberately doing the things, he or she can control the acts by self,” he adds. Besides, the stereotype of OCD is that it is about cleanliness. But it does not highlight a person’s other struggles. Someone with OCD might repeatedly check locks, count in specific patterns, or experience intrusive, distressing thoughts.

 You may like to believe it or not, but OCD can severely impact a person's daily life. People with severe OCD may spend hours a day trapped in obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals, interfering with work, relationships, and overall well-being.What can cause it Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a complex condition, and its exact cause is not fully understood, says Archana Singhal, founder of Mindwell Counsel, Delhi. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is a widely used clinical tool for assessing the severity of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It helps measure the intensity of both obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviours or mental acts) in individuals diagnosed with OCD, she adds. However, several factors are believed to contribute to the development of OCD, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological influences. These factors might work together to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. Singhal states some of the key potential causes: Genetic factors: Research suggests that genetics can play a significant role in the development of OCD. Having a family member with OCD increases the risk of developing the disorder, indicating a genetic predisposition. Studies have shown that OCD tends to run in families, suggesting that inherited genes may influence the brain's functioning in a way that contributes to the disorder. However, it's important to note that genetics alone is unlikely to be the sole cause of OCD. Brain structure and function: There is evidence that abnormalities in certain areas of the brain may contribute to OCD. Specifically, dysfunction in the circuitry involving the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and cingulate cortex has been implicated. These regions of the brain are involved in processing anxiety, decision-making, and behaviour regulation. In individuals with OCD, these brain areas may become overactive or fail to communicate properly, leading to the repetitive, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and actions (compulsions) characteristic of the disorder. Chemical imbalances (neurotransmitters): Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, anxiety, and behaviour, is thought to be involved in OCD. It is believed that people with OCD may have an imbalance of serotonin in their brains, which could contribute to the intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviours that are central to the disorder. This has led to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of OCD, which can help balance serotonin levels and alleviate symptoms for many individuals. Environmental factors: Environmental stressors or traumatic events can play a role in the onset or exacerbation of OCD. For example:
advertisementStressful life events such as the death of a loved one, divorce, abuse, or significant life changes can trigger or worsen OCD symptoms in some people.
Childhood trauma or adverse childhood experiences (such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse) may also increase the risk of developing OCD later in life. Some studies suggest that trauma can trigger OCD symptoms in predisposed individuals, particularly when combined with other factors like genetics.

Additionally, infection has been proposed as a potential trigger for OCD, particularly in children. This is known as PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections), where a strep infection may lead to sudden-onset OCD symptoms, although this theory remains controversial and is not universally accepted.Cognitive and behavioural factors: Some theories of OCD focus on cognitive and behavioural patterns. Cognitive models suggest that people with OCD may have certain cognitive biases, such as: Overestimating threats: They may perceive normal, everyday situations as dangerous or needing to be controlled. Inflated sense of responsibility: People with OCD might believe that they are responsible for preventing harm and that they must perform specific behaviours (compulsions) to prevent disasters.advertisementIntolerance of uncertainty: People with OCD often have difficulty tolerating uncertainty, which leads them to engage in compulsive rituals to reduce anxiety or to seek certainty.Behavioural models focus on the idea that OCD is learnt through classical conditioning, where certain actions become reinforced through repetition. When a person experiences anxiety and then engages in a compulsive behaviour (such as washing hands), the behaviour temporarily reduces the anxiety, reinforcing the cycle and making it more likely to occur again in the future.Is a cure available?OCD is a manageable condition, and seeking professional support can greatly enhance symptom control, enabling individuals to live more fulfilling lives. Effective OCD management typically involves a blend of treatment strategies, including therapy, medication, and lifestyle adjustments.Therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), is highly effective for treating OCD. ERP involves gradually exposing oneself to feared thoughts or situations and learning to resist the urge to perform compulsive behaviours.

Medication:  Several of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)are FDA-approved and commonly prescribed at higher doses to help alleviate anxiety and OCD symptoms.Lifestyle changes: Regular exercise, adequate sleep and a healthy diet can support overall mental health and help manage symptoms.Mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques: “Practices like mindfulness meditation, yoga and deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can alleviate some OCD symptoms,” says Archana Singhal.Support groups: Connecting with others who have OCD can provide valuable support and understanding.Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Deep Brain Stimulation are both approved treatments for patients with OCD and have not responded to other treatments.Piyali Maity, clinical director of counselling operations, 1to1help, concludes, “It is important to create an environment where individuals with OCD feel understood, supported, and empowered to seek help and that can be achieved once there is enough awareness. It is also important to be conscious and understand how we use the term OCD. Equating it with just being ‘neat’ or ‘perfectionistic’ is problematic. It is a stereotype that needs to be challenged so that the casual misuse of the term can be avoided.”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 21, 2024

Recent statistics also reveal a clear shift in how Indians approach their travel plans. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/indians-are-chasing-luxury-travel-like-never-before-whats-driving-this-shift-2653015-2024-12-22,"Luxury, business class, and extravagant retreats are becoming increasingly popular among Indian travellers. Once known for their resourcefulness and practical approach to travel, Indians today prioritise travel like never before, and they’re doing it in style – with a taste for luxury. ""I am ready to shell out a few extra bucks, but when I travel, it has to be comfortable. Brownie points if I can find luxury with that extra money,"" says Muskan Agarwal, a 25-year-old student from Delhi NCR, while sharing why she prefers to travel in luxury. Such is the mindset not only of Muskan but also of many Indians who are shifting from being budget travellers to embracing the idea of luxury travel.What data tells us Luxury travel among Indian tourists is no longer a rare occurrence. In fact, recent statistics reveal a clear shift in how Indians are approaching their travel plans. India Today analysed several year-end reports by various travel agencies, and all indicate the same.  According to data from Skyscanner, an online travel agency, 37 per cent of Indian travellers plan to upgrade their flights to business or first class in 2024. Additionally, 44 per cent intend to purchase access to airport lounges to ensure their trips begin on a luxurious note. Another MakeMyTrip (an online travel agency) data shows the same. In fact, it shows a 50 per cent year-on-year increase in business class bookings, with international flights witnessing a whopping 80  per cent jump, while domestic flights saw a 27 per cent rise. 

 



Data also shows a similar rise. Photo: MakeMyTrip
It also shows that India’s contribution of domestic hotel bookings priced above INR 10,000 has increased to 22 per cent as compared to 20 per cent in the same period last year. This number is almost double for international hotel bookings (a jump of 57 per cent from 51 per cent). These figures paint a compelling picture. For a demographic once known for cost-cutting and resourcefulness, this surge in premium travel choices marks a significant change. It’s not just about getting from point A to point B anymore; it’s about doing so in style, comfort, and with a dash of indulgence.Experts also agreeLouis D’Souza, director at Tamarind Global, says, “Luxury travel among Indian travellers has seen an extraordinary rise and this trend shows no signs of slowing down in 2025.” D’Souza explains that today’s Indian traveller craves unique, bespoke experiences that go beyond traditional sightseeing. “From unwinding in a private villa on an exclusive island to a gastronomic adventure at Michelin-star restaurants in Tokyo, or indulging in bespoke art and fashion tours in Paris, the essence of luxury is shifting toward experiential and meaningful travel,” he adds.Prabhakar Kamat, business head at Red Dot Representations, echoes this sentiment, and says the trend seems to be growing even more strongly for next year.

Let’s break down these reasons one by one. Why Indians prefer luxurySeveral factors have converged to drive the rise in luxury travel among Indians, transforming it from a niche market to a mainstream aspiration. Here’s a closer look at what’s behind this change:
Rising disposable incomes: Experts suggest that economic growth in India has created a more affluent middle and upper class, enabling a larger section of the population to afford premium travel experiences. 
Change in priorities: Experts like D'Souza suggest that the younger generation has prioritised travel as an essential part of their lives being the key contributors (Not 70 hours work week). Rajesh Magow, the co-founder and group CEO of MMT, says, “The trend toward premiumisation is becoming increasingly pronounced, as travellers are willing to spend more for a memorable holiday.”
Exposure to global lifestyles: Thanks to the rise of social media and digital platforms, Indian travellers have a front-row seat to the luxury experiences enjoyed by people around the world. This exposure has cultivated a taste for indulgence and exclusivity.

Celebration tourism: Destination weddings, milestone anniversaries, and large family reunions are on the rise. Grand occasions now call for equally grand destinations, and luxury travel provides the perfect setting for such celebrations.
Post-pandemic priorities: Privacy, safety, and bespoke experiences have become crucial considerations for travellers. Exclusive itineraries and private accommodations naturally align with these needs, making luxury travel a more appealing option. Moreover, ever since the pandemic, there has been a change in the mindset of many people, with them prioritising experiences over anything else. This has led to the rise of a very specific type of travel known as 'revenge travel'. 
Desire for unique experiences: As D’Souza points out, modern travellers are seeking experiences that go beyond sightseeing. Private villas, Michelin-starred dining, and immersive art and fashion tours have become the new definition of luxury.

 It also shows that India’s contribution of domestic hotel bookings priced above INR 10,000 has increased to 22 per cent as compared to 20 per cent in the same period last year. This number is almost double for international hotel bookings (a jump of 57 per cent from 51 per cent).  These figures paint a compelling picture. For a demographic once known for cost-cutting and resourcefulness, this surge in premium travel choices marks a significant change. It’s not just about getting from point A to point B anymore; it’s about doing so in style, comfort, and with a dash of indulgence.Experts also agree Louis D’Souza, director at Tamarind Global, says, “Luxury travel among Indian travellers has seen an extraordinary rise and this trend shows no signs of slowing down in 2025.” D’Souza explains that today’s Indian traveller craves unique, bespoke experiences that go beyond traditional sightseeing.  “From unwinding in a private villa on an exclusive island to a gastronomic adventure at Michelin-star restaurants in Tokyo, or indulging in bespoke art and fashion tours in Paris, the essence of luxury is shifting toward experiential and meaningful travel,” he adds. Prabhakar Kamat, business head at Red Dot Representations, echoes this sentiment, and says the trend seems to be growing even more strongly for next year.

0f8587f3-b100-4bd9-863d-25648330d1d9,"Retirement depression is real and rising in India. How to manage itFor many people, retirement brings feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and worthlessness, which can potentially lead to clinical depression.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/retirement-depression-is-real-how-to-manage-prevent-it-2654219-2024-12-23,"When Ritika, a 29-year-old woman from Delhi, flew from Berlin to celebrate her father's retirement, everything seemed perfect. Her father, a travel enthusiast, already had several trips planned for the months ahead. However, a year and a half later, Ritika found herself packing her bags to return to Delhi. Her father, once so vibrant, had developed a bevy of health issues, including signs of depression. Retirement depression, often caused by the emotional challenges that accompany retirement, is a growing issue in India. People who once led dynamic lives filled with social interactions, daily routines, and a sense of purpose often struggle to adjust to the sudden and stark changes brought on by retirement. Retirement comes with a set of benefits but also some challenges. “Retirement, for many people, comes with feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and worthlessness, which can lead to clinical depression,” says Dr Aarti Anand, senior consultant – psychiatry, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi. Retirement depression refers to feelings of sadness, anxiety, or hopelessness experienced after retiring from active work life. “Certain signs to recognise retirement depression include exhaustion or lack of motivation, along with generalised anxiety and having a persistent low mood,” says Nishtha Jain, counselling psychologist at the online mental health platform Lissun. “It is often caused by a lack of routine, reduced social interactions, and the sudden loss of a professional identity or purpose. Financial instability, health issues, and feelings of loneliness further exacerbate this condition,” says Sumalatha Vasudeva, psychologist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru. “Instead of feeling free, relaxed, and fulfilled, many people feel depressed, aimless, and isolated. They may grieve the loss of their old life, feel stressed about how they are going to fill their days, or worry about the toll that being at home all day is taking on the relationships with family members,” explains Dr Anand.

 Retirement can take away the sense of purpose and self-worth, make you feel lost, and leave behind a void. Though there is no suggestive data, experts say there is an increase in retirement depression among Indians. ""Retirement depression has fairly become more recognised and more prevalent with Indian populations. This change has come because of the changes in societal dynamics and traditional support systems that were previously available for retirees,"" says Jain. The changing family structure is also behind the rise in post-retirement depression among the elderly. “Traditionally, joint families provided emotional and social support for retirees. However, with the rise of nuclear families and urban migration, many retirees experience isolation and a sense of purposelessness, making them more vulnerable to depression,” adds Sumalatha Vasudeva. Not having hobbies outside one’s career is also a major cause of retirement depression.

 This retirement depression can lead to severe consequences, such as:
Chronic physical health issues like hypertension and diabetes due to stress
Cognitive decline, as reduced mental engagement impacts memory and problem-solving skills
Social withdrawal, which may cause strained family relationships
Increased risk of substance abuse or self-harm in severe cases
How to prevent retirement depression Retirement depression, however, can be prevented as well as managed. Prevention, as they say, is the best cure. “The best way to prevent retirement depression is to have a thought-out action plan well before retiring. This action plan should include planning about finances, routines, hobbies, and investments after retirement,” says Jain.

 



As a retiree, leading an active, healthy lifestyle is important for overall well-being. (Photo: AI Generative)
 To prevent retirement depression from affecting your or your parents’ lives, try having a plan ready. Here are a few expert-approved tips:
Plan ahead: Financial and emotional preparation for retirement.
Establish a routine: Stay active with hobbies, volunteer work, or part-time employment.
Social connections: Maintain and expand social networks to reduce loneliness.
Physical activity: Engage in regular exercise to improve mood and overall health.
Learn new skills: Pick up new hobbies or courses to maintain mental stimulation and purpose.
 Meanwhile, having a good support system and staying well-connected with family and friends is also crucial.Managing retirement depression Seeking professional help to manage anxiety and depression is imperative. It will help you navigate the challenges you are facing after retirement. A psychologist or counsellor can provide therapy to address these challenges.

 



Retirement is a major life change that requires not only advanced financial planning but also a strategy to stay occupied and fulfilled. (Photo: Getty)
 Here are additional strategies recommended by mental health experts to help manage retirement depression:
Join support groups: Go out for walks, socialise, and join communities or groups for retirees to share experiences and combat loneliness.
Adopt healthy habits: Ensure you take balanced nutrition, exercise regularly, and practise mindfulness activities such as yoga or meditation.
Set goals: Establish small, achievable goals to foster a sense of accomplishment. It could be something simple like going for a short trip every two months or reading 10 pages a day.
Family support: Express your emotions. Open communication with family members will help you share feelings and seek emotional support.

 The Protein Diet Coke is rooted in the trend of ""dirty soda"", a soda enhanced with syrups, creamers, or other ingredients for added flair. This trend was popularised by shows like The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, dirty soda has become a cultural phenomenon, and this new twist is no exception. But should you be adding Diet Coke to your protein shake or visa versa? We asked the experts. What do experts have to say?  When it comes to the trending combination of protein shakes and Diet Coke, experts have shared their thoughts, and the consensus is not overly optimistic. Parmeet Kaur, HOD-dietician and nutritionist at Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram, highlights that while this mix might sound intriguing, it often leads to digestive discomfort. The carbonation in Diet Coke produces gas when combined with protein powder, and can result in bloating. Moreover, artificial sweeteners like aspartame present in Diet Coke are known to cause sensitivity in some individuals, including headaches or digestive upset.

 Dr Bhavna Garg, senior consultant, dietitian, and nutritionist at Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital Kaushambi, agrees. She adds that the combination does not enhance the nutritional value of protein shakes. She notes that while the frothy mix might appear appealing, the caffeine and carbonation in Diet Coke can disturb digestion and potentially lead to bloating or discomfort. Both experts stress the importance of prioritising balanced nutrition over trendy mixes that may not serve any significant health purpose.Can you add it to your diet? While mixing protein shakes with Diet Coke might not be outright harmful, it isn’t a choice most nutritionists would recommend. According to Dr Garg, incorporating this combination into your diet depends largely on individual tolerance, but it doesn’t offer any substantial health benefits. Parmeet Kaur emphasises that protein shakes are best blended with water, milk, or plant-based alternatives to support proper digestion and nutrient absorption. If you’re aiming to meet your daily protein requirements, it’s better to consume protein shakes on their own rather than experimenting with carbonated beverages. But again, if you don’t like the taste of protein shake alone, you can’t try this trend, if it doesn’t upset your stomach.  For a balanced and healthy diet, focus on nutrient-rich foods and beverages that provide energy and essential nutrients without compromising digestive health.What’s the deal with Diet Coke? There has been a surge in people’s obsession with Diet Coke,  a low-calorie and sugar-free beverage, might seem like a healthier alternative to sugary drinks. Parmeet Kaur points out that its primary and controversial sweetener, aspartame, is not inherently toxic but can cause digestive upset or headaches in some individuals. While calorie intake might decrease with Diet Coke, its artificial sweeteners could trigger cravings for sweet foods, potentially impacting gut health. Dr Garg adds that moderate consumption of Diet Coke is key.  Excessive intake of artificially sweetened beverages has been linked to metabolic changes, digestive discomfort, and increased cravings for sweets. For a truly healthier lifestyle, she recommends opting for water, herbal teas, or natural beverages. In small quantities, Diet Coke may not pose a significant health risk, but it’s essential to ensure it doesn’t replace nutrient-rich and hydrating options in your diet.The last sip  While the combination of protein shakes and Diet Coke may spark curiosity among those who follow trends, it lacks the nutritional benefits that a health-conscious individual should prioritise. Experts recommend sticking to tried-and-tested options like water, milk, or plant-based altern atives for your protein shakes to ensure proper digestion and nutrient absorption.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

While we often think of tanning as a direct result of sun exposure, emerging research suggests that internal factors like gut health may play a subtle role in how our skin reacts to the sun. So, can poor gut health actually cause increased tanning?Gut health and skin: The connection Our gut does much more than just digesting food. It’s home to trillions of microorganisms that make up our gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem essential for overall health. A well-balanced gut microbiome regulates inflammation, supports the immune system, and even influences skin health. When this balance is disrupted—a state known as dysbiosis—it can lead to problems like inflammation and oxidative stress. Inflammation and oxidative stress are known to impact melanin production, the pigment responsible for the colour of our skin, hair, and eyes. They can affect how the skin reacts to UV rays from the sun, potentially leading to uneven pigmentation or an increased likelihood of damage.

Does poor gut health lead to more tanning?Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant and aesthetic physician, Gleneagles Hospital Bengaluru, says, “Emerging research suggests that gut health and skin health are interconnected. Poor gut health can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress, which may exacerbate pigmentation disorders or uneven tanning. A balanced gut microbiome supports overall skin health.”

 



A study has found a causal association between the gut microbiome and ease of skin tanning. (Photo: Getty Images)
However, she adds, that a compromised gut may impair the absorption of essential nutrients like antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that protect our skin from sun damage. This could make the skin more prone to UV-related changes, though not necessarily increased tanning.

This could make the skin more prone to UV-related changes, though not necessarily increased tanning. A study has found a causal association between the gut microbiome and ease of skin tanning. The gut-skin connection is the term used to describe the link between the digestive system and skin health.What Ayurveda says about gut health and tanning In Ayurveda, Vata Prakruti (individuals with a predominant air and space element) naturally have qualities like dryness, lightness, and irregularity in their body functions. This makes their metabolism unpredictable, leading to potential depletion of Rasa Dhatu (plasma or nutritive fluid), which is responsible for nourishing and hydrating the body tissues, including the skin. Dr Milind Salunke, wellness director at Swastik Wellbeing Sanctuary says, “When Rasa Dhatu is not adequately replenished due to Vata's drying nature, it results in dry, rough skin. Additionally, Vata's tendency to disturb digestive processes can cause constipation, as the body struggles to maintain proper moisture and smooth functioning in the digestive tract. This imbalance contributes to skin dryness and makes tanning more likely in Vata Prakruti individuals.What should be done Dr Aparna Santhanam, dermatologist and skin expert at ITC Dermafique, says, “Individuals with higher skin prototypes (a person's skin type in terms of response to ultraviolet radiations), greater eumelanin production, and genetic predisposition will tan more than others. While tanning may be perceived as protective, it is still a sign of UV-induced damage, and sun protection measures are essential for everyone to reduce the risk of photodamage and skin cancers. Experts suggest following these steps:
Use sun protection: Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30+ and wear protective clothing.
Limit sun exposure: Avoid peak UV hours, usually between 10 AM and 4 PM.
Maintain gut health: Eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, probiotics, and hydration to promote healthy skin.
Consult a professional: Seek advice from a dermatologist or aesthetic consultant for personalised treatments such as chemical peels or laser therapy to address pigmentation concerns.
 While poor gut health doesn’t directly cause increased tanning, it can influence your skin’s response to sun exposure by affecting factors like inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutrient availability. Conversely, tanning and sun exposure can also impact your gut microbiota, showing just how interconnected our internal and external health truly are.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

 But if you don’t want to invest Rs 30,000-40,000 in a device or deal with the hassle of using it yourself, you can opt for facials offered at salons. These microcurrent facials are gaining popularity in India, with various salons offering them at prices ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000. But how and when did microcurrent facials become so popular? Should you get one? What do experts have to say about these facials? Here’s a quick guide. Let’s start from the beginning.From the treatment of facial paralysis to celeb favourite Microcurrent facials may sound like a futuristic beauty trend, but their roots trace back to an old medical practice. Initially developed in the 1980s as a treatment for facial paralysis, microcurrent technology was later adopted by the beauty industry when its aesthetic benefits became apparent. Talk about a glow-up!  Today, these facials are promoted as a way to tone facial muscles and improve skin’s overall appearance, offering a non-invasive alternative to more aggressive anti-aging procedures (read: botox).  In recent years, microcurrent facials have skyrocketed in popularity, largely thanks to celebrity endorsements and social media buzz.

 According to Dr Sonali Kohli, consultant dermatologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, “In recent years, microcurrent facial treatments have gained significant popularity amongst skincare enthusiasts and celebrities alike, promising a non-invasive 'natural facelift' effect.” This trend further expanded with the advent of at-home microcurrent devices, like the viral microcurrent wand, used by all celebrities. 'It's like a gym workout for your face' Microcurrent facials rely on low-level electrical currents, typically between 100 and 400 microamps, to stimulate facial muscles and skin cells. “It’s like a gym workout for your face,” says Dr Aparna Santhanam, a Mumbai-based dermatologist. The primary mechanism is boosting ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production, which is crucial for cellular energy. This uptick in ATP triggers several benefits, according to Dr Santhanam. 
Enhanced muscle tone and facial contours
Stimulated collagen and elastin production
Improved circulation and lymphatic drainage
Accelerated cellular repair
 Now, this leads to various ‘potential benefits’, according to Dr Kohli, like: Immediate effects
Lifted and firmer facial features
Reduced puffiness
Enhanced skin radiance
Long-term benefits
Gradual improvement in muscle tone
Better skin texture and firmness
Delay in the appearance of fine lines
Improved absorption of skincare products
 Dr Sidharth Sonthalia, dermatologist at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Gurugram, adds, “Microcurrent facials help by stimulating the tone of facial muscles and promoting production of collagen and elastin proteins in deeper layers. Additionally, the device boosts blood circulation and enhances penetration of skincare products. The overall impact includes improved skin tone, reduction in fine lines, and a lifted or sculpted youthful appearance.”Is it worth the hype? India Today spoke to various experts, and even though experts agreed there can be some benefits that we have mentioned above, they are short-lived.  For instance, Dr Santhanam says, “Microcurrent facials are not a gimmick, but their efficacy depends on realistic expectations and proper technique.” She mentions that it works well as a preventative or maintenance tool for light wrinkles. Dr Saurabh Shah, senior clinical and cosmetic dermatologist and dermatosurgeon, however, doesn’t agree. He says that although quite sought after, these facials are not an absolutely established and reliable treatment to address skin aging.

 “It's effects are uncertain, inconsistent, unreliable, and, most importantly, short-lived compared to its other counterparts like - RF (Radiofrequency) and HIFU (High intensity focused ultrasound), which are more consistent and definitive modes of treatments,” Dr Shah adds.  Dr Shah, however, says that microcurrent facials offer to be a relatively cheaper, safer and non-invasive option.At-home vs professional treatments Dr Santhanam highlights key differences:
Professional treatments: Use medical-grade devices for deeper penetration and visible results.
At-home devices: Great for maintenance but less effective due to lower intensity.
 Dr Sonthalia adds, “At-home devices can complement professional treatments, offering maintenance between sessions. However, professional facials use advanced equipment with precise settings tailored to individual needs, often delivering superior results compared to consumer-grade devices.” Now, if you’re going for professional treatment, experts suggest getting these facials in three phases: 
Initial phase: 1-2 sessions per week for 6-8 weeks.
Maintenance phase: Once every 4-6 weeks to maintain results.
Combination therapy: Pair with RF skin tightening or hydrafacials for enhanced outcomes.
 According to Dr Sonthalia, “Initially, 6-12 sessions spaced weekly or bi-weekly, conducted by a dermatologist, are recommended for optimal results. Once the desired result is achieved, maintenance sessions can be done every 4–6 weeks, at a clinic or home, depending on individual skin goals and aging concerns.”Side effects While generally safe, microcurrent facials aren’t entirely risk-free. Some potential side effects include:
Mild redness or irritation: Usually temporary and resolves quickly.
Metallic taste: Rare and fleeting, caused by electrical stimulation.
Contraindications: Not suitable for individuals with pacemakers, epilepsy, or certain skin conditions.
 Dr Kohli mentions, “The key to success lies in understanding that this is not a quick fix but rather a long-term investment in skin health and facial muscle tone.” advertisementThe last session Microcurrent facials are the perfect blend of science and skincare, offering a gentle, non-invasive route to a snatched, youthful visage, but their effects are short-lived like any other facials.

 Microcurrent facials are the perfect blend of science and skincare, offering a gentle, non-invasive route to a snatched, youthful visage, but their effects are short-lived like any other facials.

Don’t want to spend a fortune on an assemblage of heavy bridal outfits? You can rent them! Worried about storing a bulky lehenga after the wedding, knowing you’ll rarely wear it again? Renting is the answer! Always wanted to become a Sabyasachi bride but the budget doesn’t allow it? Check out a reputed rental store, and you can get it from there at a fraction of the price. From designer replicas to authentic couture creations, you can rent the bridal outfit of your dreams with the convenience of free delivery and pick-up—especially if you’re in a tier-1 city. There are physical stores and online portals providing wedding rental services all across the country. Players like Flyrobe, Rent a Closet, and Kuro India, along with a plethora of physical rental stores, have given ‘renting’ an acceptance facelift and made it easily accessible. “The wedding clothing rental market in India is growing rapidly, thanks to evolving mindsets and a greater emphasis on sustainability. Brides are increasingly open to renting their wedding outfits, recognising the practicality of wearing exquisite designer lehengas at a fraction of the purchase cost,” Aanchal Saini, CEO of Flyrobe, tells India Today.

Experts say India is adapting well to the wedding rental trend, especially among millennials and Gen Z, who are more open to alternative ownership models. The shift is further normalised by the influence of social media and influencers.While Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru have been early adopters of the rental trend, Jaipur, Ludhiana, and Hyderabad are also quickly catching up. Experts say India is adapting well to the wedding rental trend, especially among millennials and Gen Z, who are more open to alternative ownership models. The shift is further normalised by the influence of social media and influencers. While Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru have been early adopters of the rental trend, Jaipur, Ludhiana, and Hyderabad are also quickly catching up. “Interestingly, smaller cities like Raipur have shown an exceptionally positive response. These cities combine a strong appetite for lavish weddings with a growing awareness of sustainable and cost-effective options, making them ideal markets for rentals,” shares Saini. Celebrity weddings also have a role to play, inspiring many couples to take their celebrations to picturesque locations like Udaipur, Goa, and Kerala. These cities also see high demand for rentals. “Renting allows couples to recreate similar grandeur (at destination weddings) while maintaining financial and environmental sustainability,” says Saini. Celebrity fashion stylist and costume designer Divyak D’Souza thinks of renting as an excellent money-saving option. “Couture, particularly bridal couture, is notoriously expensive, so opting to rent instead of purchase can significantly cut costs. Beyond the financial savings, renting can be seen as a sustainable choice, especially for garments typically worn only once. It also eliminates the need for long-term maintenance, storage, and regular dry cleaning that comes with owning such attire,” Divyak D’Souza tells India Today.

What's stop Indian brides Practical, sustainable, and hassle-free, renting a wedding lehenga seems perfect in theory. Yet, it remains far from becoming a mainstream choice among Indian brides. For instance, when Bhavya Arora, a Delhi-based marketing professional, suggested renting a designer lehenga for her wedding celebrations, she was met with raised eyebrows from both her family and in-laws. The recent years have witnessed a rise in pre-loved luxury fashion in India, yet renting is still looked down upon by many—especially when it is for a sacred event like a wedding.

 Daisy (name changed on request), on the other hand, found it challenging to come across good designs. Additionally, no scope for personalisation—a huge wedding fashion trend—was another turn-off for her. Delhi-based journalist Tiasa, however, could not find any decent options in her hometown, Siliguri. The hassle of carrying a rented lehenga from Delhi to her hometown and then eventually returning it within a limited time period meant significant logistical challenges. “Somewhere along the line, the thought of people talking behind my back about my decision to rent instead of buy also crossed my mind. People my age and those who are digitally literate might understand, but elders often don’t,” she says. An Indian bride’s wedding outfit carries not only the weight of craftsmanship but also deep emotions. The ‘suhaag ka joda’ holds immense emotional significance, another reason why brides refrain from renting the wedding lehenga. “For our brides, spending on wedding clothes is an investment of their feelings and emotions, like the wedding itself. There is no way a bride is going to compromise on the vision she has for herself. What a bride wears on her wedding day is extremely important and is of high sentimental value to the bride,” says Nisha Kundnani of Bridelan, a luxury wedding stylist and personal shopper. “Just until five years ago, not even 1 per cent of the customers of Indian designers would spend on a 10 or 15 lakh lehenga. That range is now an average and very well-accepted range of Indian designers. The average spend on a wedding lehenga has also become this high because of the desirability and aspirational value, simply because the demand is so high that it is also creating counter parallels such as rentals and other ways of acquisition,” explains Nisha Kundnani, who closely works with Indian brides all over the world to curate their wedding looks.advertisementRenting - A popular choice among wedding guestsCurrently, outfit rentals are a big hit among wedding guests, including bridesmaids, the groom's sisters, and the bride's mother. For many, buying a new outfit or getting one stitched for every family or friend’s wedding is not feasible. Those with a strong penchant for fashion often rush to designer rental stores to find outfits that make them look stunning without burning a hole in their pockets. Additionally, novelty is also maintained in the Instagram grids—for those who still detest repeating outfits.“Renting wedding outfits doesn't yet appear to be a major choice among brides and grooms, especially in India, where weddings are deeply emotional and culturally significant events. However, rental fashion is gaining traction among wedding guests and family members who may attend multiple events and prefer a cost-effective and practical wardrobe solution,” says Divyak.advertisementPioneers in the rental business believe it will take time for brides to embrace outfit rentals for their big day.“Think of international travel—it used to be a big deal a decade ago, and now it’s just another getaway.

We love everything extra. From the way we travel to what we eat, there’s an extra layer of luxury and novelty that we have started enjoying, and the viral kunafa chocolates straight from Dubai speak to our penchant for all things luxe. Kunafa chocolates, inspired by the beloved Middle Eastern dessert, have become the unexpected culinary star of 2024. Combining the gooey richness of pistachio praline with the crisp texture of kataifi pastry, these indulgent treats have captivated taste buds and Instagram feeds worldwide.

 What started as a niche product in Dubai has transformed into a global phenomenon, with international brands jumping on the bandwagon and crafting their own versions.The curious journey of kunafa chocolates While kunafa is a traditional dessert of the Middle East, its journey in the form of chocolate began in Dubai, where a luxury chocolate brand combined the textures of crispy kunafa and creamy fillings to create something entirely new. In 2021, Sarah Hamouda founded Fix Dessert Chocolatier, offering a selection of chocolate treats and pastries that instantly struck a chord with buyers. Today, it has become what you could call a global phenomenon. While her brand boasts numerous flavours, like Fudge Brownies with Crunchy Cereal, Crunchy Lotus Cheesecake, and many more, it is the kunafa chocolate bar that has gained popularity across dimensions.

The contrast between the crunchy kunafa strands and the creamy pistachio filling added with a bite of chocolate created a texture and flavour combination that quickly became irresistible to food enthusiasts and influencers alike. The contrast between the crunchy kunafa strands and the creamy pistachio filling added with a bite of chocolate created a texture and flavour combination that quickly became irresistible to food enthusiasts and influencers alike. Social media played a pivotal role in amplifying the buzz. Food bloggers and dessert lovers from around the world were drawn to their novelty, fuelling demand far beyond Dubai’s borders. According to Vikas Temani, founder of Paul and Mike Chocolates, the visual storytelling on social media was key. “People couldn’t resist sharing videos of them enjoying a concoction of product that looked as good as it tasted.”

 Chef Varun Inamdar agrees. “The speed and scale at which it exploded on social media were surprising. It’s a testament to how powerful visual storytelling and digital platforms are in shaping food trends today: good, bad, ugly all debatable in the same breath.” But, there was a catch. While the chocolate drew a lot of attention worldwide, getting your hands on one was a challenge. Initially, Fix Dessert Chocolatier was available only in Dubai, with limited slots to place an order. People with access to Dubai purchased the chocolates themselves or relied on relatives or friends visiting the Middle Eastern city to bring them back. Yet, the demand surpassed the supply. That’s when people came up with the idea of creating their own versions of the viral chocolate, eager to taste or replicate something close to the original bar. That’s how quickly it caught on - so much so that many saw it as a brilliant business opportunity and have been milking the trend brilliantly.

Global reinterpretations and brand innovations A post shared by @nehadeepakshah

 It is very rare that Lindt, a royalty in the world of chocolate making, would want to replicate or go out of the way from traditional chocolate making to just milk a trend. But they did, most probably because they saw potential. A spokesperson of Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprungli tells India Today, “Our Lindt Maitre Chocolatiers always keep a close eye on current trends and accordingly became aware of the Dubai chocolate recipe trend on social media. The Lindt Maitres Chocolatiers then picked up on this taste trend and developed their own recipe.”

 



Lindt launched its Dubai chocolates last month. (Photo: Facebook)
 Lindt launched its limited-edition Dubai-inspired pistachio chocolate bar on November 9, 2024. The chocolate bar was released in select shops in Germany, with only 1,000 bars available. The launch was treated like a luxury product launch, with numbered tickets, taste-testing samples, and limited access. Regarding Lindt’s this strategic move, Vikas Temani says, “Lindt, and other brands, are likely doing this to expand into non-traditional markets. Europe, the US, Japan, and Australia have been strongholds for premium chocolates, but they’re now looking to tap into markets like India, where there’s a rich dessert culture. By reinterpreting global desserts into chocolate form, they’re making their products more relatable and accessible to these new audiences. We’ll likely see more of this trend in the future.” In India, Temani’s Paul and Mike has taken the onus of introducing all Indians to the taste of this viral Turkish dessert. “We are trying to ensure it’s a high-quality product with properly roasted pistachios and a great balance of flavours. The combination of a crispy, crunchy texture with melting chocolate creates an unforgettable mouthfeel that people crave after just one bite. That addictive experience definitely plays a part in the trend’s popularity. Also, the social media frenzy creates a sense of FOMO, which only drives the demand further,” says Temani.

 And then, there are other Indian craft chocolatiers who are reinterpreting this dessert with an Indian twist, Chitram Craft Chocolates being one of them. For Dr Arun Viswanathan of Chitram Craft Chocolates, kunafa is reminiscent of an Indian dessert, and he is working on a localised version called “Dubai Return Chocolate,” which will include South Indian textures and Middle Eastern flavours too. “We’re reinterpreting kunafa with a base made of nool peni, a traditional vermicelli dessert, and incorporating saffron and rose for a unique Indian identity,” Viswanathan shares. They might launch their ""Dubai Return Chocolate"" sometime in January. Ashmeet Singh Dua, founder of Xocolatl in Hyderabad, recalls how he was inspired by the growing popularity of kunafa in India. “Kunafa had already become a hit here, almost rivalling traditional favourites like khubani ka meetha,” Dua shares. Recognising an opportunity, he crafted a version of kunafa chocolate that incorporated pistachio paste and kataifi pastry sourced directly from abroad. “When we launched in September, our social media reel went viral,” Dua explains. “The combination of textures was unlike anything people had tasted before. Bloggers shared it, and we were flooded with inquiries. That’s when we knew we had a winner.”

 He mentions that since its launch in September, Xocolatl has sold several thousand kunafa chocolate bars. Smoor, a Bengaluru-based chocolate brand, is also set to launch its chocolate bar inspired by the viral dessert during Valentine’s Day.The future The success of this Middle Eastern-inspired treat has opened doors for more cross-cultural dessert innovations but Chef Varun Inamdar, is somewhat skeptical about the trend’s longevity. “It’s the Dalgona coffee of 2024,” he quips. “While it’s visually stunning and delicious, I don’t see it becoming a permanent fixture in the culinary world.” However, Vikas Temani predicts, “While it might not stay at its current high, it will still find takers in the long run. People may not have it frequently, but they’ll seek it out occasionally. This isn’t just a flash-in-the-pan trend; it’s becoming a category of its own. Look at brands like Lindt—they’ve started investing heavily in this space. That kind of commitment shows they see potential in this trend for the long term.”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 28, 2024

Instead, it’s an accurate description of the latest talking point in the Indian alco-beverage industry: non-alcoholic spirits. Also known as zero-proof spirits, non-alcoholic alcohol is crafted to replicate the taste of traditional spirits but without the alcohol. These zero-proof drinks are not like your other non-alcoholic beverages such as ginger ale, soda, or mocktails. “Unlike mixers or soft drinks like ginger ale or soda, they are made using advanced techniques like distillation, infusion of botanicals, and careful layering of flavours to offer a sophisticated drinking experience,” Ruchi Nagrecha of non-alcoholic cocktail brand Sobriety Sips tells India Today.The growing trend of non-alcoholic spirits Non-alcoholic beers have been around for a long time, with several offerings from Indian brands as well. However, the trend has now expanded to include non-alcoholic gins, vodkas, rums, and cocktails. Several homegrown brands like Sober, Sobriety Sips, and Catwalk Botanics are at the forefront of this new trend in India. These drinks not only taste like traditional spirits but are also super-low on calories and, of course, don’t come with the notorious health side-effects and hangovers that alcohol is associated with.Gen Z and the 'sober curious' movement At the core of this trend is the rise of wellness-oriented thinking and the subsequent shift towards mindful drinking. Gen Z’s ‘sober curious’ movement—a trend encouraging people to explore their relationship with alcohol and reduce or avoid it—has also created space for zero-proof spirits.

 



Non-alcoholic gin and pink gin by Sober.
 According to Statista, Gen Z is significantly spending less on alcoholic beverages than previous generations. While Boomers, Gen X, and Millennials spent between USD 23 to USD 25 billion on alcohol in 2022, Gen Z’s spending amounted to just USD 3 billion.Filling in a lot of blanks Non-alcoholic spirits are emerging as a niche product category that can fill many gaps. For example, many bars and restaurants often neglect to make their mocktail menus exciting, limiting them to sugary mojitos, juices, blue lagoons, or lemon sodas. Zero-proof cocktails, however, provide non-drinkers with more interesting options. Popular hangout spots like The Pit and Monkey Bar in Delhi now have zero-proof cocktails on their menu. “This is a relatively new trend in India, gaining momentum over the past few years as post-Covid health consciousness and wellness trends have grown. Globally, the zero-proof movement started earlier, and now Indian consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, are embracing it. Factors such as health awareness, the need for inclusivity in social settings, and a cultural shift towards mindful alcohol consumption are driving the rise of non-alcoholic cocktails,” says Ruchi Nagrecha. For Ishan Arora, founder of Catwalk Botanics, launched in 2024, his brand was a result of seeking sobriety for himself.

 



Zero-proof spirit offerings by Catwalk Botanics.
 “Our customers are not chasing a high. They are already convinced that they want to quit, want to cut down,” Arora tells India Today. He further believes that these non-alcoholic spirits and even Gen Z’s sober curious movement come from a place of wellness and self-care. “Gen Zs are a generation who have grown up in alcohol-friendly families. According to the people of this age I have spoken to, they don’t want to replicate what happens thereafter (alcohol consumption),” he says. For Vansh Pahuja, founder of Sober, it was these small gaps that inspired him to introduce Sober—a house of non-alcoholic spirits. “It was a series of events in my life. After Covid, my father was advised to quit drinking, but he missed his regular ritual of coming home from work and sipping whisky while watching television. He didn’t want to replace it with coffee or lemon water, and there weren’t many alternatives. Similarly, when a close friend got pregnant, I realised she wouldn’t be drinking alcohol for a while, and I saw a huge potential market,” Vansh Pahuja tells us. He says his target market isn’t teetotalers but people who drink and are looking to reduce their alcohol consumption—such as those who are driving, parenting, observing religious practices, drinking moderately, or focused on fitness. Each brand has its recommended ways of consuming these non-alcoholic spirits, depending on the product. Mixing them with tonic water is one of the most common methods. Alternatively, zero-proof cocktails are also available, which don’t require adding mixers in specific quantities to enjoy these drinks. They are available in cans as well as bottles. Some brands, like Catwalk Botanics, are already on quick e-commerce platforms like BlinkIt.advertisementPricing and consumer curiosityThe pricing varies by brand, but a 750ml bottle of a non-alcoholic spirit typically costs around Rs 1,200. Industry insiders acknowledge that selling alcohol-free spirits at prices comparable to entry-level alcoholic beverages is not the easiest job, but there is curiosity among consumers. As a result, several brands have introduced cans and are planning to launch miniatures.These brands typically have their own online presence and sales platforms along with e-commerce platform tie-ups, but they also collaborate at events and pop-ups to boost awareness.“Our primary business comes from events, weddings, corporate parties, and pop-ups, which contribute about 70% of our sales,” shares Nagrecha.

As the name suggests, they promise to give your hair gorgeous curls—whether beachy, wavy, or highly defined—without the need for heat or harmful chemicals like hair-setting sprays. But which method is the best? And which one should you choose to achieve well-defined curls that last all day without relying on setting spray? TWe tried them out, tested them out, and documented the entire process. Before diving into the journey, here are a few things to know:
No heat was used in any of the techniques.
Almost all (except one) were overnight heatless curling methods. We recorded the process in three stages: while setting the curls, the next morning, and then again 8–9 hours later after going about our day.
This helped us assess how well the curls held up over time and determine which method offered the longest-lasting results.
We have fast-forwarded all the time-consuming bits. 
Day 1: Braiding  For the first day, we chose the simplest and most time-tested technique, (the OG) braiding. Process:
After dampening your hair, braid it as tightly as possible. Leave the braids in overnight and open them the next morning to reveal the results. Have a look at the video to see the results, and the rest of the process:
 
 Our final thoughts:
Braids work best if you don’t have a layered haircut.
While they don’t give you defined curls, the waves last almost the entire day without needing any setting spray.
Ideal for a casual, beachy, wavy look but not for high-end, well-defined curls (especially if you have a lot of layers).
Day 2: Heatless curler headband This technique has been at the centre of the heatless curls trend, dominating social media. The heatless curler headband is one of the easiest and most accessible tools, available on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. Process:
Place the headband on your head and secure it with a pin.
Damp your hair and divide it into two sections.
Braid each section tightly around the headband and secure the ends with a hairband (or else you will have to do some sections again, like us).
Leave it overnight.
 Here’s how it went:
 
 Our final thoughts:
Surprisingly easy to use, even if it looks complicated at first.
Creates neat, wavy curls with good volume.
Results last longer with a hair setting spray.
Comfortable to sleep in despite appearances.

Day 3: Foam rolling curlers Foam rolling curlers are one of the most affordable and popular options, especially among Indian influencers. Process:
Damp your hair and divide it into as many sections as possible.
Roll each section around a foam curler and bend it to lock.
Make sure you roll all your hair 
Leave it in overnight.

 Our final thoughts:

Slightly uncomfortable to sleep in.
Delivers highly defined curls that last a long time, even without heat or spray.

Process:
Start with freshly washed, damp hair.
Take small sections, roll each up with a velcro roller, and secure it with a pin.
Keep the rollers in for at least 3-4 hours.
Here’s how it went:
 
Our final thoughts:
Adds some volume but doesn’t create strong curls.
The longer you keep the rollers in, the better the volume and curl definition.
Takes some time to put it on. 
Day 5: The sock curlThis viral technique uses socks to curl hair. With so many variations online, we tried the most popular method.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/why-is-it-a-good-idea-to-skip-the-mountains-this-new-years-2657548-2024-12-31,"How do you plan to welcome the new year when the clock strikes midnight on December 31? Will you escape to the mountains to toast to New Year with a spectacular view, or perhaps enjoy a cosy evening at home or in a chic café? (And yes, spending it solo is absolutely fine too!)  But if you’re one of those adventurous ones who is planning a getaway to mark the start of 2024 and have destinations like Manali, Mussoorie, or Jammu on your mind, and live your ‘Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani’ moment, it’s worth taking a moment to rethink your plans. ‘We were stuck for 24 hours’ Payal Porwal, a 25-year-old engineer, from Delhi NCR, planned to spend a quiet week in Manali before the New Year to avoid the notorious ‘New Year rush’. However, her carefully-laid plans went awry when she found herself stuck for 24 hours during a visit to one of Manali’s iconic hotspots, Solang Valley. “We thought we’d visit Solang for just 2–3 hours and then head back, but we ended up getting stuck in the same spot,” Payal shared with India Today. While stranded, Payal considered herself fortunate to find a kind local family who offered help and allowed her group to use their washroom. “It was a relief,” she recalls. However, things took a turn for the worse when, two hours later, the traffic started to move, but chaos ensued as impatient drivers began overtaking each other in a bid to get ahead. “This caused yet another traffic jam, and we were stuck in the same area for the entire night,” she adds. Eventually, Payal and her friends decided to book a hotel in Solang Valley after the police advised against continuing their journey. The icy roads had become treacherous, with several cars stuck and unable to move further.

 



An automobile is stuck in the mountains.
 Payal’s story is far from an isolated incident. Recently, a viral video by a travel vlogger, @chluckytyagi, stuck in the snowstorm of Manali sparked widespread concern. The clip, shot in the picturesque Solang Valley, shows a grim reality: over 1,500 vehicles trapped in the snow, including the Himachal SDM’s official car, according to him.

 “People planning to visit Solang Valley, please reconsider. Over 1,500 vehicles are stuck due to heavy snow. It’s chaos here—please don’t come,” the vlogger warned, pointing to an endless line of immobilised vehicles.Stranded in the snow Payal was one of the nearly 10,000 tourists stranded in Solang Valley last Friday (December 27), when a severe snowstorm paralysed the area. Around 2,000 vehicles were trapped, with only 100 cars able to leave as many drivers were missing from the scene. The event made headlines, painting a chilling picture of the chaos.  Such harsh weather conditions often lead to tragic accidents, particularly in popular hill stations, where roads become treacherous with snow and ice.

History repeating itself India’s love for New Year getaways is a growing trend, but it’s not without its pitfalls. Last year, Himachal Pradesh witnessed massive traffic jams during the festive season, with over 55,000 tourists stranded across various regions. This year seems poised to follow the same script, perhaps even on a larger scale, with travel on the rise.Skidding and slipping The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued warnings of extreme cold and dense fog across North-West and Central India, including Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu & Kashmir. With conditions worsening by the day, foggy highways and snow-laden hill stations have already seen an uptick in accidents. Social media is flooded with videos showing vehicles skidding dangerously on icy roads. In one particularly alarming clip, even a 4x4 (passenger car) nearly succumbed to the slippery conditions.

 Meanwhile, Uttarakhand faces additional challenges, with an orange alert for avalanches recently issued by the Defence Geoinformatics Research Establishment (DGRE), a DRDO laboratory. Heavy snowfall has also blanketed high-altitude regions like Chamoli, Badrinath, Hemkund Sahib, Auli, and Gorson, with similar reports coming from Jammu. Such conditions often accelerate the chances of accidents. High prices in frosty paradise Another challenge for winter travellers is the steep rise in accommodation prices. As New Year approaches, hotel rates skyrocket, and options become limited as most major properties get fully booked. This situation worsens if you’re planning an impromptu getaway during the New Year.Tips to avoid the New Year rush in the Indian mountains Now, if you’re still planning to travel this New Year, here are some tips, shared by Panki Sood, who operates eco-friendly boutiques in from Manali: 
Remember to park ethically, as not following this might cause traffic jams. 
Avoid overcrowded places if you’re going with kids and older people. 
Stay with your own group, and not interact with other groups, as it might create a ‘nuisance’. 
Expect steep hikes in hotel rates and transportation costs during the New Year period. To avoid exorbitant charges, book your stays months in advance or opt for budget-friendly alternatives like homestays or guesthouses.
Always pack snacks and keep ready-to-eat foods in your vehicle while travelling. 
Panki also reminds us not to litter while travelling! 
 Finally, if possible, avoid the dream of spending the New Year’s in the mountains. Go ahead a day or a day later. The mountains are not calling this New Year!Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Trending Reel

Living Apart Together (LAT), a growing trend among committed and married couples in the West, refers to couples intentionally avoiding cohabitation in order to keep the spark alive. No more fights over putting the toilet seat down, leaving the towel on the bed, adjusting the AC temperature, or dealing with mismatched sleeping patterns! It’s about two individuals leading their own lives, chasing their goals, and focusing on themselves while remaining committed to each other. The decision to live in separate homes, despite being married, is not solely driven by these daily issues. Sometimes, the reasons are broader. It may stem from the need to maintain individuality or a strong belief in the importance of personal space - an idea mentioned by Lebanese-American writer Kahlil Gibran in his poem On Marriage: “But let there be spaces in your togetherness,
And let the winds of the heavens dance
between you.” In LAT couples, physical distance is a reality, but they remain romantically and emotionally committed to each other. But is that even possible? According to relationship experts and LAT couples themselves, the answer is a resounding yes. LAT certainly challenges the traditional norm which dictates that couples need to live together, but for some, it is a saviour of their bond.

 



Couples choose to live apart for a variety of reasons. Some value their solitude and personal space, finding that maintaining independence enhances their overall happiness. (Photo: Getty)
Such couples can live in the same building, the same housing society, or even in different cities—it just isn’t the same home. They mutually agree on this arrangement while keeping their time together flexible, such as setting specific days or weekends to meet at one partner’s place, go on outings, or take vacations. Unlike in a separation, these couples maintain intentional communication and stay committed.Why LAT works for some couples“This trend allows couples to maintain their bond while avoiding the conflicts that often arise from cohabitation. It can be genuinely helpful for a few people who want to preserve their individuality, reducing daily conflicts and keeping the romance alive,” says Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship expert.Couples choose to live apart for a variety of reasons. Some value their solitude and personal space, finding that maintaining independence enhances their overall happiness. For many, living apart allows them to strengthen their bond by reducing daily pressures.“Modern couples who value personal space, independence, and privacy benefit from this arrangement. It allows each person to maintain their own lifestyle while preserving their individuality,” adds Dr Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based psychologist and marriage counsellor.The idea that distance can make a heart grow fonder is a key reason why LAT works for some couples.advertisement“Being apart can help couples appreciate each other more, deepening their connection. They may realise the importance of their partner more acutely and feel a strong desire to meet and spend time together, making those moments even more special,” explains Dr Khanna.So, there is a mix of both ‘me time’ and ‘couple time’. The couple can enjoy personal space and pursue individual interests while also looking forward to spending quality time together. This way, LAT couples stay refreshed and feel eager to connect as well.

The regular bickering over daily household work and chores also takes a backseat and doesn’t hamper the relationship. It is among the major pros of Living Apart Together.“One significant advantage is that when partners don’t share a living space, the need for constant adjustments and negotiations about responsibilities, chores, or the division of labour is minimised. This reduces potential sources of conflict and relationship-related frustration. Without these daily pressures, the couple can focus on maintaining harmony and avoid unnecessary disputes,” says Dr Khanna, a marriage counsellor with over 22 years of experience.advertisementReduced daily conflicts, increased quality time, and a better work-life balance can help prevent some marriages or relationships from deteriorating. However, it is not a universal solution.Living Apart Together works well for certain types of couples, although it may not suit everyone. The suitability of an LAT arrangement largely depends on the personalities and specific needs of the individuals involved.“It suits couples who love each other but struggle with shared living dynamics,” says Ruchi Ruuh.Additionally, LAT is also beneficial for:
Couples who have jobs in different cities or demanding schedules
Couples with drastically different routines or lifestyle preferences
Couples who want to care for ageing parents or maintain the life they lived prior to marriage
People who want to avoid overstimulation due to mental health issues
Living apart together can be extremely trickyLiving Apart Together is not without its set of cons, though. Firstly, it is only relevant for the affluent. Running two households is expensive. Secondly, it can be tricky to maintain, especially when the individuals are not on the same page.advertisement“Prolonged physical separation can lead to emotional distancing too. These sporadic interactions can really affect the intimacy as a couple,” says Ruchi.“The lack of regular face-to-face interactions can result in feelings of disconnection or emotional detachment. This is especially true if one partner is introverted or relies heavily on the other for emotional support,” adds Dr Khanna.It can intensify feelings of loneliness or isolation, particularly if the individual is in an unfamiliar location without a strong social circle. Experts also say that being apart makes providing support in times of crises harder, as they might find it difficult to understand each other’s communication nuances.So, a healthy balance to maintain proximity is important as it helps keep intimacy alive and strengthens the bond. Most essentially, open communication should not take a backseat.How to be a successful LAT coupleTrust is the cornerstone of a successful LAT relationship. Without trust, living apart can lead to misunderstandings, insecurity, and instability.Prioritise spending time together, even if the quantity of time is limited.“Dedicating 45 minutes to an hour a day or 5–7 hours a week can be sufficient to maintain a healthy relationship, provided both partners are aligned on this approach,” suggests Dr Khanna.advertisementSetting boundaries while planning to live apart together is essential. Have the difficult conversations about finances, non-negotiable aspects, expectations, and how you will balance personal space and shared time.

“Both partners must have clear expectations. Deciding how often you’ll meet, what responsibilities you want to share, and maintaining communication should be an ongoing discussion so both partners stay aligned and their needs are met,” says Ruchi.Additionally, being expressive and maintaining communication is of utmost importance. Openly expressing needs, expectations, and concerns can help prevent misunderstandings and conflict. Experts say a lack of communication can trigger isolation, depression, and even temptations like infidelity.Being emotionally invested and staying connected through video calls or by regularly checking in on each other also helps.“Most importantly, don’t treat it like a free pass to avoid emotional intimacy. Regularly communicate and share meaningful moments to stay bonded,” suggests Ruchi.Ultimately, an LAT setup requires maturity, mutual understanding, and the ability to handle independence responsibly.Can the trend be a hit in India too?An increasingly popular trend in the West, Living Apart Together (LAT) is not entirely unfamiliar in India.“Historically, many couples lived apart due to work, such as men migrating to cities for jobs while women stayed back in villages,” highlights Dr Khanna, while adding that many modern couples already embrace it owing to professional or family obligations.“Many couples, especially in metro cities, already live apart due to demanding jobs, long commutes, or the necessity to support families in different locations. For instance, professionals commuting between Noida and Gurgaon often choose to live apart during the week, meeting only on weekends to save time and energy,” she says.Relationship expert Ruchi also sees progressive couples in metro cities who value individuality or face career-related separations embracing LAT.One cannot, however, rule out society’s reaction and expectations. Couples who adopt this lifestyle may face stigma in traditional settings. Cultural and societal expectations often emphasise shared living spaces, which can make LAT less socially acceptable.LAT or not, remember what Kahlil Gibran said in his poem:“Love one another, but make not a bond

What will define their journey?Children of younger millennials and older Gen Z, Gen Beta will be born into a world dominated by technology and AI.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/gen-beta-has-arrived-what-can-we-expect-from-them-2657962-2025-01-01,"When the clock struck midnight, we all welcomed the New Year with cheers and anticipation. A new year brings along fresh beginnings—be it a new look, renewed resolutions (yes, the same old ones with a sprinkle of extra hope), or new aspirations. But 2025 is particularly special because it marks the arrival of a brand-new cohort: Generation Beta, some of whom will live long enough to witness the dawn of the 22nd century. Before you scratch your head to do the maths, let us tell you, that Generation Beta includes those born between 2025 and 2039. By 2035, they are projected to make up 16 per cent of the global population, positioning themselves as a crucial demographic shaping the world’s future. But what will their traits look like, and how will they be any different from the previous generations - Gen Alpha (2013–2024), Gen Z (1997–2012), Millennials (1981–1996), Gen X (1965–1980) and Baby Boomers (1946–1964)? Let us dig into it. What traits are expected of Gen Beta? Children of younger millennials and older Gen Z, Gen Beta will be born into a world dominated by technology and AI. Experts suggest this generation will start life differently from their predecessors. Dr Arvind Otta, a senior psychologist and mental health activist, explains that Gen Beta will grow up during significant advancements in technology. They might even have AI applications powerful enough to personalise their learning and entertainment experiences. These differences may enable Gen Beta to navigate complex digital environments from a young age. Additionally, with societal perspectives on technology evolving, there could be greater emphasis on privacy and mental health concerns for this generation.

Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, agrees. She adds that learning, entertainment, and social interactions for Gen Beta will shift even further online. Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, agrees. She adds that learning, entertainment, and social interactions for Gen Beta will shift even further online. According to demographer and futurist Mark McCrindle's blog post, another defining trait of Gen Beta will be their adaptation to a world grappling with significant societal challenges. With climate change, global population shifts, and rapid urbanisation at the forefront, sustainability will not just be a preference but an expectation. Environmental challenges will shape societal values during their formative years. In essence, Gen Beta might be seen as a 2.0 version of iPad or “Shephora kids,” complete with a sprinkle of sass. However, like every generation, they’ll face their own unique set of challenges.‘Indian six-year-old thinks blue eyes and fair skin are beautiful’ Suriti Chakrabarti, a mum of a three-year-old and expecting her second child next month, reflects on how parenting has evolved. Despite enjoying a “blessed childhood” with an open relationship with her parents, she admits her approach will differ due to changing times. She anticipates a “generation gap” between her children, even though they’ll only be three years apart. One concern she expects to remain consistent is the struggle to build interpersonal relationships in an era of rapid technological evolution. “As kids, we weren’t as tech-savvy, but at least we could form meaningful relationships. That’s something I feel is developing slowly in today’s generations,” Suriti says. Dr Otta concurs, adding that while automation and AI might make life easier for Gen Beta, skills like creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence will require deliberate nurturing. These skills may not develop naturally in an AI-saturated environment.

 Riddhi also points out that Gen Beta’s reliance on AI could hinder their decision-making abilities. Virtual reality and the metaverse, which are just emerging now, will likely become commonplace for them. However, frequent immersion in virtual environments could blur the boundaries between real and virtual life, affecting their mental and emotional well-being. She recalls a troubling incident with a six-year-old patient who believed being “beautiful” meant having blue eyes and fair skin—a perception shaped by societal and technological influences. Such skewed ideals, if not addressed, could become more prevalent among Gen Beta.Kids of younger millennials and older Gen Z Growing up, many of us discreetly used landlines or mobile phones, careful not to let our parents find out. However, the dynamics of parenting are shifting, even in the Indian context, as younger generations take on this role. Sushmita Marik, a 30-year-old learning and development specialist and soon-to-be mum, shares her thoughts on parenting in this tech-driven era. She plans to embrace her child’s curiosity by addressing their questions openly and fostering communication. While her child will grow up in an age dominated by technology and social media, she intends to maintain a healthy balance and prevent over-dependence on it.

 Like Sushmita, experts like Riddhi suggest that millennial and Gen Z parents may adopt parenting styles that are radically different from their predecessors. Unlike previous generations, they value flexibility, inclusivity, and mental health awareness. Modern parents are less embarrassed to discuss emotions and mental well-being with their children. This openness fosters vulnerability and communication. These new approaches, combined with the challenges of raising tech-savvy children, will likely define parenting in the Gen Beta era.Tips for parents to raise Gen Beta kids We asked the experts to share some tips that can be followed by the soon-to-be parents. Have a look: 
Foster self-love and acceptance
With AI and social media creating unrealistic beauty and lifestyle standards, parents must instil a strong sense of self-worth in their children. Encourage them to embrace their unique qualities and prioritise inner happiness over external validation.
Balance technology and offline experiences
Gen Beta will be surrounded by AI and tech from birth, making it crucial to create a balance between screen time and real-world activities. Introduce hobbies like sports, arts, and outdoor play to nurture creativity and social interaction beyond digital spaces.
Teach digital literacy and critical thinking
Prepare children to navigate the digital world responsibly. Teach them to question online content, recognise AI biases, and differentiate between fact and fiction. Equip them with tools to handle misinformation and make informed choices.
Emphasise emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills
In a world where social interactions are increasingly virtual, parents should focus on developing their child’s emotional intelligence. Encourage open conversations, empathy, and collaboration to build meaningful human connections.
Encourage creativity and adaptability
As automation transforms jobs and lifestyles, creativity and adaptability will become vital skills. Provide opportunities for exploratory learning, problem-solving, and experimenting with new ideas to help Gen Beta thrive in a fast-changing world.
Set realistic expectations
Avoid imposing unattainable standards influenced by social media or AI-driven content. Focus on your child’s strengths and encourage gradual progress rather than perfection, helping them grow without undue pressure.
Promote family connections
Amidst the dominance of digital interactions, ensure that family bonds remain strong. Spend quality time together, involve children in family traditions, and create a support system that values human connections over virtual ones.

Focused on education and career growth, they leaned into the IT boom and startup culture. Their love for travel, gadgets, yet building interpersonal relationships (in real life, not online) and experiences reflects the optimism of growing up in a liberalised economy.

5956d457-4fd8-476f-a5b5-985d726a4800,The expensive reality of social media's never-ending trendsThe need to stay on top of every new social media trend is not just exhaustive but also draining your bank account. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/the-expensive-reality-of-instagram-facebook-tiktoks-never-ending-trends-and-reels-2658413-2025-01-02,"If there’s one thing we have understood about social media trends is that they come and go at lightning speed. While social media offers us creative inspiration and a space to connect, the relentless chase to stay relevant can take a toll on mental health. Beneath the surface of these fleeting moments lies an increasingly common sentiment: exhaustion.The pace of trends Social media trends are designed to be fast-moving. Algorithms prioritise fresh, engaging content, which means creators are constantly under pressure to churn out new material. A dance trend might dominate TikTok for a week before being replaced by a cooking hack or a quirky meme. The result? An overwhelming cycle of consumption where even the most dedicated users struggle to keep up. Dr Arvind Otta, senior psychologist and mental health activist, points out that the rapid evolution of social media trends can leave people feeling overwhelmed. “The fear of not being able to keep up steals the joy of using social media,” he says. This drive to fit into online communities often results in exhaustion and frustration. Similarly, Sumalatha Vasudeva, psychologist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, notes that the constant need to stay current creates fatigue, ultimately leading to burnout. Sanjina Bose, clinical psychologist at Lissun (an online mental health counselling therapy platform), describes this as the “algorithm versus real-life race”. “People spend endless hours doom scrolling, isolating themselves from real-world connections, and measuring self-worth through likes and followers. It’s a draining process that often leads to anxiety, depression, and imposter syndrome,” she explains.

 



Doomscrolling is the compulsive urge to scroll through negative news and social media content. (Photo: Unsplash)
The FOMO factor Fear of missing out (FOMO) has long been associated with social media, but it has intensified by the relentless pace of trends. Users not only want to be informed but also feel compelled to participate - whether it’s recreating a trending video or posting about the latest viral topic. For some, this pressure to stay relevant can lead to burnout. Not too long ago, the internet was obsessed with the viral Dubai kunafa chocolate. Everyone wanted a bite of it. Since getting your hands on one was a challenge, people came up with the idea of creating their own versions of the viral chocolate, eager to taste or replicate something close to the original kunafa chocolate bar from Dubai. That is exactly how impactful social media is today – so much so that brands saw it as a brilliant business opportunity and have been milking the trend brilliantly. Gayathri G, a freelance consultant, says, “It’s so jarring—one moment it’s touted as a miracle, the next, it’s a potential danger. This is just one of countless examples of opposing sides, each trying to scare you. It’s mentally draining, and it makes me wonder how anyone can navigate all this without feeling overwhelmed.” “For example, lately, there’s been a lot of talk about the benefits of castor oil for digestion, detoxing, and skin health, with people insisting on using cold-pressed, hexane-free oil. But then today, I came across a reel warning that castor oil contains ricin, a deadly toxin, and explaining how the seeds must be cooked to make the oil safe,” she adds.

 It is not just exhaustive, it is expensive too. Every day, influencers introduce a new line of makeup, accessories, bags, or jewellery to their followers. Now, imagine millions of influencers urging you to buy something new, follow a trend, or even travel to a new destination daily. You’re tempted, and you might even give in to the temptation, but how long can you keep doing this? It eventually becomes a significant drain on your bank account. Meneka Subramaniyam, an IT professional, shares, ""I love buying new makeup products to add to my vast collection. Initially, it was easy when options were limited, but now it’s a struggle to keep up. Imagine having products from not just India but options were limited, but now it’s a struggle to keep up. Imagine having products from not just India but also South Korea, Japan, France, the US, and Germany, all vying for your attention. We often forget to exercise restraint and fail to realise what this is doing to our minds.""Social media burnout: A growing concern Hence, the phenomenon of social media burnout is becoming increasingly common. Dr Otta explains that burnout manifests in various ways - from stress and disinterest to resentment toward social media platforms. Physical symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and disrupted sleep cycles are also prevalent. Emotionally, individuals may feel detached, inadequate, or overly conscious about their online presence.

 Vasudeva agrees, stating that burnout often stems from constant engagement and comparison. “People feel drained and inadequate, sacrificing personal well-being to maintain an ideal online image,” she says. According to Bose, signs of burnout include:
Constant self-comparison
Agitation or emotional distress related to social media
Increased screen time and poor sleep schedules
Feelings of disconnection from real-life relationships
The impact on daily life and self-esteem Social media’s impact extends beyond the digital realm, affecting daily routines, productivity, and personal relationships. “The pressure to stay relevant can disrupt daily life,” says Dr Otta. “People spend excessive time online, which erodes confidence when comparing themselves to others.” Vasudeva adds that this constant comparison lowers self-esteem and creates self-doubt, leaving people feeling they must always be ‘on’ to maintain their online persona.Gen Z: The most vulnerable generation? Younger generations, especially Gen Z, are particularly affected by trend-chasing culture. “For Gen Z, their online presence is tied to their identity,” says Dr Otta. “The pressure to keep up with what’s popular impacts their self-esteem.” Bose adds, “Being raised in the digital era makes them more vulnerable to the fear of missing out (FOMO), leading to significant mental strain.” However, Millennials are no different.Practical steps to break free from trend-chasing Experts agree that breaking the cycle of trend-chasing requires mindful changes in social media habits. Here’s their advice: Set boundaries: Limit screen time or schedule specific periods to check social media. Apps that track usage can help. Curate your feed: Follow accounts that inspire and align with your values. Unfollow those that induce stress or comparison. Focus on authenticity: Post content that reflects your genuine interests rather than chasing trends. Engage in offline activities: Rediscover hobbies, nurture personal relationships, and spend time in nature to regain balance. Practice mindfulness: Reflect on your motives for posting and consider whether it’s for self-expression or external validation. Try a gradual detox: Begin with short social media breaks and extend them gradually to ease the transition. Ask yourself a few questions: When tempted to make an impulsive purchase after seeing a viral trend, pause and reflect: Do I really need this?
How often will I use it?
Can I repurpose it in 3–4 different ways?
If you can confidently answer ""yes"" to all these questions, go ahead and buy it! Otherwise, it’s best to let it pass.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 2, 2025

“Now we will have 100 people in flight screaming on WhatsApp calls. Congratulations.” These were some of the reactions on the social media platform X following Air India's announcement of in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity on domestic routes. 2025 began with exciting news for travel enthusiasts as Air India introduced complimentary internet access for passengers on select aircraft, including the Airbus A350, Boeing 787-9, and certain Airbus A321neo models. With this move, Air India became the first carrier in the country to offer in-flight Wi-Fi on domestic routes. “Connectivity is now an integral part of modern travel. For some, it is about the convenience and comfort of real-time sharing, while for others, it is about greater productivity and efficiency,” says Rajesh Dogra, Chief Customer Experience Officer, Air India.

 



On January 1, Air India introduced complimentary internet access for passengers on select aircraft.
 Accessible on Wi-Fi-enabled devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones with iOS or Android operating systems, the in-flight Wi-Fi will also allow passengers to connect multiple devices simultaneously while cruising above 10,000 feet. So, basically, you can stay active on social media, stay connected with loved ones, continue texting, take WhatsApp calls, browse the internet, or even attend live online masterclasses—all while on the flight. It will also be a great help for anxious flyers by enabling connectivity. Quite the mile-high luxury? Perhaps. But it's undeniable that the unavailability of internet on flights came with its own perks—like being blissfully away from work emails and free from the boss's calls. With access to in-flight Wi-Fi on some Air India flights now, here are a few things you might miss doing:Being away from work “I will be unavailable for a few hours since I am on a flight” will no longer be a valid excuse to step away from work. Your laptop and mobile will keep buzzing with emails, texts, and work-related calls—and with in-flight Wi-Fi now available, you may feel obligated to respond to them. On the contrary, some working professionals may find this beneficial, as those hours will no longer be wasted due to the inability to work while on a flight.Gazing out of the window Eyes can stay glued to the screen even in the air! After all, you will have so much to do on your Wi-Fi enabled gadgets. Who is going to have time to peek out of the window and gaze at the vast ocean of clouds or the breathtaking landscapes below?Reading Picking up a book for a flight has long been a ritual for many regular flyers. Reading on the go is one of the best ways to stay occupied during a flight, after all! But now, books may take a backseat. When given the choice between reading a book and doomscrolling, we all know which one most people would choose (or, end up doing).Enjoying ‘me’ time With no connection to the outside world or social media, those hours on a flight became the perfect opportunity to introspect and reflect on various aspects of life. To sit with your thoughts and not indulge in any distraction can be therapeutic (not on a long-haul flight, though).   Napping without notifications Flights used to be ideal for catching up on sleep without interruptions. Now, notifications are bound to disrupt that peace! Additionally, there will likely be passengers speaking loudly on WhatsApp calls, making it even harder to enjoy a restful nap.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Tune InALSO READ |  Wi-Fi access on flights no longer linked to altitude, now subject to permissionMust Watch

Many people find it convenient to save and reuse these containers over and over again. Recently, however, a debate has sparked online about whether these containers are safe to use at all. The concern stems from the fact that these containers are made from ‘black plastic’, a material that is more prevalent in our daily lives than you might realise. The conversation gained traction after a viral Instagram video, where an influencer advised against using or reusing black plastic containers for storing or reheating food in a microwave. Have a look at the video:

What is actually black plastic?
Black plastic is a type of plastic used to make everyday items like food trays, containers, and utensils. It’s often made from recycled materials, including old electronics, and contains chemicals to make it flame-resistant. 
These chemicals, like decaBDE, are not locked into the plastic and can sneak into your food, especially if it’s hot, fatty, or acidic. 
Imagine reheating leftovers in a black plastic container—the heat could trigger these chemicals to leach out, posing risks to your health. 
That’s why experts recommend being cautious when using black plastic in your kitchen. ButCan black plastic give you cancer? In a recent study published in the scientific journal of Chemosphere 203 black plastic consumer products were analysed. It found toxic flame-retardant chemicals in 85 per cent of these products.

 That’s why experts recommend being cautious when using black plastic in your kitchen. ButCan black plastic give you cancer?  In a recent study published in the scientific journal of Chemosphere 203 black plastic consumer products were analysed. It found toxic flame-retardant chemicals in 85 per cent of these products. Experts also cautioned against the use of black plastic as much as possible. For instance, according to Dr Aravind Badiger, technical director at BDR Pharmaceuticals, black plastic utensils and containers are associated with cancer risks due to their content of toxic flame retardants. These chemicals are known to migrate into food, causing harm over time. “DecaBDE and similar compounds are ‘suspected carcinogens and endocrine disruptors’, which can interfere with hormonal systems and potentially lead to cancer,” he says.

 Dr Sachin Trivedi, the director of medical oncology at HCG Cancer Center, agrees and adds that black plastic often contains substances like bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which are linked to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and reproductive issues. Prof Chintamani, chairman of the Department of Surgical Oncology, Sir Gangaram Hospital, further points out that microplastics from the black plastic often ingested through everyday items like tea bags and bottled water, add to the cumulative toxic load in the body.  However, all three experts that India Today spoke to shared that while there is no conclusive evidence linking black plastic to cancer, but they suggest that hormonal disruptions caused by plastic chemicals could contribute to cancer risks.   “While there isn’t definitive evidence directly linking black plastic to cancer, its chemical composition poses enough risks to warrant caution,” Dr Trivedi says.Other side effects of black plastics  Endocrine disruption Studies have shown that chemicals in black plastic, such as BPA and phthalates, disrupt the endocrine system, leading to potential reproductive health issues, obesity, and diabetes. Developmental and neurological effects Research indicates that exposure to certain additives in black plastic can result in developmental delays and reduced IQ in children, along with other neurological disorders.

 Environmental impact Dr Trivedi emphasises the environmental consequences of black plastic. It is difficult to recycle and often ends up in landfills or incinerators, releasing toxic substances like dioxins and furans into the air. These are known carcinogens and can harm human health when inhaled over time. Microplastic contamination Microplastics from black plastic find their way into food, water, and air, causing inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular damage in the human body. Their long-term health impacts are still under study but are a growing concern.Should you not use black plastic? Experts unanimously recommend avoiding black plastic for food storage and preparation. Dr Badiger advises using safer, free-from-harmful-chemicals materials like glass or stainless steel. Similarly, replacing black kitchen utensils with wooden or stainless-steel options can significantly reduce exposure to toxic substances. Moreover, heating food in black plastic, whether in a microwave or otherwise, should be avoided. As Chintamani explains, heating can cause toxic chemicals to leach into food, posing health risks. If you’re just using it repeatedly for storing food, it could lead to long-term exposure to harmful substances, contributing to health risks over time. So, always opt for microwave-safe containers made from safer materials, as mentioned above. Bottomline While the direct link between black plastics and cancer is still under research, the potential risks associated with their chemical composition and environmental impact are substantial. Opting for safer alternatives and avoiding heating food in black plastic are prudent steps to protect your health.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

Not biscuits, rusks for sureHealth experts warn that many popular tea-time snack choices in Indian households are unhealthy and should be avoided for daily consumption. If your morning tea ritual also feels incomplete without dipping biscuits or rusks, it might be time to rethink your snack choices.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/food/story/healthy-tea-snacks-not-biscuits-rusks-2659861-2025-01-05,"Chai, in India, is an emotion. During winters, this emotion only intensifies, becoming the perfect antidote to the biting cold. For many, it is the first thing they relish in the morning. For others, it is also an essential breakfast companion, a post-lunch indulgence, an evening beverage, and even a post-dinner treat. As soul-soothing as the daily chai sessions feel, they often come with a hefty calorie load. But the chai is not to be solely blamed here—the real culprits are the snacks we tend to indulge in alongside those cups of tea. Health experts, however, warn that many popular tea-time snack choices in Indian households are unhealthy and should be avoided for daily consumption. If your morning tea ritual also feels incomplete without dipping biscuits or rusks, it might be time to rethink your snack choices.

 Moreover, a new survey suggests that Indians have been spending more on processed foods, refreshments, and beverages than on fruits and vegetables every month. This increased consumption of processed foods and sugary beverages is linked to a rise in diseases like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular issues in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in May 2024, also stated that 56.4 per cent of India's total disease burden is linked to unhealthy diets. A lot of the common tea snacks are high in calories and contain fewer essential nutrients, leading to health issues. “Chai is often paired with snacks in Indian culture, but the usual snacks such as biscuits, rusks, aloo bhujia, samosas, and kachoris are not healthy. They are high in refined flour, sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which may cause weight gain, high cholesterol, and diabetes if taken daily,” says Dr Neeti Sharma, Head, Nutritionist and Dietetics, Marengo Asia Hospitals Gurugram. “Nankhatai, biscuits, and rusks should be avoided as they are made with refined flour and unreliable oil quality. Similarly, fried snacks like aloo bhujia, namkeen, samosas, kachoris, and pakoras are harmful. They raise bad cholesterol, increase triglycerides, and pose a risk of coronary heart disease. These snacks lack nutritional value, providing only saturated fats and carbohydrates,” adds Reena Poptani, Clinical Dietitian and Diabetes Educator. Some of the tea snacks you should avoid on a regular basis include:

 Fried foods

Samosas and pakoras due to high calories, fat, and sodium content.



 Refined sugar treats

Store-bought cookies, biscuits, and rusks made with added sugar, unhealthy fats, and empty calories.



 Processed snacks

Chips and other processed foods high in unhealthy fats, sodium, and added sugars.

 “Deep-fried snacks can be enjoyed in moderation, limited to 1-2 times a week in small quantities, but they should not be consumed regularly. Biscuits and rusks made with whole wheat should also be restricted to 1-2 pieces per day,” suggests Dr Sharma. Many packaged products now come with enticing labels like ""50% less oil,"" ""healthier,"" or ""made with the goodness of oats."" However, it’s important to read the ingredients and labels carefully to understand what you're actually consuming.What to have instead? There are ample healthier options to replace your regular stack of biscuits, chips, packaged namkeen, and dry cakes. Health experts recommend roasted makhanas, seed mixes, and roasted black chana as healthy tea-time snack options. “Healthy alternatives also include baked or air-popped snacks, roasted chickpeas, popcorn, or makhanas. You can also opt for whole wheat crackers, biscuits, or cookies made at home with ingredients like quinoa or ragi,” says Simrat Kathuria, CEO and head dietitian at The Diet Xperts, Ludhiana. Experts also suggest khakra, bajra puff, jowar puff, puffed rice bhel with chutney and veggies, roasted peas, sprouts chaat, boiled corn chaat, chickpea salad, methi thepla, roasted sweet potato, baked samosa with vegetable filling, poha, murmura chivda, multigrain crackers, homemade dhokla, and whole-grain crackers to go with your cup of chai. However, moderation is key when it comes to snacking, even with nutritious foods. Overconsumption of any food, no matter how healthy, can disrupt the balance of your diet and lead to issues such as excessive calorie intake, weight gain, or nutrient imbalances.Love chai? A few things to remember
Limit tea intake to 1–2 cups per day if sugar and cream are added. Without sugar, 2–3 cups are acceptable.
 “Tea is acidic and contains caffeine, which can be harsh on an empty stomach,” says Simrat Kathuria. So, pair it with nutrient-dense snacks, especially in the morning. Avoid using tea as a hunger suppressant. Instead, enjoy it as a mindful addition to your diet. Having your chai without a healthy snack, by the way, is not a good idea. “Milk tea should not be consumed alone, as it is more likely to cause acidity or bloating due to its caffeine and tannins, which can lead to discomfort. To avoid this, a small and healthy snack can be served alongside,” says Dr Sharma.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 5, 2025ALSO READ |  The Problem in Your Plate: Why an Indian home-cooked meal is not always healthyTrending Reel

But of course, this isn’t something anyone would want to boast about in public because, agree with us or not, it is kind of unhygienic, to say the least. However, there might be some good news for those who detest the idea of a shower during winter months. You might even want to share it with your friends without them looking down on you. At least, that’s what a viral Instagram video claims.A viral video’s startling claim A video shared by Dr Rebecca Pinto suggests that not having a bath in winter is not that bad after all because, apparently, it increases your life expectancy by 34 per cent.

 The video, while seemingly too good to be true, has racked up an impressive 6.6 million views on Instagram. However, not everyone was on board with its claims. Many social media users were quick to express their skepticism. “Is there any research article on this? If yes, you should have shared it before making such a bold claim,” one user remarked in the comments section.
 



 


While the claim is astounding, the expert cites no journal or research paper in her video which talks about the claim.So, it was only right to do what we do best: dig deeper to find out if there’s any truth to these claims.What other experts say While the claim is astounding, the expert cites no journal or research paper in her video which talks about the claim. So, it was only right to do what we do best: dig deeper to find out if there’s any truth to these claims.What other experts say While experts agree that bathing frequently can do your skin microbiome some harm, but skipping bath altogether in winter could be detrimental. Dr Balakrishna G K, HOD and senior consultant internal medicine, Gleneagles BGS Hospital Kengeri, Bengaluru, says, “The claim that skipping baths can increase life expectancy by 34 per cent seems exaggerated and lacks strong scientific backing. While frequent baths can disrupt the skin's microbiome and natural defences, entirely skipping baths may lead to hygiene concerns and infections.” Yes, temperature and exposure to cold significantly impact the body, and this holds true for various species. Research indicates that colder temperatures can reduce metabolic rates in some species, but to say that it actually happens for humans doesn’t hold any strong proof.

 Dr H Guru Prasad, associate clinical director and HOD, department of general medicine, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, adds, “Though the claim is alluring, but scrutinising research methodology and context before conclusions is key (if there's one at all). Bathing habits may indirectly connect to skin health preservation or hot water damage reduction but longevity relies on an intricate interplay of genes, lifestyle, and surroundings, making bathing alone unlikely to significantly impact longevity.”In fact, bathing is important, even in winters While we’re conditioned to think daily bathing is essential, hygiene standards vary widely across cultures. In colder climates, it’s not uncommon for people to bathe just a few times a week. However, you should be able to strike a balance as bathing has its benefits too.
Warm baths can improve blood flow and relaxation, indirectly aiding digestion.
 “Skipping bath occasionally likely causes minimal digestive effects, but consistent lack of bathing risks stress negatively impacting digestion,” says Dr Prasad.

Well, obviously, there’s truth to these claims, but does that mean hot shower enthusiasts are unknowingly harming their bodies?“Both cold and hot baths have their benefits and drawbacks. Cold baths can improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and boost energy levels, while hot baths are relaxing and can soothe muscle aches. However, in winter, lukewarm water is ideal as it helps clean the skin without stripping away too much of its natural moisture, unlike excessively hot water, which can exacerbate dryness,” explains Dr Balakrishna G K.The hygiene concernsWhile indulging in a bit of winter laziness is totally fine, you can’t ignore hygiene.

Held in Beverly Hills, California, on January 5, the Golden Globes set the fashion tone for the year as a parade of stars sashayed down the red carpet in their sartorial best. Among the celebrities in attendance were Zendaya, Demi Moore, Selena Gomez, Angelina Jolie, Mindy Kaling, Emma Stone, and Nicole Kidman, turning the 2025 Globes into a truly fashion-forward event. 2025 is going to be the year of unabashed maximalism – that’s what the red carpet scenario suggested. The trend emerges after ‘quiet luxury’ and ‘minimal fabulousness’ ruled the fashion game in the past few years. Billowing silhouettes, opera gloves, ogle-worthy jewellery pieces, sequin galore, voluminous hairstyles  and roaring red were the top trends at the Golden Globes. India also witnessed noteworthy fashion moments with Lilly Singh rocking a Gaurav Gupta creation, and Best Director nominee Payal Kapadia slaying it in a crisp black silk jumpsuit with brocade accents. Designer Manish Malhotra also made his debut in a self-designed monochrome tuxedo with a bejewelled lapel.

Several celebrities took inspiration from the event’s name, with a dazzling array of golden gowns dominating the red carpet on this glamorous night. Subtle, blingtastic, shimmering satin or swathed in sequin, all sorts golden creations were flaunted at The Globes. Mindy Kaling embraced maximalism in an Ashi Studio strapless golden gown adorned with sparkling silver stones. Kristen Bell’s pick for the night was also an Ashi Studio creation in rose gold – a sequinned bustier and skirt set.

 Demi Moore won big at The Globes this year – not only by bagging an award for her performance in ‘The Substance’ but also with her fashion choice. She looked gorgeous in a sculptural gleaming gown in champagne gold by Armani Prive. The crystal embellishments, must we add, further upped the glam quotient!

Sequin is still very much in Say what you will, but sequins are not going anywhere anytime soon! Year after year, sequin supremacy continues to reign. From Lilly Singh’s electrifying blue Gaurav Gupta gown to Nicole Kidman’s blingtastic (and backless) silver number, these show-stopping looks were among the scene-stealers at The Globes 2025.

Opera gloves If there was a fashion element as prominent as the presence of gold at The Globes 2025, it was opera gloves. The fashion world’s favorite accessory to add a hint of drama was embraced by a bevy of celebrities, including the star of the night, Ariana Grande, as well as Pamela Anderson and Ali Wong.

e2ef4435-dd40-41d5-84e1-1f71f423ad01,"What's the real story of tourism in Goa right now?Is tourism in Goa really declining, or are we missing an undercurrent, a positive one that can reposition the state's identity as the ""party capital of India""?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/whats-the-real-story-of-tourism-in-goa-right-now-2661259-2025-01-08,"It’s the 1970s, and Goa is pulsating with the rhythm of full-moon parties. The air is electric with trance beats and psychedelic vibes, drawing in a crowd of free-spirited wanderers. This sun-soaked paradise, with its relaxed atmosphere, stunning landscapes, and culturally tolerant ethos, became a haven for the countercultural movement. For the hippies of that era, Goa was more than just a destination - it was a refuge where freedom, self-expression, and unconventional living thrived. Perhaps, it was with their arrival that Goa’s nascent tourism industry got an unintended boost. Fast forward to 2025, and the narrative has taken a sharp turn. Amid claims that Goa's tourism has lost the spark that once made it a symbol of escapism and allure, a question looms large: has Goa’s magic truly faded, or is this simply a reflection of changing times and evolving expectations?The social media debate The discourse around Goa's tourism on social media is anything but unanimous. On one side, some share videos of deserted streets, empty beaches, and quiet marketplaces, raising alarms with statements like, “Is it game over for Goa?” On the other, a contrasting narrative emerges, with bustling streets and thriving beach shacks showcasing a seemingly vibrant tourist season. So, who do you believe? For instance, X user Madhur posted a video of a Goan local shouting at tourists for parking at the wrong spot and stating this is one of the reasons for the decline in tourism in Goa. ""This kinda harassment is a major reason behind the decline of tourism in Goa. Yes, the guy shouldn’t have parked there but maybe he saw other cars and thought he also could,"" he writes in his tweet. See the tweet here:

— Madhur (@ThePlacardGuy) January 2, 2025 Adding fuel to the debate, entrepreneur Ramanuj Mukherjee shared data on Goa’s declining tourism numbers over recent years, boldly declaring that it has “gone to the dumps.”

Tourism in Goa is down in dumps

Foreign tourists have abandoned the state already. Look at 2019 v 2023 numbers. Russians and Brits who used to visit annually have opted for Sri Lanka instead.

— Ramanuj Mukherjee (@law_ninja) November 5, 2024 This didn’t sit well with Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte, who filed a complaint against Mukherjee last month. The minister, visibly frustrated with what he called “paid influencers,” addressed the controversy during a press conference: “I am not justifying the issues, but at the same time, we need to ensure that a wrong message is not created by someone. Let us amplify the right issues. Let us not disturb Goa with smaller issues when it is a tourism destination.” Amidst accusations and counter-accusations, the root causes of Goa’s challenges remain elusive. It goes beyond just tourist numbers, “expensive hotel tariffs,” or the “taxi mafia” narrative circulating online. The real reasons shaping Goa’s current reality are far more complex, natural, and nuanced than these oversimplified claims suggest.“Empty or comparatively empty” When addressing the narrative of Goa being “empty,” isn’t it subjective? A North Goa resident of three years, who wished to remain anonymous, shares, “In the South, we still see a consistent influx of foreign tourists, especially during the winters. However, these are usually long-term visitors who come for the season.” His sister chimes in, “First, we need to address the benchmark of ‘empty.’ I was at Martin’s Corner (South Goa eatery) the other day and had to wait for about 30 minutes to find a spot. Now, if that’s what you call empty! We all know that the state has been grappling with overtourism and if this is how things are balancing out, so be it.” The former further notes, “Tourism in Goa has diversified. Earlier, foreign backpackers dominated the scene. Now, we see a mix of budget domestic tourists and affluent Indian families. Budget tourism—like the so-called ‘minibus tourists’—brings people who often cook their own food or drink on the beaches, contributing less to the economy. On the other hand, affluent tourists spend significantly more and drive up prices, making it harder for locals to enjoy the same spaces. Whether that’s good or bad depends on whom you ask—it’s very subjective.” Lyndon Alves, a tourism stakeholder, highlights that overtourism is a global issue, but in Goa, it manifests differently. “This is the crowd that spends time complaining and crying, and honestly, that might be a good thing for Goa. Yes, we’ve taken a hit, but maybe it’s for the better. Overtourism of that quality is something we don’t want. Goa's brand has been spoilt by the lower-level Indian tourists,” Alves tells a media outlet. He adds, “Upmarket tourism hasn’t recovered well since Covid-19. The reality is that hotels don’t have enough rooms for upmarket tourists because many have prioritised conferences and weddings. The rates that wealthy Indian clients are paying for these events make it unviable for hotels to allocate rooms to charter tourists.”“It feels like Goa again” In recent months, Goa has made headlines—but not always for the right reasons. Overtourism has brought with it a host of challenges, from the notorious “taxi mafia” to strained garbage management systems. While efforts are underway to address these issues, a lower tourist influx might actually be a blessing in disguise for the state. Actor and travel vlogger Shenaz Treasury, currently spending time in Goa, has observed a noticeable difference this season. Having visited the state numerous times for both work and leisure, she shares, “The past few years, Goa was bursting at the seams, and it was not fun. Wrappers on the beach, plastic bottles everywhere, trash piling up, traffic jams galore, and construction ruining the vibe. This year? It feels different. The rubbish tourists—the ones who litter and don’t respect nature—seem to be missing. It feels like old Goa again. Blissful, peaceful, and oh-so-lovely.” Treasury also notes the shift in the type of visitors this year. “I love Goa this year. The Tourism Board should be thrilled. The trashy tourists have packed their bags, and what’s left is a more refined crowd (well, mostly). It’s giving me the Goa vibes I come back for every single year. I don’t mind paying the extra price if it means keeping trashy tourists who disrespect nature away!”advertisementIs Goa really expensive?Unlike in the past, travelling to far-off destinations like Thailand, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka has become remarkably easy. For this reason, Goa is now often compared to these destinations in terms of accommodation and food prices, as people are traveling in large numbers. This comparison might seem justified.The narrative that Goa is expensive—and therefore losing visitors—could hold some truth. So, could this also be an intentional move to restore Goa to its former glory, limiting access to only a select few and cutting out the ""trouble-causing lot""? Maybe.Alves raises a compelling question: “How can a place go down and be expensive at the same time?”From an economic perspective, there’s a point here. A place being perceived as ""not doing well"" while costs like hotel accommodations, airfares, and dining soar can be explained by a combination of factors, such as:Selective demand: Catering to a niche, high-spending crowd instead of the masses.Cost-push inflation: Rising operational costs driving up prices.Market positioning: Rebranding as a premium destination, intentionally excluding budget travellers.Economic paradox: A destination can face declining visitor satisfaction while prices remain high.Speculative pricing: Businesses' pricing is based on expected demand, not current realities.Shehnaz Treasury also offers insight: “Yes, Goa is ridiculously expensive now. A room on the beach for Rs 29,000—and it’s not even a 3-star?! No wonder people are flocking to Southeast Asia, Oman, or Baku instead. Makes sense. The NRIs are still here—they can afford it—but the 'classy foreigners' Goa was once known for? Barely seen. Instead, there’s a steady stream of Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish tourists.”The perception of Goa being “cheap” is changing, and this could signal a positive repositioning.Goa needs to evolve, transform, and how!When Indian tourists set foot in Goa, a sense of liberation washes over them, and for many, that’s part of the charm. However, some tourists seem to misuse this sense of freedom, engaging in behaviour that can only be described as ridiculous, thinking “yahaan sab chalta hai.” Manish Bhattacharya (name changed), a waiter at a popular Goa restaurant, recounts how groups of young boys often crowd the place—and how he caught them sneaking photos of foreigners.“I’ve been working here for the last 13 years and have seen all kinds of people. Recently, though, something that I often see—and have objected to several times—is a group of boys secretly photographing foreigners. When I noticed, I took their phone and warned them. They eventually left. But you know what? I think this is one of the reasons foreigners are leaving. They don’t feel safe or protected anymore.”And there are many more reasons why Goa needs to transform.Alves argues that smart management, involving all stakeholders, and a clearer understanding of how to reposition Goa’s tourism market—something that should have been done during the Covid-19 pandemic—can still be achieved. The market needs reinvention, with a focus on attracting more family tourism to shift the trend of young people visiting just to drink cheaply.“What we really need is family entertainment.

For many, this new beginning is an opportunity to reflect on personal goals, career ambitions, and overall lifestyle. Among these, fitness often takes centre stage, with many vowing to get in shape, embarking on a transformation journey, and hitting the gym with newfound enthusiasm. But remember, it's the little things that matter most. This common saying applies to many situations, but it is especially true when it comes to our health. From increasing water intake and making small dietary changes to ditching phone usage while eating, these simple lifestyle adjustments can make a significant impact on your well-being. Chances are, you already know what’s good and what’s not for your health, but hear it from health experts who want you to stick to the minor lifestyle changes that can truly transform your health for the better.Hello, hydration Staying hydrated is important for a bevy of bodily functions like carrying nutrients and oxygen to cells, regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, and protecting the organs and tissues. It also helps with digestion, maintaining energy, and even skin health. So, you know how important it is!

 



Aim to drink 8 glasses of water each day (Photo: Pexels)
“Start your day with a glass of water and aim to drink at least 8 glasses daily. Staying hydrated boosts metabolism, supports organ function, and improves skin health,” suggests Dr Balakrishna G K, HOD and senior consultant, Internal Medicine, Gleneagles BGS Hospital Kengeri, Bengaluru.To ensure you don’t miss out on regularly drinking water, carry a reusable water bottle and set reminders on your phone. You can also flavour it with your favourite fruits or herbs if you find drinking plain water unappealing.Plate your meals properly (focus on protein) “Start your day with a glass of water and aim to drink at least 8 glasses daily.

To ensure you don’t miss out on regularly drinking water, carry a reusable water bottle and set reminders on your phone. You can also flavour it with your favourite fruits or herbs if you find drinking plain water unappealing.Plate your meals properly (focus on protein) According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), as of May 2024, 56.4% of India's total disease burden is linked to unhealthy diets. While it is crucial to avoid regularly consuming processed and ultra-processed foods, it’s equally important to pay attention to your home-cooked meals. However, this doesn't mean you can eat anything and everything just because it's cooked at home. Contrary to popular belief, home-cooked food isn't always healthy, especially if it's not plated properly or contains excessive oil, sugar, or salt. Approach your meals with a balanced perspective—your daily diet should include fibre, lean protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and essential micronutrients. “Start taking a diversified high-fibre diet. Eat good amounts of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts which feed the best gut bacteria around. Fermentable foods like yoghurt, kefir, kimchi - incorporate probiotics and support a healthy population of microbiomes. Avoid many processed foods that contain refined sugar and unhealthy fat, which also can be fatal to gut bacteria,” suggests Dr Kapil Jamwal, clinical director, department of gastroenterology and hepatology, Marengo Asia Hospital Gurugram. Pay essential focus on protein, as it helps build and repair tissues, supports muscle growth, and plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and satiety. FYI, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has set the daily protein requirement as 0.83 grams per kg per day for adults. So, fill half the plate with vegetables and fruits, a quarter with lean protein, and a quarter with whole grains, complemented by healthy fats and a source of dairy or a dairy alternative. Here’s what a ‘plate for the day’ should look like, according to ICMR:

 



What balanced food for a day looks like for someone who aims to consume 2,000 calories, according to ICMR.
 To incorporate this change in your life, plan meals ahead of time and keep healthy snacks handy.Get moving (and start exercising) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), physical inactivity is a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

a124b665-2bc9-4c5e-a114-4743b4f74e0c,How the Michelangelo Phenomenon can shape or break a relationshipThe Michelangelo Phenomenon is a fascinating psychological concept that likens the dynamic between partners to that of a sculptor and their art.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/how-the-michelangelo-phenomenon-can-shape-or-break-a-relationship-2662344-2025-01-09,"There is no denying that relationships have evolved over a period of time, which means the kind of relationship you share with your partner was exactly not how your grandparents did. But one thing has been persistent – an ideal relationship (not that there is any but you get it, right?) is one where partners help shape each other into their best selves. That’s basically the crux of the Michelangelo Phenomenon. This is a fascinating psychological concept that likens the dynamic between partners to that of a sculptor and their art. Just as the iconic Renaissance artist Michelangelo believed his sculptures were already present within the marble, waiting to be revealed, this phenomenon suggests that in a healthy relationship, partners ""sculpt"" each other by encouraging traits and aspirations that align with their ideal selves. But is this always a harmonious process, or can the chisel sometimes strike too hard?What is the Michelangelo Phenomenon? ""The phenomenon is about partners helping each other grow into their truest versions,"" explains Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai. ""By supporting each other’s values, goals, and virtues, they chip away the unnecessary parts, revealing the best version of themselves.""

The concept aligns with Self-Determination Theory (SDT), where people flourish when their autonomy, competence, and intrinsic goals are supported. In the context of relationships, Delhi-based relationship counsellor Ruchi Ruuh highlights how partners act as sculptors. ""They affirm traits and behaviours that align with their partner’s ideal self-concept, fostering trust, shared goals, and emotional intimacy,"" she says.Why it worksThe Michelangelo Phenomenon thrives on mutual encouragement, building emotional intimacy and resilience. When both partners feel supported, they’re more likely to achieve personal growth. ""This emotional safety allows them to explore aspirations without fear of judgment or abandonment,"" adds Ruuh.

When both partners feel supported, they’re more likely to achieve personal growth. ""This emotional safety allows them to explore aspirations without fear of judgment or abandonment,"" adds Ruuh. Even in long-distance relationships, the phenomenon’s principles apply. As Sam puts it, ""Strong communication is key to keeping the effect alive. It’s a reminder that growth and connection transcend physical boundaries."" Additionally, research on relational dynamics highlights that when couples invest in each other’s personal development, they experience higher levels of satisfaction and stability. Supporting a partner’s growth fosters a cycle of positivity that reinforces the emotional foundation of the relationship. Moreover, the shared pursuit of personal goals can strengthen the couple’s bond by creating common narratives and achievements.The cultural lens In India, the phenomenon intersects with cultural expectations and familial roles. ""India’s plurality comes with societal norms that can be challenging,"" explains Sam. ""When you’re talking about the Indian aspect, or let’s say the cultural aspect, in India, this can work very well. But as India is full of pluralities, we do come with a lot of cultural expectations. No matter where you belong or what kind of families or roles you have, we always have some set of expectations from society,” explains Sam. Ruuh echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the potential for positive applications beyond romance. ""This approach isn’t limited to romantic relationships. It works in friendships, family dynamics, and even professional setups.""When can things go awry However, the sculptor’s chisel can sometimes slip. ""When one partner imposes their vision of the ‘ideal self’ onto the other, it can lead to resentment,"" warns Ruuh. Over time, this dynamic may create role strain or internal conflict. Sam points out another risk: ""There’s a chance one might lose their real self trying to meet their partner’s expectations."" The imbalance can lead to dependency, emotional distance, or unintentional reinforcement of harmful behaviours. To prevent such pitfalls, Ruuh advises boundaries and mutual respect. ""It’s essential that both partners feel like equal contributors in this process. Otherwise, the sculptor might feel overburdened or inadequate.""Takeaway The essence of a relationship, whether it’s marriage or friendship, often hinges on compatibility. While that’s undoubtedly important, interpersonal growth is equally crucial. Stagnancy isn’t something people accept easily—if you don’t grow and your partner or friend doesn’t support that growth, it could strain the relationship. On the flip side, overdoing it by imposing your vision on others can also create problems. So, the key is balance and, most importantly, listening!Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 9, 2025

Many women grapple with its symptoms, from excessive facial hair growth to hair loss (yes, we get the irony), acne, irregular periods and more. To manage these symptoms, women often seek remedies that range from lifestyle changes to wellness teas to even medications.  Among these, supplements, especially for PCOS, are getting a lot of attention online. These supplements promise a way to manage these symptoms, and some also claim that they can help you heal your PCOS. But can supplements really help you or is it a big fat scam?How PCOS impacts women’s body In simple terms, PCOS is a hormonal disorder that commonly affects women of reproductive age. Dr Anjana Singh, director of obstetrics and gynaecology at Fortis Hospital, Noida, explains that PCOS is characterised by enlarged ovaries with small cysts on their outer edges. Symptoms include unexplained weight gain, excessive facial hair, discolouration of skin on the neck, and missed periods. “Patients of PCOS may experience weight gain, especially around the belly, along with fatigue and fertility issues,” adds Dr Rohan Palshetkar, head of unit at Bloom IVF. Women with PCOS are also more prone to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Although the exact cause is unknown, factors like genetics, insulin resistance, and inflammation are believed to play a role.

However, these products often come with hefty price tags, and their effectiveness can vary widely.Supplements offer potential benefits, but they are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Dr Preeti Deedwania, consultant at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida, advises caution, noting that online recommendations can often be misleading.“Supplements are not miracle cures; they are supportive tools that should be used under medical supervision,” reiterates Dr Singh.

Berberine: Long-term use could impact gut bacteria negatively and may interact with certain medications.
Probiotics: Although generally safe, they can occasionally cause bloating or gas.
“It’s crucial to follow prescribed doses and monitor for any adverse reactions,” advises Dr Deedwania. What can be done instead of popping supplements?Supplements alone cannot cure PCOS. Experts recommend a holistic approach that prioritises lifestyle changes over reliance on pills.
Diet: A balanced diet rich in fibre, lean proteins, and healthy fats can improve insulin sensitivity and hormone levels.
Exercise: Regular physical activity helps manage weight and reduce inflammation. Experts suggest even a 10 percent weight loss can significantly improve symptoms.

2e020f36-dcf5-4d4b-8dc5-97e24f4115d5,"The male attitude towards sex toys is changing in IndiaHesitation, social taboo, judgment, and the shame associated with using sex toys often prevents men from exploring sex toys.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/male-sex-toys-attitude-india-2662924-2025-01-10,"“Why do I even need something like this?” has long been the attitude among men when it comes to sex toys. One of the probable reasons why heterosexual men are not among the top users of sex toys in India in a survey published on Lancet. However, the mindset is now changing – that’s what the leading sex toy companies in India say now. Thanks to India’s bedroom revolution, sex toys finally came out of the closet in 2024. This shift was driven by a new wave of brands selling these products online, a rising number of sex educators and sexual wellness influencers, and the normalisation of sex toy usage through their availability on quick delivery apps like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, and Blinkit. According to the 'Laid in India' survey conducted by bedroom essentials brand MuMuse with 10,000 participants, 45 per cent of Indians use sex toys, and 78 per cent openly discuss them with their friends. Industry experts, as well as some research, suggest women are more likely to report owning sex toys compared to men. The same can be attributed to the destigmatisation of female sexual pleasure and wide orgasm gap. 69 per cent of women report better orgasms with sex toys vs. without, says the MyMuse survey. While women have historically been more vocal in embracing pleasure products, men are steadily catching up,” says Arjun Siva, business head at Love Depot.Female pleasure and the barriers it overcame In India, female pleasure coming to the forefront has taken a long time, effort, and a gradual shift in societal attitudes towards sexuality and women's rights. “Relatively speaking, men face fewer barriers to access when purchasing sexual wellness products compared to women, who typically encounter significantly higher levels of stigma and judgement. Women also generally have less privacy and agency within families and society, systemically, thanks to patriarchy. It is thus generally even more challenging for women than for men to openly explore and purchase products for their sexual pleasure,” says Leeza Mangaldas, sex educator and founder of self-care brand Leezu’s. “Therefore, statistically speaking, right now in India—and in fact, even globally—a woman is more likely to own a sex toy if her partner got it for her. However, there is a growing demographic of women taking charge of their own pleasure, which is both empowering and transformative. This shift signals a positive change, one that I am personally most excited about,” she tells India Today.The 'masculine' attitude For men, however, hesitation, social taboo, judgement, and the shame associated with using sex toys often prevent them from exploring these options. “It's probably due to patriarchy, sure—since much of masculinity depends on heteronormativity and sexual success with women, a man who has to ‘resort’ to sex toys is seen as a loser or a pervert,” writes a Reddit user in a post discussing why it is shameful for a man to want a sex toy for himself. “I think the difference is probably that women orgasm way less than men during sex; so when women have sex toys it’s simply to orgasm, whereas when men have sex toys it must be because they’re freaky. That’s the ‘assumption’ made by society,” reads another comment on the post. The stigma is, however, diminishing. “While women have traditionally led this space, the stigma around using male pleasure products is slowly diminishing,” says Anushka Gupta, founder of MyMuse. “Products like Toofaan have emerged as bestsellers, reflecting an eagerness among men to explore their sexual pleasure as well as to become more self-aware about their own sexuality, anatomy, and health. This year, we expect this trend to gain further momentum, driven by increasing awareness and availability of products catering to male sexual wellness,” says Mangaldas. According to her, Indian men are likely to embrace tools that provide an informed and enjoyable understanding of their sexual health and desires, as societal conversations around gender and pleasure are becoming more mainstream. Experts say this change is also fuelled by designs that prioritise discretion and the evolution of men’s pleasure, with men actively exploring sexual wellness as an integral part of broader self-care. “Products like stroker sleeves (both powered and non-powered), vibrating rings, and app-controlled devices are gaining traction, showing that men are becoming more experimental with their choices, contrary to popular opinion,” says Siva.Couple pleasure at the forefront Not just self-pleasure, sex toys are also helping build and maintain intimacy between couples. “Women report experiencing better orgasms with sex toys. For men, the biggest benefit comes in the form of enhanced connection with their partner, with 31 per cent of men saying toys have improved their intimacy with their partners,” says the ‘Laid in India’ survey. The focus on male pleasure has now shifted to mutual pleasure. The leading brands in the realm have a ‘for couple’ category, which usually comprises tools for ‘him’ as well as ‘her’. “Interestingly, men frequently purchase for their partners,” shares Gupta. Love Depot also reports a growing demand for couple-focused products. “We've noticed a growing demand for couple-focused products, now matching the popularity of solo items designed exclusively for him or her,” adds Siva.The revolution continues in 2025 While 2024 was the year when sex toys came out of the closet, this revolution is set to continue into this year. Industry leaders anticipate pleasure products becoming even more accessible and mainstream. “First, we’re likely to see an even greater normalisation of pleasure products, with items like massagers and lubricants becoming as common and accessible as everyday wellness products—think toothbrushes or face wash. Additionally, there will be a growing focus on inclusivity and gender equality in the sexual wellness space,” predicts Mangaldas. She also believes that this year more people will understand that these tools are not just about physical pleasure, but about fostering better intimacy, comfort, and connection with themselves and their partners. Some of the trends, according to Gupta, to watch out for include:
Tech integration: Expect advancements in connected devices with customisable options and features to enhance user experience.
Educational content: Brands will continue to ramp up sex education initiatives to normalise sexual wellness and empower consumers. More creators will follow suit, as will the increased representation of sex in OTT content.
Accessibility: Tier-II and III cities will emerge as significant growth markets as societal taboos continue to erode (PS: There is already a high demand from these areas).

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/what-the-indian-passport-can-learn-from-singapore-the-worlds-most-powerful-2663026-2025-01-11,"Henley Global on Wednesday, January 8, 2025, unveiled its Passport Index, crowning Singapore’s passport as the world’s most powerful once again. While Singapore shared the top spot last year with France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, this year it has reclaimed the throne exclusively, as these countries slipped in the rankings. The title is well-deserved - holders of a Singaporean passport can travel to 195 countries without needing a visa. Over the past eight years, Singapore has consistently ranked in the top two and has remained amongst the top ten for over two decades, solidifying its reputation as a travel powerhouse.

 In comparison, India’s passport is ranked 85th on the latest Henley Passport Index, granting visa-free access to 57 countries. But what gives Singapore’s passport such unrivalled clout, and how has it maintained its dominance over the years? The answer lies in far more than just the colour of its cover. The Passport Index  This year, Singapore has reclaimed its title as the world’s most powerful passport, offering visa-free access to an impressive 195 out of 227 global destinations listed in the Henley Passport Index. This achievement places Singapore firmly ahead of second-ranked Japan, which grants visa-free entry to 193 destinations, including China—a significant milestone since the restoration of travel post-Covid-19 lockdowns. The third spot is shared by a group of EU nations—France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Finland—along with South Korea. Citizens of these countries enjoy visa-free travel to 192 destinations worldwide, underscoring their strong global mobility. Now, if you’re wondering how this agency ranks its countries, let us give you a quick crash course.

 The Henley Passport Index ranks 199 passports by comparing their visa-free access to 227 global destinations. For each destination where no visa is required, the passport earns a score of 1. The same applies if travellers can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) upon entry. If a visa is mandatory, or if travellers must secure a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) or pre-departure authorisation for a visa on arrival, the passport receives a score of 0. In simple terms, a passport’s overall score reflects the total number of destinations it grants access to without requiring a visa, making it a clear measure of global travel freedom. This data, by the way, is exclusively received from International Air Transport Association (IATA). So, when it gives Singapore the ‘strongest passport’ title, it means holding a Singaporean passport can give you the freedom to travel more easily than any other passports. Not only Henley, but organisations and reports that also show the same. For instance, the passport index has also ranked Singapore’s passports in the top 10 for 2025. How is Singapore’s passport the strongest? How does a country make its passport strong and travel easy for its citizens? Well, there are various reasons.  Global mobility
Singapore’s passport is unmatched in global mobility, offering visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 195 out of 227 destinations. This exceptional reach allows Singaporeans to travel with ease, whether for business or leisure, making it a symbol of unparalleled international freedom. As Manoj Dharmani, CEO of DUDigital Global, a company specialising in visa facilitation, tells India Today, “Singapore's passport has emerged as the world's most powerful travel document.” Strategic diplomatic relations
At the heart of Singapore’s passport strength lies its robust diplomatic relations. The country has forged extensive bilateral and multilateral partnerships, ensuring visa waivers and simplified entry procedures with numerous nations. Louis D’Souza, a travel expert and the director of Tamarind Global, explains, “Singapore’s emphasis on diplomatic ties, economic strength, and its status as a global hub for trade and tourism play pivotal roles in sustaining its passport power.” These strong alliances have earned Singapore a high degree of international trust, translating directly into greater travel freedom for its citizens. Consistent economic stability
Singapore’s consistent economic growth and political stability have significantly enhanced its passport’s global standing. A strong and reliable economy reassures other nations, leading to more open visa policies for Singaporean passport holders.

 “Through years of careful diplomacy, economic success, and stable governance, Singapore has transformed its little red passport into a golden ticket for global travel and thus international trust,” says Dharmani. Commitment to security and integrity
The integrity of Singapore’s passport is another cornerstone of its strength. Rigorous issuance processes and state-of-the-art security features make forgery nearly impossible, earning global confidence. This commitment to security ensures smoother immigration processes and fewer travel restrictions for its citizens. This brings us to another next point.  Advanced biometric technology
In 2006, Singapore was one of the first to launch a biometric visa. These e-passports contain embedded microchips storing personal data like digital photographs and fingerprints, making them both secure and efficient.  Biometric passports streamline immigration procedures, especially at e-gates in major airports, ensuring faster and more reliable border clearance. This technological edge further bolsters its passport’s reputation. PS: India first launched biometric passports, in 2008 as a pilot project, initially only issuing them to diplomatic passport holders. How can India do better? Both Singapore and India are Asian countries, but if you’re an Indian and have ever applied for a Schengen or US visa, you know that the struggle is real. Visa rejections often impact a lot of our travel plans. This year's data shows that India’s passport is ranked 85th globally. This marks a slip of 5 positions since the last year.  However, Dharmani notes that India's passport tells a different story – one of gradual change and untapped potential. “Currently ranked 85th globally, India's position on the passport power index reflects both its challenges and opportunities. The Covid-19 pandemic dealt a significant blow, pushing India's ranking down to 90th in 2021 from its previous high of 71st in 2006,” he notes. 

 



A stronger passport means more freedom to travel to various countries. Photo: Unsplash
 But there’s still scope for change, according to experts. Here are some ways that both experts suggest: 
Strengthen diplomatic relations
 Experts suggest that India must expand its network of bilateral agreements, aiming for more visa waiver deals with key countries. By boosting diplomatic ties and fostering mutual trust, Indian travellers can benefit from easier global access.
Promote inbound tourism
 Another step can be simplifying visa regimes for international tourists. This can create reciprocal agreements with other countries. A welcoming policy towards foreign travellers often encourages similar concessions for Indian passport holders.
Enhance infrastructure and governance
 Streamlining bureaucratic processes and ensuring consistent foreign policies are essential. As D’Souza mentions, “Addressing internal challenges like bureaucracy and focusing on key sectors like tourism, technology, and trade can enhance India’s global reputation.”
Focus on economic growth and stability
 Even though India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, experts suggest that economic success and political stability are key drivers of international trust. A stronger economy can reassure other nations, making them more inclined to offer visa-free access to Indian travellers. “A stronger Indian passport will make international travel more accessible for citizens and also elevate India’s standing on the global scale. This path is challenging, but Singapore’s success shows us that the vision and commitment is achievable,” D’Souza concludes.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 11, 2025Must Watch

Hollywood celebrities like Tom Hanks, Bella Hadid, and Emma Watson have openly shared their struggles with something called Impostor Syndrome—the persistent feeling of not truly deserving their achievements, even at the peak of their success. Back here in Bollywood, Shefali Shah revealed in an interview with NDTV last year that she struggles with low self-esteem. “I feel I have Impostor Syndrome, and I genuinely have very low self-esteem,” said the actress. When these words come from someone who has won a National Award and was also nominated for the International Emmys, it really shows how this behavioural pattern can make you feel limited.

 



Imposter Syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as frauds. (Photo: Unsplash)
 Similarly, Manoj Bajpayee told Mid-Day about his battle with Imposter Syndrome, admitting it made him feel “guilty” about his success. He credited fellow actor Akshaye Khanna with helping him overcome these negative thoughts. There could be a plethora of reasons why this feeling of being an “imposter” can creep into someone, but what comes across as very problematic is the feeling of not being good enough, which is increasingly fuelled by social media. But first, let’s understandWhat is Imposter Syndrome? Imposter Syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as frauds. It’s like getting an A+ on a test but still feeling like you cheated your way through. People dealing with it often think of their success as ""just luck"" or that they’ve somehow tricked everyone into believing that they’re capable. And the wild part? An individual struggling with Imposter Syndrome may get more successful with time, but their pessimist thought process could still be challenging their accomplishments. Interestingly, a review article published in the International Journal of Behavioural Science suggests that around 70 per cent of people will experience Imposter Syndrome at some point in their lives. It’s particularly prevalent in competitive environments, like academia, corporate workplaces, or creative industries, where external validation often overshadows personal achievements.How social media acts as a trigger Dr Rahul Chandhok, head consultant of mental health and behavioural science at Artemis Hospital Gurgaon, highlights how social media inflates Imposter syndrome by presenting idealised versions of life. “Social media inflates the effect of Imposter Syndrome by always providing ideal versions of others’ lives and achievements to you. Constant exhibition of these packaged highlights makes any individual feel inappropriately mediocre despite their actual accomplishments,” explains Dr Chandhok. “The pressure to meet the unrealistic standards set by influencers and peers leads to self-doubt and the belief that success is undeserved. The lack of context behind posts also creates a distorted reality, which can heighten feelings of failure. This digital environment fosters perfectionism because individuals fear judgement or rejection, which further fuels Imposter Syndrome. Mindful consumption and limiting comparisons are crucial for maintaining self-esteem in the social media era,” he adds.

The demographics most affected Certain groups are more vulnerable to social media-induced Imposter Syndrome than others. Psychologist Sumalatha Vasudeva from Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, explains, “Teenagers and young adults are particularly susceptible because they are still developing their identities and heavily rely on peer validation.” Child psychologist Riddhi Doshi Patel echoes this sentiment, and tells India Today, “Teenagers constantly compare themselves to the filtered realities on social media, leading to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.” This constant comparison to others’ curated lives - reels filled with achievements, vacations, and picture-perfect moments - warps their sense of reality. Instead of focusing on their own accomplishments, many end up feeling like they’re falling short. Adding to this is the fear of missing out (FOMO). Patel notes, “Constant updates on social media can create a sense of FOMO, making teens believe they’re missing out on exciting experiences.” The obsession with likes, comments, and follower counts only deepens this insecurity. But it’s not just teenagers who are at risk. Women in professional and academic spaces often experience higher levels of Imposter Syndrome due to societal pressures and gender biases. Creative and competitive professionals are also prone, as their industries often tie success to public recognition, Vasudeva points out. Additionally, marginalised groups face unique challenges, as systemic biases and stereotypes are frequently magnified in online spaces, adding another layer to the struggle.Combat mode on While social media can be overwhelming, there are ways to mitigate its negative impact, experts reiterate:
Curate your feed: Follow accounts that promote authenticity and positivity, avoiding those that trigger comparisons.
Limit screen time: Set boundaries to reduce overexposure to curated content.
Practice self-compassion: Remind yourself that social media often highlights the best moments and omits struggles.
Focus on personal goals: Shift your attention from external validation to internal growth and achievements.
Keep a journal: Document your accomplishments to recognise your progress and celebrate milestones.
Open up: Discuss feelings of self-doubt with trusted friends or a therapist for perspective.
Take breaks: Periodic social media detoxes can help recalibrate your self-perception and reconnect with reality.

fed03df4-704d-47b5-b8e7-d77589db87b4,"55% of Indians are left wanting more sex: SurveyA recent survey involving over 10,000 respondents has revealed startling insights into modern relationships and intimacy.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/55-of-indians-are-left-wanting-more-sex-survey-2664085-2025-01-13,"What’s happening behind closed doors in India’s bedrooms? A lot—and yet, not enough. A recent survey, Laid in India 2025 by MyMuse (a bedroom wellness brand), has sparked conversations about the evolving state of intimacy across the country. The survey, which drew insights from over 10,000 respondents, offers a refreshingly honest take on modern relationships, revealing surprising truths about how Indians approach love, desire, and connection.What the findings say The findings are as diverse as the country itself. While 87% of Indians no longer wait until marriage to explore intimacy, the survey says nearly 62% expressed a desire to break out of routine and try something new in the bedroom. The report also highlights a growing openness to sexual wellness products, with nearly half of the respondents either using or wanting to explore them. Emotional connection emerged as a critical factor for 87% of participants, showing that it’s not just about the physical—it’s also about meaningful bonds. Despite these progressive shifts, one data stood out: 55% of Indians are left wanting more sex. This dissatisfaction spans across singles, couples, and even married individuals. The data busts myths about marriage as a fix for intimacy issues, with 59% of married respondents admitting they still feel the lack of a thriving sex life. Interestingly, women reported slightly higher dissatisfaction (60%) compared to men (53%), challenging traditional narratives about who is more vocal about their needs.Why though? According to Srishati Singhal, founder of Evolve Beings (community of healers, therapists and seekers), this intimacy deficit stems from deeply rooted socio-cultural factors.
“I believe the statistics might actually be higher than what is reported. There are several factors contributing to this. Indian couples often marry young, leaving little time for exploration. Children usually follow soon after, disrupting intimacy,” she explains.
Another major issue is the lack of privacy, especially since many Indian couples live in joint families. “Even though this is gradually changing in metropolitan cities, the family dynamic often means couples have to be discreet. This constant involvement with family life leaves little time or space for couples to fully embrace their sexuality or maintain an active and fulfilling sex life,” she adds.
Moreover, Singhal feels there is a collective cultural repression around sexuality in India. People don’t learn about sexual intimacy, lovemaking, or tools to keep things exciting, which leads to a monotonous and routine-driven sexual life. Without education and awareness, couples struggle to rekindle passion or put effort into their intimate lives.
Adding to this is the modern lifestyle—busy schedules and constant exhaustion push intimacy to the bottom of the priority list. Often, intimacy is reduced to a quick stress-relief activity at the end of the day, which doesn’t sustain long-term relationships. While this may work in the honeymoon phase, it becomes increasingly difficult as the relationship matures, particularly after having children.
Content creator and sexual wellness expert Bhavjeet Sehgal identifies communication as the critical missing element in Indian relationships. She states, “Intimacy flourishes when partners are open about their desires and fantasies. Without honest communication, relationships stagnate. Women especially face societal judgment, which makes expressing their needs even harder.” Sehgal urges couples to prioritise transparent, judgment-free conversations to foster deeper emotional and physical connections.
Towards an intimate revolution There's no denying that there are problems, but Indians are increasingly willing to explore new avenues for intimacy. The report also highlights that discussions around sexual wellness are gaining acceptance, with nearly 48% eager to try tools that can enhance their experience. Anushka Gupta, co-founder of MyMuse, says, “The report is more than just a snapshot of the country’s sex lives. It doesn’t just point to the desire for more sex; it reflects the broader challenge of creating spaces for connection, experimentation, and communication in relationships.” **The report covers 500+ cities and towns, from Tier 1 metros to smaller Tier 3 regions, which provides a comprehensive look at intimacy across urban and rural India.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 13, 2025Trending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/how-ozempic-zepbound-and-mounjaro-will-transform-indias-weight-loss-market-2664159-2025-01-14,"The world of weight management is evolving at a rapid pace. In India, where weight loss has traditionally been associated with fad diets and intense workouts, the introduction of  injectables like Ozempic, Zepbound, Mounjaro, Wegovy is set to bring about a transformative shift. While these brands have been making waves in the West, trends suggest they will also significantly impact the weight-loss market in India. As of now, these drugs are set to launch in India after receiving the necessary approvals. Amongst these, three drugs are making headlines time and again: Ozempic (which never really left the spotlight), and the comparatively newer players, Zepbound and Mounjaro. But can these injectables really penetrate the Indian markets, or is there a challenge waiting for them? But before getting into that, here’s a quick crash course on these three drugs. What are Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro? Ozempic: The infamous drug that is promoted by well-known faces like Elon Musk, Ozempic contains semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. It works like a mimicker (like a stunt double) that mimics GLP-1, a hormone that regulates blood sugar, enhances insulin secretion, and makes you feel full. This weekly injectable has gained popularity even in India, as many import it from the West.

Zepbound: Contains tirzepatide, which is a dual agonist targeting both the GLP-1 receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. This drug is specifically approved for weight management in adults with obesity with weight-related health conditions such as high blood pressure or obstructive sleep apnoea.This dual action enhances appetite suppression and improves glucose control more effectively than single agonists like Ozempic.  Zepbound: Contains tirzepatide, which is a dual agonist targeting both the GLP-1 receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. This drug is specifically approved for weight management in adults with obesity with weight-related health conditions such as high blood pressure or obstructive sleep apnoea. This dual action enhances appetite suppression and improves glucose control more effectively than single agonists like Ozempic.  Mounjaro: Also contains tirzepatide and shares the same mechanism of action as Zepbound. It is branded for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes but is essentially the same compound as Zepbound. Primarily used for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. While it can also aid in weight loss, its branding focuses on diabetes management. According to Dr Samrat Shah, an internal medicine expert at Apollo Spectra, Pune, “Ozempic helps lower your hunger levels, whereas injectable treatments like Mounjaro and Zepbound significantly target both the appetite and also the way your body stores fat.”  He further explains that while Ozempic is widely recognised for managing Type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro’s dual-action mechanism offers enhanced benefits for those battling both obesity and diabetes.Side effects  While these medications promise effective weight management, they come with their share of side effects. Dr Tushar Tayal, consultant at CK Birla hospital, Gurugram, says, “Both drugs [semaglutide, tirzepatide] carry warnings about potential thyroid tumours, including cancer, observed in animal studies.”  Other side effects also include gaining weight back once they stop taking the medicine. Moreover, some people have mentioned noticing 'Ozempic face' and 'Ozempic butt and body' as these drugs often result in excessive muscle loss along with weight loss.

 



Ozempic comes with side effects. Photo: Unsplash
 Another shortfall of these drugs is the price tag. For instance, one injection of Ozempic is sold somewhere between Rs 9,000-10,000. The impact on the Indian weight loss market These side effects, even though widely circulated, have not deterred people from taking these injectables. In fact, India is likely to see the launch of these drugs by 2025-26. Eli Lilly, a US-based pharmaceutical company, plans to launch Mounjaro in India in 2025, while Novo Nordisk, the company that produces Ozempic, recently shared its plans to launch Wegovy (Ozempic’s equivalent) by 2026. India Today spoke to experts who noted that India’s weight loss market, which has traditionally leaned towards diet plans, Ayurvedic remedies, and fitness regimes, could be revolutionised by the introduction of these scientifically-backed drugs. Numbers also indicate that there could be a huge demand for such drugs (though more affordable ones) due to the rising obesity rates in India. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of Indians who are either overweight or obese. From 25 per cent in 2013, the figure has risen to 40 per cent in 2023.

 Experts agree. Rahul Kamra, a weight loss expert, keto coach, and the founder of Ketorets, tells India Today that with obesity and diabetes on the rise, they offer a scientifically backed solution that could appeal to many. Dr Tushar Tayal, consultant, internal medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, believes that these injectables may lead to increased demand for such treatments, potentially affecting the sales of traditional weight-loss products and altering dietary habits. However, these injectables may face certain challenges once launched in India, according to these experts. The challenges ahead Experts suggest that the challenges these companies will face can be divided into two halves. The first part is the challenges they’ll face before the launch. These include getting regulatory approvals and deciding a price point.  Rahul mentions that approval processes in India can be stringent, delaying market entry. In India, drug approval is overseen by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The process starts with a New Drug Application (NDA) submission, including data on the drug's safety, efficacy, and quality. Clinical trials in India are required to validate its suitability for the local population, in compliance with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and rules. The drug undergoes animal testing before human trials. Detailed documentation and manufacturing facility inspections ensure quality control. The approval process usually takes 12-18 months. The next challenge for these companies is setting a fair price, as these drugs typically cost around Rs 10,000 - 15,000, which is beyond the reach of most Indians. Dr Tayal points out that it is very important to address the high cost of these medications to make them accessible to a broader population.

  Dr Vaishali Naik, a diabetes and endocrinologist at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, on the other hand, suggests that the launch may take time in India due to people being hesitant about trying weight-loss drugs that easily. “These companies may face challenges in making a strong impact in the market as people may be doubtful about the safety of these drugs,” she says.  Post-launch, experts suggest that educating both doctors and patients on the proper use and side effects is crucial, as Indians may still prefer holistic and natural remedies, which could hinder acceptance.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Trending Reel

However, is it even healthy to chase this specific trend in your dating life, or is it simply a harmless pursuit that demands some caution? But first, let’s decode who even qualifies as a ‘golden retriever’ partner.

Essentially, it is all about the traits.Who is a 'golden retriever type' partner? Essentially, it is all about the traits.Who is a 'golden retriever type' partner? Do you have a partner who is mostly jovial, excited and is always showering you with affection? Chances are he/she fits the bill. Affectionate, loyal, playful, optimistic and energetic are the major traits of a ‘golden retriever’ partner. They are consistently supportive, enjoy spending time with their partner, and bring a sense of joy and positivity to a relationship. Just like the dog breed that they are compared to, these people are easy-going, dependable and boast an upbeat demeanour – and all of it makes them highly desirable in the dating world. But why? Well, “People are naturally drawn to individuals who radiate qualities like positivity, loyalty, affection, and unconditional support. A golden retriever-type partner makes you feel adored, appreciated, and prioritised, bringing lightness to life, especially during challenging times. These relationships feel wholesome, dependable, and optimistic, which are highly desirable qualities,” says Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship expert. “The energy created by such partners fosters a safe space for genuine connection and emotional intimacy. Their playful and happy demeanour adds to the dynamics people aspire to have in their relationships. The consistency and emotional support they offer are qualities that many seek in a partner, making this archetype highly attractive,” she adds.A reality check you shouldn't ignore Sounds like the partner of your dreams? Hold on! Time to put down the rose-tinted glasses! Even the most loving and playful partners are not immune to challenges. And when you are dating a ‘golden retriever type’, there are a lot of things to take care of. Firstly, it is to manage your expectations. ""The 'golden retriever type' is often considered the gold standard in dating, but as a partner, it's important to understand that they can't possibly exude this energy 24/7. Unlike the dogs they are compared to, who have a limited set of human stakeholders, your partner likely interacts with far more people. Therefore, it's essential to remember that these individuals may need downtime and space to recharge and bounce back,” says Radhika Mohta, a matchmaker and relationship coach. “The rise of this trend suggests we are drifting towards valuing emotional warmth, loyalty, positivity, consistency, and the availability of a partner in relationships. These qualities reflect a healthy view of love as a secure and fulfilling feeling, which is something everyone should aspire to. However, it's essential to remember that we shouldn't idealise these traits to the point of ignoring the complexities of relationships. People are complex, and relationships inevitably involve negative emotions, complications, and conflicts. While it's important to cultivate these positive qualities, we must also be realistic and prepared to navigate challenges,” adds Ruchi. Basically, you cannot live in the bubble of your partner’s perfection. Relationships require a balance of fun and seriousness, with lightheartedness paired with the depth needed to move forward. “When we solely focus on golden retriever traits, we risk overlooking the fact that relationships also need resilience and emotional intelligence. The inability to work on conflicts and navigate challenges together can be detrimental,” adds Ruchi. “While these traits are valued, additional qualities like emotional intelligence and conflict management are also necessary for a successful relationship,” she adds.As the partner of a 'golden retriever' type, remember... There might also be some red flags you might be overlooking in your ‘golden energy partner’. For instance, their affection can border on clinginess where they prioritise the relationship and avoid difficult conversations. According to relationship experts, conflicts are important for the growth of a relationship. “Negative feelings are inevitable, and it is unrealistic to always maintain a happy, rainbow-like atmosphere,” says Ruchi. Lack of space: Their constant presence and enthusiasm could make their partner feel confined or limited in their social interactions, leading to a lack of personal space. Avoidance of serious issues: Their lighthearted nature may prevent them from addressing serious or deep issues, which are crucial for managing emotional challenges within the relationship. Lack of depth in conversations: Important deep conversations might be neglected, making it difficult to handle emotional challenges effectively. Every relationship, whether it's with a laid-back, golden retriever-type person or someone with a different personality, requires effort and mutual commitment. To nurture a successful relationship with your easy-going partner, keep these key points in mind: Ruchi Ruuh suggests:

 Encouraging your partner to nurture their individuality and autonomy by pursuing activities, hobbies, and friendships outside the relationship. This will help them grow as a person and alleviate some of the weight on your shoulders, bringing balance to the relationship.


 Addressing conflicts and problems openly, ensuring that your partner takes these discussions seriously.


 Embracing imperfection. Nobody is perfect, and understanding your partner's unique personality is key. Look beyond superficial qualities and consider the deeper traits that contribute to a fulfilling relationship.

d37487b0-bac6-4c8d-b40d-8cda100be260,"Los Angeles Wildfires: Truth behind the bizarre theoriesFrom insurance companies to Sean Diddy, conspiracy theories about LA wildfires are spreading like, well, wildfire. But is there any truth to them?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/los-angeles-wildfires-truth-behind-the-bizarre-theories-2664722-2025-01-14,"Fire crews are working tirelessly to contain the wildfires tearing through Los Angeles, as the world watches the dire situation unfolding in the United States’ most populous city. Stronger wind gusts expected in the coming days could further complicate their efforts. These fires, potentially the costliest in US history, have already claimed at least 24 lives, displaced thousands, destroyed over 12,000 structures, and forced 100,000 people—including top Hollywood celebrities—to evacuate.

 



The fires have already claimed at least 24 lives. (Photo: Reuters)
 While government agencies are yet to release official damage estimates, AccuWeather, a weather data and analysis firm, projects the total damages and economic losses to range between $250 billion and $275 billion, according to The Guardian. Meanwhile, the cause of the fires remains under investigation. This uncertainty has made the crisis fertile ground for conspiracy theories. Despite lacking credible evidence, these theories have gained traction on social media, fuelling widespread misinformation and diverting attention from the ongoing firefighting efforts.Conspiracy theories afloat Social media is flooded with conspiracy theories suggesting that there’s more to the story. Videos and supposed “proof” suggest it was more of an orchestrated move than being a by-product of climate change, but is it? President-elect Donald Trump blamed the Democratic Party, while Elon Musk, attributed it to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. The claims are too many, but are the reasons good enough? Let’s find out: Insurance cancellation months ahead of ‘wildfires’ In the months leading up to the devastating Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025, several major insurance companies, including State Farm (insurance company), cancelled numerous homeowners' policies in high-risk areas such as Pacific Palisades. In July 2024, State Farm alone dropped about 1,600 policies in this region. These cancellations left many residents without coverage just before the catastrophic fires erupted, exacerbating the financial and emotional toll on affected homeowners. Besides State Farm, major insurers have reduced their coverage in California, and several others have followed suit. This has caused quite a hullabaloo on social media where they blamed the insurance company behind the fires or at least they knew about it. Watch some of the conspiracy theorists talk about their assumptions on the fire:

 What’s the truth? One of the main reasons why many insurance companies cancelled their policies or failed to renew them is because of the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires, leading to unsustainable losses. Companies like Allstate and Farmers Insurance Group have also reduced their presence in the state, citing rising risks and regulatory challenges. Data from the California Department of Insurance shows that between 2020 and 2022, 2.8 million homeowner policies were not renewed statewide, with over 500,000 affected in Los Angeles County alone. The Los Angeles wildfires are a recurring natural disaster fuelled by a combination of factors, including dry weather, strong Santa Ana winds, and dense vegetation that acts as tinder. Over the years, these fires have caused widespread devastation, displacing thousands of residents, destroying homes, and threatening iconic neighbourhoods. State Farm told Euronews Green that it is handling claims for over 5,700 homes and vehicles related to the LA fires. “California’s insurance market is uniquely complex, but we remain engaged with state officials to improve the availability of insurance for residents,” says a spokesperson. Fires deliberately set for ‘Agenda 2030’ and smart cities In recent years, Los Angeles has pursued the SmartLA 2028 initiative, aiming to enhance urban living through advanced technologies. This strategy focuses on improving infrastructure, transportation, and public services to create a more efficient and sustainable city. However, a conspiracy theory claims that California fires were deliberately set to clear land for smart city development under the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Some social media posts suggest that Los Angeles is part of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) smart city list. These claims draw comparisons to the wildfires in Lahaina, Maui, implying a link between wildfires and smart city initiatives in these areas. Another claim suggests that the fires were started intentionally as a part of a ""criminal land grab"" to build the smart city.

— The Patriot Voice (@TPV_John) January 8, 2025 What’s the truth? PolitiFact debunked these claims, confirming Los Angeles is not on the WEF's list, and smart city development focuses on enhancing infrastructure, not destruction. The fires are attributed to dry conditions and strong winds, with no evidence supporting a deliberate land-grab theory. As a part of the SmartLA 2028 initiative, it doesn’t propose rebuilding the entire city but rather adding technology to improve the lives of its residents. To cover-up Sean Diddy’s horrific crimes One particularly outlandish theory ties the Los Angeles wildfires to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. The speculation claims that the fires may have been orchestrated to erase evidence of alleged misconduct linked to Diddy’s infamous gatherings. Adding fuel to the conspiracy is the fact that Diddy’s Holmby Hills mansion reportedly remained unscathed, even as neighbouring properties suffered significant damage. Diddy facing numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Some theorists allege the existence of a so-called “Diddy list,” purportedly naming celebrities who were frequent attendees at his controversial events. There are also rumours that state that underground tunnels allegedly connect Diddy’s mansion to nearby estates, including high-profile properties like the Playboy Mansion and Michael Jackson’s former home. These tunnels are speculated to have been used for illicit activities, though no credible evidence has surfaced to confirm their existence.

24eb3961-e947-4959-8e73-74f0f6117816,Is Northeast India finally getting its due as a travel destination?Both experts and data highlight a growing preference amongst travellers for the Northeast as a travel destination.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/is-northeast-india-finally-getting-its-due-as-a-travel-destination-2664776-2025-01-15,"For decades, Northeast India remained a well-kept secret, tucked away in the farthest corner of the country. As someone from this region, it was no surprise when people would ask me where exactly is that after I mentioned Assam. In fact, sarcastic comments like “Assam is not a part of India” were unfortunately not uncommon.To the changing times The Northeast is home to mesmerising landscapes, a vibrant food scene, and rich traditions. Yet, the seven sisters and a brother (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim) often took a backseat in India’s tourism narrative. But times are changing. Travellers are finally discovering the charm of this region—and for all the right reasons. In a recent report by The New York Times, Assam has been named the 4th must-visit destination in the world. The report highlights Assam as a crowd-free region that is gaining international recognition and witnessing improved accessibility. Another report, the 'Travel Trends Report 2025' released by the travel platform Skyscanner, identified Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya, as the most popular destination for Indian travellers this year. This trend suggests that not only are Indians exploring the Northeast, but the region is also becoming a favourite amongst foreign visitors. Post-pandemic, there has been significant growth in interest and demand for travel to the northeastern states. In fact, data shows that the region has not only recovered to pre-pandemic travel levels but has also surpassed them.  According to provisional data from the Ministry of Tourism, the Government of India, 118.45 lakh domestic visitors travelled to the northeastern states in 2022, compared to 95 lakh in 2019. For foreign tourists, the numbers stood at 1.04 lakh in 2022, compared to 3.6 lakh in 2019. This upward trend appears to be continuing, with further increases expected.

Experts seem to agree.Vaibhav Kala, a travel expert, founder of Aquaterra Adventures, and senior VP, of the Adventure Tour Operators Association of India shares with India Today that northeast tourism is set to arrive in the coming decade. According to him, every tourism effort progresses through the stages of discovery of USP, awareness, connectivity challenges, lack of infrastructure, capacity building, etc and these stages are en route to completion, which will herald a new era for tourism in the Northeast.Sanjar Imam, the co-founder at Panache World, a luxury trip curator, tells us that travel to the Northeastern region is increasing and has made a recovery from the pandemic, as people are opting to visit more off beat places than the regular famous ones.  But what caused this change? Let’s have a look at some of the reasons. Better connectivity All the experts that we spoke to credited better connectivity to the Northeastern region as one of the major reasons why the region is seeing a hike in tourism. Rikant Pittie, CEO and Co-Founder of EaseMyTrip tells India Today that this surge is attributed to improved infrastructure, enhanced connectivity, and government initiatives like the Swadesh Darshan and PRASHAD schemes, which have developed holistic tourism destinations based on sustainable and responsible tourism principles. advertisementSchemes like UDAN (UdeDesh ka Aam Nagrik), increased connectivity in the region via air. For other modes of transportation, the Ministry of Northeastern Development has to be credited for better road and railway connectivity. The Ministry of Railways in March 2023 press release said that during the year 2021-22, 14 new line projects covering a total length of 1,181 kms have been planned/sanctioned/executed out of which, 361 kms have been commissioned, all in the Northeastern Region (NER).

Experts decode the better pick for your skinThere's a growing buzz online about ravinage, a plant-based alternative to retinol, being better for your skin. But is there any truth to the claims? We turned to experts to help dissect the facts.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/ravinage-over-retinol-experts-decode-the-better-pick-for-your-skin-2665447-2025-01-16,"The world of skincare is ever-evolving - or at least it feels that way. You hop onto a skincare trend, and poof, it vanishes, replaced by a new one, creating a never-ending loop. One such skincare staple that has stood the test of time, particularly in Millennials (and increasingly some Gen Zs) routines, is retinol. This ultimate skincare ingredient is celebrated for its ability to combat ageing, acne, and skin pigmentation. If you are into skincare - or even just dipping your toes into it - you have likely heard of retinol. But now, bakuchiol, popularly referred to as ""ravinage,"" is creating a buzz as a gentler, plant-based alternative. While there is plenty of excitement surrounding this new ingredient, the big question remains: should you swap your trusty retinol for ravinage just yet?The basics: Retinol vs. Ravinage Retinol and ravinage are powerhouse skincare ingredients, but they cater to different needs and skin types. Retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, has long been celebrated as the gold standard for addressing wrinkles, fine lines, acne, and uneven skin texture. Ravinage, by contrast, is a gentler, plant-based alternative often likened to bakuchiol or other natural actives. It offers similar anti-ageing and brightening benefits but without the irritation that retinol can sometimes cause.   Retinols potency in treating severe acne and advanced signs of ageing. (Photo: Unsplash)Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant aesthetic physician at Gleneagles Hospital Bengaluru, explains that while retinol and ravinage improve skin texture, boost collagen production, and target wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, their mechanisms differ. ""Retinol binds to retinoid receptors to accelerate cell turnover and stimulate collagen synthesis,"" she notes.Meanwhile, ravinage achieves comparable results through alternative pathways, offering a gentler approach without the dryness or irritation often linked to retinol. Dr Garima Tyagi, a dermatologist at SENS Clinic, highlights that ravinage, derived from the Psoralea corylifolia plant, is rich in antioxidants. ""This makes it not only effective against signs of ageing but also helpful in combating pollution-induced skin damage, all while being safe for sensitive skin,"" she adds.Targeted skin concerns Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant aesthetic physician at Gleneagles Hospital Bengaluru, explains that while retinol and ravinage improve skin texture, boost collagen production, and target wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, their mechanisms differ. ""Retinol binds to retinoid receptors to accelerate cell turnover and stimulate collagen synthesis,"" she notes. Meanwhile, ravinage achieves comparable results through alternative pathways, offering a gentler approach without the dryness or irritation often linked to retinol. Dr Garima Tyagi, a dermatologist at SENS Clinic, highlights that ravinage, derived from the Psoralea corylifolia plant, is rich in antioxidants. ""This makes it not only effective against signs of ageing but also helpful in combating pollution-induced skin damage, all while being safe for sensitive skin,"" she adds.Targeted skin concerns Each ingredient caters to specific skin issues:Retinol: Best for fine lines, deep wrinkles, acne, and pronounced hyperpigmentation.Ravinage: Ideal for mild pigmentation, early signs of ageing, and individuals with sensitive or reactive skin. Dr Shitij Goel, HOD of dermatology at Shardacare-Health City, highlights retinols potency in treating severe acne and advanced signs of ageing. On the other hand, ravinage, with its anti-inflammatory properties, is ideal for sensitive or reactive skin. However, retinols strength often comes with side effects, including dryness, peeling, and redness, which can be challenging for those with sensitive skin. Ravinage provides a gentler alternative. ""Ravinage doesnt cause the dryness or irritation often seen with retinol,"" explains Dr Ruby Sachdev. Dr Garima Tyagi agrees, recommending ravinage for individuals prone to allergies or skin reactions.Long-term benefits and safety Both ingredients offer significant long-term anti-ageing benefits when used properly. Retinol, backed by decades of research, improves skin texture, reduces wrinkles, and fights acne. However, improper use can lead to irritation, dryness, and increased sun sensitivity, especially without proper sun protection. Ravinage, on the other hand, provides similar anti-ageing and brightening effects but with a gentler touch. ""Studies show its safety and effectiveness for sensitive skin,"" notes Dr Goel, though he adds that more rigorous testing is still needed to match retinol's extensive research history. While retinol may deliver faster and more dramatic results, particularly for severe concerns, ravinage stands out as a reliable, soothing alternative for those seeking long-term benefits without potential side effects. However, irrespective of what you choose, consistency and proper application are important to reaping lasting results.Trend or game-changer? Ravinages rise as a natural alternative aligns with the clean beauty movement. ""Its gentle nature and plant-based origin make it appealing,"" says Dr Tyagi. Dr Goel, on the other hand, believes its more than a trend, describing it as a game-changer ingredient for inclusive skincare. While ravinage is unlikely to replace retinol, its carving its niche. ""As both ingredients address distinct needs,"" says Dr. Sachdev. Retinol remains unmatched for serious conditions, while ravinage shines for sensitive skin and for those who want to take the natural route for flawless skin.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 16, 2025",lifestyle,2025-01-16T08:16:00,22.1,5.3

In 2016, the band performed in India for the first time at the Global Citizen Festival in Mumbai. But that was part of a larger initiative with a strong focus on global causes like poverty eradication, gender equality, and education.

 Fast forward to 2025, and Coldplay is set to return to India with their Music of the Spheres World Tour - a performance that is galaxies apart from their previous visit, in more ways than one. While their 2016 performance at the Global Citizen Festival was part of a multi-artist charity event, Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres tour is a full-circle moment, entirely centred around them. This time, fans can expect an unparalleled and immersive experience dedicated solely to their music and vision. The band’s setlist, production, and captivating themes draw directly from their ninth studio album, and it promises an unforgettable journey through sound and emotion. Social media has already ignited excitement, with viral Instagram Reels giving fans a glimpse into what’s in store - a concert experience like no other, filled with mesmerising visuals, heart-stirring performances, and unforgettable moments. A spectacle of sound, light, and technology Besides their vast playlist that boasts songs about love, loss, hope and joy, Coldplay concerts are often touted as “an experience of a lifetime” for their spectacular sound and light theatrics, not to mention their mind-blowing cutting-edge technology.

 With their Music of the Spheres tour, the band has taken live performances to a new level with interactive wristbands, stunning augmented reality visuals (the moon glasses have all our hearts), and larger-than-life stage designs. Each concert feels like stepping into a cosmic wonderland, with vibrant lights synchronised to the music and planetary-themed visuals enhancing the narrative of their album.

 This level of immersive production was absent in their 2016 performance, where the focus was more on their music and their role in the Global Citizen campaign. With Music of the Spheres, Coldplay is delivering a deeply curated concert experience that brings their celestial vision to life across the world (and we are assuming the magic to happen in India too). Sustainability at its core If your carbon footprint concerns you, you will be happy to know Music of the Spheres tour has sustainability at its core. Coldplay has taken significant steps to reduce the carbon footprint of their tour, including the use of renewable energy, solar-powered stages, and biodegradable confetti. The tour also encourages fans to travel sustainably, which is especially relevant in a densely populated country like India. India’s love for concerts is on the rise Over the past decade, global stars like Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, and U2 have performed in India, marking the nation’s emergence as a hotspot for international music events. In 2023, India also welcomed the iconic Lollapalooza music festival, drawing massive crowds and cementing its place on the global concert map. With Coldplay returning to the country for their Music of the Spheres World Tour this year, the love for concerts is reaching a crescendo (the calender will vouch for it). This could also mean bigger international stars making their way to India, which wasn't the case even two-three years ago. So, if you have a ticket to Coldplay’s Mumbai (or Ahmedabad) concert, consider yourself lucky—your journey to A Sky Full of Stars is officially beginning soon.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 16, 2025Trending Reel

Imagine chopped tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños, and seasoned chicken, topped with dressings like guacamole, salsa, sour cream, or mayonnaise. Drooling already? Thanks to its tantalising appeal, this trend has made its way from the West and has gone viral in India as well. Think of it like a chaat, but with chips instead of the regular murmura or papdi. Or, loaded nachos...but on the go (and with crisps of your choice). This BYOC (Bring Your Own Chips) trend is sweeping across several Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, and Surat. Premium restaurants as well as street food vendors are embracing it. Even Lay’s India jumped on the fad and recently launched their first food truck in Delhi to highlight creative and delicious ways to enjoy their range of chips.

 Ever made Kurkure Chaat at home? If you have, you know it’s an explosion of flavours that’s simply irresistible! “This trend is known as ‘walking tacos.’ People love it because it combines convenience, customisation, and bold flavours. The ability to personalise their tacos with a variety of toppings and sauces makes it a fun and interactive dining experience,” says Karan Wasan, owner of Grapi, a Delhi eatery specialising in coffee and Italian cuisine.

 His restaurant is one of the pioneers of the BYOC trend in India, going viral across social media platforms for making this unique concept widely accessible. Wasan introduced the concept in November at his restaurant, with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian toppings for Rs 200 and Rs 230 respectively. “Customers can choose from classic options like salsa, guacamole, sour cream, and shredded cheese, as well as unique toppings like pickled jalapeños, corn relish, and chipotle crema. For those looking for healthier options, we provide low-fat Greek yoghurt, fresh veggies, and a variety of greens. Our menu also includes gluten-free and vegan-friendly toppings to accommodate dietary preferences,” Wasan shares.

 



BYOC customisation at Grapi, New Delhi.
Does it make your packet of chips healthier? Since a lot of fresh vegetables and chicken are added to chips, many think it is a healthier way to eat your chips. Priya Paliwal, Chief Dietician, Dietetics, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Delhi, explains: “On the positive side, you are adding lean proteins, fibre-rich vegetables, and healthy fats that can enhance the nutritional value of chips. Instead of just having a packet full of calories, you're getting some amount of vitamins, protein and fibre.” However, experts also have a word of caution. Many tend to go overboard with sauces and mayonnaise while getting their chips customised.  “It may seem like a healthier option, but it's not. It's important to remember that the base is still a packet of chips, which are high in calories, salt, and unhealthy fats. Adding chicken might boost the protein content, but if it's cooked in unhealthy oils, it can negate any potential benefits,” adds Simrat Kathuria, CEO and Head Dietitian at The Diet Xperts. “It would be wiser to add lots of vegetables as a damage controller, which brings the goodness of fibre. Then eggs and chicken can be added to up the trend game with lean proteins. The loophole, however, is the addition of sauces, creams, and mayonnaise,” adds Karishmma Chawla, Functional Medicine Nutritionist and Lifestyle Educator. Experts warn that loading up on sauces like mayonnaise can significantly increase the calorie, sugar, and unhealthy fat content, leading to weight gain and a higher risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. The high levels of unhealthy fats, salt, and sugar can also negatively impact gut health, potentially causing digestive issues and other health problems.What to keep in mind Even if you are adding veggies and protein to your chips, “keep it only as a cheat meal,” suggests Chawla. Moreover, balance it by eating healthier food throughout the day. Furthermore, the addition of a heavy amount of unhealthy and processed sauces is definitely a bad idea. Consider replacing those with healthier alternatives like hummus, guacamole or dips prepared with yoghurt. “Your dips can be made from hung curd with herbs and spring onions or sesame tahini. The key is to avoid high-sugar and high-fat sauces or dips that may not be well-tolerated by your gut,” says Chawla. For a healthier twist, Paliwal suggests opting for baked and whole grain chips, makhana or homemade vegetable chips. “Now you can pair these with fresh toppings like grilled chicken & veggies and yoghurt-based sauces,” she says. Remember, moderation is your best friend when it comes to enjoying chips – with or without healthy toppings.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 17, 2025ALSO READ |  Virat Kohli's chhole bhature next to a wrap cart in Delhi, Indian street food is getting a health upgradeTrending Reel

For many, as the golden years approach, it could mean spending their retirement in serene overseas locations, basking in the sun, and enjoying a slower pace of life. But what if we told you that this aspiration can be achieved through retirement visas - specialised permits designed for retirees who wish to reside in foreign countries?  These visas not only allow people to live abroad but often come with additional benefits that enhance the retirement experience.‘The chill visa’ The retirement visa is not a new concept. In fact, it has been around for quite a while but has gained popularity recently, as more people gravitate towards slow living and retirement abroad. Interestingly, the first country to introduce a formal retirement visa programme was Costa Rica. This Central American nation established its retirement visa, known as the Pensionado Visa, in the early 1980s. The Pensionado Visa allows retirees with a stable pension income to reside in Costa Rica, making it a pioneer in offering such a dedicated visa for retirees.

However, just two years before he died, this ""hypothetical"" acid was first prepared in 1851 by German chemist Adolph Strecker and Russian chemist Nikolai Nikolaevich Sokolov in the lab. Over the years, glycolic acid was used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent. In nature, glycolic acid comes from sugarcane and can be found in some fruits like grapes and vegetables like beets. But it was only in 1992 that this acid entered the cosmetic industry when Avon launched the ANEW skincare line containing glycolic acid. The viral acid  If there’s one active ingredient that has made its way into every beauty enthusiast’s social media feed (guilty), it has to be glycolic acid. Not only for the face, but this skincare ingredient is going viral for its multi-purpose usage. This AHA, which is more useful than your BFF’s advice, is known to have various benefits like:
Lightening dark underarms, knees, and elbows
Helping with dandruff removal
Getting rid of strawberry legs
Acting as a deodorant
Boosting collagen
Brightening your skin
Acne 
 Another reason why it went viral, is that it’s recommended not only by influencers but also by dermatologists on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Recently, it has gained hype in India as well.

 Today, you can find glycolic acid everywhere. From big brands to pharmacy brands, it’s now available all around India.But how does glycolic acid work? Glycolic acid is a potent alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) known for its exfoliating and collagen-boosting properties. Dr Ruben Bhasin Passi, consultant, dermatology, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, explains, ""It works by dissolving the glue that binds dead skin cells together, allowing them to slough off.""  Dr Trupti Agarwal, a consultant of dermatology at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital tells India Today that this process promotes cell turnover, which helps with skin renewal. By removing the outer layer of dead skin, glycolic acid uncovers a brighter, more even skin tone and encourages collagen production, which is crucial for youthful skin.

 But can glycolic acid really solve all your skincare and body care woes? We broke down each benefit of the acid with expert inputs:What do experts have to say? Exfoliation and texture improvement ""Glycolic acid penetrates deeply to exfoliate and promote smoother skin,"" says Dr Agarwal. Its ability to break the bonds between dead skin cells enhances cell turnover, leading to a renewed, brighter complexion. A 2013 scientific review also shows that the effectiveness of glycolic acid as a chemical peel can help to deal with acne, due to its exploitation properties. However, according to the study, stronger concentration usage (than what we get in our serums) should be done under expert supervision. A May 2020 study also says the same.  Collagen stimulation  Dr Aparna Santhanam, a Mumbai-based dermatologist, shares, ""Glycolic acid stimulates fibroblast activity (it is a kind of cell that produces collagen), increasing collagen production. This not only improves firmness but also reduces fine lines over time."" Brightening and evening skin tone  Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist, and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics, Mumbai, says, ""It helps even out skin tone, and tackles signs of ageing such as dark spots and wrinkles by deeply penetrating the skin."" Hyperpigmentation and dark spots  Dr Agarwal explains, ""glycolic acid inhibits the tyrosinase enzyme (It is an enzyme that controls the production of melanin, the pigment that gives colour to skin, hair, and eyes), reducing melanin production. This makes it effective for treating hyperpigmentation, melasma, and post-inflammatory marks.""

 Deodorant use  Dr Santhanam explains, ""Glycolic acid lowers skin pH, preventing odour-causing bacteria from thriving."" The above-mentioned May 2020 study further shows that this bacteria-killing feature can help prevent odour.  Strawberry legs The dark spots or bumps on the legs, often caused by ingrown hair, can benefit from glycolic acid’s exfoliating properties. It helps to clear clogged pores and smooth out the skin’s appearance. Dark neck, knees, and elbows  Dr Agarwal says these areas tend to have thicker skin that can darken over time due to friction or build-up of dead skin cells. Applying glycolic acid can help fade hyperpigmentation and create a more even skin tone. Side effects While glycolic acid is effective, it is not without potential drawbacks. Some of the potential side effects include: 
Redness   
Burning   
Dryness   
Peeling   
Increased sun sensitivity 
How to add it to your skincare routine For choosing the right product, Dr Rinky Kapoor suggests, ""Start with a glycolic acid toner, serum, or cream at a lower concentration, such as 5-10%. Gradually increase usage as your skin tolerates it."" Application steps
Cleanse: Begin with a clean, dry face.
Apply: Use a thin layer of glycolic acid product, avoiding the eye area.
Moisturise: Follow with a hydrating product to balance the effects.
Protect: Always use sunscreen during the day to guard against UV damage.
 PS: This glycolic acid is also used in the chemical peel facials (20-70 per cent) that you can avail at clinics. Don't forget to: 
Start with a patch test to rule out irritation.
Combine glycolic acid with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid to balance its effects.
Remember...
Avoid combining it with other potent actives like retinoids, vitamin C, or benzoyl peroxide in the same routine to prevent irritation.
Limit use during pregnancy unless advised by a dermatologist.
Bottomline Glycolic acid is a game-changer in skincare due to its exfoliative, hydrating, and rejuvenating properties. Whether you’re addressing body concerns like dark knees or strawberry legs or facial issues like acne or pigmentation, this powerhouse ingredient delivers excellent results when used correctly. But, experts suggest that you should always balance its use with proper hydration and sun protection to maximise benefits and minimise risks.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 18, 2025

It can be some vague posts about not being loved, a selfie from a hospital, targeted quotes, or just a string of sad songs. While it is normal for people to express their pain on social media, when they present an exaggerated picture through their posts with the mere intention of seeking attention or gaining sympathy, it is called ‘sadfishing’.

Those with low self-esteem or an inadequate offline support system are also more prone to practising this trend. “Gaining attention or sympathy is the major reason why people do it. Sometimes, however, teenagers may also do it to boast to their friends that they can fool society or that many people are concerned about them,” shares Dr Rajiv Mehta, Vice-Chairperson (Psychiatry), Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi. The increased dependence on digital platforms to build social media connections is also a reason why people indulge in sadfishing.

 “Humans are social animals, and they always expect society to be around. But as we are progressing more into the 21st century, they are becoming lonelier. The virtual world has become the real world; to beat that loneliness and to ventilate their feelings, people share such posts on the Internet,” adds Dr Mehta. According to him, individuals with borderline personality traits or those with fewer social friends than virtual friends, and people mostly glued to the digital world, are more likely to sadfish on social media. Such people are also more prone to anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Do you know sadfishing has also been used by several celebrities as a marketing move? In 2019, Kendall Jenner posted about her struggle with acne, and it eventually turned out to be part of a marketing campaign. It was then that the term sadfishing was coined as a journalist with Metro used it in her piece covering the marketing stunt. Sadfishing is also common in relationships. It is mostly present when direct communication is weak between partners, indicating a lack of emotional safety or trust.

 “It could look like posting exaggerated emotional struggles online instead of communicating directly with a partner,” says Ruchi Ruuh. Turning to social media for sympathy can create unnecessary misunderstandings within the relationship. In some cases, sadfishing can actually be beneficial as it helps find support and can help mental health when the person is also actively working towards finding a solution to their issue. It can also provide an outlet or temporary relief to genuinely distressed people. “In other cases, it could become a mechanism to bypass the real issues and seek real solutions through professional help. It can make individuals dependent on vague external validation. Regular sadfishing can lead to backlash, scepticism, or bullying. This can worsen the feelings of rejection and isolation,” says Ruuh.Is there a way to identify sadfishing, though? A series of emotional posts can at times be a cry for help as well. In case you are really confused and concerned, it is better to talk to the person. “The idea is not to shame someone who's struggling but also not to get manipulated by it. Genuine cries for help often lead to actionable steps like seeking support, while attention-seeking posts may lack follow-through,” says Ruuh. Meanwhile, she also shares some ways you can identify if someone is sadfishing on social media:

 Posts often lack clear details or context about the issue and look empty and vague.


 Regular dramatic or overly emotional posts without any actionable solutions. The posts seem unauthentic and lack substance.


 Posts seem designed to attract comments or reactions rather than genuinely seeking help.


 The issues seem unserious when they are followed by happy posts or them partying or chilling with friends.

Dealing with sadfishing Dealing with sadfishers, especially when you are unsure of their intent, can be tricky. You don’t want to hurt someone but at the same time don’t want to be manipulated. The first attempt, experts say, should be to talk to the person and understand the intensity of the incident/situation. “Counsel the person accordingly. If their intent was just to gather attention, ask them to face reality and make them understand that it is not a matter of boasting or fooling others. Otherwise, when they genuinely need help, no one will come forward, just like the classic fable of the boy who cried wolf,” says Dr Mehta. You can also suggest therapy or counselling if the struggles seem genuine and recurring. Lastly, remember Ruchi Ruuh’s suggestion: “Sometimes if it all seems recurring and manipulative, it's best to establish boundaries; empathy is good, but attention-seeking behaviour shouldn't be enabled.”Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 19, 2025

Can Indian schools face a similar problem?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/as-sweden-shifts-back-to-books-is-india-next-in-the-digital-learning-struggle-2667181-2025-01-20,"Digital learning was once touted as the way forward. However, 15 years after replacing books with computers, Sweden is now investing €104 million to bring back printed textbooks. The reason? Officials believe the digital-first approach has failed to develop fundamental skills like reading and writing. Once again, computers are being set aside to make room for traditional textbooks in the curriculum. In a country like India, where we often look to the West for inspiration, this decision raises important questions. What impact might Sweden’s shift have on India? Moreover, how prevalent is digital learning here, and has it penetrated deeply enough to affect students in the same way?The Swedish perspective After Sweden introduced its digital learning in schools, schools in Ireland followed suit. However, the Swedish government, after experimenting with digital-first education for over a decade, recognised a worrying trend: students' reading and writing skills were slipping. Minister for Schools Lotta Edholm emphasised the value of analogue environments for developing foundational skills, announcing a significant investment in reintroducing textbooks and traditional teaching methods. This doesn’t mean Sweden is abandoning technology altogether—it’s about striking a balance. UNESCO has similarly cautioned against over-reliance on digital tools, advocating teacher-led, in-person learning.India: A digital paradox in education India, with its socio-economic diversity and vast student population, faces unique challenges in integrating digital learning. According to Praneet Mungali, Trustee of Sanskriti Group Schools, while initiatives like the Right to Education and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan have improved access to education, reading habits remain largely confined to textbooks. For millions of students, particularly in rural areas, digital education remains a distant dream due to limited resources. Meanwhile, urban schools are increasingly adopting digital tools, creating a stark divide. Anu Singh (name changed), a teacher at a reputed Delhi school and a mother of two, shares, “In India, we are still in the blackboard teaching era, and textbooks are an integral part of most students’ curriculum. Unless it’s an IB school, where digital learning is fully integrated, access to such resources is limited. Yes, many students have access to phones at home, but that’s where the problem arises. While some use them for better understanding of topics, parental discretion is crucial in this regard.” She agrees with Mungali’s views, adding that for many students, owning a textbook itself is a luxury, making the idea of relying on digital learning seem almost unreal.Are we reading less? In India, the problem is not with digital learning, but the dominance of visual media. According to a report by the National Literacy Trust (NLT) organisation in 2024, which included over 76,000 responses, shows that only 34.6% of children aged 8 to 18 enjoy reading in their free time. Last year’s annual streaming trends report by Amazon Fire TV revealed that Indians now spend an average of over four hours per day binge-watching content on their Fire TV devices. With the number of smartphone users in India crossing the 1 billion mark, 90% of them prefer consuming video content online. The increased screen time among students isn’t a result of schools adopting digital learning; rather, it stems from excessive exposure to content on OTT platforms. As digital content consumption rises, traditional reading appears to be declining—a pattern mirrored globally. Arzoo Wadhawan, Clinical Psychologist at Artemis Hospitals, highlights several factors:
Instant gratification: Platforms like Netflix offer quick, visual entertainment requiring less cognitive effort.
Attention spans: Social media and multitasking culture reduce deep, focused engagement with texts.
Shift to shorter formats: Blogs, tweets, and audiobooks cater to modern lifestyles, but compromise critical thinking and concentration.
The role of libraries, policies and book fairs However, Swagat Sengupta, CEO of Oxford Bookstores, offers a more optimistic view, observing that readership is not declining uniformly. “We see dynamic footfalls from children, Gen Z, and beyond,” he says, crediting initiatives like book fairs and literary workshops for cultivating lifelong reading habits. India’s libraries, both public and school-based, are critical in bridging the gap. Yet, many lack adequate funding or modern management. Mungali advocates for investments in schools and public libraries to make books accessible to all socio-economic groups. Government schemes like the National Mission on Libraries provide a starting point, but much more needs to be done.Screen time and learning Sweden’s return to textbook policy stems from growing evidence that screen time may hinder foundational learning. Wadhawan explains, “Frequent multitasking rewires the brain, reducing focus and deep reading abilities.” India, too, sees rising concerns over excessive screen exposure among children, making a balanced approach to technology essential.The way forward India’s challenge isn’t digital learning itself, yet numbers reveal a decline in readership. A mother of a Class VIII student, soon to be promoted to Class IX, shares her experience: “Every Friday, my daughter receives a book from the school library as part of their curriculum. But when she comes home, the book ends up in her drawer, untouched. Instead, she uses her phone—whether for homework, gaming, or watching videos. The library book eventually goes back unread. I believe, we need stronger incentives and creative strategies to cultivate a reading habit, which is becoming increasingly difficult with each passing day.” Experts suggest:
Strengthening school libraries: As hubs for analogue learning, these can nurture reading beyond exams.
Promoting family reading: Making reading a social activity can counteract OTT-driven habits.
Gamifying the reading experience: Apps that combine books with interactive elements can engage tech-savvy students.

60fb5b63-9bff-44b2-a773-32fbd9d8698b,Can two spoons of rum at night cure your winter cough?Many believe drinking rum or brandy with warm water can help deal with coughing during winter. But what do doctors say?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-two-spoons-of-rum-at-night-cure-your-winter-cough-2667458-2025-01-20,"“When my father brought home a bottle of rum this winter, I was a bit surprised because he doesn’t drink. When I asked him about it, he said it was to keep his cough under control,” says Vansh, a 27-year-old businessman from Delhi, to India Today. “This incident also took me back to my childhood, as my father would give me a teaspoon of brandy at night during peak winter whenever I had a cough or cold,” he adds. Vansh’s father is not alone in believing that a bit of rum or brandy can help cure a winter cough. It, in fact, is a popular home remedy in India as well as in the West. Remember when Shah Rukh Khan offered cognac (a type of brand) to a shivering Kajol in the film 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'? So did Rishi Kapoor to Sridevi in 'Chandni'.

 



A still from the film 'Chandni'.
 The most common way to drink rum for a cough involves making a sort of Hot Toddy (a cocktail). Boil water with spices like cinnamon, cloves, and star anise, add a bit of rum (30 ml), and sip it slowly.What doctors say It is believed that drinking rum or brandy can soothe a sore throat and clear cold-induced congestion. Regardless of what age-old remedies suggest, doctors do not recommend consuming any kind of alcohol as a treatment at all. Drinking rum with hot water, doctors say, only provides symptomatic relief. The consumption risks outweigh any benefits. “It gives you a little warmth which provides symptomatic relief. It is not used for treating any viral infections like a cold and cough. Using rum on a regular basis can lower the immunity,” Dr Atul Kakar, Chairperson of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi. Dr Mriganka Bohra, General Physician, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Jaipur, explains that alcohol found in rum dilates the blood vessels, resulting in a sensation of warmth. “It may have a mild numbing effect on a sore throat. When combined with ingredients such as honey, lemon, or spices, it could provide some comforting benefits. Nonetheless, these benefits are only surface-level and do not offer a genuine remedy,” adds Dr Bohra.Impact on health  The impact of consuming alcohol, even in small quantities, is significant. “Alcohol, including rum, puts a considerable strain on the liver, which is tasked with processing it. Even minimal consumption can lead to inflammation, particularly in those who already have liver issues like fatty liver disease. Consistent use, even in what seems to be harmless amounts for 'therapeutic purposes,' can result in liver damage over time,” Dr Saad Anwar, Senior Consultant Gastro, Gastro Surgery, GI Onco Surgery and Advance Laparoscopic Surgery, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Kanpur. Since alcohol can impair the immune system, it increases the risk of infections rather than offering protective benefits.

 Health experts also highlight more risks of consuming alcohol to treat winter cough and cold; it can disrupt sleep, irritate the stomach lining, and lead to dehydration. “These conditions can further aggravate cold symptoms. Alcohol can also negatively interact with medications often used to treat colds, such as antihistamines or pain relievers, which can result in adverse side effects,” adds Dr Bohra.What to do instead? On the contrary, drinking herbal tea, doctors say, can provide similar comfort. Research also suggests this. In a study conducted in 2008, participants reported immediate relief from symptoms of cough, runny nose, and sneezing upon consuming a hot beverage. “Relying on alcohol as a 'solution' for winter illnesses is not only ineffective but may also lead to addiction and long-term health complications. Instead, prioritise proven remedies and seek guidance from a medical professional for ongoing symptoms,” suggests Dr Anwar. Keep yourself hydrated, take proper rest, drink warm fluids and try steam inhalation when you are down with a common cold or cough during winter, for doctors say these are far more effective than drinking rum or brandy.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Must Watch

— Oli London (@OliLondonTV) January 20, 2025 But whether Melania's daytime inaugural attire will become part of the Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection remains uncertain. She had previously contributed to the collection in 2017. The Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection is one of the most popular and enduring exhibits at the National Museum of American History in Washington DC. Not just inaugural outfits, the collection gives people an insight into the personal style and influence of America’s first ladies. Now, to the inaugural ceremony. Donald Trump arrived at the US Capitol on Monday and has been sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, marking a stunning political comeback after his felony convictions. Traditionally, the ceremony is held outdoors at the Capitol, but this time, due to dangerously cold temperatures, it was held indoors. The inauguration was attended by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama, and outgoing President Joe Biden.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 20, 2025Must Watch

Usha Vance, Jill Biden and Ivanka Trump championed monochromatic looks with their elegant sartorial picks. Usha Vance made a stylish appearance on Inauguration Day, where her husband, JD Vance, was sworn in as the Vice President of the United States. Usha Vance, the Second Lady of the US, kept it warm yet stylish in a pink Oscar de la Renta ensemble – a custom cashmere coat with a matching scarf. She completed her look with statement floral earrings and blush-toned suede boots that complemented her outfit’s subtle palette. She also wore matching gloves and carried a small clutch in a neutral shade.

 She tied her tresses in a sleek bun and rocked minimal makeup. Usha, who traces her origins to Andhra Pradesh, was born in California. She attended Yale Law School, where she met JD Vance in 2013. The couple got married in 2014 after graduating from Yale Law School and have three children together. An accomplished trial lawyer who has worked at Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP in San Francisco and Washington, DC, Usha has been instrumental in her husband's political journey. Ahead of Inauguration Day, Usha made a fashion statement in a stunning strapless gown as she hosted a special dinner at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, along with her husband, JD Vance.

 She wowed in a custom-made Oscar de la Renta gown featuring a sweetheart neckline and dazzling floral accents. Inauguration Day witnessed several fashionable moments, including First Lady Melania Trump’s sharp and edgy look in a tailored coat, skirt, and blouse set with a statement hat. Her ensemble was an American amalgam, as it hailed from New York-based designers Adam Lippes (outfit) and Eric Javits (hat). She, however, ditched the complete monotone appeal by adding a subtle pop of white to her ensemble.

In stark contrast to her former fashion model days, Melania put forth a poised and graceful presence with her sartorial picks during Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day ceremonies. Her sharp selection of silhouettes this time made it clear: she is no longer the first-time FLOTUS whose style once stirred quite a few controversies. Though, a hint of drama is still an imperative part of her personal style. Yes, we are talking about her Inauguration Day hat that not only hid her eyes (half of her face, actually) but also got in the way when Trump tried to kiss Melania at the oath ceremony.

 She cut a crisp image and coordinated Donald Trump's outfit in a navy blue ensemble for Inauguration Day. What she wore was a double-breasted mid-length coat over a contrasting white blouse. She styled it with opera gloves, blue heels and the statement hat. Her ensemble was an American amalgam, as it hailed from independent New York-based designers Adam Lippes (outfit) and Eric Javits (hat). The FLOTUS then switched into a glamorous strapless gown designed by her stylist Herve Pierre for the Commander-in-Chief Inaugural Ball. She wowed in a strapless off-white dress which was accentuated with striking black straps and a side slit. To complete the look, she opted for a Harry Winston diamond brooch and wore it as a choker.

I saw a comment on Instagram about using lube as a primer for acne-prone skin because it is water-based,"" says Arnakshi Patgiri (@arnakshi_kashyap on Instagram), a beauty content creator and influencer. Over the last few years, the beauty industry has seen a slew of crazy hacks and tricks for both skincare and makeup (as a lifestyle writer, I’ve come across plenty). Last year, we saw an influencer using their own poop as skincare. Now, within just the first month of this year, we are witnessing a bizarre trend: using lube (yes, that) on the face as a facial primer. The concept of using a facial primer—the first step in applying makeup to ensure pores are minimised and makeup goes on smoothly—isn’t new. In fact, in the West, people have been using lube as a primer for quite some time. However, for many Indians, it became a crazy new idea when Arnakshi posted about it on Instagram. In her video, she explains how it has worked for her acne-prone skin and doesn't cause irritation since it is designed for the most intimate areas of the body. The video soon went viral. While some were confused, others ‘sexualised’ the content and cracked jokes about it. However, there were those who agreed that lube could indeed double as a primer. Have a look at the video:

A trend from the West As we told you, the concept of applying lube on your face as a primer is not new. In fact, makeup artist and TikToker Lukas Kohutek first used lube as a primer in February 2019. By 2021, #lubeprimer had millions of views on TikTok. But it took some time to catch up, even in the West. Now, it seems like the trend has finally arrived in India, with a lot of people becoming curious about the trend.  What are experts saying?Even though the idea of using lube might be appealing, as it’s cheaper (no pink tax), it seems like experts are not happy with the idea of using it on our faces. advertisementDr Trupti Agarwal, consultant, dermatology, Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, explains that while lubricants, particularly those with silicone or water-based formulas, might mimic the texture of some commercial primers, they are not formulated for this purpose. “Silicone-based lubes create a smooth, slippery texture, resembling primers used for makeup or skin smoothing. However, their effectiveness depends on the type of lube and skin type. They may offer a temporary solution, but they are neither reliable nor designed for long-term use,” she says.Dr Sarita Sanke, senior consultant, dermatology department, Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital, tells India Today, “Makeup primers are formulated to be non-comedogenic and safe for prolonged facial application. Lubricants are intended for intimate use and may contain ingredients that irritate or compromise the skin barrier.”Dr Mikki Singh, medical director and founder of Bodycraft Clinics, further adds that while lubricants may temporarily create a smooth base for makeup, they lack the benefits of true primers. “Ingredients like glycerin and hydroxyethylcellulose might create a smoother surface, but lubes are not designed for facial skin and can trigger adverse reactions,” she says. advertisementThe potential side effects according to expertsUsing lubricants as makeup primers may seem harmless, but experts point out several risks. According to Dr Manjot Marwah, dermatologist, director of LHR clinics and founder of EnagenBio: Water-based lubes: These contain gels and humectants that may leave a crinkly, sticky feel on the skin once they dry, especially if applied heavily. They might accentuate fine lines or texture, particularly around delicate areas like the eyes.  Oil-based lubes: While these can provide a smoother application, they have a higher chance of clogging pores and causing breakouts (comedones), especially if you’re prone to acne.Other side effects include: 
Clogged pores and breakouts: Dr Agarwal explains that lubes can aggravate skin issues, especially in individuals with oily or acne-prone skin.
Irritation and allergic reactions: Dr Sarita Sanke warns that certain lubricants contain fragrances or preservatives that can irritate facial skin. “Prolonged use can also disrupt the skin’s natural barrier,” she adds.
Potential sensitivity: Its prolonged use, may cause irritation or sensitivity, particularly in individuals with pre-existing skin conditions.
Residue and removal challenges: Lubes may leave behind an oily or greasy residue, requiring more effort to cleanse thoroughly.

Smooth texture for makeup application: Temporarily blurs fine lines and creates a smooth finish, especially beneficial for individuals with dry skin.
Inexpensive alternative in a pinch: Serves as a quick, affordable fix when you're out of primer and need a smooth base.
Hydration (water-based lubes): Works as a moisturiser and enhances makeup adherence due to its hydrating properties.
Minimal shine control (silicone-based lubes): Provides a smooth, oil-free look for a few hours, particularly in the T-zone or areas prone to shine.
How to pick a primer (which is not a lube): If you're looking for a skin primer for makeup application, it's always best to choose a product specifically designed for this purpose, according to Dr Agarwal. He suggested to look for: 
Hydrating primers if you have dry skin.
Pore-filling primers if you have large pores.
Mattifying primers for oily or combination skin.
These products are formulated to provide specific benefits without the side effects associated with lubricants.

Draped in an exquisite jamewar (Kashmiri fabric) saree by ace designer Tarun Tahiliani, she embraced traditional roots with complete flair. The saree, crafted over 1,900 meticulous hours, features intricate aari work and delicate French knots, creating a stunning interplay of texture and detail. She paired it with a modern tapered collared blouse, accented at the neckline with a chunky diamond brooch. The ensemble showcased Tahiliani's signature style - a seamless amalgamation of tradition and contemporary elegance.

 To achieve its flawless drape, heritage jamewar shawls were embroidered by skilled craftsmen, hand-painted, printed, and further enhanced with intricate embroidery. Her saree was a modern interpretation of the traditional jamewar, adorned with the finest kashidakari, a traditional Kashmiri embroidery technique that uses thread and beads to create intricate patterns and designs. Her look was completed with a pair of pearl-and-diamond-studded chandbalis. Simple and effortless, yet undeniably striking.

 Earlier, ahead of the Inauguration Day, Nita and Mukesh Ambani attended a private reception hosted in honour of President Trump. For the reception too, Nita Ambani chose the traditional route. She wore a custom-designed Kanchipuram silk saree by Swadesh. Woven by National Award-winning master artisan B Krishnamoorthy, it features intricate and meticulously chosen motifs like the Iruthalaipakshi (double-headed eagle symbolising Lord Vishnu), Mayil (representing immortality and divinity), and the mythical Sorgavasal animal trails (embodying the charm of India’s rich folklore).

 To give it a more contemporary look, she styled the saree with a Manish Malhotra velvet blouse which featured a built-up neckline and intricate beadwork along the sleeve. Her accessories were a statement in themselves, with the necklace being a standout piece. It featured a rare parrot-shaped pendant crafted in Southern India in the 18th century. Adorned with emeralds, rubies, diamonds, and pearls, the pendant was set using the traditional gold Kundan technique, enhanced with vibrant red and green enamel, perfectly complementing her look. Mukesh and Nita Ambani were invited to Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony as the 47th President of the United States, which took place at the Capitol in Washington DC, on Monday. The guest list also included Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Tesla's Elon Musk, Apple's Tim Cook, and Google's Sundar Pichai.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 22, 2025Must Watch

8bd47660-61a4-418d-b308-1f109e304123,What should an Indian teenager's skincare routine look like?Not giving a damn about skincare at all or overwhelming your skin with every possible viral skincare product - indulging in either route - is not ideal for teenagers.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/what-should-an-indian-teenager-skincare-actually-look-like-2668610-2025-01-22,"If you are somebody who grew up in the 90s, you might remember how television ads dominated your skincare choices. That was the time when products like fairness creams, so-called game-changing peel-off masks, and ‘miraculous’ acne-clearing face washes gained popularity. Did those products do more harm than good to your teenage skin? Many dermatologists would agree. Cut to now, a similar story is unfolding but with a twist. TV ads have been replaced by social media influencers, who promote new products almost daily. For instance, Kabeer Kanojia, a 14-year-old student from Delhi, learnt about salicylic acid on Instagram rather than in a Chemistry class. He is keen on buying salicylic acid and a viral charcoal mask to manage his acne, but his pocket money doesn’t allow him to buy it yet. Gargy, an 18-year-old, has her beauty shelf replete with several viral products like snail mucin and retinol serum. Research suggests Gen Z and Gen Alpha are immensely splurging on beauty and skincare.Skincare and new-age teens Teens and tweens are flocking to Sephora stores; they are already concerned about issues like “anti-aging” and “collagen-boosting.” Meanwhile, dermatologists warn that following elaborate skincare routines, overusing products, and mindlessly following influencers can be harmful to the skin, especially for teenagers.

 



Teenagers should avoid using harsh scrubs and strong skincare ingredients. (Photo: Pexels)
“Social media plays a huge role in teens today as influencers and trailers promote serums and active chemicals as the need of the hour in skincare. Having knowledge is empowering, but it usually lacks context on skin types, possible side effects, and usage,” says Dr. Chandani Jain Gupta, Dermatologist and Aesthetic Physician, Elantis Healthcare, New Delhi.She suggests teenagers focus on a simple skincare routine that works for them instead of following any social media trend and making impulsive purchases.Owing to the increased craze in skincare among growing children, dedicated teenage skincare brands have also cropped up across the world. The trend is also catching up in India.“Teenagers often face specific concerns like acne, oily skin, and dandruff. Our focus was to develop products that are not only clinically proven to be effective but also completely safe for this age group. We prioritised gentle yet potent ingredients to address these concerns without compromising their skin health,” says Vidya Madhavan, founder and CEO, Y Play Z.For teenagers, the focus should be on establishing good habits and tackling common issues like acne and oiliness.“Due to puberty, teenagers, of course, go through hormonal imbalances. However, what has contributed to the increased rate of acne in teenagers today is their lifestyle and food habits. Fifteen to twenty years ago, cases of acne and hormonal imbalances were not as prevalent as they are now,” says Dr. Rishne Gupte.advertisement“The main reason remains hormonal imbalance, which has become more common in teenagers. Additionally, physical activity, which was much more common 20 years ago, has also declined. Junk food consumption has increased dramatically, and so have rates of obesity and conditions like PCOD,” Dr. Gupte adds.Doctors want teenagers to understand that skin is an organ, and it gets affected by hormonal imbalances or poor nutrition. Experimenting too much with the skin will only make it more sensitive and lead to breakouts.So, what is an ideal skincare routine for teenagers?First things first, do things that you can control – food habits, sleep routine, and exercise.As for products, all that a teenager essentially need is:
Cleanser
Moisturiser
Sunscreen
The products you buy should be ideal for your skin type and be non-comedogenic (a product contains ingredients that won't clog or block the pores on your skin). Products usually have it mentioned on the packaging.“A skincare routine of an Indian teen should be concentrated on cleansing, hydration, and protection from the sun. Begin by using a face wash that would gently remove the dirt and oils from the surface of the face. Then moisturise with light, non-comedogenic moisture to keep hydrated throughout. Use sunscreen, even at home, and avoid harsh scrubs; use exfoliants once a week,” says Dr. Gupta.advertisementSocial media videos are convincing enough for teenagers to start investing in active ingredients. But do they even need any? Well, those dealing with acne may benefit from salicylic acid and adapalene – that’s what doctors say.“Adapalene is particularly suitable for teenagers. Additionally, salicylic acid works well when paired with a moisturiser and sunscreen. Teenagers don’t need a lot of things. Simple lifestyle modifications, healthy eating habits, and the use of one or two active ingredients alongside a moisturiser and sunscreen can effectively manage acne,” says Dr. Gupte.As they grow older, teenagers can focus on solutions targeted at specific concerns (if any), like dryness or uneven skin tone.PS: Bonus (but basic) skincare tips for teenagers:
Do not touch or squeeze the pimple
Wash your face twice a day
Drink plenty of water
Use non-comedogenic products
Manage stress and exercise regularly
Eat a healthy diet
Clean your makeup properly before sleeping
If you use makeup regularly, allow your skin to have makeup-free day
Consult a doctor for medications if your acne does not disappear.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Trending Reel 
 “Social media plays a huge role in teens today as influencers and trailers promote serums and active chemicals as the need of the hour in skincare. Having knowledge is empowering, but it usually lacks context on skin types, possible side effects, and usage,” says Dr. Chandani Jain Gupta, Dermatologist and Aesthetic Physician, Elantis Healthcare, New Delhi. She suggests teenagers focus on a simple skincare routine that works for them instead of following any social media trend and making impulsive purchases. Owing to the increased craze in skincare among growing children, dedicated teenage skincare brands have also cropped up across the world. The trend is also catching up in India. “Teenagers often face specific concerns like acne, oily skin, and dandruff. Our focus was to develop products that are not only clinically proven to be effective but also completely safe for this age group. We prioritised gentle yet potent ingredients to address these concerns without compromising their skin health,” says Vidya Madhavan, founder and CEO, Y Play Z. For teenagers, the focus should be on establishing good habits and tackling common issues like acne and oiliness. “Due to puberty, teenagers, of course, go through hormonal imbalances. However, what has contributed to the increased rate of acne in teenagers today is their lifestyle and food habits. Fifteen to twenty years ago, cases of acne and hormonal imbalances were not as prevalent as they are now,” says Dr. Rishne Gupte. “The main reason remains hormonal imbalance, which has become more common in teenagers. Additionally, physical activity, which was much more common 20 years ago, has also declined. Junk food consumption has increased dramatically, and so have rates of obesity and conditions like PCOD,” Dr. Gupte adds. Doctors want teenagers to understand that skin is an organ, and it gets affected by hormonal imbalances or poor nutrition. Experimenting too much with the skin will only make it more sensitive and lead to breakouts.So, what is an ideal skincare routine for teenagers? First things first, do things that you can control – food habits, sleep routine, and exercise. As for products, all that a teenager essentially need is:
Cleanser
Moisturiser
Sunscreen
 The products you buy should be ideal for your skin type and be non-comedogenic (a product contains ingredients that won't clog or block the pores on your skin). Products usually have it mentioned on the packaging. “A skincare routine of an Indian teen should be concentrated on cleansing, hydration, and protection from the sun. Begin by using a face wash that would gently remove the dirt and oils from the surface of the face. Then moisturise with light, non-comedogenic moisture to keep hydrated throughout. Use sunscreen, even at home, and avoid harsh scrubs; use exfoliants once a week,” says Dr. Gupta. Social media videos are convincing enough for teenagers to start investing in active ingredients. But do they even need any? Well, those dealing with acne may benefit from salicylic acid and adapalene – that’s what doctors say. “Adapalene is particularly suitable for teenagers. Additionally, salicylic acid works well when paired with a moisturiser and sunscreen. Teenagers don’t need a lot of things.

The answer to this question can vary for different people. For some, it might be calling their favourite person. For others, it could be indulging in self-care or cleaning, while some may prefer complete isolation with their chosen piece of content. This content can be anything, and it generally depends on the type of person you are. For some, it could be watching a mystery thriller, while for others, it might be enjoying a comedy. Such is the case with Muskan Gupta, a 25-year-old from Assam, who, when she’s sad, her mind craves something light-hearted that can create a ‘distraction’ from the ‘real world’. For many youngsters, particularly Gen Z, like Muskan, this is where Samay Raina, the Kashmiri stand-up comedian who has been the talk of the town, comes in. For some, like Muskan, Samay is the solution when they are feeling low. Meanwhile, others, like Shambhavi Jha, a fashion designer from Delhi NCR, who prefers Arijit Singh’s music when she’s sad, tells us she watches Samay and his show India’s Got Latent while having her dinner or lunch, or as a pastime with friends. India’s Got Latent, a spin-off of India’s Got Talent (both shows have the same IMDb rating of 5.4), is a reality show that is consumed massively by young Indians, who have a preference for dark comedy.

Samay initially carved a niche following, especially during Covid-19, due to his chess videos on YouTube. He made the game, which was considered ‘a gentleman’s game’, into a 'non-serious' one due to his funny commentary. But he received mass validation after winning Comicstaan Season 2, and his name grew exponentially when he started his own reality show in 2024. But what was different?

 Samay initially carved a niche following, especially during Covid-19, due to his chess videos on YouTube. He made the game, which was considered ‘a gentleman’s game’, into a 'non-serious' one due to his funny commentary. But he received mass validation after winning Comicstaan Season 2, and his name grew exponentially when he started his own reality show in 2024. But what was different? Well, unlike the other Indian reality shows which are often called out for being scripted, Samay’s show started taking credit for being 'unscripted, unfiltered and raw'. “He talks like how we talk to our friends, so it’s relatable on the ground level,” says Reejak, a 20-year-old student and content writer from Delhi. Reejak says that he rediscovered Samay during the pandemic when he started streaming YouTube videos with Tanmay Bhatt but initially found him ‘annoying’. But now, Samay's content has become Reejak’s ‘comfort space’.What is the reason? India Today spoke to various youngsters who have a paid subscription to India’s Got Latent, and we asked them what makes Samay and his style of comedy so likeable, and the word ‘relatable’ popped out the most. Like Reejak mentioned, since Samay talks to everyone, even celebs and contestants, as his friends, on his show, it makes him more relatable. “I like Samay because of his unique sense of humour, relatable content which actually resonates with many people. His comic timing is also very good and his ability to address social issues with a light-hearted approach is brilliant,” says Shambhavi. Today, Samay has millions of followers online. But how did he and his show become so relatable and gain such a huge following online in a short time? The answer lies in the dark...humour. The hype around dark humour Dark humour and roasts are not new concepts in India. In fact, All India Bakchod (AIB) was known for a similar format, but we all know how it ended. But now it seems like audiences are loving this similar format (times have changed). We also spoke to various experts and tried to decode the sudden love of ‘dark humour’. Now, even though in a recent podcast with Prakhar Gupta, Samay mentions that he would not refer to himself as someone who only does dark  humour- characterised by grim or satiric - the internet and his fans do refer to him as someone who is known for the same, due to his viral clips online.     Shreya Kaul, a counselling psychologist, explains that what makes him so relatable is his comic style, which is undeniably quick, sharp, and witty, particularly in live, improvisational formats. She says he excels in turning situations around and delivering retorts that leave audiences in splits. For many, this quick wit is both impressive and aspirational. Watching someone handle banter so effortlessly can be both entertaining and inspiring, offering a sense of connectedness. “Comedy, especially dark comedy, has always been a powerful tool for connection and catharsis. It can make taboo topics more approachable and help people confront their fears. In the controlled environment of a comedy show, audiences often feel safe to laugh at things they wouldn’t in other contexts,” she explains. Shreya further explains that Samay’s show allows for greater creative freedom than traditional, heavily curated television comedies like The Great Indian Laughter Challenge. “Platforms like YouTube provide more room for experimentation and risk-taking, which Samay has leveraged well,” she says. Dipra Agarwal, a counselling psychologist at Allen Career Institute, Bangalore, who is also a paid member of Samay’s India’s Got Latent, explains that audiences find him relatable because of the way he has presented himself. “I saw his podcast with Prakhar and realised that Samay was bullied a lot as a kid. That explains a lot, and why he is this way,” she says. Dipra mentions that if you look closely, you will find that it is Samay’s journey that is so appealing to people- a young boy, who was bullied so much and now has turned his life and  is achieving dreams not only for himself but for his parents as well. Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist, says roast culture and dark humour have gained prominence recently, partly because they tap into frustrations and societal stereotypes that many suppress. By bringing these issues to the surface in a relatable way, such humour, resonates with audiences.

 Another reason which makes Samay more likeable, according to audiences and experts, is his ability to crack jokes on himself. “Samay’s skill in engaging with his co-performers and handling their jabs as well as his own, creates a sense of camaraderie for the audience,” says Shreya.advertisementThe dark side of dark humourDark humour and shows like India’s Got Latent are not for everyone which is why it is also very easy for some people to get offended.“Disrespecting people with disabilities is not dark humour,” says Tinkesh Kaushik to India Today, the world’s first triple amputee to trek Everest Base Camp. Tinkesh has previously called Samay Raina out for a particular joke when one of the contestants made fun of people with disabilities and everyone—the judges including Raina—was seen laughing.“If I am making fun of myself and my insecurities, that is okay. Someone who is not disabled and has privilege can’t be disrespecting people and our community, especially now when we have worked so hard for raising awareness and sensitivity amongst people,” says Tinkesh.For others, the problem lies in the crass language that is being used.Here are two such examples (which made headlines):
The first one is Samay Raina and Kusha Kapila’s controversy, which arose from a roast segment on the show 'Pretty Good Roast' last year, where Raina made jokes about Kapila’s recent divorce from Zorawar Ahluwalia. The jokes were deemed ‘dehumanising’ by Kapila, leading to significant backlash against both comedians. Following the episode, which included insensitive remarks about her personal life, Kusha blocked Samay on Instagram, indicating ongoing tension between them. In response to the controversy, Kusha expressed that she did not approve of the jokes beforehand and sat through the roast as a show of resilience, although she later regretted it. This incident has strained their friendship, with Samay acknowledging that it will take time before they can move past it and laugh about the situation again.
In a separate controversy, Samay Raina faced criticism after a contestant on his show, India’s Got Latent, made a joke about Deepika Padukone’s struggles with depression in November 2024. The joke sparked outrage amongst viewers and mental health advocates, leading Raina to address the backlash publicly. But Samay being Samay, he posted a story saying, “To everyone who is outraging on Twitter, one request: Could you please outrage in my YouTube comment section so I get some ad revenue from the traction, at least.”

The lines are blurryHow do you define what is problematic and what is not? The line is thin and a blurry one. Experts also find it confusing. “The idea is to be funny and express oneself, and what one is as a person generally shows through jokes. Being hurt and offended are by-products that I don’t deliberately seek nor try to avoid beyond a certain sensibility,” explains Navin Kumar, a stand-up comic.Even though Samay's fan following often say that dark humour is all about taking things lightly, often at times people have called him and his show out for crossing a line.Absy says, “As a neurodivergent and disability-affirmative therapist, I often find that certain types of humour, like that showcased in Samay Raina’s performances, bring up complex emotions for me. His jokes—and sometimes the overall tone of his shows—tend to reinforce systemic ableism. This, in turn, can contribute to feelings of exclusion or the normalisation of pro-exclusion humour.”Shreya, on the other hand says, that while some find solace in dark humour, especially as a coping mechanism for mental health struggles, others take offence. For viewers, dark comedy can offer a voyeuristic thrill, as it pushes boundaries many wouldn’t dare to cross themselves.“This duality is intrinsic to the genre—what is empowering and liberating for one can feel offensive or insensitive to another,” concludes Shreya.Where do you draw the line?

Contrary to popular belief, what you wear and how you carry yourself are not limited to displaying your penchant for style. These seemingly small choices could lead to health issues over time. For instance, have you ever thought about how carrying a heavy handbag on one shoulder could be putting excessive pressure on a single arm and damaging your nerves? There is a term for it – heavy-purse syndrome. But without even realising your daily purse’s impact on your health, you carry it every day to work or college. This is not the only way health and fashion collide. Read on to learn about more fashion mistakes that can negatively affect your health: Heels You probably already know that wearing high heels is not a great idea. It can lead to long-term issues like lower back pain, neck strain, knee pain, and can also affect posture. Women, especially those in their thirties or those going through menopause or perimenopause, should avoid wearing heels regularly because they experience changes in bone density during that time.

 



Pointy high heels for everyday wear? Doctors say no. (Photo: Pexels)
 Wearing heels causes the calf muscles to contract and shorten while stretching the muscles along the shin bone. This imbalance can put significant stress on the knees, leading to severe knee pain. Furthermore, wearing pointy heels and shoes can also cause problems like bunions, corns, ingrown toenails, and arthritis. No matter how stylish they look, keep heels for occasional purposes. “In terms of usage on a daily basis, one should opt for footwear that provides comfort, support, and strict alignment. Pick shoes with cushioned soles to absorb shock, adequate arch support to prevent strain, and a roomy toe box to allow natural movement of your toes. Look for lightweight, flexible materials and a slightly elevated heel (about 1–2 cm) for optimal posture,” suggests Dr Yogesh Kumar, director, orthopedics, joint replacement, and sports injury, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, New Delhi. Heavy bags A lot of us tend to blend practicality with style and put our entire world in our bags. And it is mostly one arm or shoulder that bears the brunt. This improper handling of a heavy bag every day can lead to a bevy of health issues. “Lifting a bag with heavy weight leads to a long-lasting ill impact on muscle and bone health. Bags that are heavy in weight put a lot of strain on body parts such as the shoulders, neck, and spine, leading to muscle imbalances, poor posture, and chronic pain over time,” says Dr Mihir Thanvi, consultant, orthopedic, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Jaipur.

 



Lifting Heavy handbags and shoulder bags can lead to a long-lasting ill impact on muscle and bone health. (Photo: Pexels)
 He further explains that carrying a bag in the forearm increases stress on the elbow and wrist, potentially causing joint inflammation or nerve compression. To prevent these health issues from developing, consider carrying only essential items in your bag to make it lighter, or switch sides every day. You can also switch to a backpack with padded straps to distribute the weight evenly. Stretching on a regular basis can also be helpful in such cases. Tight clothing (think skinny jeans, corsets) Ever heard of petticoat cancer? It is linked to tying the petticoat or dhoti too tightly and subsequent inflammation in the waistline. This happens only when tight-fitted clothing, especially around the waist, is worn repeatedly. It is just one example of how tight clothing can be fatal. Health experts also warn against wearing garments like tight skinny jeans and corsets to keep numerous health problems at bay. “Frequent or prolonged use of such clothes (like tight skinny jeans) could constrict the flow of blood to certain body parts and create numbness or tingling in the legs, medically referred to as meralgia paresthetica. Compressing the stomach will also result in acid reflux, bloating, or indigestion. Tight jeans can also produce a warm and moist environment around the vaginal region, predisposing it to infections by yeast or causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women,” warns Dr Ashu Yadav, senior consultant and head-radiation oncology, Andromeda Cancer Hospital, Sonipat. You can, however, wear tight, sultry clothes like corsets occasionally. “During occasional use, tight clothing is non-hazardous, but one must look for loose, comfortable wear to ensure ease and avoid any long-term harm through proper breathing and good circulation for overall health,” adds Dr Yadav. Ill-fitted and synthetic undergarments When it comes to undergarments, the fabric and fit matter significantly. Synthetic and non-breathable materials are a strict no, as they can trap moisture and lead to skin irritation, fungal infections, or urinary tract infections. Additionally, poor-fitting bras strain the shoulder and neck areas. You surely don’t want to experience that discomfort and pain. Contact lenses without proper care Don’t we all love how coloured lenses instantly add a touch of oomph to our look? Even clear lenses (non-coloured ones), for that matter, allow eyes to take center stage instead of being overshadowed by bulky frames.

 



When not used properly, contact lenses can be harmful to the cornea. (Photo: Pexels)
 However, if one doesn’t maintain proper hygiene or follow the basic lens-wearing norms, it can be disastrous. Wearing contact lenses for too long, not cleaning them properly, or taking a shower with lenses on can lead to eye infections, dryness, and even damage to the cornea.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Must Watch

Through the open doors The harmless phantoms on their errands glide, With feet that make no sound upon the floors.                                 - - Haunted Houses by HW Longfellow Imagine this: you’re locked in a room with your cousins, catching up after ages. Suddenly, one of them starts narrating eerie incidents or the plot of a spine-chilling horror film they recently watched. The room’s energy shifts - curiosity builds, adrenaline kicks in. You’re scared but glued to every word. By the end of the night, you’re too spooked to walk back to your room, yet you’d do it all over again for the thrill. Paranormal tourism taps into this same human craving for fear, curiosity, and adventure. For those still scratching their heads over this one-of-a-kind travelling trend, dim the lights, and lean in close as we tell you more aboutParanormal tourism (and its hype abroad) As its name suggests, it’s visiting a “haunted” or mysterious location to explore the unknown. It blends thrill, education, and cultural curiosity, and it involves guided tours to places believed to have a supernatural significance. These tours focus on removing superstitions and understanding paranormal activities scientifically. For instance, TravelChannel.com defines this as “the niche within the travel industry where tourists attend paranormal-themed conventions and festivals, investigate famously haunted locations, and join ghost tours or haunted pub crawls through cities”. Others have referred to it as visiting places that embody belief systems beyond normal views. It is a well-established niche in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, where there are provisions for proper guided tours, overnight stays, and events at these so-called “haunted” locations that cater to those intrigued by the supernatural. An iconic ""haunted"" destination in the US is the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which was also the inspiration behind Stephen King’s cult classic The Shining. The place is known for ""ghost"" sightings and eerie occurrences. The hotel, interestingly, offers guided ghost tours that have become a key part of its charm. In the UK, it has to be Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. The location is infamous as 'Britain's most haunted historic castle'. Chillingham Castle boasts some of the highest levels of paranormal activity in the country, according to the castle's official website. Ghost tours and ghost hunts here run all year round.

 In a study published in 2016, researchers found that 38% of people incorporated paranormal activities, such as ghost tours or haunted houses, into their vacations. Even more surprisingly, 44% of travellers chose supernatural sites as their primary holiday destinations.The appeal of paranormal tourism in India We all love indulging in thrilling experiences, though the meaning of thrill and adventure can be very subjective. While some get their adrenaline rush from adventure sports like paragliding, zip-lining, or bungee jumping, for others, the eerie excitement of visiting a location steeped in scary, spine-chilling stories is the ultimate thrill. Just like you might have a long-pending Goa trip on your bucket list to take with friends, there are people—believe it or not—who dream of visiting a “haunted” location with their group. For instance, many paranormal thrill-seekers in India have Rajasthan’s Bhangarh Fort, Kuldhara village or Kurseong’s Dow Hill on their bucket list, drawn by the absolutely spooky stories woven around these places over the years.

 Mrinalini Sengupta, an engineering graduate from Kolkata, is a believer who loves exploring places wrapped in an enigma. She says, “I love reading about these places online, in books, and of course, the stories woven around these ‘haunted’ locations give you goosebumps. However, I can’t go there alone, and my friends aren’t really interested in seeking this kind of thrill. I try to look for groups or communities that host these kinds of heritage walks or guided tours to such locations. It’s nice to see how places abroad have mainstream tourism built around this.”

 Dushyant Singh Panwar, a heritage explorer and cultural revivalist who became a walk leader for Delhi Tourism’s ‘haunted’ heritage walk, shares, “People are getting tired of the mundane and the banal nowadays. It has everything to do with the plethora of options available. So-called ‘haunted’ heritage walks or guided tours to ‘haunted’ locations offer them a novel experience that stays with them for its sheer unconventionality. Therefore, I see a rise in demand for these niche experiences. ”

advertisementIndian travellers' interestSo, where does paranormal tourism in India stand? Dushyant Singh believes, it is still at a nascent stage vis a vis the West, and this perspective primarily comes from an urban context.“In rural India, however, local legends and myths have thrived for centuries. North Kerala and South Coastal Karnataka (Tulunadu) boast a rich tradition of Theyyam and Bhoota Kola. These Hindu traditional dance forms are deeply spiritual, with performers embodying a divine aura and sometimes becoming possessed by ‘spirits.’ These spirits not only bless the rural community gathered but also indulge in fortune-telling, creating a deeply immersive cultural experience,” he adds.

 



Bhoota Kola also known as the worship of Daivas or Bhootas or Demi-Gods, is an ancient ritual prevalent among the Tulu-speaking community in the Dakshina Kannada districts in Karnataka. (Photo: travel_karnataka)
advertisementAn interesting example of this cultural heritage is the Kannada superhit movie Kantara, which brought the hypnotic power and mystery of Bhoota Kola to the attention of the entire country and even the world. Similarly, the traditions surrounding many peer/fakir sufis who inhabit holy graves (dargah) and tombs also hold a paranormal essence, blending spiritual and mystical practices that have existed for ages.However, he mentions, “Despite the deep cultural and paranormal significance of these practices, tourism hasn’t been actively built around them. However, with rising awareness, these beautiful traditions are slowly being discovered by a wider audience. People are now increasingly planning trips to witness and experience the allure of Theyyam, Bhoota Kola, and other age-old traditions that blend spirituality, mysticism, and cultural heritage.”Things are changingWhile India is still warming up to the concept, there are pioneers like the Parapsychology and Investigation Research Society (registered under the Government of India), which, since 2016, has been working to fill this void and provide thrilling, curated experiences to people seeking them, says Sarbajeet Mohanty, co-founder, paranormal investigator, and demonologist, who also featured as a paranormal expert on MTV’s reality show Dark Scroll.Scare Events Private Limited, the company co-founded by Mohanty and his partner Puja, launched Ghost Encounters Tours (GET) in 2022 under the parent organisation PAIR. “With a focus on removing superstition and spreading awareness, these tours we curate blend adventure, education, and scientific exploration to offer a unique experience. We’ve been doing this for years now and know the world of the paranormal inside out. Our aim has always been to remove fear rooted in ignorance and provide authentic, safe encounters for those genuinely interested,” says Mohanty.Unlike regular tours, Ghost Encounters Tours are exclusive, accommodating only 10-15 participants at a time. Participants must complete a form and undergo a brief screening process to ensure only those genuinely curious and prepared for the experience join. Safety, respect for the unknown, and an authentic paranormal experience are the pillars of these tours conducted by Mohanty and his team.

Before setting off on the guided tour, participants are required to attend a workshop that equips them with tools to distinguish between natural and supernatural phenomena. Using scientific equipment and psychic insights, these workshops aim to demystify paranormal activities and debunk myths.

 So, where does paranormal tourism in India stand? Dushyant Singh believes, it is still at a nascent stage vis a vis the West, and this perspective primarily comes from an urban context. “In rural India, however, local legends and myths have thrived for centuries. North Kerala and South Coastal Karnataka (Tulunadu) boast a rich tradition of Theyyam and Bhoota Kola. These Hindu traditional dance forms are deeply spiritual, with performers embodying a divine aura and sometimes becoming possessed by ‘spirits.’ These spirits not only bless the rural community gathered but also indulge in fortune-telling, creating a deeply immersive cultural experience,” he adds.

 



Bhoota Kola also known as the worship of Daivas or Bhootas or Demi-Gods, is an ancient ritual prevalent among the Tulu-speaking community in the Dakshina Kannada districts in Karnataka. (Photo: travel_karnataka)
 An interesting example of this cultural heritage is the Kannada superhit movie Kantara, which brought the hypnotic power and mystery of Bhoota Kola to the attention of the entire country and even the world. Similarly, the traditions surrounding many peer/fakir sufis who inhabit holy graves (dargah) and tombs also hold a paranormal essence, blending spiritual and mystical practices that have existed for ages. However, he mentions, “Despite the deep cultural and paranormal significance of these practices, tourism hasn’t been actively built around them. However, with rising awareness, these beautiful traditions are slowly being discovered by a wider audience. People are now increasingly planning trips to witness and experience the allure of Theyyam, Bhoota Kola, and other age-old traditions that blend spirituality, mysticism, and cultural heritage.”Things are changing While India is still warming up to the concept, there are pioneers like the Parapsychology and Investigation Research Society (registered under the Government of India), which, since 2016, has been working to fill this void and provide thrilling, curated experiences to people seeking them, says Sarbajeet Mohanty, co-founder, paranormal investigator, and demonologist, who also featured as a paranormal expert on MTV’s reality show Dark Scroll. Scare Events Private Limited, the company co-founded by Mohanty and his partner Puja, launched Ghost Encounters Tours (GET) in 2022 under the parent organisation PAIR. “With a focus on removing superstition and spreading awareness, these tours we curate blend adventure, education, and scientific exploration to offer a unique experience. We’ve been doing this for years now and know the world of the paranormal inside out. Our aim has always been to remove fear rooted in ignorance and provide authentic, safe encounters for those genuinely interested,” says Mohanty. Unlike regular tours, Ghost Encounters Tours are exclusive, accommodating only 10-15 participants at a time. Participants must complete a form and undergo a brief screening process to ensure only those genuinely curious and prepared for the experience join. Safety, respect for the unknown, and an authentic paranormal experience are the pillars of these tours conducted by Mohanty and his team.

One way to achieve this is by doing something out of the ordinary while travelling. This can include activities that provide an adrenaline rush, such as river rafting or paragliding. But behind the thrill lies a sobering truth – the risks involved, especially when safety measures are overlooked. Take, for instance, the tragic story of Shivani Dable, a 27-year-old from Pune. She visited Goa to explore and create memories, but her trip ended in disaster. On 19 January, Shivani and her instructor, 26-year-old Sumal Nepali, lost their lives when their paraglider plunged into a ravine shortly after taking off from a cliff in Keri village, North Goa. A video of the incident has also gone viral.  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. On 7 January, a similar tragedy struck near Manali. Tadi Mahesh Reddy, a 32-year-old, was attempting to take off at Raison when a sudden gust of wind caused his glider to descend instead of ascend, leading to his death.advertisement

— @Rationalviews (@pramod_writes) January 21, 2025 What’s common in these accidents? Both establishments offering these adventure sports were operating illegally. This alarming fact highlights a larger issue plaguing adventure tourism in India.The rise in adventure sports and tourism With more Indians embracing travel, the demand for thrilling, adrenaline-packed activities has surged. Adventure sports such as paragliding, skydiving, rafting, and trekking have gained immense popularity. These activities cater to those seeking excitement, whether on land, in the air, or on water. From mountaineering to hot-air ballooning, the options are endless. The adventure tourism market in India was valued at approximately Rs 15,000 crore (USD 2 billion) in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 17 per cent to reach Rs 35,000 crore (USD 4.6 billion) by 2028.But... This growing enthusiasm has been accompanied by a significant rise in accidents at tourist hotspots. January alone witnessed several incidents, many of which resulted in severe injuries or loss of life. The majority of paragliding mishaps share two key factors: inexperienced pilots and illegal operators. Travellers often face difficulty distinguishing between legitimate and unregulated operators. Without clear guidelines or visible certifications, they inadvertently put their lives at risk. The risks are not limited to paragliding. On 20 May 2024, Ranjini N, a 35-year-old nurse, fell approximately 30 feet when the zipline cable snapped during an activity at Jungle Trailz Resort near Harohalli, Bengaluru. She was part of a group outing with colleagues. Investigations revealed that the resort lacked basic safety measures, such as helmets and first-aid facilities. A police complaint was subsequently filed against the resort management. River rafting, another popular adventure sport, has also seen its share of tragic incidents. Earlier this month in Rishikesh, a hub for adventure enthusiasts, a 33-year-old woman from Delhi drowned after her raft overturned at the ""Golf Course"" rapid. Trapped in the strong currents of the Ganga, she could not be rescued in time, though three others on the raft were saved.

 These incidents underline the urgent need for stricter regulations and better enforcement in the adventure tourism sector. While the thrill of adventure sports is undeniable, ensuring proper safety protocols and certification is crucial to preventing such tragedies. Travellers, too, must stay vigilant and prioritise safety over cost or convenience when choosing operators. Only by addressing these issues can we strike a balance between excitement and safety in the world of adventure tourism.The rules and regulations: The current scenario In 2023, the Indian government introduced new ‘Guidelines for Adventure Tourism’, a 170-page document detailing everything from age limits for various sports to insurance requirements. Operators found violating these safety guidelines can face fines ranging from Rs 5,000 for minor offences to Rs 25,000 for serious violations. Repeat offenders may face harsher penalties or additional sanctions. In addition to these central guidelines, some states have implemented their own regulatory measures to improve safety in adventure sports. This includes judicial directives to enforce safety protocols. However, according to Vaibhav Kala, founder of Aquaterra Adventures and senior VP of the Adventure Tour Operators Association of India (ATOAI) many operators fail to adhere to these policies or find loopholes, often leading to such tragic incidents. Rakesh, the owner of a similar adventure sports establishment in Manali, who has been in this business for almost 10 years, tells India Today that in Himachal Pradesh, many individuals (inexperienced ones) are entering the adventure sports business as obtaining a licence is ‘pretty easy’. He added that officials conduct quality checks on equipment used in these activities only twice a year. “When recognised and registered operators follow the rules, most adventure tourism activities are safe and prioritise safety and responsible tourism. However, when these measures are not implemented, the consequences can be dire, just as they are anywhere else in the world,” says Vaibhav.‘It’s just bad luck’ Rakesh shares that, despite taking all precautions, such incidents sometimes occur because no one can overpower ‘mother nature’. Referring to these accidents as ‘bad luck’, Rakesh stated that such incidents could happen anywhere. However, experts seem to disagree. The CEO of Zoho, Sridhar Vembu, who recently lost his friend’s son in a paragliding accident in Himachal Pradesh’s Kullu, expressed concerns about paragliding in the region, calling it ‘risky’ and ‘accident-prone’. He emphasised the need for regulators to take a closer look at such incidents.

Yesterday I had the very sad duty to attend the funeral of Jeyesh Ram, 27 year old son of my dear friend Cibi Anand and Priya. He lost his life in a para-gliding accident in Kulu, Himachal Pradesh last Friday.

— Sridhar Vembu (@svembu) January 19, 2025 Vaibhav also pointed out that “increasing accidents due to lack of knowledge, experience, and proper registration mechanisms, guidelines, and protocols” can be resolved with effective management. He urged that we need to implement sweeping regulations aligned with Central guidelines to ensure safety and protect the country's reputation as a premier adventure tourism destination. He further emphasised the need for a unified management regime for these activities in India. This includes mandatory registration of companies, guides, and operators under a comprehensive safety management plan. ""India must act immediately to make sweeping regulations in line with central guidelines and advice. The recent accidents in paragliding are yet another sterling example of why we must protect India's reputation as a great adventure tourism destination,"" concludes Vaibhav.

 As for her glam, she kept it simple with a dewy base and nude lipstick. Her kohl-rimmed eyes, a dainty black bindi, and a side-parted hair bun with soft curls added a hint of drama to the look. Several Bollywood stars, including Sonam Kapoor, Bipasha Basu, Ananya Panday, Rani Mukerji, and Aditi Rao Hydari, turned up at the venue wearing stunning black ensembles to celebrate 25 years of Sabyasachi.

 The accessories weren’t any less dramatic. The oversized cross pendant layered with other bold necklaces screamed gothic opulence, and the chunky earrings and bold glasses added a quirky, intellectual edge to the look. (PS: We loved the stacked bangles!) Now, to that marvellous job with the hairdo! It was swept into a voluminous updo, one that would vividly remind you of Frida Kahlo.

 At the much-anticipated event, Bollywood’s who’s who arrived looking every bit gorgeous (that would be an understatement, seriously). Sonam Kapoor, Aditi Rao Hydari, Alia Bhatt, Ananya Panday, Bipasha Basu, and several other celebrities showed up to celebrate 25 years of Sabyasachi. Now, if you were to talk about how the show was, it was larger-than-life, regal, and opulent (just like Sabyasachi’s brides and stores, tell me if I’m wrong). The show’s setup was inspired by dalan bari (verandah house), which was a bow to his roots, his hometown – ‘Calcutta.’ The brand Sabyasachi is synonymous with brides, weddings, and marriages, not just in India but across countries. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Bollywood is a fan of his couture because he has dressed these divas not just on screen but for their real-life special days as well (he designed wedding outfits for Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, and Katrina Kaif).Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 26, 2025Must Watch

Following the Covid-19 pandemic, last year saw people, including Indians, travelling more than ever before. As we step into 2025, the travel landscape for Indians is poised for even greater transformation, shaped by shifting preferences and emerging trends. Here are five key travel trends that could define how Indians explore destinations, both domestically and internationally, this year. PS: This information has been gathered after speaking with travel experts and reviewing trend reports from travel agencies like Skyscanner, Booking.com, and Pickyourtrail. 1. Very mindful, very demure travel With 2024 planting the seed of mindful travel, this year is likely to witness it in full bloom. Mindful travel emphasises being aware of your surroundings, appreciating local culture, and making sustainable choices to reduce environmental impact. Both data and experts echo this sentiment. Hari Ganapathy, co-founder of Pickyourtrail, an online travel company, tells India Today, “2025 is shaping up to be ‘The Year of Mindful Wanderlust’, where travel is no longer just about destinations but about deeper connections, purpose, and personalisation.” According to Hari, this shift is driven by travellers prioritising eco-conscious escapes, milestone celebrations, and immersive experiences, fundamentally changing how journeys are planned and experienced.

 



Indians are travellers prioritising eco-conscious escapes. Photo: Unsplash
advertisementThis trend aligns with a recent Skyscanner survey of Indian travellers, where 70 per cent of respondents expressed a desire to be more mindful of their health and well-being (not just the environment) while travelling. Additionally, the survey reveals that Indians are moving beyond the traditional “treat yourself” holiday mentality, with over half (57 per cent) prioritising wellness even while on vacation.With travellers searching for the elixir of life, vacations are no longer just about unwinding. Driven by the desire for better lifestyle choices, 60 per cent of travellers are interested in longevity retreats – supercharged versions of traditional wellness itineraries that aim for long-term benefits instead of temporary fixes.2. AI = automatic itineraryAs technology advances, AI is becoming an indispensable travel companion. Skyscanner’s data reveals that 84 per cent of Indian travellers feel confident using AI tools for planning and booking, with 52 per cent using them for destination research, 50 per cent for flight bookings, 48 per cent for comparing options, and 46 per cent for inspiration.3. Layovers? Not so lay low anymoreThe days of boring layovers are over. In 2025, stopovers are becoming mini-holidays. Cities like Istanbul, Doha, and Dubai now offer free stays and discounted cultural tours, turning transit time into bonus travel.advertisementEven airports are gaining prominence. Data shows over a third (34 per cent) of travellers express interest in visiting destinations based on their airports, while 60 per cent are curious about airports offering unique experiences or facilities. From sleep pods and spas to Michelin-star restaurants and Pilates sessions, airports are evolving into destinations in their own right.

Off-beat travelOff-beat travel, a trend gaining momentum last year, is set to flourish in 2025. Data suggests Indians are increasingly exploring unique, lesser-known destinations. According to Pickyourtrail, this trend is especially prevalent among DINK (Dual Income, No Kids) couples and remote workers, who are avoiding crowds by travelling during off-peak seasons.For example, Europe in autumn or tropical paradises before the monsoon are becoming popular choices. Travellers are favouring quieter months for a more relaxed experience and cost savings.Indian tourists are also veering away from traditional hotspots like Goa, opting instead for places like Gokarna and Karwar that offer authentic experiences.

If not, here’s the answer: each of them, at some point in the last decade, visited India to rejuvenate at some of the country’s most renowned wellness retreats. While we often look to the West for inspiration, wellness tourism in India is witnessing a significant boom, in a way, actually leading the way for the world to look up to and follow. The reasons are many, but the primary driver is the increasing mindfulness around health and lifestyle. More than ever, people are focusing on holistic wellbeing, embracing practices like meditation, yoga, and traditional healing techniques. Many are also turning toward veganism, vegetarianism, or a sativic lifestyle to achieve a balance of body, mind, and soul. India, with its deep-rooted wellness heritage and diverse offerings, is perfectly poised to cater to this growing demand. So, it was but natural to experience one up close to understand what makes these retreats so life-changing and why they attract people from across the globe.At Swastik Wellbeing Sanctuary – back to the roots It’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with life’s demands these days. Our hectic schedules leave little to no room to reconnect with ourselves, our surroundings, or even to appreciate the small joys of life. Perhaps, that’s the first thing we realised on Day 1 at the wellness sanctuary – the importance of appreciating the little things. It was a small little ritual before the meals that brought back fond memories (more about that later).

 



Swastik Wellbeing is located in Peacock Valley, Khed, Pune, surrounded by the Sahyadri Hills and the serene Khadakwasla backwaters.
advertisementDr Rajesh Srinivas, general manager at Swastik Wellbeing, says, “Indians have understood the importance of wellbeing - not just physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual. With growing affluence and an increasingly young workforce wellbeing holidays are the way to go. These provide a quick reboot and return to work with more engagement and productivity.” Dr Rajesh Srinivas, general manager at Swastik Wellbeing, says, “Indians have understood the importance of wellbeing - not just physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual. With growing affluence and an increasingly young workforce wellbeing holidays are the way to go. These provide a quick reboot and return to work with more engagement and productivity.” Now, Swastik Wellbeing is located in Peacock Valley, Khed, Pune, surrounded by the Sahyadri Hills and the serene Khadakwasla backwaters, far removed from the maddening city crowds. Spanning across 51 acres, the property is a haven of lush greenery, exuding peace and tranquillity – a stark contrast to chaotic city life. At Swastik, a range of personalised experiences are on offer, each rooted in the core values of Health, Wealth, Love, Bliss, and Spirituality. Even greetings here are not a casual “hello” or “hi.” They are imbued with a deep sense of spirituality. As a gesture of respect and connection, people greet one another with atma naman (my soul acknowledges your soul).A day in the wellness ‘sanctuary’ For someone aiming to bring a change in their life, mentally or physically, Swastik provides the much-needed awakening your body and soul require. Your days will be spent in the retreat as per your dincharya (daily routine), which will be prescribed to you once you have consulted with the experts.

 



The day starts here with an early morning fun workout session under the guidance of the experts.
 Your consultation with the Ayurvedic practitioner will be the deciding factor for many things, including your diet and the therapies you undergo there. Now, that could range from halotherapy (salt therapy) to resonance therapy (sound healing), arogyam massages, or meditation. However, everything depends on how long you plan to stay at the retreat; they offer tailored plans starting from 1 to 14 nights. From IBS to fertility, from PCOS to menopause, they have programs to accommodate seekers willing to transform themselves both physically and spiritually.

 



A room perfect for resonance therapy, no?
 You will find yourself engaging with sounds of different frequencies in a dark room that has been designed to look like ‘space’ and witness your healing process. In another instance, you might be meditating in a large room surrounded by candles, experiencing pin-drop silence while chanting Vedic mantras. A day at Swastik Wellbeing typically starts at 7 in the morning and wraps up by 9 at night.

 



A day spent at Swastik Wellbeing will be replete with different activities.
The food – Nothing less than a gourmet affair If someone mentions that your meals for the next few days are going to be unprocessed, unrefined, and naturally sourced, with no white sugar, no fried foods and white salt, the thought might excite you about eating clean. However, the constant worry of what if the food is bland might also cross your mind. Nonetheless, you are going to enjoy your meals at Swastik’s in-house restaurant, Rasa, because not only is the presentation impeccable, but the flavours could give any Michelin-star restaurant a run for their money. There is no use of wheat in the cooking, and almost everything is made using millet and fresh, farm-to-table vegetables. There is no concept of a fridge in their kitchen, as everything sourced for the day is finished well in advance, with preparations beginning afresh the next day.

 I initially thought that checking into a wellness retreat would mean meals devoid of flavour, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. The food is delicious and far exceeded my expectations. Chocolate mousse cake, gnocchi, cabbage rolls, dim sum - who on earth imagines a wellness retreat’s menu to be this promising and full of taste? The three days I spent there, I don’t recall them repeating any dish at any mealtime. Each meal, each dish, was crafted to perfection, with the menu specifying its carb, protein, and calorie content. If you’re someone who worries about controlled portion sizes (core tenets), fret not—they are more than happy to serve you a second or even a third helping based on your appetite. While Swastik aims to take charge of your wellbeing, starving you to achieve that is definitely not their approach.advertisementArchitectureOne of the highlights of the retreat is the villas, or guhas, designed for guest accommodation. Currently, 64 villas are functional, and the setup feels straight out of The Shire—a fictional region in JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, home to the hobbits.

What does that mean for the booming concert culture in India?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/coldplay-live-streamed-a-turning-point-for-concert-culture-in-india-2671463-2025-01-28,"Just a few months ago, we were talking about the seismic shift in India’s concert culture. More and more people are now willing to invest time, effort, and money to watch global music sensations perform live. The past year—and the start of this one—has been nothing short of extraordinary for India’s live music scene. In 2024 alone, we witnessed 11 global stars headlining concerts in India. The buzz-worthy ones included Dua Lipa’s Feeding India concert with Zomato, Maroon 5’s debut Mumbai show, Bryan Adams’ five-city So Happy It Hurts tour, and Alan Walker’s Walkerworld India tour. Though Rihanna and Justin Bieber didn’t perform for the public, their private performances at the Ambani wedding were enough to turn heads and add to the hype. Of course, any conversation about live music in India would be incomplete without mentioning Coldplay, at least that’s the case now. Coldplay concerts aren’t just events—they’re pilgrimages for fans who fight for tickets, scramble for hotel rooms, and book flights just to witness their magic live. Their Music of the Spheres World Tour this year in Ahmedabad was no different. The demand was sky-high, but what made it truly unique was the live-streaming element. For those who couldn’t make it to the stadium, the team’s decision to stream the concert gave fans across the country the chance to experience the magic. And it wasn’t a small crowd—an estimated 8.3 million people tuned in!

 This brings us to an interesting question: Are Indian audiences ready to go the extra mile to be part of live shows, or are they content enjoying the spectacle from the comfort of their homes?'Beginning of an era' Kiran Mani, CEO-digital at JioStar, reflected on the experience, saying, “This is just the beginning of an era where technology and storytelling come together to unlock endless possibilities in live entertainment.” His optimism is echoed by VG Jaishankar, co-founder and managing director of Hyperlink Brand Solutions, which handled the marketing for the Coldplay concert in India. According to him, this event has opened up new avenues for concert experiences. “India has been a key player in live experiential events, especially since the resumption of in-person gatherings post-pandemic. Live streaming has become a natural extension to enhance the reach of concerts beyond physical venue limits.” Jaishankar also highlights the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead: “While the challenges of streaming rights and copyright laws still exist, advancements in technology and network capabilities have positioned India as a leader in delivering high-quality live content. I believe we’ve already crossed the transformative moment—what lies ahead is continuous innovation and refining execution to elevate audience experiences further.”Opportunities live streaming creates The digital age ushered in a new era for live music broadcasts. In the 1990s, the internet enabled the first instances of live streaming. Over time, as internet speeds increased and streaming technologies advanced, live streaming became more popular and accessible. Platforms like YouTube and social media networks started hosting live performances, giving artists the ability to reach fans directly without relying on traditional broadcasting channels. In India, while concerts are being celebrated as a boost to the economy--Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself vouched for their positive impact--live streaming emerges as a powerful add-on to the ongoing concert culture boom. The essence of a live concert lies in its immersive experience: buying tickets, soaking in the crowd's energy, and creating unforgettable memories. However, live streaming offers a new dimension, ensuring that fans who can’t attend due to ticket shortages, travel costs, or other constraints can still enjoy the magic. Jaishankar highlights this shift, noting, “This model also creates opportunities to enhance virtual experiences using AR (Augmented Reality) triggers, allowing remote audiences to interact and feel connected to the event in new and innovative ways. While the revenue potential of live streaming is still evolving, its ability to democratise and enrich the concert experience is undeniable.”Artists’ perspective How do the artists stand to gain or lose from all of this? Well, a small data will help you understand better. According to 2024’s year-end data from BookMyShow, India's live event industry has witnessed remarkable growth, this was before Coldplay performed in India. In 2022, the country hosted approximately 19,000 live events/gigs, and live concerts were only a small part of it. The number went up significantly in 2023, with a total of 26,359 events -- a 39 per cent increase from the previous year. Additionally, audience participation in live entertainment grew by 82 per cent year-over-year in 2023. This data should put the discussion to rest. “Artists, promoters, and producers now work cohesively to expand their audience beyond the venue. While the audience for live-streamed concerts in India is still growing, it offers a chance to experiment and learn. It can help overcome geographic and economic barriers, but the success depends on seamless execution, including reliable network infrastructure and production setups. With AR-enabled experiences, organisers have the opportunity to further engage virtual attendees by adding interactive and immersive elements to the live stream,” Jaishankar explains.advertisementWhat the target audience saysSurajit Dasgupta, a product manager and passionate concert-goer, has attended live performances by U2, Joe Satriani, Kodaline, The Lumineers, Parikrama, Pentagram, and Alan Walker. He was amongst the lucky few who managed to secure tickets for Coldplay's Music of the Spheres concert in India. Interestingly, he also watched the Ahmedabad show via live stream from the comfort of his home. Sharing his thoughts, he says:""You can never, ever compare the live experience to streaming the show. If I got tickets to my favourite concert, I would never ditch them for an experience at home, no matter how comfortable it is. That said, live streaming does help bridge the gap, especially for those who want to attend but can't due to reasons galore.""He further emphasises the irreplaceable magic of attending a concert in person: ""The vibe on the ground is everything compared to sitting at home and watching. Absolutely mesmerising! People who truly want to see their favourite band live will still go, regardless of whether the concert is live-streamed or not.""However, the concept of live streaming did stir up some debate on social media. Some fans expressed frustration that after struggling to secure tickets and meting with other expenses, the concert was made available for free to a wider audience. Addressing this, Jaishankar clarifies:advertisement""Live events are constantly evolving, and streaming isn’t new—it has been successful globally for decades. However, in India, it has the potential to complement and elevate the exclusivity of live experiences by creating hybrid formats. Streaming doesn’t dilute the magic of attending in person; instead, it allows producers to expand their reach while maintaining the core essence of live events.""Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 28, 2025

The actress, who is the brand ambassador of the luxury fashion brand, arrived in an ensemble from their Spring/Summer 2025 collection, which was nothing short of a sartorial statement. Her look was an amalgamation of regal and opulent elements. Sonam opted for a monochromatic look featuring a fluid sheer dress and paired it with a faux fur coat from the house’s Resort 2025 collection. Of course, don’t forget those long black gloves for an edgier finish. The look does feel like she channelled vintage Hollywood elegance (somewhat reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn’s iconic Breakfast at Tiffany’s look).

 As far as her makeup is concerned, it was put together by makeup artist Arti Nayar. Sonam opted for a dewy base, sculpted cheekbones, and softly defined eyes to enhance her striking features. She finished it off with a pink-toned lipstick. And that gorgeous bun—did you spot the gajra though? What a way to bring together contrasting elements. While you might feel a necklace could have elevated the look, those pearl earrings, reminiscent of a kanauti, did their job brilliantly, and of course, those earcuffs!

 The look was curated by Rhea Kapoor, Abhilasha Tiwari, and Chandni Modha.

Having attended Dior’s shows in the past as an admirer, stepping into this role as their first South Asian ambassador feels truly surreal.” “Dior has always been more than just a brand to me—it has been an integral part of my personal style journey and a creative partner in many of my films. Becoming a part of this storied legacy is both an honour and a responsibility, one that I embrace with great pride. I look forward to deepening my association with Dior and shining a spotlight on the incredible artistry of Indian and South Asian craftsmen, bringing their talent to the global stage,” she adds.

d856b5ab-54ac-4a70-857d-02c320724a02,"Male infertility on the rise: Why sperm freezing is gaining popularity in IndiaSperm freezing is a simple, life-altering option that ensures men can overcome challenges and secure their path to parenthood. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/male-infertility-on-the-rise-why-sperm-freezing-is-gaining-popularity-in-india-2671587-2025-01-29,"In the 1960s, India had a fertility rate of 5.92. This means that, on average, a woman would bear almost six children if she lived through her childbearing years. This figure was significantly higher than the ‘replacement level’ needed to maintain a stable population. Fast-forward to today, and there has been a significant decline in the fertility rate. According to the latest data, the fertility rate has dropped to 2, in 2023, which is just 0.1 point below the required replacement level (the average number of children a woman needs to have to replace herself and her generation). However, experts warn that even this small difference could eventually lead to a population decline.Why the drop? This drop in fertility rate can be because of various reasons, apart from the sheer rise in couples who don’t want to have kids. Apart from this, both data and experts suggest that there has been a clear increase in infertility amongst Indians.  For men, this means, if we go by the definition provided by The World Health Organization (WHO), “the inability to make a fertile female pregnant after one year of unprotected intercourse”. In India, male infertility has become a significant concern, contributing to 40-50 per cent of infertility cases amongst young couples. This number is 15 per cent world wide. We asked various experts regarding the reason for this stark difference between India and various other nations, and the answers simply seem to come down to one thing: the changing lifestyle.

advertisementDr Durga G. Rao, co-founder and medical director of Oasis Fertility, explains, ""The quality of life we lead is significantly affected by environmental factors: pollution, pesticides, food adulteration, and the air we breathe, all of which contribute to infertility. Lifestyle factors like stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, and pollution also play a role in male fertility issues, making preservation more relevant now than ever."" Dr Durga G. Rao, co-founder and medical director of Oasis Fertility, explains, ""The quality of life we lead is significantly affected by environmental factors: pollution, pesticides, food adulteration, and the air we breathe, all of which contribute to infertility. Lifestyle factors like stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, and pollution also play a role in male fertility issues, making preservation more relevant now than ever."" Dr Sheetal Jindal, senior consultant and medical director medical genetics program Jindal IVF, Chandigarh, further adds that other factors include late marriages, demanding work schedules, obesity, poor diets, and lifestyle habits such as smoking, drinking, and drug use. All these have caused, in many men, particularly in their late 20s to early 40s, a dip in sperm quality and count, leading to the growing need for fertility preservation options. This is where sperm freezing comes in. Enter: Sperm freezing  With the increasing awareness of male infertility, sperm freezing has emerged as a viable option for preserving male fertility. Sperm freezing, or sperm cryopreservation, offers a solution to preserve sperm for later use. This is relevant in cases where men have a low sperm count right now and may face infertility in the future and also particularly in cases where men are undergoing medical treatments.  Dr Nishi Singh, head of fertility at Prime IVF, says, ""For men who are facing medical treatments that could affect their fertility, sperm freezing provides a crucial lifeline. Whether it’s cancer treatments, high-risk professions, or a desire to keep their options open, men are increasingly turning to this method."" The procedure typically begins with a semen sample, which can be obtained through natural ejaculation or, in specific cases, surgical methods.

 Dr Rao, says, ""The sperm sample is processed to remove impurities and mixed with a cryoprotectant before being frozen."" This ensures that the sperm remains functional even after thawing, preserving its ability to fertilise an egg when needed. These selected sperm cells are then treated with a cryoprotectant solution, which safeguards them from damage during the freezing process. The sperm is then stored at ultra-low temperatures in liquid nitrogen, where it can remain viable for years (20 years to be precise). In India, sperm freezing has become an affordable and accessible option, with rates ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per year for storage.  For men, there are no specific challenges that they face while undergoing sperm freezing (unlike women), but there’s a stigma attached to it (more about it later). But before that, is there a rise in sperm freezing?Is there a rise in sperm freezing? The trend of sperm freezing is on the rise, even in India. While the exact statistics are harder to come by, India Today spoke to various experts, and they all seem to agree that the trend is gaining momentum.  According to Dr Singh, this trend is mostly observed in men between their late 20s and 40s. ""The rising demand is linked to lifestyle choices, medical conditions, and the increased awareness of fertility preservation options,"" says Dr Singh.

 Moreover, men who may be exposed to high-risk environments, such as in certain professions that involve long working hours or hazardous conditions, are also turning to sperm freezing, according to the experts. The option gives them the flexibility to pursue careers without the pressure of immediate family planning.advertisementThe taboosDespite the increasing awareness around fertility preservation, sperm freezing continues to face societal stigma, especially in India. The concept of male infertility is often seen as a 'blow to masculinity', making it harder for men to seek out fertility treatments or sperm preservation. Experts seem to agree too. ""In India, sperm freezing continues to face deep-rooted stigma, stemming from societal expectations that equate masculinity with unyielding fertility. The idea that a man should always be capable of fathering children without medical assistance perpetuates this taboo, discouraging many from considering sperm preservation,"" says Dr Jindal.However, just like women have claimed reproductive agency through egg freezing, challenging these stigmas is essential for creating a space where men can exercise their reproductive rights and options without fear of judgment.Rise in egg freezing tooRiya*, a 28-year-old woman with endometriosis, was advised to freeze her eggs early due to the progressive nature of her condition. advertisementAnother, a 38-year-old, Sheetal*, sought egg freezing to extend her fertility window while still searching for a partner.

97f089cb-f541-4a42-8c38-8c4161400192,"Why Indian singles are choosing concerts over coffee datesAs time passes, the way we do everything evolves—including the way we date, a survey is proof!",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/why-indian-singles-are-choosing-concerts-coldplay-over-coffee-dates-2671976-2025-01-29,"Dating is longer about just swiping right because, for Indian Gen Z (also a few Millennials), the new-age romance formula is a mix of music, shared vibes, and real-world connections. According to happn’s (dating app) latest survey*, 74 per cent of Indian Singles consider concerts their dream first date, while 67 per cent have mentioned that live music events make dating easier. As India is going big on concert culture of late (and PM Narendra Modi promoting it too), it’s clear that concerts aren’t just about the beats, fandom, or dressing up cool - they’re becoming the ultimate matchmaking hotspots.Why concerts are the new dating ground You have realised by now that dating in 2025 is way different from what it used to be, let’s say five years back. Dating today means creating memories, and experiencing things together, which could mean going to a puppy yoga session or maybe a painting session with your date. And guess what, the rise of activity-based dating is reshaping how singles connect, and music events are playing a crucial role. Whether it means vibing to Coldplay’s A Sky Full of Stars or singing along at an Ed Sheeran gig, or maybe discovering indie talent at Lollapalooza, concerts are proving to be the ideal setting for romantic sparks.

advertisement Karima Ben Abdelmalek, CEO and president of happn, says, “Gen Z is reshaping the dating landscape, and our research shows that music is at the forefront of their social lives. Indian Singles are keen on activity-based dates and looking for new icebreakers. With India's music festival season in full swing, singles have a unique opportunity to break the ice and form connections in a vibrant, real-world setting.” Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing, says, “When two people share a live music experience, they're not just watching performances; they're participating in a shared emotional journey that bypasses the usual dating hurdles. The concert environment naturally negates the pressure of constant conversation while creating multiple opportunities for genuine interaction.”The power of playlist chemistry So, what are the common traits that you look for when you bond with someone? If taste in music and artists is one of them, well, you are not alone. 48 per cent of Indian Singles admit that seeing a favourite musician in someone’s dating profile can spark an instant attraction. Music is no longer just a means of entertainment – it is a personality trait, an emotional trigger and, of course, a love language that can make or break things. The survey also highlights:
74 per cent of Indian Singles use music as an icebreaker when meeting someone new.
79 per cent believe that music sets the mood for romance, proving that your playlist choices can make or break first impressions.
76 per cent love discovering new music with someone special, turning shared gigs into potential love stories.
Why music sets the tone Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai, believes that live concerts create an unspoken language of intimacy. “Concerts are basically the new dating thing because they foster a collective emotion—whether it's sadness, happiness, euphoria, or nostalgia. The rhythm, the beat, and the shared energy create an unstructured space where people connect without words.” She further explains that the sense of synchrony in live music creates a deep sense of connection. “When you’re experiencing music with someone, you’re not just finding a date—you’re finding someone who feels like home.”Wait a minute! There is scientific reasoning too Did you know live music triggers the release of oxytocin and dopamine? Yes, that’s true. “The release of these hormones creates a natural high that people often associate with their companion. This biological response, combined with the shared appreciation for music, creates an instant connection that's difficult to replicate in traditional dating settings,” says Dr Tugnait.Final note You will probably believe it now if we say that concerts are becoming an unexpected but ideal setting for romance. You can assume this from the very craze and enthusiasm people have around concerts in India as a whole (otherwise how do explain people flying to Abu Dhabi for Coldplay concert after not securing a ticket in India?). So, if that the new trend we are looking at... so be it! **Please note: The survey was done on 2000 people from Tier 1 metro cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad)Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 29, 2025

But is it worth the hype?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/asian-influencers-are-embracing-diy-skincare-again-but-there-is-a-catch-2672055-2025-01-30,"""Run to your kitchen!""
""All you need are these kitchen staples""
""Whip up these DIY face masks with simple ingredients from your kitchen"" If beauty and skincare are your thing, your feed (like mine) is probably flooded with DIY videos of beauty influencers flaunting spotless, glass skin with nearly invisible pores, swearing that one ‘face mask’ changed their life. No, that’s not an exaggeration. Apparently, glowing skin and life-changing moments go hand in hand. These videos tend to have two things in common: first, the influencers mostly live in the West, and second, their ‘miracle remedy’ has been a ‘grandmother’s secret’ for centuries. Rice, honey, chickpea flour, and turmeric - according to these influencers- are (some of) the golden tickets to glowing skin. And for better gut health (which, of course, leads to glowing skin), the magic ingredients include garlic, ginger, turmeric, and more. These influencers spark curiosity by revealing their ‘holy grail’ skincare hacks. The videos go viral, and suddenly, everyone is raving about them. And since these magical ingredients are already sitting in most kitchens, people start slathering them on their faces or mixing them into drinks, often without any real research. Notably, these influencers often have their own brands, are going to launch one, or have an affiliation with one of the brands. Let's look at some examples. 'Okra for glowing skin' Zafeera, an influencer who goes by @byzareefa, has racked up over 4 lakh followers with just 48 posts. She’s best known for sharing face mask and drink recipes that promise glowing skin and a healthy gut, some featuring her brand. She shot to fame when one of her videos went viral, revealing the ‘secret’ behind her ‘perfect’ hair and skin. The magic ingredient? Okra. Yes, bhindi.

  In her clip, Zafeera declared, “I’ve been drinking okra water for six months, and here’s how it has absolutely changed my life [umm]. My bloating has reduced significantly because when okra is soaked in water, it releases soluble and insoluble fibre, which helps with bloating and digestion in general.” She also recommends drinking it 3-4 times a week. However, scientific evidence on okra’s benefits is pretty slim. Experts warn that overconsumption can lead to gas, bloating, electrolyte imbalances, and even kidney stones—so maybe don’t start chugging bhindi water just yet. Read more about it here. ‘The bird spit’ Another crazy trend, that also promised a glowing skin was a little bizarre, and it involves bird spit. Yes, you read that right. While some influencers swear by honey and turmeric, others have taken skincare to the skies—literally. This trend revolves around bird’s nest extract, derived from the saliva of swiftlets. Beauty influencers claim it’s packed with proteins, amino acids, and minerals that promise glass skin, deep hydration, and an otherworldly glow. This trend actually came from the kitchens of China, according to influencers.  One such advocate is Wendy Cung Ly, who went viral after crediting her flawless complexion to bird spit-infused serums and drinks.

 But before you start chasing birds with a collection jar, here’s the catch—while bird’s nest has been a prized ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, scientific evidence on its skincare benefits is limited at best. Experts also warn that mass production raises ethical and sustainability concerns. So, is bird spit the ultimate beauty elixir? Maybe, maybe not. But we have better options.  Here’s the link to know more. Horsetail for hair Israa Abdullah is a Pakistani influencer who lives in the UK. With just 800+ posts, she has managed to gather more than 8 lakh followers on Instagram. Her content? You guessed it right, DIY for hair and face masks.  One such product that she was seen promoting is her own brand of natural hair oil and toner made from horsehair, a perennial plant.  However, studies show something else. Even though, a 2010 study hinted that the horsetail could be a natural source of antioxidants and beneficial phytochemicals. But a 2019 research review concluded that there’s simply not enough evidence to rate horsetail as an effective solution for hair loss.

 So, while horsetail might pack some antioxidant power, don’t start brewing it for hair growth just yet, as its ability to regrow hair is still unsure.  Until more solid research emerges, your best bet might still be tried-and-tested hair care routines—minus the herbal guesswork. Such examples are never ending. The problem with DIY remedies DIY skincare and haircare trends might seem like the ultimate beauty hack—easy, affordable, and all-natural. But the truth is, what works for one person might not work for another. We know that the influencers promoting it have the flawless dream skin that you want to achieve, but remember:  Every skin type is different with unique sensitivities, concerns, and reactions. A remedy that gives someone glowing, clear skin might leave another with irritation, dryness, or breakouts. The same applies to hair—factors like scalp health, hair texture, and underlying conditions all influence how an ingredient will react. This also goes for what you put in your body.  Moreover, time is also changing.  Dr Deepali Bhardwaj, a Delhi-based dermatologist, says our environment and food habits have changed significantly, so our skin now needs advanced care to achieve the desired texture. “Things have drastically changed since our parents' time. The biggest difference is that we've become more exposed to chemicals than ever before. Compared to them, we face higher pollution levels, less nutritious food, and, in many cases, even unhealthy water. And we’re dealing with increased stress, free radicals in the air, smoke, and pollution,” she explains. So, remember, without proper research or professional guidance, blindly following viral DIY trends can do more harm than good. Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s safe for everyone.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Trending Reel

0f575fab-64ff-4c1c-af77-9b918c6ab33b,Swastika Mukherjee calls out Uber: When 'pet-friendly' isn't enoughSwastika Mukherjee called out Uber after an incident highlighted the gaps in their newly launched 'pet-friendly' feature on their app.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/swastika-mukherjee-calls-out-uber-when-pet-friendly-isnt-enough-2672512-2025-01-30,"Among the many challenges pet parents face, finding a reliable cab service to take their furry friends to and fro remains a major hurdle. On Thursday, actress Swastika Mukherjee called out ride-hailing giant Uber after an incident highlighted the gaps in their newly launched ‘pet-friendly’ cab service.What actually happened Rakshita Singh, who runs the Dulaar Amanat Foundation, an NGO in Delhi, called out Uber for its ‘lack of compassion’ towards pet animals. She was frustrated with Uber’s newly launched ‘Uber Pet’ feature, which allows pets to accompany their owners but at a significantly higher price. For a regular five-kilometre ride to her mentioned destination, Uber quoted a price of Rs 150, whereas the same trip under ‘Uber Pet’ shot up to Rs 487—almost three times the original fare.

 



The puppies in question.
 Rakshita had booked an Uber Go from Chhawla, New Delhi, to Dwarka to take six rescued puppies to a pet clinic for a check-up, one of whom was in critical condition. When the cab arrived, she placed the baskets with the pups inside, but after entering the OTP, the driver asked what she was carrying. Upon learning they were puppies, he immediately refused the ride, insisting she cancel and book a ‘pet taxi’ instead. Until that moment, Rakshita hadn’t been aware of the pet taxi feature.

 “I pleaded with him, explaining that it was a medical emergency and we needed help immediately. He said that if he had known we were taking dogs to the hospital, he wouldn’t have accepted the ride and insisted we remove the pups from the cab,” Rakshita told India Today. With no other option, she tried booking the Uber Pet service but was shocked by its steep pricing. Following her experience, she demanded answers, particularly regarding the lack of detailed information about the size and layout of the pet-friendly taxis.

 



Screenshot shared by Rakshita Singh.
 Swastika Mukherjee, who closely works with Rakshita’s NGO, later shared her post on Instagram, which sparked a discussion online. India Today tried to find out if there's any truth to these claims. We checked the pricing for both the features - 'Uber Sedan' and 'Uber Pet' - for a distance of about 4km, and this is what we found:

 



We found a whopping difference of Rs 388.
What the policy says Uber’s official website states that service animals are allowed at all times, while non-service animals are permitted at the driver’s discretion. Under the ‘Uber Pet’ feature, which was introduced in Bengaluru last year, riders can travel with pets, but only one is allowed per ride. When India Today reached out to Uber this is what a spokesperson said, “We introduced ‘Uber Pet’ to meet the growing demand from pet owners who want an easy way to travel using Uber with their furry companions. It ensures that there is a safe and convenient ride available when you are travelling with your pets while providing additional earning opportunities for drivers.” “The surcharge for ‘Uber Pet’ covers the costs associated with vehicle cleaning and maintenance to ensure that the car is ready and comfortable for subsequent riders,” he added.The problem with ‘pet-friendly’ Rakshita Singh’s experience is not an isolated one - pet parents across India frequently struggle with transportation, accommodations, and public spaces that claim to be pet-friendly but fall short in practice. Ayush Das, a 20-year-old engineering student with five dogs, shares his frustration: ""Travelling with pets is a nightmare. Cabs, hotels, and even cafes often don’t allow them. You need to keep searching and enquiring before your needs and theirs (pets) align. Limited carriers like Air India permit pet travel, but securing train bookings is another hassle. We've stopped taking our pets out - not by choice, but due to a lack of options."" Rashi Narang, founder of pet-care brand Heads Up For Tails, emphasises the need for change: “Travelling with pets should be a positive experience, not a struggle. I hope for a future where all pets can travel safely and comfortably with their families.""The cost factor Beyond accessibility, affordability is another major hurdle for pet parents. ""Raising a pet today is like raising a child,"" Das adds. ""A 1kg pack of quality dog food costs around Rs 1,000 and lasts barely a week for an adult dog. Add grooming, vet visits, and other expenses - especially for specific breeds - and it becomes a significant financial commitment. While it may seem otherwise, having a pet is not a luxury for some, they do it out of sheer love and compassion,” he says.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 30, 2025Must Watch

Gym memberships, healthy snacks, organic groceries, protein supplements, and more can quickly burn a hole in our pockets. As a result, some people feel guilty about spending so much yet continue doing so, while others opt for cheaper but often ‘unhealthier’ alternatives. If you also feel that the healthier you try to eat, the more you have to spend, you’re not alone. If you search for this question on the internet, you’ll find various Reddit users with the same concern, sharing their experiences of how ‘healthy’ items often cost more than regular food (which is already expensive—thanks, inflation). A recent two-year analysis by the Food Foundation found that, for 1,000 calories a day, a basket of healthy food costs more than double that of less healthy options.

 



Healthy is the new expensive. Photo: Getty Images
 That means if you want to get 1,000 calories a day from healthy items like fruit and vegetables, it will cost you more than the same amount of calories from less healthy options, such as ready meals and processed meats. Now, for full disclosure, even though this study compares food prices in the United Kingdom, the situation in India is no different. Let’s take an everyday example. How many times have you gone to a fast-food chain and ordered your favourite burger? Now, if you’re on a health kick like me, chances are you’ve asked them to replace the regular refined flour buns with wheat ones. But of course, making an unhealthy burger slightly healthier comes at a price—you have to pay extra. In the end, you either end up paying more or decide to skip the wheat bun altogether. But why is there a difference in price? We tried figuring it out.The quest for healthy food  India Today spoke to various experts, and they all agreed that eating healthily is important, but such products are often sold at a higher price. To explore this further, we used third-party apps to compare the prices of 'unhealthy' and 'healthy' versions of the readily available items like rice, bread, fruits, and juices on platforms such as Swiggy Instamart and Blinkit. We ensured consistency by selecting food items from the same brand wherever possible. And the results were shocking, to say the least.1. Brown rice vs white rice We started with a staple found in almost every household – rice, and compared the two options available: brown and white. At its core, brown rice and white rice differ in nutritional value, texture, and taste. Brown rice is generally considered healthier as it's less processed and retains more nutrients. However, if you opt for brown rice, 1 kg will cost you around Rs 200, whereas the same amount of white basmati rice will cost you half of that, at Rs 100. This shows a whopping 100 per cent price hike for the two options from the same brand.

2. Brown vs white vs sourdough bread  For the second option, we picked bread, which is also another house staple, especially if you have a busy schedule. When it comes to choosing bread, there are plenty of options, but three of the most common ones are brown bread, white bread, and sourdough bread. Each has its own texture, taste, and nutritional profile. The healthiest one here is sourdough bread, as it goes through a fermentation process, which makes it easier to digest and improves nutrient absorption. Then brown, and then white due to the presence of refined flour and highly processed nature.  Now, let's look at the price difference. 

 



The steep price difference. Photo: Via Swiggy Insá¹­amart
 For the same brand and quantity (350-400 gm), you would have to pay Rs 30 for white bread, Rs 60 for brown, and Rs 150 for sourdough bread. 3. Snack options Out of the food that we consume, the most difficult one to quit seems to be our snacking habits. Rat snacking is not healthy, but today in the market there are various options that can be considered as a healthier snack. For this, we compared Makhana, or fox nuts, which is not only natural but is also gaining popularity due to its high nutritional content of protein, carbohydrates, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc. Let's compare its pricing to other readily available snacking options. 

 



Makana is slowly gaining popularity in India, but it is quite expensive. Photo: Via SwiggyInstamart
 For this, a 200 gm packet of makhana will cost you around Rs 500 (Rs 2,500 per kilogram), whereas bhujia, a popular Indian snack that is far from healthy, is sold at just Rs 330 per kilogram (smart snacking? uh, expensive snacking?). 4. Protein/Greek yogurt vs curd  Curd is a staple in many Indian households, known for its creamy texture and probiotic benefits. It is made by fermenting milk with natural bacteria, which helps improve digestion and gut health. But if you want more protein and nutrient value from your curd, protein or Greek yogurt should be your go-to. But how much more expensive is it than your regular curd? Have a look: 

 



Photo: Via Swiggy Instamart.
 A 400-450 gm pack of protein-rich curd will cost you around Rs 325, whereas regular curd is much more affordable, retailing at just Rs 35 (crazy much?)!advertisement4. Fruit juices vs real fruit After seeing these steep price differences, if you’re sweating and considering quenching your thirst with a healthier option, be prepared—your bank balance won’t be too happy. For fruit juices, we found a contrasting difference between the ones with high sugar content and the so-called healthier ones. Moreover, the fruit, it seems, is much more expensive! Take pomegranate, for example. On food delivery apps, 1 kg of the fruit costs around Rs 448 (without discounts). In contrast, 1 litre of ‘pure’ pomegranate juice costs Rs 450, while the processed, sugary version is just Rs 130!

Why so much difference?The examples can go on and on. Today in the market, the healthier options seem to be more expensive, but technically, it should not. Dietician Kanikka Malhotra tells India Today that ""nutritious foods can cost up to three times more than unhealthy options like processed foods and fast food."" The cost disparity is influenced by supply chain issues, climate change, and the marketing of convenience foods over healthier alternatives. ""Those in lower-income brackets often face barriers to accessing healthy foods and healthcare services, leading to a reliance on cheaper, less nutritious options that ultimately increases health risks and associated costs,"" she says. However, experts seem to believe prioritising health can result in long-term financial benefits. Debjani Gupta, a nutritionist and wellness expert from Mumbai, says that while staying healthy does incur expenses, it is a worthwhile investment compared to the cost of medical treatments and hospitalisations resulting from poor health. ""The sugar-laden processed food falls cheaper on the pocket than sourcing fresh fruits, vegetables, and unprocessed food—thanks to the food industry that has successfully been able to seep into our lives, palate, and more,"" she adds.Dietician Karuna Chaturvedi from Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida, further highlights how fitness and wellness expenses, including gym memberships, medical check-ups, and ergonomic furniture, add to the financial burden. She explains, ""Preventive healthcare, although cost-effective in the long run, does have a front-end financial cost. However, in the long run, prioritising health will decrease the chances of chronic diseases, saving money on medical treatments and improving the quality of life in general.""Are there actual practical solutions and alternatives?The good news? Eating healthy on a budget is possible—it just takes a little planning. Gupta strongly believes in utilising locally grown, affordable produce. ""Here comes our traditionally grown millets, variety of rice, lentils, and pulses into play. One does not have to buy quinoa, sourdough bread, etc., which comparatively costs much more,"" she suggests.Chaturvedi also encourages budget-friendly fitness options. ""Running, squatting, and push-up exercises are free, and one doesn't need a membership to a gym since working out outdoors in parks is free,"" she points out. However, she warns that while there are free alternatives to staying fit, they require more time and consistency.Malhotra provides some practical tips for an affordable, healthy diet:
Affordable protein sources: Lentils, chickpeas, beans, eggs, tofu, paneer, yoghurt, and peanuts offer essential nutrients and are comparably cheaper.
Complex carbohydrates: Whole wheat roti, oats, sweet potatoes, and fibre-rich millets provide long-lasting energy.
Healthy fats: Oils such as mustard or groundnut oil ensure good heart and skin health.
Seasonal fruits and vegetables: Go for buying produce in season, which significantly lowers costs while maximising nutritional benefits.
Additionally, Gupta emphasises the importance of hydration and gut health. ""Adequate hydration helps in optimal digestion, absorption, assimilation, and elimination,"" she says.Do you think healthy is the new expensive?  Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Must Watch

The collection was unveiled at Paris Fashion Week earlier this week, only it wasn’t just couture, it was a cathartic retelling of a life-altering event. At the heart of it all was Gaurav’s muse, his life partner - Navkirat Sodhi – who survived the accident which happened about eight months ago.A story born out of the ashes Eight months ago, a seemingly ordinary evening turned into a nightmare. A candle flame spiralled out of control, engulfing Navkirat in fire. As Gaurav rushed to extinguish the flames with his bare hands, he suffered burns himself, but Navkirat bore the brunt of it—55 per cent of her body was burnt. She was in the ICU for the next two and a half months fighting for her life as the doctors gave her a 50 per cent chance of survival.

 But Navkirat fought back. “She is a fighter and a survivor... she is a goddess,” Gaurav said in an emotional video shared on his official page. In the following months, as Navkirat treaded on a long road to recovery, the journey not just transformed their lives, but it left Gaurav with a creative vision, one that needs to be talked about (and is very much being done already).

 For Gaurav, Across the Flame is more than just a collection— it tells a story of “resilience, transformation, and the infinite light within all of us”. The collection draws from astral projection, a mystical out-of-body experience that Gaurav and Navkirat embraced during their recovery. Navkirat didn’t just inspire the collection; she embodied it. She opened the show, walking down the runway in a cream-hued draped corset gown - her scars visible, her presence powerful. All eyes watched Navkirat as she walked the runway, adding her poetic excellence to it all – an empowering moment for the world to witness, a moment of defiance, of reclaiming her story on the grandest stage of all.

About the collection A post shared by Gaurav Gupta (@gauravguptaofficial)
 The runway transformed into a powerful retelling of their journey - where each ensemble wasn’t just couture for the world to see, but a deeply personal and emotional expression of survival, resilience, and rebirth. The beauty of the collection was amplified by intricate details—20,000 Preciosa crystals catching the light like embers, ghungroo embellishments raffia and micro pearls, and celestial makeup that paid homage to their otherworldly journey. This season also introduced new colours like ochre, twilight purple, and space blue, symbolising transformation, alongside the brand’s signature shades of black, ivory, and metallics. Fire, the force that tested them, became an indomitable motif woven into the collection through form, drapery, and symbolism. The Twin Flame ensemble—an ochre masterpiece—embodies both the destruction and the strength that emerged from it.

 The entire collection offers a glimpse into their experience, with colours playing a crucial role in storytelling. Shades of black, dark purple, and blue point out the bruises and burns, while white represents healing and transcendence. The midnight blue metal breastplates resemble armour, signifying strength amid vulnerability, while traditional Banarasi brocades, woven with sacred chants, become wearable mantras of survival.

 For the first time, denim enters Gaurav Gupta’s couture universe—manifesting in the Bucket Corset and Distressed Bucket Jacket. Raw, rebellious, and defiant, these pieces mirror the journey of endurance and reinvention.More than fashion The collection reminds us of a quote by Alexander McQueen: “I think there is beauty in everything. What 'normal' people perceive as ugly, I can usually see something of beauty in it.” Much like McQueen’s philosophy, Across the Flame challenges conventional ideas of beauty. It finds grace in resilience, strength in scars, and poetry in survival.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 31, 2025Trending Reel

So, some couples indulge in maintenance sex to keep their relationship strong. But is it a relationship lifeline or just another duty?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/story/maintenance-sex-couples-love-bedroom-chore-2672803-2025-01-31,"Have you had sex with your partner when you are not in the mood? Or is it just another chore for you? Or are you pretending to be asleep before your partner gets into bed? Perhaps, you'll find comfort in knowing that dwindling sex drive is pretty common in couples.  According to a study by Johns Hopkins, sexual intimacy has a pattern. The first stage is - Couples, newly in love, are more excited, experience closeness and have regular sex. The second stage is - Once the couple has been in a relationship for more than three to four years, the freshness of the relationship wears off, and sex becomes routine. The third stage is - Once the couple starts a family, the couple's sex life takes a toll, mostly due to exhaustion and lack of private time. Many don't recover from this even after their child has grown up.  The study revealed that approximately one woman in 10 experiences a decrease in their sex drive at some point in life. This can happen due to several factors, such as career and family pressures, feeling overwhelmed, resentful, loss of connection, shift in priorities, juggling responsibilities, hormonal changes, depression, body image concerns and physical changes.  Men also experience a decrease in sex drive, commonly due to one of these reasons - physical changes, societal stigmas, erectile dysfunction or underlying health conditions. It is rare for two people to have matching sex drives. So, some couples make a silent pact (or a verbal one) to engage in sex in order to maintain their relationship, even if one or both partners aren't particularly in the mood. Though often unspoken, maintenance sex happens. But is it a relationship lifeline or just another duty?

advertisementBasically, maintenance sex is a couple keeping the sex up to ensure both people in the relationship are sexually satisfied. It is like maintaining a relationship with the help of sex just like we maintain the walls of our house with paint or the furniture with nuts and bolts.  Basically, maintenance sex is a couple keeping the sex up to ensure both people in the relationship are sexually satisfied. It is like maintaining a relationship with the help of sex just like we maintain the walls of our house with paint or the furniture with nuts and bolts.  ""It's a way to keep the connection alive and ensure intimacy remains a part of the relationship,"" said Dr Pallavi Abhilasha, associate professor at Christian Medical College & Hospital's department of Psychiatry in Ludhiana, Punjab. She said that some couples find that it can boost their relationship by keeping the physical bond strong and preventing feelings of neglect or distance, adding, ""people do it for various reasons, including maintaining intimacy, fulfilling each other's needs, or simply keeping the relationship healthy."" Even though it is hard to put a number to how common it is as it's a private matter and varies from couple to couple, but several sex experts say that maintenance sex should definitely be a part of the menu. A 2017 study revealed that couples that have sex once a week are the happiest. Another study in the US said couples who had sex more than once a week didn't report being any happier, and those who had sex less than once a week reported feeling less fulfilled. Mrudula*, a resident of Delhi, said, ""Yes, I have had sex with my partner when not in the mood and so has he. All's fair in love and sex, as long as it's mutual.""

 Sex is a way to remind your partner how much you mean to each other. But is it non-consensual or unwanted sex? Dr Pallavi Abhilasha said, ""While it might be termed as unwanted sex, it's still consensual if both partners agree to it. The key difference is that one or both partners might not be particularly enthusiastic about it at that moment."" To expect that your partner will always want the exact amount of sex as you do is not particularly practical. For some, sex is like hitting the gym - you don't want to do it initially but once you are done, you are satisfied. While there are others who think it is better to hit the gym once and then eat junk guilt-free the entire week.  Sharanya*, a homemaker, said that her bond with her husband is very strong but they just don't have matching sex drives. In order to avoid this one thing ruin their relationship, she said 'I just go along with it'.  ""For me, it's more about getting over with it. It is too time consuming and just seems like too much of a process. Sex once a week is an unsaid rule between my husband and me. We love each other and I am good at faking it, so, it is a win-win. It does not matter to me and I don't want it to affect my relationship,"" she said.

IS IT SEXIST? Some argue that maintenance sex is sexist and that one should only have sex when they are 'in the mood'. But what happens when one partner isn't 'in the mood' and the other, with the higher libido, wants sex? This leaves one partner feeling hounded for sex all the time and the other pathetic for wanting it, leading to an unhealthy, sexless, and unfulfilled marriage. Sex plays an important role in a healthy and happy relationship.  Dr Pallavi Abhilasha explained this further, ""Whether it's sexist depends on the dynamics of the relationship. If one partner feels pressured or obligated to engage in maintenance sex, it can be problematic. However, if both partners agree and see it as a way to maintain their connection, it can be a healthy practice."" Couples might need or want to have maintenance sex to keep their relationship strong, maintain intimacy, or fulfill each other's needs. ""The drawbacks can include feelings of resentment or obligation if one partner feels pressured. It's essential for both partners to communicate openly and ensure that they're both comfortable with the arrangement,"" she said.

 A Reddit thread asking men on how much maintenance sex is enough in an otherwise healthy marriage, a user posted, ""There is a bigger underlying problem if sex is just duty or maintenance. I'd prefer no sex to duty sex and I'm a dude. Sex should be exciting and enthusiastic."" Another user posted, ""If it's just lay there expressionless and saying get it over with then no thanks. If it's active engagement with some play acting then I'm all for it."" Many echoed the thought that they would rather not have sex than go for maintenance sex. WHEN TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP? If you feel pressured into sex, speak to your partner. If force is involved, seek professional help. One must see a therapist or health-care provider if one feels fully sexually unsatisfied or is experiencing an unusually prolonged dip in libido.Published By: Anupriya ThakurPublished On: Jan 31, 2025

Among these innovations, if there is one name that is gaining a lot of attention recently in the medical field, it is precision medicine.  Precision medicine at its core stands out as a revolutionary approach that tailors treatment to people based on their genes. But can it help in transforming how we treat diseases, particularly cancer?  In an exclusive interview with India Today, Dr Shitij Kapur, Vice-Chancellor & President of King's College London, talked about precision medicine and its applications. What is precision medicine exactly? ""For a very long time, we’ve always been making a diagnosis and offering a treatment that was just medicine as usual,"" says Dr Shitij Kapur.  Traditional medicine relies on a broad approach where patients with the same illness receive similar treatments. However, precision medicine allows doctors to identify subtypes of diseases, tailoring treatments accordingly.   ""A diagnosis like breast cancer gets broken into smaller entities. When you do the genetics of it, you realise there are, let’s say, four types of breast cancer,"" he explains.  By identifying these genetic differences, doctors can prescribe targeted treatments that improve patient outcomes.How can it help with cancer? Precision medicine has made significant strides in oncology. Cancer, once classified as a single disease, is now understood to have multiple variations based on genetic mutations. This understanding allows doctors to select therapies that specifically target these mutations.

 “At one level, someone has breast cancer, but then when you do the section of it and when you do the genetics of it, you realise that there are, let's say, 4 types of breast cancer. They look the same, the symptoms may be the same, but you realise that either the person's genetics or the cancer's genetics are different, and then the treatment is targeted based on that,” says Dr Kapur.Can you afford it? Even though precision medicine leads to better outcomes, affordability remains a concern. “The latest new medicine has come for a brain disease called metachromatic leukodystrophy. A single treatment [through precision medicine] for one person for that disease costs 4.5 million US dollars. No person can afford it even in the United States where it is being offered; it is only offered in the context of insurance,” Dr Kapur points out.  The economic model of precision medicine, where treatments apply to smaller patient groups, means drug prices remain high. Despite this, experts like him are hoping that as technology advances, the cost-effectiveness of these treatments will improve.How can AI help here? Unlike other fields like travel, fashion, food, and more, artificial intelligence here, too, is playing a crucial role in enhancing precision medicine by improving predictive healthcare. AI analyses vast datasets, identifying patterns in genetic and lifestyle factors that can predict disease risks.  ""If I just ask someone about their family history of diabetes, I can predict their risk. Now, AI enhances this by analysing detailed genetic and lifestyle data,"" Dr Kapur explains. However, apart from its steep pricing, precision medicine is not yet widely available for Indians, like high blood pressure and diabetes medicines are.  “The hope is that this principle of using your genetics to guide your treatment across a big diagnostic category like blood pressure or heart disease will lead to better treatments, and we hope that they'll keep coming,” Dr Kapur concludes.

In short, the quest for longevity has become the talk of the town, with people hoping to live as long as they can (more than 100). This means eating clean, working out, getting red light therapies, taking supplements, and making frequent doctor visits are just part of it. At the forefront of this movement is Bryan Johnson, a millionaire entrepreneur and founder of Blueprint, a website where he showcases his lifestyle and encourages others to follow suit. He is often credited with coining and popularising the phrase on social media. Netflix also recently released a documentary on his lifestyle, 'Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever'.  One term that has emerged alongside Johnson’s longevity journey is biohacking—the practice of optimising the body and mind through science, technology, and lifestyle changes. But is it true, or just a fad? Let's delve into it. What is biohacking exactly? The logic behind biohacking is simple: to make yourself live a healthier life, by taking matters into your own hands. It includes various methods aimed at enhancing human health, performance, and overall well-being through self-experimentation and biological modifications. It is often referred to as ""do-it-yourself biology,"" as to biohack your way through life, one needs to make gradual adjustments to your lifestyle, diet, and even their biology to boost their physical and mental abilities. But biohacking comes with a price - quite literally.  With healthy food being already expensive, there are costs of biohacking which include a hefty medical bill for treatments and supplements and more. Bryan's obsession with Biohacking In 2013, after selling his company to eBay’s PayPal for $800 million, Bryan had plenty of options on how to spend his fortune. He could have travelled the world, bought a mansion, and lived a life of luxury. But instead, he decided to dedicate his life to chasing immortality through biohacking (yes, we are not joking).

 His way of 'biohacking' involves Bryan starting his day at 4:30 am, and, by 11:30 am, he’s done with dinner. His daily routine includes light therapy, and taking 111 supplements. Experts and various people call it 'extreme' for obvious reasons. But the real question is - can you actually bio hack in real life?'Biohacking is a Sci-fi concept'In an exclusive interview with India Today, Dr Shitij Kapur, Vice-Chancellor & President of King's College London, says, ""At the moment, biohacking remains a sci-fi concept. It needs much better evidence before being considered a legitimate approach to longevity.""

Well, anecdotal evidence suggests that younger generations are grappling with issues like brain fog and declining mental clarity. So, does that mean early onset dementia is becoming more and more common? In an exclusive interview with India Today, Dr Shitij Kapur, Vice-Chancellor and President of King's College London, addressed this concern.   ""Yes, early onset dementia is a reality,"" he confirmed. ""People who get dementia, things like Alzheimer's disease, the onset would be around 70+ and after 70, with every extra year you live, the risk that you might get Alzheimer's disease increases. Some data suggest that by age 90, the number could be as high as one in four. There is also a much smaller subset of people who develop dementia in their 50s and 60s, known as early onset dementia."" However, Dr Kapur was quick to clarify a common misconception. ""If the question is whether dementia itself is appearing earlier in life, the answer is no. What is happening is that our detection systems have improved. Previously, many people with early onset dementia might have remained undiagnosed for years. Now, better tests, increased MRI availability, and improved diagnostic tools are leading to earlier identification."" Dementia rates aren't necessarily rising among the younger generation, but you can't overlook the prevalence of cognitive complaints such as brain fog. Gen Z, in particular, reports experiencing these symptoms, and several Reddit confessions reflect the trend. The issue even resonates on platforms like TikTok, where terms like ""Brain Rot"" have gone viral, with the phrase being named Oxford's Word of the Year in 2024.
 


 Experts suggest that while brain fog and attention issues may feel alarming, they are not synonymous with dementia. Factors such as chronic stress, sleep deprivation, poor diet, and constant exposure to digital stimuli often contribute to these symptoms. Unlike dementia, which involves irreversible neurodegenerative changes, brain fog is usually reversible with lifestyle adjustments.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 2, 2025Trending Reel

eb812f61-0050-48b6-9355-8b2a025c6443,Top Indian chefs share the biggest food trends for 2025What will this year look like when it comes to the food scene? Top chefs and restaurateurs decode.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/food/story/whats-driving-the-big-food-trends-in-india-in-2025-2674405-2025-02-04,"The way we eat is about to get a major shake-up or let’s just say that 2025 is going to witness a lot of firsts when it comes to food and dining. From high-protein innovations to seaweed cocktails, this is shaping up to be a year of bold culinary experimentation and mindful dining. As chefs push boundaries and diners crave authenticity, the food scene is evolving like never before.Protein and sustainability will rule the charts Most people who prefer taking the healthy route in their food habits look for just one important ingredient in food labels – protein. So, how can it not make it to this year’s top trend prediction? ""Protein is no longer just about powders and shakes,"" says Chef Shantanu Gupte. ""We’re seeing a shift towards whole food sources-plant-based proteins and naturally high-protein ingredients."" Menus are adapting to this demand, with high-protein items taking centre stage, and packaged goods proudly highlighting their protein content. This growing awareness around protein intake is set to rise even further.

 



Protein is no longer just about powders and shakes. (Photo: Unsplash)
advertisement Chef Ishijyot Surri, executive chef and founder of Mulk, Miniyaturk and SJI Gourmet, agrees. He also mentions that elevated plant-based cuisines which celebrate vegetables, legumes, and grains over simple meat substitutes, will be embraced. Sustainability will continue to be a key factor in shaping food trends in 2025. Chef and author Varun Inamdar talks about the importance of eco-conscious choices such as plant-based fine dining. ""I tried plant-based seafood in its beta stage in Thailand, and it most certainly has the potential to burst onto the culinary scene,"" he shares. As more chefs experiment with sustainable ingredients, plant-based options are set to become an integral part of fine dining experiences. ""Sustainability is no longer optional—it’s a necessity,"" Chef Surri reiterates. Expect to see plant-based seafood like lab-grown tuna and prawn alternatives take off, alongside functional mushrooms like Lion’s Mane and Reishi making their way into wellness foods and meat substitutes.Regional cuisine representation When it comes to cooking philosophy, authenticity is taking over aesthetics. ""We’re moving beyond just making food look good; it’s about using indigenous ingredients and telling a story,"" Chef Gupte emphasises. From the Himalayas to the Northeast, regional flavours are making their way onto mainstream menus. ""For years, Indian cuisine in restaurants was synonymous with Punjabi food (think chicken tikka, butter chicken), but now, we’re seeing more from Kerala, Karnataka, the Northeast, and Himachal Pradesh. This diversity is redefining Indian dining,"" he states.

 



Himachal Pradesh's Siddu is slowly but steadily entering the national food scene. (Photo: Unsplash)
 ""Indian cuisine is also embracing neo-regional inspirations,"" says Chef Inamdar. ""Expect dishes like Crabs Thecha Thermidor, Dahi 'Pie Tee' Chaat, and Lucknowi Iconic Liquid Kebab to make waves.""Massive transformation in the beverage scene We all know how much Gen Z have an impact on almost all social and economic spheres and of course, the food and beverage scene wasn’t going to escape, was it? Gen Z is reshaping the beverage scene too. ""Gen Z is driving a shift towards lighter spirits and curated cocktails. The era of heavy spirits is giving way to ingredient-driven cocktails with unique, refreshing profiles. Menus featuring innovative cocktail combinations are on the rise,” says Chef Gupte.

 



Zero-proof alcohol not only taste like traditional spirits but are also super-low on calories.
 There is no denying that people have been taking their health more seriously and making some wise decisions when it comes to their well-being. Hence, alcohol is going to take a backseat in the coming days. ""There’s a growing demand for lighter spirits and ingredient-driven cocktails,"" says Chef Gupte. ""The era of heavy liquor is making way for mindful drinking—think herbal, fruit-forward, and refreshing cocktails.""The sweet but spicy revolution Sweet and spicy combinations are expected to take the food world by storm in 2025. Shivani Sharma, Chefpreneur and founder of Gourmestan, believes the Swicy trend (sweet + spicy) will define the year. ""This innovation ranges from swicy sauces to even snacks and desserts,"" she explains. ""Imagine swicy cayenne dark chocolate bars or jalapeno mango fruit salsas."" Swiccy caters to the ever-growing appetite for global fusion tastes: South American, Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine, and so many more.Coffee as a culinary ingredient Coffee as a beverage is too mainstream, and this year, it will make it to your dining table too, at least that’s what Chef Gupte predicts. There is a growing trend of coffee-infused dishes, and chefs experimenting with unique flavour profiles. ""Coffee is evolving beyond the cup. In 2025, expect to see coffee-flavoured avocado dishes and coffee-baked sausages,"" he reveals. The versatility of coffee as a flavouring ingredient will make its way into a wide range of foods, from savoury to sweet.Fresh ingredients Health and well-being is going to define numerous trends and farm-to-table is one of them. Chef Shiva Shanmugam, executive chef at IBNII, Coorg, explains, “One of the biggest food trends of 2025 is the shift towards farm-to-table dining, where ingredients are sourced as fresh and local as possible. People are willing to eat fresh and invest in health, therefore seasonal, organic produce, fresh from the farm, will take centre stage and restaurants will cater to it.”

 “This not only enhances the taste of the food but also minimises the carbon footprint associated with industrial food production, transportation, and processing,” he adds.advertisementAI transforming the food sceneYes, we are aware the buzz began in 2024, but the trend will not just stay in 2025 but it will expand and reach new heights.""Technology's role in the food industry is expanding rapidly. From AI-driven consumer data collection to personalised dining experiences, tech is reshaping how we eat. Expect to see more digital menus, robotic kitchen assistants, and AI-powered tools enhancing restaurant operations,” predicts Chef Gupte.

""Cloud kitchens are becoming more efficient with the help of AI, while software solutions offer hyper-customised dining experiences. The integration of technology isn't just a trend; it's becoming an essential part of the culinary landscape,” he adds.Pistachio superpowerIf you are to believe Shivani Sharma, pistachios have their sights set on the spotlight for 2025. “These nuts have long been recognised for their vivid green colour and creamy taste, what sets them apart though is their powerful nutritional profile. It is for this reason that pistachios seem to be gaining immense popularity as a multipurpose garnish for both sweet and savoury dishes. Pistachio butter and pistachio milk are already in the works for high gourmet pastries and dominating the plant-based dairy aisle,” she says.

Furthermore, pistachios will continue to have a broad range of culinary applications. “They serve as an ideal oil for drizzling on salads and even soups, while the nuts' earthy flavour serves as an inspiration for new takes on pesto, desserts, cocktails, and so much more. Not only are pistachios delightful to taste, but they are also eco-friendly option due to the minimal water requirement compared to other nuts.”Final bitesThe way we used to think about food, let’s say, five years ago, has changed massively now.

Elaborate 10-step skincare routines, an obsession with multi-step skincare, sheet masks, rice water, and snail mucin are all courtesy of the K-beauty trend in India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/is-k-beauty-craze-trend-in-india-overhyped-2674922-2025-02-05,"All things Korean—be it food, movies, shows, music, fashion, or beauty—have taken the world by storm and become a global phenomenon in recent years. In India, this K-craze is no exception and can easily be deemed unstoppable. One particular sector that has witnessed significant growth in the Indian landscape is Korean beauty. Whether a skincare enthusiast or not, K-beauty is a term well-known among young Indians. Elaborate 10-step skincare routines, an obsession with multi-step skincare, sheet masks, rice water, and snail mucin are all courtesy of the K-beauty trend in India. Statista’s revenue report on Korean beauty products in India makes this craze quite evident: in 2022, the market reached approximately 531 million USD, up from 389 million USD in 2018. It is further forecast to grow to over 1.3 billion USD by 2032. K-beauty stands out for its emphasis on a multi-step routine that focuses on deep hydration, natural ingredients, and lightweight, innovative formulations, all aimed at achieving and maintaining dewy, youthful, and supple skin.

 For many K-beauty enthusiasts in India, the craze began with the search for a sunscreen that leaves no white cast while providing effective protection. For others, it was the game-changing preventive lip care and deeply hydrating serums that drew them in. Snail mucin, a cult favourite, has gained immense popularity among those striving for glass skin. With the use of gentle yet effective ingredients like Centella Asiatica, Mugwort, and Green Tea Extract, Korean beauty has also become a go-to for those with sensitive skin. The growing craze is not without criticism, though. Dermatologists often criticise that it promotes ‘glass skin’ as the ultimate skincare goal, setting beauty standards. Additionally, Korean Beauty, a trend that has thrived on social media popularity, has also led to people using anything and everything on their skin just because they saw influencers doing it in viral videos.

 



Some popular K-beauty products in India.
 “The world of social media and Instagram influencers often promotes products that may not work for everyone and can even make skin more sensitive. While Korean skincare products are undoubtedly innovative and effective, they need to be used thoughtfully and scientifically—not applied blindly,” says Dr Deepali Bhardwaj, a Delhi-based dermatologist and founder of Elska Skin and Aesthetics clinic. SIs the K-beauty craze in India overhyped? Have you ever admired a Korean actor’s gleaming, glass-like skin while watching a K-drama and felt the urge to stock your skincare shelf with K-beauty products? The current Indian beauty market makes that quite easy, as K-beauty products are now readily accessible in India. In fact, several Indian brands also now promise the coveted ‘Korean glow’ and have ingredients that are typical of K-beauty game. Additionally, dedicated Korean beauty platforms like Purplle, Beauty Barn, and Kindlife.in offer a wide range of products from various brands.

 However, simply buying those products may not fulfil your dream of achieving that glass skin. “We (Indians) have some of the best skin in the world—not out of bias, but as a fact. Our skin tones typically fall under Type 4 and Type 5 on the Fitzpatrick scale, and our melanin-rich skin is incredibly diverse and unique. There's a phenomenon called ‘Merioski’, which explains how melanin reacts to sunlight. This reaction is crucial for dermatologists and skincare experts when formulating products to help us achieve our best skin. However, social media influencers often promote skincare products that may not be suitable for all skin types, ultimately leading to sensitivity and damage,” explains Dr Bhardwaj. Dermatologists stress that skincare products should be chosen based on factors such as skin type, concerns, and texture.

 



Dermats warn against overconsumption fuelled by the K-beauty craze. (Photo: Freepik)
 “Korean skincare promises to help with hydration, gentle exfoliation, and nourishing ingredients that can help give the skin a glowing, smooth look. Using products like cleansers, toners, serums, and moisturisers that suit your skin type can make a noticeable difference. However, one shouldn’t get carried away by any trend that goes viral on social media,” says Dr Rinky Kapoor. “If someone tries Korean products, the results may not be 100 percent effective and can vary from person to person. For some, they may work, while for others, there may be no visible change. It is imperative to understand your skin type, texture, and concerns, as well as your skin’s specific needs, and consult a doctor,” she adds. Meanwhile, Dr Rishi Parashar, chairperson, dermatology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, highlights another major issue related to the K-beauty craze in India: “The way people buy these products (often from Instagram, malls, or unverified sources) without scientific proof of their effectiveness is a major concern.” Dr Bhardwaj agrees and adds that Korean beauty products are innovative and effective, but they must be used scientifically, with an understanding of what works for your skin, rather than applying them blindly. However, many dermatologists praise certain Korean skincare ingredients, such as green tea, tiger grass, rice water, ginseng, and eggshell extract. “These products are more natural and genuine. They contain more antioxidants, offer greater benefits, and have fewer side effects,” adds Dr Bhardwaj. She also highlights how something as common as rice water can actually increase pigmentation for some people if overused. Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics, Mumbai, warns against overconsumption fuelled by the K-beauty craze. “People buying too many products without understanding their skin’s true needs can end up with skin woes that can steal their peace of mind. Don’t fall prey to any trends like this without weighing the pros and cons. It is a good idea to consult an expert before using any product,” she says.What’s happening in the K-beauty x India world? Korean brands continue to eye India as a major market, with many new players entering the scene. For instance, BTS sensation J-Hope’s sister, Ji-Woo, recently flew to India to promote her skincare brand, Neaf Neaf. She launched it in Delhi in December 2024 at Kosmos—a Korean culture fest. Mizon, a prominent Korean brand, also recently entered India through online platforms such as Amazon and Tira (Reliance Retail’s beauty platform).

 



Mizon products are not now available in India through Amazon and Tira.
 The offline availability of K-beauty products is also growing, with a presence at Nykaa and Tira stores. Moreover, dedicated K-beauty stores are now being opened in areas such as Humayunpur in Delhi - a popular hub for Northeast cuisine, Korean fashion, and beauty. Younger generations like Gen Z and Gen Alpha are at the forefront of this trend. “It is the rising population of Generation Zillennial and Generation Alpha who are driving its growth in India. Their strong affinity for global trends, social media influence, and global ambitions demanding the best beauty products from across the world have positioned them as the primary consumers of K-beauty,” says Manasa Garemella, co-founder of kindlife.in—a multi-brand Korean and Japanese beauty platform. Industry experts believe that the future of Korean beauty in India is set to shine even brighter in the coming years. This is already evident—not just in the growing number of products and brands but also with the arrival of Korean clinics (like KorinMi) and beauty treatments in the Indian skincare landscape. From viral Korean hair spas to snail mucin facials, one no longer needs to fly to South Korea to stock up on beauty essentials or experience a Korean skin analysis. “Trends like lightweight sunscreens and hybrid formulas are revolutionising beauty routines, captivating skincare enthusiasts across the country. K-beauty's cutting-edge technology and focus on high-quality, effective formulations ensure its enduring appeal, with numerous new launches expected to hit the Indian market,” shares Garemella. While the efficacy of K-beauty products is both praised and cautioned by Indian dermatologists, consulting a skincare specialist before using any product - Korean or otherwise - is always advisable. As for the hype, it has not lasted for over a decade without reason.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Must Watch

82710871-f74e-42da-9550-384112b4fab8,"How social media made investing 'cool' for young IndiansA recent report shows that 93 per cent of young adults actively save money, with a significant portion allocating 20–30 per cent of their monthly earnings towards future financial goals. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/how-social-media-made-investing-cool-for-young-indians-2674618-2025-02-05,"For Raghav Sharma*, a 25-year-old software developer from Delhi NCR, his work is his life. Not because he loves his job wholeheartedly, but because his job takes up a major chunk of his day, requiring him to be available almost all the time for his bosses. He says the company returns the ‘favour’ by giving him a salary that places him amongst the top 2 per cent of earners in India. This has often encouraged him to spend (uh, sorry, invest) a significant portion of his income in various assets. However, his investment preferences are not limited to the usual SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) and stocks; they also include options like US stocks and cryptocurrencies. Initially reluctant about investing, Raghav now spends most of his ‘free time’ exploring investment opportunities. When asked where he gets information about which stocks or crypto to buy or avoid, he admits he relies heavily on social media, particularly X (formerly Twitter).  “After finding promising recommendations on X, I do a bit of research online or consult friends who are into investing before putting my money in,” he says. The story is little different for Riddhi Agarwal*. The 24-year-old student, who earns money through side gigs and internships, tells India Today, she first learnt about investing through Instagram, which was a year ago. Now, she is not only investing herself, but has also taught her mother to do so. 

 



Increased awareness is prompting young Indians to explore diverse income streams. Photo: Unsplash
advertisementLike Riddhi and Raghav, a majority of young Indians want to or are investing their money. And for some, these options go far beyond the usual ways of investing.  Like Riddhi and Raghav, a majority of young Indians want to or are investing their money. And for some, these options go far beyond the usual ways of investing.  Fin One, a digital-first initiative by Angel One Limited, unveiled its 'Fin One: Young Indians’ Saving Habits Outlook 2024'. The data shows that 93 per cent of young adults actively save money, with a significant portion allocating 20-30 per cent of their monthly earnings towards future financial goals. The study also shows, for 62 per cent, YouTube is a primary source of education for savings and financial planning.‘Beyond SIPs and stocks’ A lot of young Indians are investing. However, for them, investment goes beyond stocks and SIPs. A December 2024 report by CoinSwitch revealed that India today has around 2 crore people investing in crypto. This majorly involves people from the age group of 18-35, including even smaller cities like Botad, Barbaka, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Patna, Kanchipuram, and Dehradun. This comes despite the Indian government not recognising cryptos as legal tender and imposing a 30 per cent tax on crypto income. Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred, which builds consumer tech for financial infrastructures, explains the boom amongst young audiences and their need for portfolio diversification. “For decades, stocks and Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) were the go-to investment avenues for young Indians. However, a new generation is emerging, armed with financial literacy and a hunger for diversification across multiple investment platforms, both traditional and non-traditional,” Tarun says. According to him, a major push has come from mobile apps that now enable Indian investors to invest in US stocks, crypto, and alternative assets, boosting the investor base. Other options include real estate crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, and digital gold, which offer avenues beyond traditional markets, appealing to tech-savvy millennials and Gen Z.

 



Various apps like Zebpay, coinswtich, Kucoin and more have enabled Indian investors to invest in US stocks, crypto, and alternative assets, boosting the investor base. Photo: Unsplash
 Another reason, according to Tarun, is the desire for quicker returns, pushing investors towards higher-risk, higher-reward options. “While stocks offer long-term growth, alternatives like cryptocurrencies and NFTs promise rapid gains, attracting a segment of younger investors,” says Tarun. Furthermore, the limitations of traditional investments have become apparent for the young crowd. ""Fixed deposits offer low returns in an inflationary environment, while stock market volatility can be unsettling. Diversification mitigates these risks by spreading investments across various asset classes. Finally, increased awareness of personal finance and a growing entrepreneurial spirit are prompting young Indians to explore diverse income streams and investment opportunities,"" he adds.  Apart from these, Harsh Gahlaut, the co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, says that the sudden increase in investing is also due to the rise of social media, which has gamified investing, glorifying high-stakes bets with promises of overnight riches.The gamification of investing ft. social media All the financial experts we spoke to seem to agree that social media and finfluencers play a major role in making investment 'cool'. Nitin Joshi, who once started his own business and is now a business content creator, is a name that often comes up when discussing finfluencers. Within just 94 days, he achieved an impressive 1M followers on Instagram. Finfluencer, he believes, can play a significant role in empowering people to invest smarter, especially through their content. He explains that by breaking down complex financial concepts into simple, digestible insights, finfluencers make investing more approachable for everyone, particularly beginners. “They [finfluencers] not only share valuable strategies but also help demystify key aspects of personal finance like budgeting, saving, and investing. This creates a pathway for new investors to build financial literacy, gain confidence, and make informed decisions, ultimately improving their financial well-being,” says Nitin. Sakchi Jain, a CA and finance educator on social media, who “simplifies finance from a Gen Z perspective” is another finfluencer who has gained a massive following in a short period of time. She points out that earlier, people mostly learnt about financial news through traditional media, which focused on market updates, stock movements, and economic events. But if someone wanted to understand the basics of investing - like how mutual funds work, what SIPs are, or how to build a portfolio - they had very few accessible resources. That’s where finfluencers have made a real difference. Instead of just sharing what’s happening in the markets, they explain the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of investing.

  “Through short, easy-to-understand content, we help bridge the knowledge gap, making finance approachable for beginners,” she says. Harsh further explains that often though, social media amplifies sensational content, fostering a herd mentality amongst investors. This results in a fear of missing out (FOMO) among young investors, drawing them to unconventional assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other unregulated products. But experts warn that this desire for quick gains often overshadows a key aspect of investing - risk management.‘How to become a millionaire by 20’ If you search online for methods to get rich faster, you’ll find yourself in a bubble of finfluencers offering all kinds of advice – ranging from how to build wealth quickly to how to become a millionaire or retire at a very young age and spend the rest of your life travelling 'like them'. Harsh warns that influencers [some, not all] often do more harm than good for investors, as their advice typically “overlooks the unique needs, goals, and risk tolerance of individuals.” “Their focus on creating engaging content, rather than offering responsible guidance, means they bear no accountability for the financial outcomes of those they influence. Only a qualified financial expert, aligned with your specific requirements, can provide truly valuable and personalised advice,” he says.   While finfluencers have contributed to greater awareness about investing, they’ve also amplified the ""greed factor,"" setting unrealistic expectations and encouraging risky behaviour, according to Harsh. “Many promote biased, promotional, or purely return-focused advice, neglecting the critical personalised aspects of investing. This has resulted in impulsive, thrill-driven decisions rather than disciplined, goal-based financial planning,” he adds. Tarun adds that such quick-rich schemes are rarely, if ever, sustainable. While the allure of rapid wealth is strong, true financial growth requires patience and a disciplined approach, he says.  



Building wealth is a marathon, not a sprint, and requires a steady hand and realistic expectations.

 “Chasing quick returns often leads to high-risk investments, which can result in substantial losses.  A sound financial strategy focuses on long-term goals, diversification, and consistent investing, even if it appears less exciting than promises of overnight riches,” Tarun says.  To tackle this, India’s market watchdog SEBI has often cracked down on influencers. The latest move came in January 2025, when it issued a draft circular restricting finfluencers from using the latest share price data when providing ‘educational content’. In August 2024, SEBI also asked finfluencers to register with them and adhere to specific guidelines - rules that even some finfluencers seem to agree with. For instance, Sakchi says SEBI’s intention behind the regulations is clear: to protect retail investors from misleading financial advice and ensure transparency in the financial content space. However, she points out that the challenge arises when all financial content creators are viewed through the same lens. ""There is a difference between those who provide educational content based on facts and research and those who promote risky or misleading investments. The current discourse sometimes paints all finfluencers in a negative light, which isn’t fair to those who genuinely focus on financial literacy and responsible investing,” she says. But how do you identify what is credible and what is not? Experts tell us.How to identify credible financial advice online? Tarun says to identify credible financial advice online, start by verifying the advisor’s credentials. Look for certifications such as SEBI Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) or qualifications from respected financial institutions.  Be cautious of individuals promoting specific products without disclosing any affiliations—transparency is crucial. Here are a few key filters to help identify credible investment advice on social media, according to Harsh:
Emphasis on goal-based investing: Trustworthy financial advice centres around tailored investment planning that aligns with individual goals rather than hype-driven strategies.
Avoid sensationalism: If the content prioritises excitement over solid financial principles, it’s a clear red flag.
Verify credentials: Ensure that the person offering advice has relevant financial expertise or certifications to back their claims.
Cross-check with credible sources: Reliable financial guidance is rooted in thorough research and data, not just personal anecdotes or opinions.
Customisation is key: Genuine advice recognises that every investor’s financial journey is unique. Be wary of generic, one-size-fits-all recommendations.
 Remember, investing isn’t about chasing thrills or following fleeting trends - it’s about building a disciplined, sustainable wealth creation plan. Social media can be a great learning tool, but blindly acting on trends without understanding the associated risks often leads to losses. Approach with caution and prioritise informed decision-making. (*names changed as per request)Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Must Watch

Experts share thoughtsThere have been numerous reports on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram where women have shared experiences of becoming pregnant after starting Ozempic. Many of these women had previously faced challenges with infertility, IVF, PCOS, and endometriosis.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/is-the-ozempic-baby-phenomenon-real-experts-share-thoughts-2675541-2025-02-06,"Ozempic helps with weight loss, but can it boost fertility too? Well, that’s what a bunch of videos on TikTok and Instagram claim. ‘Ozempic babies’—the term has started gaining precedence online after several women shared stories of their unexpected pregnancies after using Ozempic which is generally administered for weight loss and Type 2 diabetes. Now, most of you might wonder, so why it is even a big deal, right? Wrong! Here’s where it gets interesting. Most of these women who claimed they got pregnant after they started using ozempic had been struggling with infertility, IVF, PCOS, and endometriosis. So, does that mean that Ozempic boosts fertility too? In a video posted on Instagram last month, Demi Walker shared her experience with Ozempic. She recounted that, after encountering a TikTok trend about ""Ozempic babies""—stories of women who had been struggling with infertility, IVF, PCOS, and endometriosis falling pregnant while using Ozempic—she decided to conduct her own research. Despite years of trying various methods without success, she chose to privately purchase Ozempic as a final effort, fully aware of the need for caution and informed decision-making. After four months of consistent use, she administered her final injection and, within four weeks, discovered she was pregnant.

So, India Today decided to speak to experts who shed some light on the “Ozempic baby’ buzz.What exactly is an ‘Ozempic baby’?The term 'Ozempic baby' isn't a medical one. It's a phrase used by some people to talk about unplanned pregnancies that happen after taking Ozempic (a GLP-1 receptor agonist), a medication primarily prescribed for Type 2 diabetes and sometimes for weight management.Dr Sowmya K N, consultant – obstetrician and gynaecologist, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Kengeri, Bengaluru, explains, “Ozempic has been shown to help improve metabolic health, regulate sugar levels, and support weight management in women with conditions like obesity or PCOS. With weight loss, menstrual cycles often become more regular, improving the chances of conception. As a result, some women may find their fertility improved after using Ozempic for weight management.Any credible evidence?While there's no concrete scientific evidence directly linking Ozempic to increased fertility, there are some plausible explanations.“Weight loss due to Ozempic can improve ovarian health and hormonal balance, which in turn can enhance fertility in women, especially those with conditions like PCOS. It's well-documented that even a modest weight loss of 4-5 kg can increase conception rates by 40-50%. So, while it might not be a ""side effect"" in the traditional sense, weight loss achieved through Ozempic can certainly contribute to better fertility outcomes, but again there is no credible research to support this,” says Dr Sowmya.Have doctors seen this happen?Yes, some healthcare professionals have observed cases where women experienced improved fertility after losing weight with the help of Ozempic.For instance, Dr Manjula Anagani, clinical director, robotic gynaecologist and HOD, Care Vatsalya, Women and Child Institute, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, noted that weight loss and metabolic improvements through medications like Ozempic have enabled conception for women who previously faced infertility. “In practice, I've encountered narratives where weight loss and metabolic improvements through remedies like Ozempic enabled conception for women formerly facing “barrenness”. That said, births shouldn't be attributed to the prescription itself but rather to addressing underlying conditions,” she says.

However, according to medical literature, there have been a few reported cases of women conceiving while on this medication. So far, no major birth defects have been confirmed. However, as a precaution, it is strongly advised to discontinue Ozempic immediately upon confirming pregnancy, as there is a potential risk of birth defects,” she says.“Since this is a newer drug, more studies are needed to fully understand its effects on pregnancy and fetal development. If you are planning to conceive or suspect you are pregnant while using Ozempic, it is best to consult a healthcare provider for guidance,” she adds.Studies to support?At a stage where Ozempic is still being tested for its effectiveness on weight loss, it is very difficult to ascertain if it has a role to play in improving pregnancies.

There are just anecdotal reports at the moment claiming its efficiency.However, one thing that most experts claim is the fact that losing weight can improve fertility in many cases. A University Health blog suggests, “As a woman loses weight, there are fewer fat cells producing estrogen. This can cause the body to recognize that it isn’t already pregnant—and prepare itself to become pregnant.

Hold on, no need to give up just because of the title of this viral challenge.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/how-to-stick-to-phone-free-february-challenge-and-reduce-screen-time-2675803-2025-02-06,"A new trend on the block challenges you to reduce your screen time and go 'Phone-Free' this February. But hold on, no need to give up just because of the title of this viral challenge! In today’s digital world, it is nearly impossible for people to ditch their mobile phones for an entire month. That’s why this challenge - a non-profit campaign co-created by the Global Solidarity Foundation - offers two levels to choose from: Phone-Free and Phone-Flex. Phone-Free is the radical level, requiring you to give up your phone entirely for a month. However, there is also the more achievable Phone-Flex level, which focuses on reducing your phone usage and overall screen time. According to Statista, the average mobile screen time in India was around 4.77 hours per day.

 



Excessive phone usage is linked with increased risk of several health issues. (Photo: Pexels)
 It’s not uncommon for people to take their phones to the toilet and unknowingly spend 30 to 60 minutes scrolling. Similarly, they may pick up their phone to send a text or make a call but end up getting lost in mindless social media browsing. If you’re someone who struggles to put your phone down, you may want to take up this challenge - your health will thank you for it. Excessive phone usage is linked to several physical and mental health conditions, including eye strain, neck pain, back pain, loneliness, mood disorders, and sleep disturbances. Several studies also suggest that it is associated with difficulties in cognitive-emotional regulation, impulsivity, social media addiction, shyness, and low self-esteem. Unhealthy eating habits, migraines, reduced physical fitness, and changes in the brain’s grey matter volume have also been linked to excessive phone usage. On the contrary, cutting back your phone use by even one hour a day can have significant health benefits. Phones and social media apps are designed to be addictive. Cutting down your screen time will require you to challenge your dopamine boost loop. Why? Because your brain becomes accustomed to the constant dopamine hits you experience while using your phone - whether it’s from receiving a new message, watching a Reel, or getting a new notification. This cycle of instant gratification makes it harder to stay away from screens. If you want to rethink your relationship with your phone and cut down your daily screen time, here are a few tips to follow:Disable push notifications for unnecessary apps Begin by disabling push notifications from unnecessary apps like beauty stores, food delivery services, and even Instagram if possible. Many of us pick up our phones every time a notification pops up on the screen. You should also consider deleting unwanted apps.Start with mini breaks Challenge your brain smartly by taking several short screen-free breaks. Start with 10 minutes, then gradually extend them to 30 minutes and one hour. If you manage well, try a completely phone-free day once a week. However, if you experience heightened anxiety or panic attacks when taking phone breaks, it is advisable to consult a mental health expert.Have an ‘offline’ plan To avoid picking up your phone out of boredom, keep yourself occupied with other activities such as reading, exercising, colouring, doodling, walking, cooking, meal-prepping, or solving puzzles. Choose activities you enjoy. If you find yourself feeling bored, remind yourself that it is actually beneficial for your health.Don’t take your phone to the loo or bedroom This step can help in multiple ways. Taking your phone to the washroom is a recipe for disaster (it exposes you to various germs, increases the risk of infections, and can even lead to painful haemorrhoids). Similarly, using your phone before bedtime can negatively affect your sleep quality, leading to a host of health issues.

 



Beyond the obvious germ factor, taking phone to the loo invites a whole list of other health issues. (Photo: Getty)
 By avoiding phone use in bed and the bathroom, you not only reduce screen time but also protect your health.Let your friends and family know Inform your social circle that you’re trying to reduce your phone usage so you don’t feel pressured to reply instantly, making it easier to stay off your mobile.Remind yourself It’s all about training your brain. Keep reminding yourself why you are on this quest to reduce phone usage -find your ‘why’. Before picking up your phone, take a moment to decide what you want to do and for how long.

For some, it was tax relief; for others, it was the focus on science and development. However, it was also significant for Bihar, as the state received several key initiatives. One such announcement that caught people’s attention was the focus on makhana - yes, those fox nuts that have been a staple in Indian pantries for years. During the budget, Nirmala Sitharaman declared that a ""Makhana Board"" would be set up in Bihar. This initiative aims to enhance production, processing, value addition, and marketing of Makhana. Bihar is the largest producer of these nuts in India, contributing 80 per cent of the country’s supply, yet it has struggled to capitalise on the growing global demand for this superfood. “The board will provide hand-holding and training support to makhana farmers and will also work to ensure they receive the benefits of all relevant government schemes,” the finance minister said.‘The black diamond’ Makhana has gained popularity only in recent years. This rise can be credited to various factors (which we’ll discuss shortly), but its prominence isn’t just limited to India - it has also caught attention in the West. Industry players selling makhana both in India and abroad share the same story of increasing demand. Let’s look at the numbers. Data shows that India is the largest exporter of makhana worldwide. In the fiscal year 2023-2024, India exported approximately 25,130 metric tons of makhana. The top importers? The US, Canada, and Australia, with the US being the largest consumer.

advertisementIndia Today spoke to various snack business owners, and they all agreed that demand for this superfood is surging. India Today spoke to various snack business owners, and they all agreed that demand for this superfood is surging. But how did makhana become a global superfood? The superfood factor One major reason for makhana’s growing reputation is its nutritional value. Often referred to as a superfood, makhana is packed with essential nutrients, making it a must-have on a balanced diet. According to Rajeev Pabreja, secretary of the Nuts and Dry Fruits Council of India (NDFCI), makhana is an excellent choice for those aiming for weight loss due to its high protein and low-calorie content. “With high antioxidant and flavonoid levels, it helps combat inflammation and ageing,” he adds. Beyond weight management and heart health, makhana also aids digestion. “Its high fibre content helps regulate blood sugar and improves insulin sensitivity,” says Karishmma Chawla, functional medicine nutritionist and lifestyle educator. Deepti Khatuja, head clinical nutritionist at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, highlights that foxnuts are loaded with proteins, healthy fats (omega-3), vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. “They are rich in folates, fibres, and essential minerals such as magnesium, phosphorus, copper, iron, zinc, and vitamins B1, B2, B3, and selenium—many of which play a crucial role in strengthening the immune system and improving cardiac health,” she explains. With these health benefits and a rising trend of healthy snacking, makhana’s popularity has skyrocketed. Another reason behind its global appeal is the efforts of Indian entrepreneurs and brands promoting it as a healthier alternative to traditional snacks. Aashutosh Aggarwal, chief commercial officer of Snackpure, a brand selling makhana and other nuts, tells India Today, “Various health and lifestyle influencers have advocated the nutritional benefits of makhana. Recently, makhana gained considerable media attention after Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha, emphasised its potential as a superfood.”

— Nikhil Kamath (@nikhilkamathcio) January 17, 2025 Aditya Sameer Kaji and Aarti Kaji, Harvard graduates, founded Taali Foods in 2018 in the US as a healthy snacking brand. Today, Taali offers various snack options, with makhana being one of its top sellers abroad. The idea for the business stemmed from their own experiences - packing large quantities of makhana whenever they travelled from India to university. Taali was born as a way to introduce a healthy snack option to Western consumers. “We introduced makhana in flavours like Sriracha and Cheddar Cheese so that people would be encouraged to try it. Instead of just targeting Indian stores in the US, we placed our products in mainstream supermarkets like Whole Foods. We also rebranded it as ‘water lily pops’ instead of makhana,” Aarti told India Today, explaining their marketing strategy.

 Today, Taali exports to various countries, helping to push makhana beyond the NRI market and into the mainstream Western snack industry. When asked why they think the West is suddenly obsessed with makhana, Aditya smiled and said, “We’d like to think we [Indian snack brands in the west] played a small role in it.” He’s not wrong. Several brands like Taali, Farmley, and others are capitalising on the healthy snacking movement, marketing makhana in flavours suited to Western palates. This has encouraged not just NRIs but also Western consumers to try it. Aman Gupta, head of marketing at Farmley, a dry fruits and nuts business selling both in India and abroad, describes fox nuts as a nutritional powerhouse. “As India embraces a healthy snacking revolution, makhana stands out as a wholesome, home-grown superfood that aligns with modern dietary needs,” Aman says. PS: Bohana is another brand that sells popped water lily seeds and even made it to the US Shark Tank in 2020!

The Ayurveda in the West A post shared by Startups Global (@startupsglobal)
 When we talk about Ayurveda, most people think of medicine. However, did you know that at its essence, Ayurveda is a holistic system that also includes an ‘Ayurvedic diet’, a way of eating that focuses on fresh, seasonal, and nourishing foods using natural ingredients. With India being the birthplace of Ayurveda, many people in the West are embracing Ayurvedic dietary principles by consuming natural Indian foods. Ingredients like moringa, ashwagandha, and shilajit have gained popularity, thanks in part to social media influencers who highlight their benefits. Makhana has also benefitted from this trend.The GI tag In 2022, the Indian government awarded the prestigious Geographical Indication (GI) tag to Mithila Makhana, recognising its deep-rooted heritage in Bihar’s Mithila region. This certification is more than just a title - it helps protect the name “Mithila Makhana” from misuse, boosts its market value, and ensures fair earnings for farmers while also paving the way for increased exports. What makes Mithila Makhana so special? It’s not just where it’s grown but how. The flood-prone lands of Mithila and parts of Nepal provide the perfect mix of soil, water, and climate, nurtured by farming traditions passed down through generations. Packed with protein, magnesium, calcium, and iron, makhana is both nutrient-rich and culturally significant, playing an essential role in rituals like Kojagara Puja. With this recognition, over 500,000 farmers in Bihar stand to gain better incomes and improved livelihoods. Makhana now joins the ranks of other GI-tagged Indian treasures like Darjeeling Tea and Basmati Rice, carving its place on the global stage as a premium superfood.What can the budget do for makhana? Nearly 80 per cent of India’s makhana cultivation comes from Bihar’s Mithila region. To understand why a Makhana Board is essential, we must first understand how makhana is grown. Farmers in Bihar have turned a challenge into an opportunity by cultivating makhana in flood-prone areas. The process begins in March-April when seeds are scattered in still water bodies. As plants grow, their leaves float on the surface while seeds develop below. By monsoon, the water is drained, revealing thousands of black, marble-like seeds, hence the nickname ‘black diamond.’ However, harvesting is labour-intensive, with farmers manually collecting seeds from muddy waters. After harvesting, the seeds must be sun-dried, roasted in clay ovens, and hand-popped to create the crunchy, white makhana pearls. Despite this effort, makhana farmers face challenges. The supply chain involves multiple middlemen, inflating prices while leaving farmers underpaid. Makhana is also highly seasonal, leading to fluctuating prices, sometimes as high as Rs 5,000.

 Experts believe that with the formation of the Makhana Board and government support, production can be streamlined, ensuring fairer prices and better livelihoods for farmers. With the global makhana market projected to reach USD 177.7 million by 2025, this initiative could significantly boost India’s food industry. While business owners dream of replacing popcorn with makhana, there’s still a long way to go. However, there’s no denying that people are going nuts over it, and makhana is on its way to becoming a global superstar—sorry, superfood.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Trending Reel

But social media has turned the search into a paradox.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/indian-travellers-are-craving-offbeat-escapes-but-heres-the-irony-2676448-2025-02-07,"In the past, let’s say 15-20 years back, travelling used to be an annual or biannual affair. It would mostly mean family vacations covering places within India. However, the way we travel has undergone a massive change in the last couple of years, and a few factors are responsible for this—#1 being the influencer culture. After the pandemic, revenge travel gained the spotlight, and from what it seems, it never went down. Post-pandemic, people started travelling to different destinations as an act of revenge for missing out on two years spent in lockdown due to the pandemic. Travel influencers and vloggers also popped up around this time, telling people when, where, and how to travel. Now, when overcrowding has become a problem in the most-hyped destinations, people have started looking for alternatives - offbeat destinations in India and abroad - because, after all, vacations are taken for relaxation, and these underrated destinations offer that. India Today spoke to experts from the travel industry to weigh in on this evolving trend and what’s driving it.The rise of offbeat travel “This destination, just 3 hours from Delhi, has a view like the Maldives. I bet you did not know about this gem.”  - That’s it. That is enough of a hook phrase to get you glued to a Reel, and the next thing you know, you’re telling your partner, friends, or family about it, and voila, a plan is almost on. Everyone wants to travel to offbeat and lesser-known destinations because visiting one is a flex in itself, apart from everything else. According to Anil Lohia, COO of TripXL, Indian travellers are now seeking authentic, cultural, and unique experiences over traditional tourist hotspots. And this is the reason why there is a surge in offbeat tourism. Easy access to e-visas and visa-on-arrival facilities for Indian citizens has made things more convenient. ""Owing to the rising influence of social media, digital exposure, and the increasing growth in per capita income, Indians are travelling more than ever before,"" he notes. Similarly, Santosh Kumar, country manager for India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Indonesia at Booking.com, tells India Today that travellers are venturing beyond traditional tourist hotspots, driven by a desire for deeper cultural immersion, exploration of heritage and culinary delights, and meaningful connections with local communities. He highlights a surge in searches for lesser-known locations, with Shahdag (Azerbaijan) emerging as the top searched international destination in 2024.

 “With Indian travellers seeking new experiences, unexplored international destinations like Stepantsminda (212%), Baku (203%), and Troms¸ (185%) also emerged as popular choices. Domestically, travellers sought authentic experiences with destinations such as Perumbakkam (Chennai), Pangala (Karnataka), and Tekkumuri (Kerala) gaining popularity,” he says.Emerging destinations on the Indian traveller’s map As mentioned above, the post-pandemic period has seen an uptick in travel to more tranquil but breathtaking places. “Over the past few years and especially in the post-Covid era, travellers are increasingly exploring lesser-known yet pleasantly tranquil destinations like Turtuk in Ladakh, Chitkul, Tawang, and Chikmagalur in India. When it comes to international escapes, Vietnam, Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan make it to the top of the list as they offer an extraordinary mix of culture, adventure, and solitude.” Vaibhav Kala, founder of Aquaterra Adventures Ltd., further expands on this, pointing to a global wishlist that includes Georgia, Japan, the Dolomites in Italy, Wales, Panama, Morocco, Costa Rica, Mendoza in Argentina, Almaty, Bolivia, Chamonix, Gilgit.

 “Indians are travelling to these and more... Last summer, our Trek around Mont Blanc sold out in a fortnight on a hike across France, Italy, and Switzerland. Aconcagua near Mendoza saw Indians summit on Republic Day this year, and a summer Dolomites trek in Italy runs full,” he mentions.What’s driving this trend? As mentioned earlier, several factors contribute to these changing demands among Indian travellers. Vaibhav Kala explains that the increased spending power of young Indians, who are eager to explore new terrains, is one of them. Actor and travel blogger Shenaz Treasury agrees. She says, “With higher disposable incomes and greater travel awareness than before, young Indians are now exploring international destinations more frequently. When I was in my early twenties, most people couldn’t afford to travel abroad unless they were relocating for work or college.”

 Speaking about young people travelling more, Kala further explains, “The higher spending power among the youth of the country gets them exploring new territories and new grounds. With the recent tax breaks for people earning Rs 12 lakh, we will see a lot of that budget moving to travel. The youth are intrigued by the world, and travel has become easier in recent times with trade treaties that our government has signed with various countries. Getting visas and visa-on-arrival is changing the game for Indians looking to travel globally.” He adds that in the Instagram generation, everyone wants to have something to show and tell on their handles and create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) amongst those who haven’t discovered the world yet. This trend leads to people wanting to top the other in their discovery of destinations, food, fashion, etc. Moreover, Lohia adds, ""Affordable luxury, budget-friendly and tailor-made service options, and a shift towards cultural immersion have been pivotal in driving the trend of exploring unexplored places. Travellers are actively seeking traditional and rejuvenating experiences to escape monotony.""Does ‘offbeat’ even exist in the age of influencers? Shenaz Treasury breaks down the ‘offbeat’ paradox brilliantly. “Because of Instagram, all the hidden gems are coming out. People are looking for places that are not overcrowded. Goa, Manali, and Bali are flooded with tourists. Even Bali is full of Indian tourists now, along with Western tourists. It’s hard to enjoy peace because everyone is taking selfies everywhere, and it’s actually very annoying. I love to travel, but I start dreading going to places like this because I don’t want to deal with the crowds,” she explains. “There’s also the rise of remote work, which allows people to work from wherever they are. I’ve seen people working in Bali, Manali, and, of course, Goa. With flexible schedules, many are looking to spend more time in nature—but finding untouched nature in this country is becoming increasingly difficult due to overpopulation,” she adds.Conclusion As Shenaz Treasury puts it, “The trend of travelling to offbeat destinations is real, but I don’t know if people are finding what they are looking for because, in India, every place—whether it’s the Andamans or Meghalaya—is already very crowded.” While offbeat travel may pique our interest, at the end of the day, whether a destination is actually offbeat, in the true sense of the word, is doubtful.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 7, 2025

3264d262-6a63-4c30-9881-b781a5da93b0,Only 3% of Indians have a healthy relationship with technology: SurveyThe State of Emotional Wellbeing Report 2024 reveals the many emotional wellbeing issues affecting Indians and the efforts that are needed to tackle them.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/only-3-indians-have-a-healthy-relationship-with-technology-survey-2677262-2025-02-09,"Brain Rot, Doomscrolling, Digital Dementia, Internet-Induced ADHD, Phantom Vibration Syndrome—these are some of the buzzwords people frequently throw around when discussing how technology is affecting everyone’s mental wellbeing. The State of Emotional Wellbeing Report 2024 reveals the many emotional wellbeing issues affecting Indians and the efforts that is needed to tackle them. The findings are based on over 83,000 counselling sessions, 12,000 screenings, and 42,000 assessments. The digital life imbalance Only 3 out of 100 individuals have a healthy digital-life balance. A staggering 50% of individuals fell into the ‘poor’ category, struggling to disconnect from their devices, while another 10% had an ‘inadequate’ digital life balance.The rise in mental health awareness One of the standout findings is the 15% rise in mental health-related counselling. The report suggests that anxiety, depression, and workplace stress have been the main reasons why people continue to seek professional help. Surprisingly (a pleasant one), 23% of employees who are seeking support for work-related issues, struggled with difficult workplace relationships. This emphasises the need for healthier communication and psychologically safe workplaces.More men seeking counselling Traditionally, women have been more open to seeking therapy and emotional support. When it comes to men, they shy away from seeking help as most believe it is “not too manly” to do so, say experts. However, the latest trends show that there has been a 7% increase in men availing counselling. This signals a positive and much-welcome change. 70% of financial consultations were taken by men, while women attended 60% of relationship counselling sessions.Mental health issues are more common among the young Mental health concerns are disproportionately affecting younger age groups, with anxiety and depression peaking among those under 30. The survey found that stressors such as job transitions and relationship management contribute to elevated anxiety and depression levels, with 92% of individuals under 25 showing symptoms of anxiety and 91% exhibiting signs of depression.Suicide risks are on the rise While there are some positives in the report, this one might not be a pleasant finding. According to the survey, there has been a 22% rise in suicide risk cases and a 17% rise in distress cases compared to last year (2023). Nearly half of those seeking counselling faced serious emotional challenges. The report stresses the urgent need for accessible, high-quality mental health resources and proactive intervention. The report, State of Emotional Wellbeing Report 2024, shows a clear picture - while mental health awareness is growing, so are the challenges. Now, it rests on us how we tackle it.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 9, 2025Tune InTrending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/the-west-is-obsessing-over-shilajit-which-has-been-a-secret-for-indians-for-ages-2677319-2025-02-10,"A few months ago, during my trip to the mountains, I came across an interesting vendor. Wearing an old jacket and wrapping a shawl around himself, he was probably the first or maybe the second vendor who was hiding what he was selling. As we got closer, he reached into his pocket and showed us a black, tar-like substance that he claimed was the solution to everything—from poor libido to weakness. ""This is shilajit from the Himalayas,"" he claimed, along with an inappropriate jingle that made us laugh dismissing both the product and him out of embarrassment. Now, here we are. If you’ve ever been to the mountains, especially in the Himalayas, you might have seen many vendors casually selling shilajit. But, little did we know that this mineral is making waves not only in India but also across the globe.

 



Shilajit is predominantly found in the Himalayan region. Photo: Freepik
 Data shows that India is the largest exporter of shilajit, with the US being its biggest buyer. But how did shilajit become so popular, and what can it actually do to your body, especially for women? We tried to find out. But first things first.Where can you find shilajit? Shilajit has various names. The Persians called it ""mummy"" or ""mumiay"" and believed that this organic mineral could cure all diseases and even heal broken bones. It is also referred to as ""salajeet"" in Pakistan, and the Russians call it ""mumiyo"" or ""mumie."" For us Indians, shilajit has mentions in ancient Ayurvedic texts and is a key ingredient in Siddha and Unani medicine, as well as in folk remedies, particularly in mountainous regions. The use of shilajit dates back thousands of years, with mentions in Sanskrit texts and later inclusion in Ayurvedic texts like Charaka (125-150 AD), Sushruta (200-500 AD), and Vagbhatta (600 AD). Some believe that shilajit was introduced to India by Arabian traders under the name ""Momian,"" later recognised and adopted by Ayurvedic physicians for its medicinal uses.

 



Shilajit is a powerful adaptogen. Photo: Freepik
 Today, you can find shilajit predominantly in the Himalayan region, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. It is typically extracted from elevations between 16,000 to 19,000 feet. Although traditionally produced in India, shilajit is also found in other mountainous regions, such as the Caucasus Mountains, Altai Mountains, and Gilgit-Baltistan.What happens when women take shilajit? Though often marketed for men, shilajit offers significant benefits for women. Dr Mickey Mehta, a holistic health coach, explains, ""Shilajit is a gift from the Himalayas, deeply rooted in Ayurveda as a powerful rejuvenator for women. It purifies the body by flushing out toxins, strengthens digestion, and supports liver health."" Dubai and Delhi-based culinary nutritionist and holistic wellness coach Eshanka Wahi adds, ""Shilajit helps balance hormones (regulating estrogen and progesterone levels), boosts energy, reduces fatigue, enhances mood, supports joint health, and improves skin health and bone strength. It’s a natural powerhouse supplement that supports overall wellness when taken consistently."" Shilajit helps regulate hormones, easing PMS, irregular periods, and supporting fertility and PCOS by strengthening the reproductive system. It also has a calming effect, reducing stress and sharpening focus, allowing women to maintain balance and vitality. Rich in minerals and fulvic acid, it fights fatigue and nourishes skin, hair, and bones - especially important after menopause. Additionally, it may help increase iron levels in anaemic women.What does it do for men? Today, various products on the market (in India and abroad) promote shilajit as the ""IT supplement"" for men. From influencers to Bollywood celebrities, everyone seems to endorse it. But is it as effective as advertisements claim? ""Shilajit is a powerful adaptogen, helping the body cope with physical and emotional stress. Studies show it increases sperm count, boosts testosterone, stamina, and improves reproductive health,"" says Dr Mehta. Shilajit supports cognitive function, sharpening focus, memory, and mental clarity while fighting fatigue. ""Research shows that shilajit helps reduce bad cholesterol (LDL), improves blood flow, and lowers oxidative stress,"" Dr Mehta adds. However, he emphasises that for optimal benefits, ""It must be purified (Shuddha) and taken in the right Ayurvedic dosage and method."" Eshanka Wahi points to scientific studies supporting these claims, citing a 2016 study published in Andrologia, which found that men who consumed purified shilajit for 90 days experienced a 23.5 per cent increase in testosterone levels. However, more extensive studies are needed to prove its effectiveness.Why is the West suddenly obsessed with it? In August 2024, shilajit made headlines when an Australian company, Himalayanpowdershilajit, started selling it for as much as Rs 3,700 per 15 grams. Like Himalayanpowdershilajit, many brands today (both Western and Indian catering to Western audiences) are cashing in on the trend. In fact, India is the largest exporter of shilajit to the West. The West has shown a pattern of adopting Ayurvedic herbs - first Ashwagandha, then Brahmi, Neem, and Tulsi. Now, shilajit is their new obsession. Dr Mehta says, ""As Ayurvedic wisdom gains traction, it has also caught the fancy of the modern world. People are turning to natural adaptogens like shilajit over pharmaceuticals.""

 Many wellness influencers and fitness enthusiasts now promote shilajit as a natural testosterone booster and muscle-building supplement. The presence of fulvic acid has also made it popular in the anti-ageing market. ""Western biohackers see shilajit as a natural way to optimise health. It’s now seen as part of the biohacking trend alongside fitness, longevity, and anti-ageing,"" says Eshanka Wahi. With a growing preference for holistic health, many Westerners are looking for natural ways to enhance brain function, energy, and overall well-being-exactly what shilajit has offered in Ayurveda for centuries.Who should not take shilajit? “After I had this herb, I had to change my pad every 15 minutes,” shares Dr Mitali, who goes by @dr.uterus on Instagram. She recounts a story from her eighth standard when a vendor in Himachal sold her mother an herb, claiming it was good for her children. Long story short, after consuming shilajit, she experienced uncontrollable bleeding. Have a look at the video:

 Despite its many benefits, shilajit is not suitable for everyone and should be taken with caution. Dr Mickey Mehta warns against its use in certain cases:
Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid it.
People with iron overload (hemochromatosis) should steer clear, as shilajit is rich in iron.
Those with high uric acid levels or gout may experience flare-ups.
It may lower blood pressure, so those with hypotension should avoid it.
Shilajit can stimulate the immune system, which may be harmful to individuals with autoimmune disorders like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.
Those with compromised liver or kidney function should avoid it.
It may interact with anticoagulants, diabetes medications, and blood pressure medications.
 Low-quality shilajit can cause severe side effects, as seen in Dr Mitali’s case. Possible side effects of excessive or low-quality shilajit include:
Digestive discomfort (nausea, diarrhoea)
Increased uric acid levels
Allergic reactions (rash, dizziness)
 Always remember to consult a professional before taking shilajit, based on your bloodwork.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 10, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/ranveer-allahbadia-samay-raina-indias-got-latent-controversy-vulgar-joke-gone-too-far-2677721-2025-02-10,"On Monday, February 10, YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia, aka BeerBiceps, was under fire on social media and landed in legal trouble for making 'inappropriate' jokes and remarks during his appearance on Samay Raina's show India’s Got Latent. ""Shame on you, Ranveer bhai... you lost my respect,"" commented a user on Allahbadia’s latest Instagram post. The comment received 700 likes. Such is the state of his comment section right now. A content creator and podcaster with millions of followers online, now Ranveer, is facing a wave of anger from the 'disappointed’ masses. According to his Instagram bio, Ranveer is an ""entrepreneur"" and a promoter of ""peace & growth"". He is often seen sharing content on spirituality, politics, relationships, etc and has taken interviews of various Bollywood celebrities and politicians, but things took a drastic turn overnight for him and a few others after a clip from Samay Raina’s show India’s Got Latent went viral.  Now, his comment section is flooded with criticism over his remarks, with many believing he took things too far.
 


 The clip that sparked the outrage was a video that landed him in trouble - both legally and online. In the video, during the show, Ranveer, who was a panelist, asks a question to the contestant, one that might haunt him for a long time: ""Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once to make it stop forever?"" At that moment, Ranveer appeared somewhat proud of himself for making the ‘joke’ while the audience and panel laughed along in the video, but as the episode went up, not everyone seemed to be laughing about it. The apology and the FIRs Soon the backlash intensified, and a complaint was filed against Ranveer Allahbadia for ""promoting obscenity"" and using offensive language. The complaint was submitted to the Mumbai Police Commissioner and the National Commission for Women, following which the Mumbai Police initiated an inquiry and registered an FIR - not just against Ranveer but also against social media influencer Apoorva Makhija (who was also part of the show) and comedian Samay Raina himself. Furthermore, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis commented on Monday that while freedom of speech exists in the country, it ends when it “encroaches upon the freedom of others”. ""I have come to know about it. I haven’t seen it yet. Things have been said and presented in the wrong way. Everyone has freedom of speech, but our freedom ends when we encroach upon the freedom of others... In our society, we have certain rules, and if someone violates them, it is absolutely wrong, and action should be taken against them,"" Fadnavis told reporters.

A quick look at the comment section reveals a common sentiment: his content doesn’t align with the ‘joke’ he made. Have a look at some of the (decent) comments we picked:
 



 



 


 As of now, the investigation is still ongoing. However, this isn’t the first time Samay Raina’s show has landed in trouble. In fact, India’s Got Latent often faces criticism online, and sometimes, the consequences go beyond just social media outrage. The most recent one was on February 5. An FIR was filed against Jessy Nabam, a contestant on India’s Got Latent, for making controversial remarks about eating dog meat. Nabam claimed that people from Arunachal Pradesh commonly consume dog meat and sometimes even eat their pets. Tinkesh Kaushik, the world’s first triple amputee to trek Everest Base Camp, also criticised the show for its content. ""Disrespecting people with disabilities is not dark humour,"" Kaushik told India Today. He had previously called out Samay Raina when one of the contestants made fun of people with disabilities, and the judges—including Raina—were seen laughing.advertisement‘Not everyone gets dark humour’Now, while one section of the audience is outraged over the ‘inappropriate’ and ‘vulgar’ jokes made on the show—often calling for a ban—another section argues that Samay and his show represent dark humour. But where do you draw the line? Is everything fair in the name of humour? There are two sides to this—some believe that making harsh jokes about someone’s appearance or disability is just dark humour, while others worry about the moral values these shows promote. Even experts often find these ‘lines’ blurred and confusing.In fact, after the incident, a lot of people took to Reddit to support Ranveer, and India's Got latent.

If you grew up in the 80s or 90s, the return of bangs might bring back memories (some fond, some harrowing) of the infamous ‘Sadhana cut.’ Named after the legendary actress Sadhana, this iconic hairstyle was the go-to choice for a style refresh without sacrificing long tresses. In the 90s, parents were particularly obsessed with it. Fringes then became associated with life’s upheavals. Cut to 2025, and they are back as a raging trend that you can’t ignore. Closer to home, Shraddha Kapoor got a bang-on makeover. She shared photos on Instagram flaunting her long wispy fringes.

 Amy Johnson, Dyson’s global director of haircare artistry, also considers bangs (fringes) a major hairstyle trend. “Bangs are the ultimate way to refresh your look. Whether you go for soft curtain bangs, playful choppy fringes, or edgy blunt cuts, bangs add a youthful and chic touch to any hairstyle. They’re versatile enough to complement sleek updos, textured waves, or even a simple, loose blowout. Not only do they enhance your overall style, but they also bring attention to your eyes and cheekbones, giving you that irresistible, flirty vibe perfect for any occasion,” she says. At the 2025 Grammys, Miley Cyrus flaunted her slightly curled bangs, perfectly complementing her smokey eye glam and nude lips.

 Lady Gaga, on the other hand, put forth a sharper look. She exuded goth glam in a black ensemble comprising a corset and a voluminous skirt, teamed with a black manicure and sharp winged eyeliner. However, her micro bangs – cut sharply – stole the show.

 Taylor Swift also took her bangs to the red carpet, turning up in a stunning Vivienne Westwood red corset dress. Sabrina Carpenter, the OG poster girl for bangs, gave her fringes a dramatic twist with soft curls.

 Several other stars, including Clairo, Julia Michaels, and GloRilla, brought the bangs to the Grammys. Basically, bangs have shed that stereotypical ‘trauma bangs’ image. In case you are also convinced to go for a bang-in makeover, we bring you some expert tips. “Someone with a round face should opt for softer bangs/fringe, whereas someone with a heart-shaped face can opt for more solid bangs/fringe. Oval and diamond face shapes can also opt for curtain bangs, while square and rectangular face shapes can go for side bangs,” suggests Shaheen Jumani, creative director at Looks Salon. However, if you have curly, frizzy hair, avoid cutting bangs – especially if you don’t want to spend an extra five minutes in the morning styling them. “Curly and frizzy hair tends to jump up after cutting, so styling is required,” says Jumani. Otherwise, even someone with curly hair can have beautifully done bangs.

Sugar. From our birthday cakes to breakup chocolates, sugar and sugary treats are deeply embedded in our culture and daily lives. That one bite we think is harmless, but experts worry that it is a silent threat lurking in our pantries. Today, even though there is a certain level of awareness amongst Indians, especially Gen Z, it is almost impossible for an average person (not a celebrity) to follow a sugar-free diet. However, it is the need of the hour to seriously consider the hazardous impact of sugar. India is one of the few countries where deaths due to excessive sugar consumption (diabetes, obesity, heart disease) are alarmingly high. Now, remember, while sugar is a carbohydrate that provides the body with energy, and natural sugars are found in many healthy foods, the problem lies in the overconsumption of refined and added sugars.  So, we have asked six experts to share their insights on how they think sugar is bad for you. 1. Leads to weight gain ""Sugar is nothing but empty calories that have no benefit on your health, and instead it can be deadly as a drug,"" says Madhura Paroolkar Behki, head nutritionist and dietician at Cult Transform.

advertisementShe explains that sugar ""doesn't keep you full for longer. It has no nutrients and just adds excess calories, which can lead to an increase in fat storage, especially around the belly area.""2. Causes blood sugar spikes and insulin resistanceDr Aishwarya Tandle, deputy manager of Medico Marketing at SAVA Herbals, explains that excessive sugar consumption makes the body less responsive to insulin, leading to insulin resistance. This increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and conditions like PCOS in women.3. Increases risk of heart diseaseDr Archana Batra, a dietician and certified diabetes educator, states that sugar consumption is linked to high blood pressure, fatty liver, and chronic inflammation, all of which are risk factors for heart disease.Multiple studies, including research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association released in 2014, have found that a diet high in added sugars increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Excess sugar contributes to abnormal cholesterol levels, and increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries due to plaque build-up). Chronic inflammation caused by high sugar intake further damages blood vessels, leading to hypertension and heart attacks.4. Negatively affects mental healthEven though we often associate sugar and junk food as a way to lift our spirits and mood, Dr Anjali Nain, senior dietician at Healthians, warns that excess sugar intake can trigger mood swings, anxiety, and even depression. advertisementSugar activates the brain’s reward system in a way similar to addictive drugs, leading to dependence.5. Contributes to premature skin ageingYes, consuming sugar can impact your skin, experts like Vriti Srivastav, holistic dietitian, say. That acne you got after going partying last night? Can be from the sugar you consume. Dr Srivastav explains that sugar speeds up skin ageing. The process of glycation damages collagen and elastin, proteins essential for youthful, hydrated skin. Over time, this can cause wrinkles and sagging.6. Weakens the immune systemSunil Lobo, a fitness expert, notes that sugar weakens immune function by increasing inflammation in the body. This makes it harder to fight off infections and can contribute to autoimmune conditions.7.  A hidden threat Madhura Paroolkar Behki and Dr Anjali Nain both agree that excess sugar has severe long-term consequences, making it a hidden health threat, as it is often overlooked. How to manage sugar cravingsIf you want to control your sugar cravings, here are some expert approved ways that you can manage your sugar cravings. 
Increase fibre intake: Foods like salads, cooked vegetables, and millets keep you full for longer, reducing sugar cravings.
Stay hydrated: Thirst is often mistaken for sugar cravings, so drink enough water throughout the day.
Balance meals: Ensure your diet includes protein, healthy fats, and fibre to keep you satisfied.

Choose healthy alternatives: Opt for natural sweeteners like dates, honey, or monk fruit instead of refined sugar.
Practice stress management: High stress levels and lack of sleep can trigger sugar cravings. Regular exercise and proper sleep can help maintain a hormonal balance.
Worst times to consume sugaradvertisementWhile it’s best to minimise sugar intake overall, all experts agree that certain times are worse than others:
On an empty stomach: This can cause a rapid spike and crash in blood sugar levels, leading to fatigue and mood swings.
Late at night: Sugar before bedtime can disrupt sleep and contribute to weight gain.
Before a workout: While sugar provides quick energy, it fades fast and can lead to exhaustion mid-workout.
During stress or emotional distress: Sugar may provide temporary relief but can create a cycle of emotional eating and increased cravings.
The bitter truth Sugar may be a staple in our diets, from our morning chai to our midnight dessert, but excessive consumption can have serious health consequences. From weight gain and diabetes to heart disease and skin ageing, the risks are undeniable. So, the next time you reach for that sugary treat, think twice!Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Must Watch

Gush over the viral video of the bride in green dancing to Chaudhary. Watch as her partner joins in - cheer for the couple, maybe even shed a happy tear. Scroll to move on. But Instagram’s algorithm shows you the same video, reposted by another page. It’s too wholesome to skip, so you watch it again. A few Reels later, it appears on your feed once again... and it goes on. If you're an active Instagram user, you've probably experienced this exact scenario unfolding on your feed.

 But what if we told you this video might never have gone viral - or even appeared on your feed - if not for a wedding social media manager’s keen eye? It was their decision to carefully extract this standout moment from the bride’s long, elaborate welcome dance that made it explode online. How do we know? Well, the manager who handled social media for this wedding told us.Rising trend of hiring social media managers A wedding social media manager (or wedding publicist) is emerging as a new-age profession, making its mark in India’s massive Rs 10 lakh crore wedding industry. Their job? To capture behind-the-scenes moments, post in real-time, build a social media strategy to make the couple go viral, ideate and execute ‘trending’ Reels, and share the couple’s wedding intangibles (photos and videos) in a visually appealing way on a dedicated wedding page. Though at a nascent stage, the trend of hiring social media managers for weddings is getting popular among Indian couples. The viral bald bride, who chose to ditch a wig on her wedding day as a powerful statement for those battling alopecia, too hired a social media agency to document her wedding.

 Wedding planning platform WedMeGood’s Annual Wedding Industry Report too identified the trend and noted almost 7 per cent Gen Z couples hired a social media manager for their wedding. “A growing number of wedding social media agencies have emerged, and many wedding photographers are now offering it as an add-on service with separate billing,” says Mehak Sagar Shahani, founder of WedMeGood, in an interview with India Today.

 Shaadi BTS, The Wedding Gram, What A Shot and Media Vows are some of the popular names.What exactly do wedding social media managers do? Expect 2-3 people from the wedding social media team to be present at the wedding, shooting content on their respective phones and executing pre-discussed Reel ideas (such as transition Reels or trend-based videos). Their other team members will simultaneously post BTS moments and wedding details strategically on the couple’s dedicated wedding page. Once the events are over, the team will continue managing the couple’s profile and posting wedding content (photos and videos) in an appealing manner for at least the next two weeks. This may also include transition Reels, viral-worthy moments, and heartfelt odes to the families.

 Before the project is finalised, the team meets the couple to understand their story, dynamics, vision, and specific deliverable requests. Only after this do they craft a strategy and generate ideas tailored to the couple. Mostly, the deliverables include the following (as shared by Nikita Kabra of The Wedding Gram):
advertisementShort-form videos that encapsulate raw emotions
Curated Instagram posts and captions that tell the story in the couple’s own voice
Behind-the-scenes moments that often go unnoticed but mean the most
Stories and trend-based Reels
The number of Reels and posts is often pre-discussed as part of the package. Some agencies charge Rs 50k per event day.If you’re someone who is always on social media, has a knack for storytelling (turning even random videos into meaningful content with a relevant song and text), loves weddings (including the chaos that comes with them), and has an eye for viral-worthy wedding content, you might be a great fit as a wedding content creator or wedding social media manager.What’s fuelling this trend?Modern Indian weddings are now heavily influenced by social media. From choosing makeup artists to discovering clothing labels, platforms like Instagram and Pinterest play signifcant. Naturally, couples (especially brides) aspire to be on the other side: dominating social media feeds, inspiring brides-to-be, and getting featured on wedding blogs and news portals.“So many brides book popular makeup artists to get featured on their social media handles, knowing they will be noticed and admired by their lakhs or even millions of followers,” shares Rohit Kadyan, a destination wedding photographer based in Delhi.From planning a viral-worthy wedding entry to creating offbeat moments during the celebrations, many couples now put extra thought into their nuptials to gain social media attention.advertisementThis is where social media managers come in - they take over the process, thereby also allowing couples to enjoy their wedding and be fully present in the moment.Wedding industry experts also agree that virality is one of the main reasons why couples are now roping in social media professionals for their weddings. Unlike the primary photography and videography teams, who prioritise quality and timelessness, social media managers cater to the instant gratification bit. These teams capture content on their phones, edit instantly and put up on social media right away for public consumption. Some of it is also trend-based, so the promptness is vital.Anupriya Khanna, marketing manager with luxury wedding photography team CineLove Productions, tells India Today:  “Almost every third wedding , especially grand-scale celebrations, now have social media team. Why? Because short-form content is on the rise, and its quick, effortless consumption makes it popular. Unlike traditional teasers and long-form videos, these clips are faster to create and watch. It feels like a moment just happened, and it’s already online for everyone to see and admire.”“People are planning their entries, artist performances, and even the entire schedule around it - ensuring they have a team to record and help make it go viral,” Khanna adds.advertisementIs social media fame the only factor? Nope.For many couples, hiring a social media manager isn’t just about going viral. Instead, it’s about capturing raw, intimate moments that the photography team might miss, and showcasing details on social media that might not make it to their personal profiles when sharing wedding snippets.“Mostly, when a couple shares photos on their social media profiles, they don’t go overboard. At the max, someone would post 20-30 posts. But when a social media agency takes over and creates a dedicated wedding page, it becomes a digital diary where you can unabashedly post anything and everything about the wedding without worrying about spamming your followers,” shares Nazneen Saiyed, founder of marketing agency Media Vows, who also handled the viral ‘Chaudhary’ dance couple’s wedding.This way, the key to attention they put while planning the wedding – be it the grand décor, wedding favour stations, quirky signages or little details like personalised napkins, song selection – also gets highlighted.

“While some do hope their content goes viral, most couples just want a well-documented wedding experience to look back on. It’s more about storytelling and capturing emotions rather than just chasing views,” adds Nikita Kabra, co-founder of The Wedding Gram.“Some people want every moment to be captured, while others have specific requests. Photographers often focus on the couple, but we ensure the family's presence and the couple's connection with them are also highlighted. There are countless real, exciting moments that often go unnoticed - we make sure they aren’t missed,” shares Nazneen.Meanwhile, Mehak highlights, how a lot of clips do not make it to the wedding videos and social media managers make such moments accessible.

Dentists agree that one should avoid rinsing with water after brushing their teeth. “Do not rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing. This applies both after you brush and after you use mouthwash. If you rinse, you wash away the fluoride, and it cannot work its magic to prevent cavities or decay. Fluoride is most effective when it stays on your teeth for an extended time,” says Dr Raghavendra B R, dentist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru. Dentists suggest spitting out the excess toothpaste and waiting for 20–30 minutes before drinking water. “Or, if one feels the need to rinse their mouth immediately after brushing their teeth, then using a fluoride mouth rinse can also work,” says Dr Suman Yadav, head of the maxillofacial and dental department at Numed Hospital, Noida. Fluoride, a mineral, protects enamel from the acid produced in the mouth by bacteria, thereby preventing cavities. It essentially reduces tooth decay and also protects against plaque build-up. “When the fluoride in toothpaste comes in contact with enamel, it integrates into the crystal structure and forms a mineral called fluorapatite, providing protection from acid attacks. Not only that, but it also promotes remineralisation by encouraging calcium and phosphate ions, which create a new surface on the teeth, making them acid-resistant,” explains Dr Bhargav K H, consultant paediatric dentist, maxillofacial and dental surgery at SPARSH Hospital, Bengaluru. Dentists hail fluoride as an important toothpaste ingredient. However, children and those diagnosed with dental fluorosis (a condition involving white spots or discolouration of the teeth) should avoid using fluoride-containing toothpastes. Even children, who may accidentally swallow toothpaste while brushing their teeth, are advised to use fluoride-free toothpastes. You do not need to follow the no-rinse rule when using fluoride-free toothpaste. Though gaining prominence, dentists do not recommend using toothpastes that do not contain this mineral. Non-fluoride toothpastes contain ingredients like xylitol (a natural sugar alcohol present in several fruits and vegetables). “The main drawback is that it does not provide the same level of protection against tooth decay as fluoride toothpaste. For general oral health, fluoride toothpaste is often the better option,” says Dr Raghavendra. Dr Bhargav agrees and adds: “Fluoride-free toothpaste does not protect the teeth from plaque and cavities as much as fluoride toothpaste does.” Meanwhile, here are a few basic oral hygiene tips for a healthy smile: - Brush your teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled brush. Brush in a circular motion so that all tooth surfaces are cleaned. - Flossing is a great habit to add to your daily routine. You can use traditional floss or opt for a water flosser to clean between your teeth and remove plaque and food particles from areas that brushing alone cannot reach. - Keep yourself hydrated and limit your consumption of sugar and acidic foods, as they can lead to tooth decay. - Experts suggest using an antibacterial mouthwash to reduce bacteria and freshen your breath. Make sure to choose one that is free of alcohol. - Smoking or using tobacco products is detrimental to overall health, including oral health. It increases the risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and oral cancer. And who wants those nicotine stains on their teeth? So, try to quit smoking.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 13, 2025Must Watch

But with DINK (Dual Income, No Kids) couples at an all-time high, how can you tackle the family pressure with the utmost subtlety?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/what-to-do-when-your-in-laws-pressure-you-about-kids-even-in-2025-2679569-2025-02-13,"The solution to any marital problem? Baccha karlo (make a baby). No problems at all? Phir bhi baccha karlo (nevertheless, make a baby). Because, believe it or not, for some people, a married couple’s solution to all problems (and even when you do not have any) lies in procreating. It is 2025, and while everything has evolved, some things remain unchanged—like the age-old pressure from in-laws to ‘give them grandkids.’The subtle (not-so-subtle) pressure Now, eventually, those stern warnings have mellowed into subtle implications (like we saw in Arati Kadav’s Mrs), but the pressure remains unchanged in most households.

 



Mrs is the remake of the Malayalam film The Great Indian Kitchen (2021).
 It all starts with small hints like: Do you know, Mrs Kapoor’s daughter is due next month” or maybe “Oh look how cute is that baby”. Then, a level up: “We’re not getting any younger, you know.” And finally, the emotional manipulation boss level: “What if something happens to us, and we never get to see our grandchild?” They will leave no stone unturned to convince you - Hum paal lenge (we will bring them up), budhape ka sahara (support in old age), khandaan ka waris (heir to the family lineage). Their reasons haven’t got any better but their implications have. If your in-laws are still treating your uterus (or your partner’s) like a community project, you need to know - your body, your choice and there ways to convey it (you can take the subtle route too).Align as a couple first According to Dr Nisha Khanna, psychologist and marriage counsellor, the first and most crucial step is for the couple to be on the same page. Bringing a third party or a child into the picture should only happen once they have clarity on how they feel about the situation. ""Having kids or choosing not to is a deeply personal decision, whether for a couple or an individual. If even one partner isn’t comfortable, parenthood shouldn’t be forced upon them,"" she says. Without mutual agreement, external pressure can amplify conflicts. Dr Khanna suggests a few things to keep in mind as a couple before conveying the decision to the respective in-laws. Comprehending the situation: Both partners must deeply understand and articulate why they do not want to move forward with the decision to have a child. It’s a significant life decision, and if they choose to delay or opt-out, they should be clear about their reasons. Honesty: If one or both partners are not ready for a child, forcing the decision can impact not only their own mental health, but also the child’s well-being in the future.Set boundaries without straining relationships The choice to have children is deeply personal and should never be influenced by external pressure. Times have changed and while many may want to understand it or not, new-age couples face several unique challenges – from career aspirations and financial considerations to environmental concerns and changing social dynamics, says Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing. The traditional timeline for starting a family has evolved, with many choosing to delay parenthood or remain child-free. Therefore, you should set your boundaries, politely. “Setting healthy boundaries with in-laws is essential. A firm but respectful conversation explaining your personal choices can help manage expectations. Couples can say, ‘We appreciate your care for our future, but we'll make this decision when and if we feel ready,’” she says. For the people pleasers out there: Remember, having children to please others often leads to resentment and can impact both the parents and the child's well-being. “Instead of buckling under pressure, couples should focus on their own readiness, desires, and life goals. The key is maintaining open communication with your partner and presenting a united front when dealing with family pressure. Your reproductive choices remain yours alone – in 2025 and always,” Dr Tugnait.Handling emotional reactions from family Chances are that each member of the family comes from a different school of thought and have deep-seated beliefs about parenting as a natural life milestone. Sometimes, it needs patience to understand that their pressure may stem from their upbringing as well as societal norms. So, the key is to acknowledge their thought as well and not come across as insolent. Dr Khanna advises couples to respond with patience and understanding. “We have to tell them how society is changing, how things are evolving, and what your goals are. If needed, you can have them read documentaries, books, or articles, or even watch something that highlights how this issue is impacting people,” she says. “Boundaries definitely play an important role. However, when setting boundaries, be polite yet firm, and remain respectful. Having a child or not is your personal decision, and if you are not comfortable with it, you have every right to express that. You can also share what specifically makes you uncomfortable about the idea,” Dr Khanna adds. Along with these, avoid getting into confrontations or dismissive replies that could escalate tensions and make them understand how important the family is to you and that you respect them.Each partner’s role in managing family expectations Unless and until you as a couple feel united and convinced, the conversation will fall flat. “The partner whose family is applying pressure should take the lead in conversations, as they have an established rapport and can communicate more effectively,” says Dr Tugnait. In situations like these, couples generally avoid going to get-togethers, afraid that someone might broach the “baby topic” again, but don’t do that. Instead, create new room for discussions that naturally steer conversations away from baby talk. “Both partners must be aligned, presenting a united message that respects family while firmly upholding their right to make personal decisions. This unified stance is more effective than any individual tactic,” she adds.Takeaway At the end of the day, it is your life so the choice should be yours. You want kids or not, no one else gets a vote - especially not the ones who won’t be waking up for your baby's 3 am feeding. When you fall under pressure and take a decision unwillingly, especially as big as having a baby, you might end up messing things up.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 13, 2025Must Watch

63c629b6-a4b9-4aea-a75a-31c786500adb,"Are red aloe vera products a scam?Aloe sanguinalis, also known as Somali red aloe or 'red aloe vera' gel, is gaining attention as a better alternative to aloe vera gel. However, experts seem to disagree.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/are-red-aloe-vera-products-a-scam-stmp-2679571-2025-02-14,"Over the years, if there’s one product that has been a staple in almost every makeup bag (whether you’re a beauty enthusiast or not), it has to be aloe vera gel. Known for its hydrating and anti-inflammatory properties, and approved by both Ayurvedic and allopathic experts, aloe vera has made quite a mark in the beauty industry. In fact, India is one of the largest exporters of aloe vera in the world. But what if we told you there’s a close cousin of aloe vera, found in red hues, that supposedly has ‘22 times’ more ‘healing’ properties and is native to the African deserts? Sounds appealing, right? Well, that’s exactly how many beauty brands are marketing what they call ‘red aloe vera’. However, the information surrounding this ingredient is only half true. Yes, a red aloe species exists, native to Somalia in the Horn of Africa, but it was only discovered in 2019. According to Indian dermatologists, the products being sold under the name ‘red aloe vera’ could potentially be a scam.‘Hiding in plain sight’ To understand why experts believe red aloe products in India might be a scam, we need to look at how they were discovered. Today, various brands are marketing 'red aloe vera’ as a superior version of the commonly available green one.  In fact, several celebrities endorse these brands, and the products are available on platforms like Flipkart and Nykaa. These products range from eye creams to red aloe vera gels.  Now, back to our story of how the red aloe was discovered. Scientific journals state that Aloe sanguinalis, or Somali Red Aloe, has red-coloured leaves and sap (the gooey substance inside aloe vera) was ‘hiding in plain sight’ in an area not typically known for high biological diversity.  Locals had long recognised it as different from other “Dacar” (the Somali name for aloes) and referred to it as “Dacar cas” or “red aloe”. However, it was only classified as a distinct species by an environmentalist and a botanist in 2019, making it unique among the 600+ aloe species. This Somali red aloe has a yellow sap that turns a beautiful red shade. Its rarity makes it highly expensive to import into India, and moreover, there have been no substantial studies on its benefits in India. Let’s discuss this in detail.

Is red aloe vera a scam? Sujit Shanshanwal, dermatologist and medical director of SkinAmour Clinics, Mumbai, states that in his 15 years of experience, he has never come across red aloe vera. “I did some research and realised that red aloe was only recently discovered. The claims that it has better benefits than aloe vera are quite impossible. Since it was only recently identified, there hasn’t been enough time for extensive studies to prove its effectiveness,” he says. Sujit explains that assuming the red aloe vera’ being sold in beauty markets, including India, is superior to regular aloe vera is misleading. There is no scientific study to support these claims. “There are so many species of aloe. Aloe vera (the widely available one) is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. We now have various scientific studies proving its benefits, but there’s no such research on red aloe. Some species of aloe actually have drying properties rather than hydrating ones, so it’s wrong to assume red aloe will be any better or have the same benefits as aloe vera,” he says. Dr Chandani Jain Gupta, dermatologist and aesthetic physician at Elantis Healthcare, New Delhi, somewhat disagrees. She agrees that the red aloe vera products sold in Indian markets are a scam, primarily because they are too expensive to be sold at the rates advertised. However, she believes red aloe vera might have some benefits, attributing this to its red colour. Let’s talk about the cost first. “Red aloe is sold for around Rs 65,000 to Rs 70,000 per kg. If a company is selling 500 grams of ‘red aloe vera’ for Rs 500, it’s impossible that they’re offering the real product,” Dr Gupta says.

 



Aloe vera has proven scientific benefits. Photo: Pexels
 In India, you may come across ‘red aloe vera’, which is just the traditional aloe vera plant turning a copper-reddish hue due to excessive sun exposure. Dr Gupta clarifies that these plants have the same properties as regular aloe vera and nothing ‘extraordinary’. As for potential benefits, Dr Gupta says that red-coloured fruits and vegetables are generally rich in antioxidants like lycopene and Vitamin C, which protect the skin from ageing and UV damage. They also boost collagen production, keeping the skin firm and reducing wrinkles. “These foods have anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce acne, redness, and irritation. Similarly, there’s a good chance that red aloe might offer these benefits due to its colour. But again, more studies are needed to confirm this,” she adds. India Today conducted an analysis of products claiming to contain ‘red aloe vera’ and found two key things: the term ‘red aloe vera extract’ appears at the very end of the ingredient list, suggesting it’s not the primary component, and many of these products contain artificial red colouring. “Nowadays, people will market anything as special,” Dr Gupta says. Stick to the OG one Both the experts suggest sticking to the OG green aloe vera, that has scientific data to prove its benefits, like: 
Burn healing: Clinical research suggests that topical application of aloe vera gel can speed burn healing and reduce pain from burns.
Skin conditions: Research also indicates topical aloe vera may help with herpes simplex, lichen planus, and psoriasis.
Moisturising and anti-wrinkle effects: The same study also showed that oral aloe vera gel increased collagen production and improved skin elasticity in females over 45.
General wound healing: Aloe vera contains acids that promote wound healing for skin tissue and ulcers.
Anti-inflammatory responses: Aloe vera promotes anti-inflammatory responses in the body, reducing swelling from injuries and promoting recovery from infections.
Arthritis and joint pain: A 2010 study also suggests that ingestion of aloe vera daily can help prevent and cause a regression of adjuvant arthritis and might also improve digestive health. 
 If you’ve seen red aloe vera’s supposed benefits and were tempted to try it, hold your horses! Stick to the original one, unless, of course, you’re allergic to it.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/why-valentines-day-makes-some-indians-cringe-2680114-2025-02-14,"What are your plans for Valentine's Day? Are you going out on a date with your partner, or will it be a cosy surprise at home? If you're single, perhaps it's a singles' day event for you? But, If you're reading this, chances are pretty high that you have no V-Day plans. Now, if you fall into this category - the one where you don't want to celebrate what people call the festival of love and consider it ""cringe"" - let us tell you, you're not alone. Valentine's Day is on its way to becoming one of the most hated events around the globe, and India is no exception.  ""My boyfriend doesn’t believe in Valentine’s Week or Valentine’s Day. It’s not that he’s not romantic, he is, but he doesn’t believe in the concept of celebrating a specific day for love,"" says Ruchi Sharma*, a 25-year-old working professional from Delhi NCR. Ruchi shares the same belief. She feels the day has become too commercialised to be meaningful.

 



For some love is about the 'little things'. Photo: Pexels
 Nivedita, a 31-year-old, echoed a similar sentiment in a recent survey, ""It might come off as pessimistic, but I’m just being a realist. I don’t think these V-Day matches will work out because they are so rushed and desperate. After all, it’s just another day. Why give it so much importance?""‘Too much effort for a day’ Now, we are not saying that people aren't celebrating the day at ALL. But there's a section - even in India - that is opposed to the idea of dressing up in red or spending extravagantly. A recent study by Quack Quack, an online dating app, found that 23 per cent of daters above 26 see it as just another reminder of their relationship status - or the lack of it. The study also found that many couples prefer treating it as any other day, with 9 per cent stating they don’t believe in celebrating Valentine’s Day in a grand manner and would rather focus on making consistent, sustainable efforts throughout the year. The study highlights a stark difference in how Gen Z and Millennials perceive the day. Among 22,000 respondents, 2,560 daters between 20 and 25 expressed their dislike for the commercialisation of the occasion, arguing that ""bigger gifts being equated with bigger love"" has placed unnecessary pressure on people.

 A 22-year-old civil service aspirant, Naren, quips, ""Let’s rename it 'pressure cooker day' because we’re cooked if we plan a bad date and equally cooked in the process of planning the perfect one."" Millennials, on the other hand, have mixed feelings about the day. 13 per cent of female daters reportedly embrace the spirit of love, while 2 in 5 men claim they are 'over it', feeling the weight of all things heart-shaped and the ever-growing expectations.For some, it’s just a Western concept To understand why some people find Valentine's Day cringe-worthy, we need to recognise that some believe the origin of the day is not part of Indian culture and is a foreign concept. There are various theories about how the day came into existence, but the most popular one revolves around a priest named Valentine, who lived during the reign of Emperor Claudius II in the 3rd century. Claudius had banned marriages for young men, believing that single soldiers fought better than married ones. Valentine defied this order and secretly conducted weddings—not so cringe, right? When the emperor found out, he had Valentine arrested and sentenced to death. While in prison, Valentine supposedly fell in love with the jailer’s daughter and sent her a letter signed ""From your Valentine"", a phrase still used today. He was executed on 14th February, which later became a day of remembrance in his honour. Fast-forward to 2025, and St Valentine could never have imagined that the day of his execution would turn into a massive money-making event for brands. Now, coming back to why some singles and couples choose not to celebrate the day—there are a few reasons. For some, the concept feels too Western to accept. For others, it’s not just about commercialisation but over-commercialisation, which has driven many people away from the day. Today, brands jump on the Valentine's Day fever, offering discounts ""in the spirit of love,"" further pressuring people to celebrate and making some feel disassociated.

 Shreya Kaul, a psychologist, shares her thoughts on the overwhelming nature of Valentine's Day. “On Feb 14, suddenly everything turns red, pink, purple, and hot. I think it’s a bit overdone now. It was fine when it was limited to restaurants and gifts—still acceptable—but now it’s blown up so much that it’s almost ridiculous. Everything just gets drenched in pink and red, and suddenly, even brands like Blinkit are giving out Valentine's cards. It’s just a lot after a certain point. When it’s so in your face, it becomes overwhelming. And then, the moment February 14 is over—poof! Love disappears. Everything is gone, as if it never existed,” she says. Riya Shah*, a 21-year-old student from Kolkata, also finds the celebration unnecessary. “It is dumb to celebrate as it has no real meaning. Like, some guy just decided it was going to be lovers’ day, and everyone followed?” Riya tells India Today that she would rather celebrate her anniversary than spend extravagantly on Valentine's Day. Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist, explains that Valentine's Day (especially the week leading up to it) is associated with things like roses, teddy bears, and promises. Even though there are non-materialistic aspects, the focus still remains on how to commercialise love. “As Indians, our culture is quite modest, and open expressions of love aren't as common. So, some people see it as just a marketing gimmick. Many feel that businesses are simply trying to take more money out of our pockets, which is why an entire week has been dedicated to spending,” she says. At the same time, she acknowledges that others believe love can be expressed without spending excessively. For them, calling the day ‘cringe’ and choosing not to celebrate is simply a better option.Social media play a role here too Sherya points out that social media have made things worse by adding this constant pressure to do more. She says people feel like they have to go big, like there’s some unspoken rule that Valentine’s Day has to be extravagant. “It’s almost as if it has to be a thing rather than just a simple, meaningful experience between two people. Instead of just enjoying the day, it’s becoming a forced, tokenistic display,” says Sherya. The over-the-top gifts and grand gestures that couples share on social media, along with brands aggressively promoting their campaigns, have only amplified the sense of spectacle. It has reached a point where even those in relationships find the whole thing, well, too much to take. For couples (especially men), it creates pressure to act a certain way and do something elaborate, even if they don’t need to or want to. The overwhelming presence of advertisements and campaigns makes it super cringe. Some people enjoy the over-the-top sweetness of their partners, but they wouldn’t normally behave that way. Acting outside of one’s usual behaviour adds to the cringe factor.”

 For those who are single, the experience is no better. The relentless romanticising of love can feel suffocating.   “The campaigns leading up to Valentine’s Day last for a week or two, making it feel like an unavoidable spectacle. The elaborate aspects of Kiss Day, Propose Day, Chocolate Day, and Teddy Day make it unnecessarily dramatic,” she adds.  Sherya explains that at its core, cringe is about excess - when things go so far beyond what’s necessary that they feel performative and detached from real emotion. And let’s not forget the dramatic build-up - because apparently, one day isn’t enough to celebrate love. “Cringe is something so extra that it makes you ask, ‘Why are you doing this?’ It’s that acute sense of embarrassment or awkwardness so visceral that your body reacts to it. Over-the-top gestures feel unnecessary and exaggerated, making normal life seem, well, normal,” Sherya concludes.  Do you think Valentine's Day is overhyped? Let us know in the comments!

But the limitations of the study, such as the small sample size, can't be overlooked.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-ozempic-curb-alcohol-cravings-new-study-2680146-2025-02-15,"Researchers have found a rather helpful side effect of Ozempic and similar drugs: they could be effective in controlling alcohol overconsumption. A new study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that semaglutide (sold under brand names Mounjaro, Ozempic, Rybelsus, and Wegovy) can help curb alcohol cravings. The clinical trial, however, comprised only 48 participants and was conducted over a span of nine weeks. The chosen participants already dealt with alcohol use disorder (AUD) - a condition that makes it difficult to control alcohol consumption. The female participants reported drinking more than seven drinks a week, while male participants consumed 14 within the month prior. They also reported two or more heavy drinking days (five drinks at a time for men and four drinks for women). During the trial, half of the patients received low doses of semaglutide on a weekly basis, while the other half received a placebo. Participants in the semaglutide group experienced nearly a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of alcohol consumed on drinking days by the second month of treatment. In contrast, the placebo group saw only about a 2 per cent reduction during the same period. Moreover, 40 per cent of the participants in the semaglutide group reported having 'no heavy drinking days', compared to 20 per cent in the placebo group. However, it was observed that semaglutide did not affect the number of days people consumed alcohol; only the amount consumed was less. The trial found that semaglutide didn’t appear to affect how many days out of the week people chose to drink alcohol - just that when they drank, they drank less. One cannot ignore the several limitations of the new study as well. For instance, researchers are yet to determine exactly how semaglutide reduces alcohol cravings. Is it due to common side effects like nausea, which naturally discourages drinking? Or does the drug alter brain activity and make alcohol less appealing, similar to its effect on food? Additionally, the study did not include participants without excess body weight. Only one of the participants had a BMI under 24.9 (25 to 29 is considered overweight, and 30 onwards is obese); thus, whether semaglutide should be used in people without weight issues is still a question. It is also yet to be studied what happens to a person with alcohol use disorder once they stop taking the drug. Bigger trials over a longer period are certainly required to assess if (and how) semaglutide can actually help with alcohol addiction. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist drug, was originally developed as an anti-diabetic medication. It has now gained popularity for its significant results for weight loss. It mimics the action of the enzyme GLP-1 and reduces appetite via brain pathways and slowing gastric emptying of food into the intestine. This promotes a feeling of early fullness and hence leads to reduced calorie intake and subsequent weight loss. As it continues to make global buzz as a miracle medication for its dual benefit - insulin production and significant weight loss - several side effects (some rather surprising) have emerged. Minor symptoms include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain. Some severe side effects can lead to vision issues, pancreatitis, stomach paralysis, gallbladder issues, and allergic reactions. Some patients may also face ileus (a condition where intestines are no longer able to contract, hence waste is not able to move out of the body). In terms of surprising effects, people have reported increased fertility (as suggested by the Ozempic baby boom) and delayed ageing.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 15, 2025Trending Reel

It helps burn calories, manage stress, boost metabolism, and tone muscles. Those on a weight loss journey also benefit greatly from brisk walking.While many head out for a walk after hearty meals, others prefer walking on an empty stomach, thinking that it will burn more calories. If you too have ever wondered which walk is more effective for weight loss – empty stomach or post-meal – the confusion is definitely real. Both kinds of walks help in burning calories and thereby aid in losing weight, but which one is better? Let’s hear it from health experts.

 



If a person is generally healthy, short or moderate-length fasted walking (walking on empty stomach) can be a part of their daily routine. (Photo: Pexels)
“When someone is aiming to lose weight, it is always better to walk on an empty stomach. It is also known as fasting cardio,” shares Fareha Shanam, senior dietitian at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.If a person is generally healthy, short or moderate-length fasted walking can be a part of their daily routine.How walking on an empty stomach helpsExperts say that when one walks on an empty stomach, the body is forced to use stored fat for energy (as there is no readily available glucose from food). This can lead to increased fat burning and potentially improved weight loss.“Muscles take up sugar from the blood for contraction (during walking, running, or exercising). When sugar levels drop in the blood, the liver breaks down glycogen into glucose to fuel the muscles. Even during sleep, the liver releases glucose into the bloodstream; hence, body stores of glycogen are low in the morning. Therefore, exercising in a fasted state leads the body to burn more fat for energy,” explains Dr Tushar Tayal, consultant, internal medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram.A study conducted in 2022 by researchers at Nottingham Trent University observed that exercising on an empty stomach burned 70 per cent more fat.“Combining exercise and fasting can be a potent way to increase the benefits of exercise, so we would like to assess this over a longer period of time and explore other ways in which we can make fasting easier and more convenient for people,” Dr David Clayton, an expert in nutrition and exercise physiology at Nottingham Trent University, said.If you think you can overeat or indulge in a carbohydrate-rich diet in response to prolonged hunger, know that the benefits of this fasted walk will go in vain.When (and how) to be cautious with fasted walkingThose with health issues like diabetes, hypertension, and blood pressure should be cautious when indulging in fasted cardio.“Fasted cardio for an extended period can be risky due to potential effects of low blood sugar and dehydration, such as lightheadedness, dizziness, tremors, and syncope (fainting),” says Dr Siri M Kamath, consultant - internal medicine, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru.Dr Kamath also highlights another potential side effect of walking on an empty stomach. “If there are not enough carbohydrates in the system to provide energy, then the body begins a process called gluconeogenesis, which converts protein into fuel. This means there could be less protein left to rebuild muscle,” he says.What about post-meal walks?Post-meal walks are also beneficial for health and have their own set of pros.When you walk after meals, your body uses the glucose from the food you have consumed for energy.“This can lead to improved endurance and performance, as your body has a readily available source of energy,” explains Fareha Shanam. As a result, it helps control blood sugar spikes, which is especially important for those suffering from diabetes or insulin resistance.Though it can’t necessarily burn more fat compared to fasted walking, walking for 10-15 minutes after a meal improves digestion and prevents bloating.How much to walk?For weight loss and to maintain overall well-being, walk for 30 to 60 minutes daily.Overall, losing weight is not solely dependent on how much you exercise. You also need to maintain a healthy lifestyle, get enough sleep, and create a calorie deficit (or burn more calories through dietary changes and exercise).“An empty-stomach walk may help burn a higher percentage of fat, but the total calories burnt are more important,” says Dr Tayal.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 15, 2025Trending Reel 
advertisement Walking is hailed as a great form of exercise. It helps burn calories, manage stress, boost metabolism, and tone muscles. Those on a weight loss journey also benefit greatly from brisk walking.While many head out for a walk after hearty meals, others prefer walking on an empty stomach, thinking that it will burn more calories. If you too have ever wondered which walk is more effective for weight loss – empty stomach or post-meal – the confusion is definitely real. Both kinds of walks help in burning calories and thereby aid in losing weight, but which one is better? Let’s hear it from health experts.

“When someone is aiming to lose weight, it is always better to walk on an empty stomach. It is also known as fasting cardio,” shares Fareha Shanam, senior dietitian at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.If a person is generally healthy, short or moderate-length fasted walking can be a part of their daily routine.How walking on an empty stomach helpsExperts say that when one walks on an empty stomach, the body is forced to use stored fat for energy (as there is no readily available glucose from food). This can lead to increased fat burning and potentially improved weight loss.“Muscles take up sugar from the blood for contraction (during walking, running, or exercising). When sugar levels drop in the blood, the liver breaks down glycogen into glucose to fuel the muscles. Even during sleep, the liver releases glucose into the bloodstream; hence, body stores of glycogen are low in the morning.

f54b04d3-9b29-4eba-a267-4c99e62b2a49,How accessible is quality elder care in India?A 2023 report states that the elderly population in India is projected to increase from 10.1 per cent in 2021 to 20.8 per cent by 2050. Are we ready for it?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/how-accessible-is-quality-elder-care-in-india-2680097-2025-02-16,"A report in 2023 warned against the rising population of senior citizens (60 years of age or older) in India. India Ageing Report 2023 by UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund), states that the elderly population in India is projected to increase from 10.1 per cent in 2021 to 20.8 per cent by 2050. In 2022, India had approximately 149 million people aged 60 and above, making up around 10.5% of the total population (as of July 1). By 2050, this number is expected to more than double, reaching 347 million and accounting for 20.8% of the population. Now, this brings us to several important questions, one of them being – the accessibility of quality senior care in India and whether the government is doing anything to benefit them as well as the economy. But firstUnderstanding challenges faced by senior citizens in India Financial constraints: There is no denying inflation is affecting the healthcare sector too and the costs are at an all-time high. Most elderly do not have a stable income source; they are mostly dependent on meagre pensions, savings or financial support from family members, which is often not enough. When meeting basic needs becomes challenging, the extra care cost only adds up to their existing burden. Health issues: Ageing brings with it a host of bodily problems like heart conditions and arthritis. You can’t also deny the mental health concerns that start creeping up as you age, like – depression (due to loneliness) and dementia. Therefore, a one-stop quality elder care system that is easily accessible is the need of the hour. Loneliness and isolation: One of the downsides of a nuclear family is when children move away for work or studies to Tier 1 cities or even abroad, the aged parents are left alone to fend for themselves. The lack of emotional support, in some, leads to depression or the feeling of loneliness.

 Saumyajit Roy, CEO and co-founder of Emoha, an elder care and medical centre says, “Access to quality elder care in India remains a significant challenge, especially across different income groups. Nearlyâ€ï70% of India’s elderly population lives in rural areas, where geriatric care services are scarce. Economic dependency further limits access;â€ï70% of elderly citizens of our country rely on others for financial support, and 78% lack a pension, making affordability a major concern. While the government’s Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana has also played a crucial role in providing financial security for senior citizens, Roy mentions that additional investments in geriatric mental health support, chronic disease management, and telehealth services are still necessary. Ishita Bagchi, head of operations and HR at Vesta Elder Care (elder care provider) says that the biggest challenge the elderly face in India today is the quality of care and safety. “While helpers are available locally, there is little assurance of quality care and safety is a major concern. Given the situation with elderly abuse rising, it is crucial to ensure that the caregivers are verified, and they go through strict quality control measures,” she states.Enter, elder care service providers Traditionally, in a joint family set-up, the seniors used to be taken care of by their own family, but with the changing family structure and urban migration, this is becoming less effective by the day. While high-income families can access premium elder care facilities and home services, middle-income groups often struggle to find affordable yet quality options. Lower-income groups remain largely dependent on family support or government initiatives, which are still in the process of expanding their reach. That’s where several elder care service providers are trying to make a difference. From japa maids to caregivers to doctors at home, they assist the elderly in their day-to-day lives.

 



Elder care service includes comprehensive care plans and services addressing both physical and emotional needs, ensuring seniors live comfortably and independently in their own homes. (Photo: Unsplash)
 “What we provide are caregivers (one of their services)  - caregivers who are more like a personal extension of the family - who take care of things like getting water for them, bringing food, changing drip,” says Bagchi. Let’s say someone nearing their 70s has undergone surgery. There could be numerous needs like changing diapers, clothes, feeding, etc., which, while they are in the hospital, will be taken care of by the staff. However, the real challenge starts when they are home, and there is no support system available. “At home, the staff helps with cleaning the person, taking care of their hygiene, whether they are using a diaper, need to be cleaned on the bed, or require assistance to the washroom with mobility support like a wheelchair,” she adds. With 75% of elders living with one or more chronic diseases, the challenges of ageing go beyond just physical health. Therefore, Roy mentions that their elder care service includes comprehensive care plans and services addressing both physical and emotional needs, ensuring seniors live comfortably and independently in their own homes. If needed, these service providers offer geriatric support at home, including regular health check-ups, teleconsultations with expert doctors, nursing care, and support for chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and dementia. There are many families where children have settled abroad or gone out for higher studies, leaving parents behind without support. During a health scare, this can be really anxiety-inducing for both the parents and the children. These assistance services come in really handy during such times. Even building social connections and travelling for a holiday is no longer a challenge, given the extensive services some of them provide.Are these services affordable? Financial dependence is a major challenge with 70% of elders relying on others for support, and 78% lacking a pension. Therefore, affordability comes out as a major hurdle for elder care service providers. “When we say elder caregivers, these services start from Rs 800 for a 12-hour shift and go up to Rs 1000 for a 12-hour shift. For a 24-hour live-in caregiver, it starts from Rs 1500,” says Ishita of Vesta Elder Care. Another care service, Emoha, provides personalised care plans designed specifically to cater to elder care needs, starting from as low as Rs 199 per month. However, Sanjeev Jain, founder of NEMA Elder Care says, “Elder care services are not affordable for an average Indian family. The lack of insurance coverage for senior care, as well as the limited availability of health insurance for older individuals, remains the biggest impediment.”The government’s shortcomings While speaking to each of the founders and associates of these elder care services, the lack of prominent government initiatives for senior citizens seems to be one of the biggest problems here. More than the government, it’s the private sector that is playing a significant role. Vineet Jain, founder and CEO of Artha Senior Care, points out, “The Indian government has introduced various policies and schemes to support elder care, though implementation challenges remain. Some key initiatives include The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, the Senior Citizens' Savings Scheme, the National Program for Healthcare of the Elderly, and the IRDAI Guidelines on Senior Citizen Health Insurance. However, despite these policies, the private sector is playing a bigger role in bridging the gap, as public initiatives are still limited in scope and execution.” For Ishita Bagchi, the problem lies in the lack of a government body regulating or controlling quality because she believes that, right now, caregivers are more like blue-collar workers. “Caregivers are not domestic helpers. They are not supposed to cook or do household chores, but they are responsible for cleaning the patient, changing diapers, and maintaining hygiene, including cleaning bed sheets. We need government support in establishing and enforcing quality control standards,” she mentions.The future of elder care in India It is estimated that the current Indian elder care market, which is valued at 7 billion dollars, is expected to reach 50 billion dollars by 2030. So, scalable businesses and products that could benefit senior citizens will have a huge scope in the coming years. Further, it is expected that there will be a shift towards technology-enabled services, such as elder care mobile applications, telemedicine, health monitoring devices, and smart homes, improving accessibility and affordability. Vineet Jain states that there are going to be more affordable and scalable elder care models in the next 5-10 years, along with more government and private sector collaboration for better scope and functioning. “Public-private partnerships may lead to new policies, tax benefits, and funding options that improve accessibility. As awareness grows and demand increases, India will move towards a more structured, regulated, and quality-driven elder care ecosystem, making it more accessible and affordable for all,” he concludes.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 16, 2025Must Watch

This was pretty evident from the fact that the gates had to be shut a little earlier than promised due to an overwhelming response over the weekends which was meant for general public viewing (February 8 and 9). While there’s no denying that the fair, held at Okhla’s NSIC grounds, was sold out last edition as well, but this one transformed into impressive sales numbers across diverse genres and categories. With 120 exhibitors - the most in the fair’s history - this edition set a new benchmark for success. Having said that, art has always been a niche interest (for the intellectuals, and those with taste, they said), but with an unprecedented footfall for the last couple of years, you might want to think otherwise! So, is it just social media outreach playing its part, or are genuine art connoisseurs, in larger numbers, filling the void?

Art as an investment A post shared by India Art Fair (@indiaartfair)
 The fact that people are realising that art is not just an object of aesthetic pleasure but a formidable asset is making some (if not all) the difference. Younger audiences are no longer engaging with art purely for its visual or cultural appeal; they are increasingly viewing it as an investment. Uday Jain, director of Dhoomimal Gallery, says, “Art has become more than aesthetics for the younger generation. Many are now looking at art as a luxury investment, delving deeper into its nuances.” The shift is also partly driven by increased market transparency made possible by digital platforms. With never-before-seen ease, collectors can now follow artist trajectories, auction outcomes, and worldwide trends in a jiffy. Its popularity has also grown beyond the conventional collector base due to the rise of statement pieces, where art meets design, fashion, and even technology. Seema Kohli, who exhibited at the India Art Fair 2025, adds another perspective. “I do think that the focus has shifted from only aesthetics to investment, but that is largely due to awareness and also the fact that the prices of artworks are not entirely commercial. I think the whole commercial aspect of the art scene has changed, which is also contributing to the idea of art being an investment and not just about aesthetics,” she says.

 But Kohli also agrees that it is not just the magic of social media at play after all. “I think there are a lot of contributing factors. It’s not only social media or the kind of exposure the press gives them, but also the awareness, the possibility, and the growing interest in collecting art,” she adds. “The underlying fact is that people who connect with art - whatever work they want to see in their homes - have been instrumental in creating a larger market for art. So many young artists are being promoted and collected by younger investors and collectors.”Is democratising art diluting its depth? What was once an exclusive playground for the art elite has, over time, transformed into a bustling spectacle, propelled by several factors, social media being one of them. As artist Ritu Bhutani notes, the event’s visibility today extends far beyond the gallery circuit: “The fair does live up to the hype and buzz created by social media. People across all age groups are aware of this annual event. Social media has helped in the outreach.” No one denies the accessibility, but does this influx of attention come at a cost? Some believe that although social media has made art more accessible to the masses, it has also encouraged a culture of superficial admiration. “There were people who attended the fair just so that they could post and pose,” Bhutani observes, though she is quick to acknowledge that such engagement is not inherently detrimental. “Art needs to be accessible to all who appreciate it.”

 This phenomenon isn't exclusive to India. Worldwide, the digital boom has transformed the art market, blurring the distinction between appreciation and purchase. “Social media platforms like Instagram and X did play a major role in creating the buzz for the India Art Fair by sharing real-time updates and creating enthusiasm around events like these and giving followers an opportunity to showcase artworks, and connect with a global audience,” says Uday Jain. He mentions that while it is great when it comes to accessibility, he shares a few concerns too. “There are times when concerns are raised about diluting the depth of art appreciation due to immediate scrolling through posts and the notion to capture what’s in trends or viral moments shift focus from actual appreciation to the admiration of a piece,” he adds.The cultural shift For emerging artists like Viswanath Kuttum, who also exhibited at the India Art Fair, the fair is more than just a marketplace - it is a cultural landmark. “Everyone wants to be seen here, whether it is the gallery, the artist, the collector, or the elite,” he observes. The FOMO culture that has permeated every sphere of contemporary life is undeniably at play. “The frenzied social media sharing to let people know ‘we were here’ is definitely driven by FOMO.” But, he adds, “One cannot disregard it as the Kumbh Mela of the art world, considering that the event not only promotes artistic excellence but also has a lasting influence on the cultural identity of Delhi.” Seema Kohli absolutely agrees and highlights how the fair has become a confluence of industries beyond art. “It was not only the galleries that were collaborating. It was the cars, it was the fashion - everything wanted to be part of the art fair.” These collaborations, she asserts, are what elevate the fair beyond mere spectacle. “You can have footfall, but it will only be a success if it is actually substantial and has good collaborations.”The challenges: Rising costs, scarce space The success of the latest edition of the fair did come with its own set of challenges and there’s no denying that. The challenges were posed at its primary stakeholders—galleries and artists. While the sales have been absolutely astounding (across categories), securing a space at the fair has become increasingly difficult due to mounting costs. Bhutani raises a pertinent concern: “It is becoming increasingly difficult for galleries to get a space due to the mounting costs involved. Ideally, the fair should attract more international galleries and collectors to give maximum exposure to the bursting art scene in India.” The curation of the fair itself reflects the evolving definition of what constitutes “art.” As Bhutani notes, “The thin line between art and craft has already blurred, and the focus is more on creating and presenting statement pieces to the viewers.” This, in turn, raises questions about the direction Indian art is headed in - whether it remains anchored in fine art traditions or continues its fluid expansion into lifestyle and design.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 17, 2025Trending Reel

Want to lose weight? Green tea on an empty stomach does the trick.
Looking for better digestion and glowing skin? A mix of turmeric, pepper, warm water, and honey is all you need. Today, if you open the internet, you'll find countless recipes from fitness enthusiasts suggesting the ‘right’ morning drink. But let’s be honest—this overload of options has only led to confusion. What to drink and what to avoid has become a dilemma for many. So, let’s simplify it. We’ve identified common concerns, consulted an expert, and explored the science behind these drinks to bring you the best options.  Let’s dive in. But first things first. Should you start your day with a morning ‘drink’?  The trend of starting the day with a drink has been around for ages. For many Indians, it's a hot cup of tea, while for others, it's coffee. However, as more Indians become health-conscious, many are looking to replace their tea or coffee with healthier alternatives. In fact, science suggests that after 7-8 hours of sleep (the lucky ones), your body is likely dehydrated. To counter this, it's important to start your day with something hydrating. While water is a great option, if you want to upgrade your morning drink based on your needs, here’s what you can sip.  Dr Anjali Nain, a senior dietician at Healthians, also agrees. She says that mornings are certainly lazy, but the right drink can help you feel energised, focused, and ready to tackle the day.

 ""Those who need a strong boost in the morning can drink coffee because caffeine content provides an immediate energy kick and those who prefer something lighter can start their morning routine with green tea. You can also drink water or coconut water if hydration is your priority. Herbal teas can also be preferred by people if they want to calm their mind and promote digestion. If you’re looking for a nutritious, filling drink, smoothies packed with fruits, vegetables, and protein can provide sustained energy and essential vitamins. Ultimately, the right drink is one that supports your energy needs, health goals, and personal taste,"" she adds. But which one should you choose? Look for what problem you want to tackle.  Let’s start with the most widely discussed one - a morning drink for weight loss.5 problems, one solution: A beverage in the morning1. For weight loss  Before getting into this, let us tell you that weight loss can not be done through just having this one drink in the morning. In fact, losing weight is a result of various things, including eating clean, and working out. However, science and some experts do suggest that certain drinks might aid in weight loss. Vriti Srivastav, a dietician, tells India Today, the best drink to have in the morning to accelerate weight loss are items you’ll find in your kitchen.  She suggested combining a few fenugreek seeds with jeera, coriander seeds, ginger and curry leaves. Boil them together or soak them overnight and reheat in the morning. This drink has various benefits, since: 
Jeera (cumin seeds) - Soothes the gut and reduces water retention. 
Ginger - Builds immunity and boosts digestion. 
Dhaniya seeds (coriander seeds) - Promote protective mucus production in the stomach that aids in cases of acidity. 
Fenugreek and curry leaves- Help balance blood sugar levels and promote weight loss. 
 The entire drink together helps improve our metabolism, which in turn helps in weight loss.  Now, if you want something less complicated, a simple lemon ginger water might also work, according to science. A meta-analysis of 14 studies found that ginger intake significantly reduced body weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and fasting glucose levels. Moreover, lemon has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, aiding in weight management.2. Glowing skin  Want glass-like skin but unsure how? While achieving that Korean-like glow may be challenging for Indians, radiant skin is possible with a clean diet, regular exercise, and the right skincare. Boosting collagen levels can also help enhance your skin’s natural glow. Vritti suggests going for a shot of Amla (Indian gooseberry) and celery stalk with aloe vera and carrot.  “These four provide a cooling effect on the stomach while providing a boost of antioxidants and hydration, which are quintessential for the skin. The same drink also aids in reducing acne,” she says.  You can also opt for a fresh glass of blueberry smoothies, as berries are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, which are known to stimulate collagen production, essential for skin elasticity and glow. While specific studies on berry smoothies are limited, general benefits of antioxidants and Vitamin C on skin health are well-documented. advertisement3. For acne Your acne problems can be solved by making your gut health better. Vritti suggests making a probiotic rice kanji by soaking 2 tablespoons of cooked rice with 2 tablespoons of curd or yogurt and fermenting it overnight. Add a pinch of turmeric, black pepper, 1 teaspoon flaxseed powder, and chopped coriander. This aids in clearing and strengthening the gut. A clean gut is the hack for no acne.

She also says avoiding sugary and oily foods to prevent acne, and ensure hydration by adding Celtic salt to your drink. Now, if your acne is because of your PCOS, starting your day with spearmint tea might help you. A randomised controlled trial demonstrated that drinking spearmint tea twice daily for one month significantly reduced testosterone levels in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), leading to improvement in hormonal acne. 4. For irregular periods Your irregular periods can be caused by various reasons. Even though consulting a doctor is the best solution if you’re facing these issues, Eshanka Wahi, a Dubai & Delhi-based nutritionist and founder of Eat Clean With Eshanka, tells us to drink fenugreek and fennel seed water.advertisement“This drink promotes regular cycles, particularly for women dealing with hormonal imbalances. Fenugreek seeds improve insulin sensitivity, whereas fennel seeds regulate estrogen levels,” she says. On the other hand, Vritti suggests making a drink using cinnamon with bay leaf, coriander seeds, and ginger. Boil them together in water and have it as a herbal tea. This tea helps regulate insulin resistance and hormone balance while helping in clearing excess free estrogen circulating in the body. In addition to this, have 2 tablespoons of Amla-coriander chutney as a daily ritual in the morning. She suggests that this helps clean the bowels and prevent acidity. “Very few know that regular bowel movement is extremely essential for hormone balance as it helps excrete the used up hormone compounds from the body, especially estrogen,” says Vritti. 5. Resolve gut issuesAloe vera and Triphala water help detoxify the gut, according to Eshanka. She suggests that aloe vera contains anti-inflammatory properties that clear the gut and support your digestion.Finally, remember that these drinks can support your journey, but they’re just one piece of the puzzle.

5242c551-eb98-4427-beae-e6c6868537cf,"Born at the 'right' time: The growing craze for Mahurat Deliveries in IndiaMore and more people are opting for Mahurat Deliveries, believing that in an uncertain world, they can influence their baby's fate and ensure an 'auspicious', 'blessed' future.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/the-growing-craze-for-mahurat-deliveries-in-india-2681549-2025-02-18,"In January 2024, as people were gearing up for the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, several expecting mothers lined up at hospitals to get their babies delivered on the same date - January 22. The reason? They wanted their babies’ births to coincide with the consecration ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya. They had requested doctors in advance to accommodate their demand so that their child could be born at an “auspicious” time and date. And that, my friends, is Mahurat Delivery. Now, from what it looks like, it was not just a one-time phenomenon - Mahurat deliveries, or auspiciously timed births, are on the rise across India. But why are hospitals and doctors receiving more and more similar requests? Some clinics have even gone to the extent of accommodating ‘Mahurat Delivery’ in their list of services. Is the craze for mahurat baby deliveries at an all-time high in India? If yes, then what’s the reason?

 



More and more hospitals are receiving requests from parents to deliver their babies at an auspicious mahurat (time). (Photo: Unsplash)
advertisementWhat is Mahurat Delivery? Dr Nirmala Chandrashekar, senior consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, explains, “Mahurat delivery refers to the practice where parents choose a specific day and time for their baby’s birth, often after consulting a priest or astrologer. However, doctors ensure that the gestational age is appropriate and that there are no medical emergencies before proceeding.” According to doctors, the practice isn’t something new and with the increasing reliance on elective C-sections, this has been made more feasible. “Since many first-time mothers already opt for planned C-sections, the additional step of aligning the birth with an auspicious time seems logical to them,” she adds.The rise in demand Childbirth cannot be fully controlled, and traditionally, since most deliveries happened naturally, due dates were merely rough estimates of when a child could be expected. However, with medical advancement, many parents now believe they can also influence their child’s fate by choosing an astrologically favourable moment which is generally determined in advance through consultations with a numerologist or a priest. Dr Manjula Anagani, clinical director at CARE Hospitals, Hyderabad, agrees that the demand for Mahurat Deliveries has increased in recent years. “More and more people are asking for it because they believe that, in an uncertain world, they can influence the fate of the baby - which is not exactly advisable. In our hospital, the provision exists in cases where it is already decided that the baby will be delivered via caesarean section,” she says. Hence, hospitals had to adapt to this rising trend, but with some restrictions. Some doctors claim they have time and again denied absurd requests from some parents-to-be. “Usually, we prefer to do it in the early hours, during the morning or daytime. If patients request a suitable time within that period, we are okay with it. However, we are not in favour of conducting deliveries in the middle of the night, at 10 pm or 1 am, when services are difficult to provide, and the outcomes for both the baby and the mother may not be optimal,” Dr Anagani adds. Meanwhile, studies show a significant rise in C-section deliveries in India. Data from the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) reveals an increase from 17.2% in 2015-2016 to 21.5% in 2019-2021. The survey also suggests that the practice is especially prominent in private hospitals, where nearly half of all deliveries are C-sections.Are there risks involved? Now, most people may suggest that if C-sections are happening rampantly in India for complications or otherwise, how can a well-planned delivery be a problem for the mother or child’s health? However, the truth is very different. “If parents insist on a mahurat when the baby isn’t full-term (less than 37 weeks), it can lead to neonatal complications, often requiring NICU care,” warns Dr Anagani. “Additionally, if contractions begin naturally, but parents refuse delivery on that specific day, it can create complications for both the baby and the mother. In some cases, people insist on a caesarean even when a vaginal delivery is possible, just to ensure the baby is born at a specific time. This is more detrimental, as unnecessary surgical procedures increase the risk of infections and morbidity for the mother while also having a medical impact on the foetus.” Dr Chandrashekar emphasises that as long as the delivery is safe and the baby is full-term, there are no major health risks. “Our primary focus is always the well-being of both mother and baby. If the timing is medically unsuitable, we advise against it,” she states.Two cents While Mahurat deliveries are at an all-time high, and you may be tempted to follow the advice of your revered priest or astrologer for the benefit of your child, we believe it's best to stay clear of this. Dr. Manjula Anagani offers a similar suggestion: “Good health and proper medical care play a far bigger role in a child’s future than the exact moment of birth.”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 18, 2025Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/at-home-enema-kits-are-now-on-amazon-would-you-try-one-for-good-poop-2681916-2025-02-18,"In April 2023, American musician and member of the band Blink-182, Travis Barker, launched a Rs 16,000 (approx.) enema kit. The kit was launched as a tribute to a cult classic from his band's album, Enema of the State, which was released in 1999.  If you don’t know exactly what an enema kit is - it is used to flush your colon with liquid, usually for constipation relief (more on this later).  Now back to Barker's enema kit, it came with a branded enema bulb and a can of water (yes, water) signed by the musician and husband of Kourtney Kardashian Barker. But what was inside was more than just water, according to him. It was the cause behind his success—the success in life and in his love life.

 The kit was released in collaboration with “Liquid Death,” a brand often known for advertising things in a “cool” way, to say the least. Now, even though the kit sold out quickly, people knew what they were buying was not the kits themselves but an art piece, autographed by the singer. In fact, the kits were sold with a warning: ""Adult art piece and not intended for use as a real medical device. Enema of the State should never be placed in or near your butthole without consulting a doctor first. Also, you should not place it in or near your friend’s butthole without consulting them or their doctor first either.""

 Now, we know that even though Travis’s kit was a joke, what if we told you that today, you can buy enema kits (not Travis’s one) easily online? As gross as it sounds, it is true.What are at-home enema kits and what do they do? Once a procedure was only available in hospitals, today, enema kits are widely available for at-home use. While some of these kits are priced as low as Rs 170, making them easily accessible, other brands offer a more aesthetic version. An at-home enema kit is your gut’s personal reset button, perfect for when things feel a little, backed up. These kits typically come with a bag or bottle to hold the solution, a tube and nozzle for delivery, and sometimes pre-mixed liquid. You can use warm water, saline, or even coffee (yes, really) depending on your ‘needs.’ The idea is simple—introduce liquid into the rectum to soften things up and get your bowels moving.

 Initially, and even now, enemas are used when your life has complications—ugh, sorry, constipation. They serve as a way to relieve constipation and cleanse the colon before medical procedures. Using an enema is easier than you think. Just find a comfy spot (the bathroom is ideal unless you like living dangerously), lubricate the nozzle, and get into position (lying on your left side works best). Slowly release the liquid, hold it in for a few minutes, and then, well, let nature take its course. Dr Chetan Kalal, a consultant hepatologist and transplant physician at Saifee Hospital, says people use these kits for various reasons, such as:
Instant relief from constipation – Enemas soften stools and can cause bowel movements in minutes. They relax the stool, making it easier to pass.
Gut detox & cleansing – Enemas are meant to cleanse out toxins, though there isn't much scientific evidence to support this.
Medical preparation – Physicians prescribe enemas before procedures such as a colonoscopy.
 However, due to easy access and influencers promoting them online as a way to cleanse the body, their use is becoming increasingly common. “At-home enema kits are widely available online and in pharmacies. They typically contain saline or other solutions designed to cleanse the colon. While convenient, they should be used cautiously and as directed,” says Dr Sukhvinder Singh Saggu, GI & bariatric surgeon at CK Birla Hospital, Delhi, and director of minimal access surgery.Should you try this at home? Now, enema kits are not a 'Khatron Ke Khiladi' stunt that should never be attempted at home. In fact, experts that India Today spoke to suggest that using enema kits once in a while might be okay and not fatal, but should be avoided if possible. Dr Saggu says that enemas can help with occasional constipation or bowel cleansing but should not be overused.

 “Consulting a doctor before use is advised, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions. While they provide temporary relief, relying on them frequently may disrupt natural bowel function and lead to potential side effects,” he says. Payal Kothari, gut health coach, agrees and mentions that these side effects can include:
Irritation and dependence – Excessive use may cause the body to become dependent on enemas for defecation.
Electrolyte imbalance – Overuse of enemas can dehydrate the body and disrupt mineral levels.
Infection or injury – If hygiene is not maintained or if used too forcefully, infections or rectal damage can occur.
But-om line If you are sometimes constipated, occasional use of an enema is fine. But frequent use is not a good idea. A more effective approach would be long-term solutions - drink plenty of water, eat fibre-rich foods, and exercise regularly. If you're chronically constipated, talking to a doctor is always a better option than giving yourself an enema.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 18, 2025

 Doctors highly recommend recognising and addressing these signs early to prevent complications and ensure overall well-being. This constant health monitoring should begin as early as the age of 20 – with a monthly self-breast examination. Breast cancer, the most common cancer affecting women, is also on the rise among women under 30 in India. In your 30s and 40s, the body undergoes several changes, increasing the risk of complications if early signs are ignored. This makes it important to closely monitor your health, maintain an active lifestyle, and stay aware of age-related health risks.Monitoring reproductive and hormonal health “A woman should begin monitoring her health closely from the time of menarche (when she gets her first period), but many health issues start to emerge around the age of 30. At 30, ovarian reserve begins to decrease, and this is also when conditions like breast pain, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), or menstrual cycle pain (such as congestive dysmenorrhoea) can appear,” says Dr Manjula Anagani, Robotic Gynaecologist & HOD, Care, Women and Child Institute, CARE Hospitals, Hyderabad. Some of the signs you should certainly not ignore include:

 Painful menstrual cycle and heavy bleeding: It could indicate endometriosis, fibroids, PCOS, or hormonal imbalances. Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus.
“If endometriosis is neglected in its early stages, when it is still superficial and primarily causes pain, it can progress to deep infiltrating endometriosis. This can significantly impact quality of life, affecting fertility and causing severe pain, including dyschezia (pain during bowel movements). Over time, it can lead to chronic pain and a condition known as frozen pelvis, which can severely limit daily activities,” explains Dr Anagani.

 Breast pain, lumps, or nipple discharge: Breast pain can be hormonal, but lumps and nipple discharge may indicate infections or breast cancer. Early detection helps identify breast cancer at an early and treatable stage.
Dr Manju Khemani, Principal Director & Head of Unit, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, recommends that every woman perform a monthly self-breast examination after each period. Women over 40 should go for a mammography if they notice any lump.

 Unexplained fatigue: Fatigue is often overlooked as a result of regular stress or a hectic schedule. However, persistent unexplained fatigue can indicate anaemia, thyroid disorders, or diabetes. Heavy periods are often the primary cause of iron deficiency and subsequent anaemia, which can eventually lead to heart issues. Fatigue could also signal thyroid problems, which can cause weight gain, depression, and hormonal imbalances.


 Unexplained weight gain: Sudden weight gain is often linked to PCOS and thyroid disorders. Excess weight can also increase the risk of heart disease.


 Increased urination or frequent UTIs: Increased frequency of urination or recurrent UTIs can lead to kidney dysfunction, as urinary infections are a common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in women, says Dr Khemani.


 Bloating, indigestion, or gastric discomfort: Many women resort to medications like Pan40 to deal with gastric issues, but persistent bloating, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits can be common symptoms of ovarian cancer, especially after age 50. Dr Khemani recommends that women experiencing such symptoms consult a doctor and get an ultrasound done.



 Bleeding after menopause: Bleeding after menopause should not be taken lightly, as it could be a sign of endometrial cancer or fibroids.

Cervical cancer is on the rise Cervical cancer is now the second most common cancer affecting women. Doctors say that it often goes undetected until later stages because the symptoms may be mild or mistaken for other conditions. Bleeding between periods or after intercourse should not be ignored. Persistent pelvic pain or unusual vaginal discharge (such as watery, foul-smelling, or blood-streaked discharge) should not be taken lightly.

 



Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women.
 Early detection through screenings (Pap smear test) and vaccination (HPV) can significantly improve survival rates. More than 90% of all cervical cancer cases are linked to the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). A simple HPV vaccine shot can protect women from this common cancer. Gardasil 9, Gardasil, and Cervavac are among the well-known HPV vaccines available in India. The vaccine is approved for use in both males and females aged 9 to 45 years. Keeping other cancers in check Dr Aditya Sarin, Associate Consultant, Medical Oncology, Sir Gangaram Hospital, Delhi, highlights several signs that could signal cancer among women:

 Unexplained weight loss: Could indicate pancreatic, ovarian, or stomach cancer.

Persistent bloating and abdominal pain: Often misdiagnosed but can signal ovarian cancer.


 Persistent bloating and abdominal pain: Often misdiagnosed but can signal ovarian cancer.
 Unusual vaginal bleeding: May indicate cervical, uterine, or vaginal cancer, especially postmenopausal bleeding.


 Breast lumps, skin changes, or nipple discharge: Could be early signs of breast cancer, including aggressive triple-negative breast cancer.


 Chronic fatigue: May be linked to cancer or heart disease.


 Changes in bowel or bladder habits: Could signal colorectal cancer.


 Persistent cough or hoarseness: A potential symptom of lung cancer, which is rising among women.

Heart health issues often get overlooked in women Post-menopausal women are at high risk of developing heart diseases. “The risk of any cardiac illness increases with age. In women especially, the risk increases post-menopause. So, all women should start closely monitoring their health signs and symptoms after menopause because of the hormonal changes that occur, which increase the risk of cardiac illness,” says Dr Shubendu Mohanty, Senior Consultant Cardiology, Sharda Care, Greater Noida. Doctors, however, warn that chest pain is not the only symptom to watch out for. Fatigue, breathlessness, increased sweating, pain in the arms or jaw, and generally feeling low could also be signs of a heart issue.

 “Data shows that women are more likely to experience atypical symptoms of heart disease. These symptoms are often less severe and can be overlooked, even when women present to the emergency room. The chances of misdiagnosis or missing a cardiac diagnosis are higher in women than in men. One reason for this is that women may exhibit minor ECG changes, even when they are healthy,” explains Dr Mohanty. “Heart disease is often associated with severe chest pain, but symptoms can differ, especially in women and the elderly. They may experience extreme fatigue, breathlessness, weakness, or a sensation of dyspepsia (such as a burning feeling in the chest). Other signs include increased sweating, pain in the arms, jaw, or upper back, and a general sense of feeling low, with reduced energy to perform daily activities,” says Dr PRLN Prasad, consultant - interventional cardiologist , Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru. Those suffering from (or with a history) of diabetes, smoking, hypertension should be extra cautious. Dr Alok Chopra, cardiologist and co-founder of Aashlok Hospital in Delhi, says obesity rates, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and over burden and stress in familial life add significantly to the problem. “Early menopause is common in Indian women and brings hormonal changes which elevate blood pressure and heart disease. Additionally, women with gestational diabetes are at greater risk,” Dr Chopra adds. Apart from keeping a check on symptoms, routine checkups for blood pressure, sugar and cholesterol, and a healthy diet, regular exercise, stress management should also be prioritised to mitigate heart health risks.Early detection of neurological issues is important As women approach 40, they undergo several physiological and hormonal changes. These include the onset of menopause and can at times mimic symptoms of neurological or heart diseases. Doctors strongly suggest not ignoring certain signs, as early intervention helps prevent complications like strokes.“Any symptom or sign, especially headache, dizziness, or breathlessness on exertion, should not be ignored. Women often have lifestyle diseases that are misdiagnosed as psychosomatic disorders,” says Dr Anshu Rohatgi, Vice-Chairperson, Neurology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.Dr Jyoti Wadhwa, Vice-Chairperson and Head of Medical Oncology at Paras Health, also highlights the growing concern about strokes in younger women:""There’s been an alarming rise in strokes in younger women, largely due to rising obesity rates and hypertension. Many don’t take the initial signs - like dizziness or headaches - seriously, which can lead to fatal outcomes if not caught in time.""

77cbc945-3611-4e10-85fd-f9f4ca2e0dfc,"What is secondary infertility, and why is it rising in IndiaSecondary infertility is on the rise in India but is seldom discussed. Lack of awareness is the reason why it is still a lesser-known term.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/what-is-secondary-infertility-and-why-is-it-rising-in-india-2682432-2025-02-19,"While India has surpassed China to become the most populous country in the world, you cannot deny the fact that the overall infertility rate has increased in India. The overall infertility rate has risen steadily over the years, increasing from 22.4% in 1992–93 to 25.3% in 2005–06, and further climbing to 30.7% in 2015–16. While the country is grappling with this problem, another issue is hitting closer to home—the diagnosis of secondary infertility. This issue particularly arises when a couple struggles to conceive a second time after a successful first pregnancy. As surprising as it may seem, secondary infertility in India is on the rise, with studies showing its prevalence reaching around 28.6% in 2015-16—an increase of 5.9%.
What is secondary infertility? Dr Manjusha Goel, lead consultant, department of obstetrics and gynaecology, CK Birla Hospital, Delhi, explains the condition where a woman is unable to conceive despite having had a previous pregnancy or abortion. Unlike primary infertility, where a couple have never been able to conceive, this occurs when there is difficulty in achieving pregnancy after an earlier successful conception. There are varied factors - age-related fertility decline, reproductive health issues, or lifestyle factors – that can lead to this problem.Factors contributing to the problem One of the primary reasons for its rise is definitely delayed pregnancy followed by lifestyle habits. As we evolve, our priorities are changing and career, financial stability, or personal goals have taken precedence. Not that it is a problem, but due to this reason, a lot of couples want to delay their pregnancies, hardly being able to access what might come of it. So, even when conception for the first time is easy, the second one becomes a challenge. Dr Sowmya K N, consultant, obstetrician and gynaecologist, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Kengeri, Bengaluru, states, “A specific age group is more prone to secondary infertility. Fertility chances reduce in females above 35 years of age due to the reduced quality and quantity of eggs. Similarly, in men above 40 years, lifestyle habits such as smoking, alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, and chronic medical conditions contribute to infertility.” If the second pregnancy occurs after this time period, the chances of conception failing are high. Besides, stress, owing to our busy life schedules, also plays a role, along with hormonal imbalances like Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis play a part too. “Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disorders, metabolic syndromes, weight fluctuations, chronic drug use (whether therapeutic or illicit), tubal blockages, reduced sperm motility or sperm count, and varicocele further contribute to secondary infertility,” she adds. An additional factor could be a previous infection. Dr Manjula Anagani, clinical director, robotic gynaecologist and HOD, Care Vatsalya, Women and Child Institute, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad explains how, “If there was a prior infection due to a previous abortion, vaginal delivery, or any local infection, it could lead to tubal factor infertility, where the fallopian tubes become blocked this could be a reason. Another condition, endometritis, where the endometrium gets infected, can also be a factor.""Who are most affected? As the biological clock ticks, the quality and quantity of eggs decline, making conception more difficult. This is for both men and women, because just like you need healthy eggs for a healthy baby, the sperm quality matters too, and it starts deteriorating after a certain point of time. “As more couples choose to have children later in life, they may experience a decline in both ovum quality and quantity over time. Additionally, this age group is more likely to have lifestyle-related health concerns or underlying medical conditions that could impact fertility,” says Dr Goel. However, Dr Mandavi Rai, senior fertility and IVF specialist, Motherhood Fertility & IVF, Noida, adds, “Even younger couples can struggle with this issue due to stress.  It becomes crucial to be aware of and detect secondary infertility early on.”Why is secondary infertility lesser known Dr Aswati Nair, a fertility specialist at Nova IVF Fertility, Rajouri Garden, Delhi, says, “Secondary infertility is lesser-known as many tend to believe that if a couple has conceived before, they won’t face fertility issues again. But that’s a misconception.” Sighting another reason, Dr Goel says, “Society’s focus tends to be more on primary infertility, leading to a lack of awareness and discussion around secondary infertility. Hence, it is never discussed in the open and no one gets to know about it.”Can secondary infertility be prevented or managed? Dr Anagani says that awareness is the first step towards preventing secondary infertility. Just because you had a pregnancy before, whether it led to an abortion or a delivery, doesn’t mean you will definitely conceive the next time. If someone is not getting pregnant despite trying for at least a year while having a normal sexual life, they should visit a doctor for evaluation. “Solutions depend on the cause. If ovulation is the issue, we induce ovulation. If the problem is related to the fallopian tubes, we can perform a hysteroscopy or laparoscopy to diagnose and treat it. If there is a mucous fibroid, it can be removed. Endometriosis, if present, needs to be treated accordingly. Since the treatment is cause-based, if semen analysis shows an issue, we examine the male factor, looking for varicosities or motility problems, and address them accordingly,” she adds. Dr Goel reveals that unnecessary abortions could also lead to secondary infertility, so that should be avoided too. “Avoiding unnecessary abortions and intrauterine procedures could lead to infertility. As much as possible, stay clear of these procedures.” And of course, there are other basic rules that need to be followed, like eating clean, exercising and limiting the consumption of alcohol to increase your chances of conception and carrying a baby full term.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 19, 2025

The term was coined in the late 20th century due to increased life spans and later childbearing ages.The cycle of caring for both their parents and children primarily determines the Sandwich Generation’s financial decisions as well as their daily routine. A typical day in the life of a sandwich-generation individual may include taking their mother to the doctor in the morning, helping their child with school homework in the evening, negotiating an important deal at work, and making a quick run to the grocery store on the way home.Edelweiss Life Insurance, in collaboration with YouGov, surveyed over 4,000 respondents from this generation across 12 major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Kochi, and Chandigarh.What the survey saysA significant 60 per cent of the respondents said that no matter how much they save or invest, it never feels enough for the future. Over 50 per cent of the sandwich generation participants expressed worry about running out of money.

 



Over 50 per cent of the sandwich generation participants expressed worry about running out of money.
This is, of course, not the first sandwich generation that India is witnessing, but the unique social and economic challenges set them apart. Heavy reliance on credit cards and loans, the increased cost of living, expensive healthcare and education, and a quest for a better living standard make it essentially tricky for this generation to navigate finances.The future cost of kids’ education, future healthcare costs, lack of work-life balance, and declining health of parents are their top concerns. At the same time, they are taking family vacations and maintaining a good standard of living, even if it means stretching their resources. But this relentless dedication is leading many in the sandwich generation to burn through their income and savings, highlighted through high credit reliance and accessing investments earlier than planned.For the Sandwich Generation, the top three short-term aspirations are taking their parents on a vacation and improving their current standard of living. In the long run, they aspire to provide for their children's marriage, accumulate enough savings for retirement, and travel.Life insurance, health insurance, mutual funds, equity, and bank FDs make for their most preferred financial instruments.

advertisement 60 per cent of India’s ‘sandwich generation’ is worried about future financial security, a new survey suggests.Sandwich Generation is a term used to define individuals in the age group of 35-54 years, financially providing for two generations of dependants – growing kids and ageing parents. The term was coined in the late 20th century due to increased life spans and later childbearing ages.The cycle of caring for both their parents and children primarily determines the Sandwich Generation’s financial decisions as well as their daily routine. A typical day in the life of a sandwich-generation individual may include taking their mother to the doctor in the morning, helping their child with school homework in the evening, negotiating an important deal at work, and making a quick run to the grocery store on the way home.Edelweiss Life Insurance, in collaboration with YouGov, surveyed over 4,000 respondents from this generation across 12 major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Kochi, and Chandigarh.What the survey saysA significant 60 per cent of the respondents said that no matter how much they save or invest, it never feels enough for the future. Over 50 per cent of the sandwich generation participants expressed worry about running out of money.

 



Over 50 per cent of the sandwich generation participants expressed worry about running out of money.
This is, of course, not the first sandwich generation that India is witnessing, but the unique social and economic challenges set them apart. Heavy reliance on credit cards and loans, the increased cost of living, expensive healthcare and education, and a quest for a better living standard make it essentially tricky for this generation to navigate finances.The future cost of kids’ education, future healthcare costs, lack of work-life balance, and declining health of parents are their top concerns. At the same time, they are taking family vacations and maintaining a good standard of living, even if it means stretching their resources. But this relentless dedication is leading many in the sandwich generation to burn through their income and savings, highlighted through high credit reliance and accessing investments earlier than planned.For the Sandwich Generation, the top three short-term aspirations are taking their parents on a vacation and improving their current standard of living. In the long run, they aspire to provide for their children's marriage, accumulate enough savings for retirement, and travel.Life insurance, health insurance, mutual funds, equity, and bank FDs make for their most preferred financial instruments.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/how-to-be-safe-in-gym-and-avoid-the-risk-of-fatal-injuries-2682963-2025-02-20,"Gym safety is once again a topic of discussion following the tragic death of national-level powerlifter Yashtika Acharya during a workout. The 17-year-old died after a 270-kg weight she was attempting to lift fell on her neck during training at a gym in Rajasthan's Bikaner. She lost balance while lifting, causing the weights to fall on her.Gym injuries are quite common. In India, shoulder, knee, and ankle sprains, along with lower back pain, are among the most prevalent ones. However, some injuries sustained while working out can also be fatal.As a fitness enthusiast who exercises regularly in the gym, you can take several steps to ensure your safety. Those who are new or yet to embark on their gym journey should be extra cautious and prepared. Something as basic as keeping yourself hydrated or not missing out on the warm-up goes a long way in preventing mishaps.Warming upWarming up is a way to prepare your body for exercise. The idea is to gradually increase your heart rate and blood flow to your muscles before beginning a rigorous workout. Fitness experts highly recommend taking 5-10 minutes to warm up and cool down the body.Research also suggests that warm-up routines help in reducing injury rates.Maintaining proper form“Always prioritise proper form and technique during exercise. It helps avoid injuries,” says Abhishek Singh, a Raipur-based fitness coach. Incorrect posture or form can lead to undue stress on muscles, ligaments, and joints, thereby increasing the risk of injury.Take time to learn good form and technique from your instructor. Your form should never be compromised, whether you are in a hurry to finish sets or reps or struggling with a heavy weight.“Even after you learn the technique, improving it should be a continuous pursuit,” says Yash Sharma, Delhi-based fitness influencer and entrepreneur.Exercise warm-upThe importance of a general warm-up session is well known, but a specific warm-up before weight training is just as crucial.“If you are going to lift 80 kg, it is important to do some warm-up reps with 20 kg, 40 kg, and 60 kg first,” says Yash Sharma.Ego lifting“Avoid the urge of ego lifting,” suggests Abhishek. Lifting excessive weight with poor form can cause joint damage and other injuries.Training too hard is one of the common reasons for gym injuries.Dichotomy of push and pullIn the gym, you target different muscle groups with various push and pull exercises. However, Yash suggests that the push-and-pull concept should also be applied in another way.""Understanding the dichotomy of push and pull. The gym is a place where you are supposed to push your limits, but sometimes you need to pull back a little. This balance comes with experience, which is why consistency is imperative,” he says.Listen to your bodyUnderstanding your body's signals is crucial. If you experience unusual pain, excessive fatigue, or discomfort, it is important to rest or modify your training accordingly.Have a spotter or a personal trainerLack of supervision is another prominent reason why many get injured in gyms. It is beneficial to have a personal trainer who guides you and ensures you are exercising with the correct form and technique.Otherwise, you can also have a spotter, suggests Abhishek.

“Always have a spotter with significant knowledge and experience in weightlifting to assist you when lifting heavy weights, ensuring proper technique and providing immediate support if needed to prevent injuries,” he says.Wear appropriate shoesShoes should have proper grip to avoid slipping and ensure stability.“Wearing the right shoes for specific workouts is essential for maximising performance and preventing injuries,” shares Abhishek.“Proper footwear provides better stability during movements like squats, lunges, and deadlifts, especially for individuals with specific foot mechanics, such as flat feet or high arches,” he adds.Equipment awarenessYou, of course, need to know your equipment and how it functions properly, not only to maximise your performance but also to avoid injury.“While doing squats, use a safety bar to avoid serious injuries. Proper setup and a safety bar are very important for squats,” suggests Abhishek.Similarly, before using benches and racks, make sure they are locked and stable. Adjust seats, handles, and weights to match your personal requirements and body mechanics. Before using any resistance band or cable, check for wear and tear—otherwise, they might snap and cause injury.Don’t miss rest daysGiving your body time to recover from a heavy workout is essential. Otherwise, your muscles won’t have enough time to repair and grow, increasing the risk of fatigue, injury, and overtraining.How safe are gyms in India?Meanwhile, several gyms compromise the safety of fitness enthusiasts by hiring untrained professionals. Spotters and trainers should themselves be properly trained before supervising others in the gym.All equipment should be regularly inspected to ensure safety. Damaged or faulty equipment should either be replaced or repaired.

But in this search for love, do divorced men have it easier than women?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/its-2025-but-has-dating-become-any-easier-for-divorced-indian-women-2683214-2025-02-21,"“The world today is hungry for love; hungry to be wanted, to be loved.” – Mother Teresa Finding love is a challenge. Don’t really think it’s true? Well, Cosmo India’s survey might give you better insight. A survey based on 65.4% of women and 34.5% of men, aged between 25 and 44, states that 60% of respondents are not in a relationship because they haven’t found the right person. As challenging as life gets, finding a partner is no piece of cake—and to top it all, if you are divorced in 2025, it doesn’t get any easier, despite people bragging about their open-mindedness. In reality, even today, it is harder for a divorced woman to find a new partner, and 38% agree with it. Things get even tougher if she is a single mother—only a meagre 20% think otherwise. Even though the age-old stigma around divorce has gradually lost some of its societal weight, conversations about individual happiness, mental well-being, and the right to start over have gained traction. But this shift hasn’t truly translated into a more accepting landscape for divorced women seeking new relationships.Shifting perceptions, but... Without a doubt, perceptions of divorce have evolved. More women today are choosing to walk away from unhappy marriages without succumbing to societal pressure—or rather, feeling confident enough to rise above its judgment. Of course, awareness and a lot of social activism have a role in many women being able to make this decision independently. However, on the ground, there is scope for so much more improvement. Dr Nisha Khanna, psychologist and marriage counsellor, notes, “Society is still not fully accepting of women who have undergone a divorce. Most of the time, the woman is blamed—regardless of whether her partner cheated, was abusive, or whether her in-laws mistreated her. People often find faults with women.No strings attached, please It gets even worse when you are a divorcee with a child, notes Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai. “Children from a previous marriage are often considered a burden or responsibility, and many men are unwilling to take on that role. There's also a mindset of ""not my kid, not my responsibility."" While this doesn’t apply to all men, it is a prevalent perspective,” she says. Moreover, single mothers are usually overburdened with physical, emotional, and financial responsibilities, making it difficult for them to date. The situation becomes even more challenging if they don’t have a strong financial background. “To top it all, legal complications - such as custody battles or issues with an ex-partner - can also make things more difficult as many see it as a turnoff,” she adds.The past baggage If not societal norms, sometimes the trauma of a past marriage itself can be a hindrance. Going through a divorce brings emotional and physical trauma, which can lead to trust issues and a tendency to repeat past mistakes. “Divorce also takes a toll on self-esteem. Picking oneself up after such an experience is difficult. While clarity and life lessons emerge from a divorce, the hurt makes women more selective about their next partner,” says Dr Khanna. Sam adds, “Some women may keep repeating patterns from past relationships, which means they might unknowingly seek or encounter emotionally unavailable men or those who prefer casual dating, making serious commitment difficult.”Some ground rules you need to follow Happiness is your birthright, let no one deny you that. If seeking a new partner brings you happiness, so be it. But before you move forward, ensure you have recovered and healed from the trauma and ""scars"" of your past relationship. Secondly, it’s crucial to be clear about what you want, says Sam—whether it’s companionship, marriage, or a casual arrangement like friends with benefits. Clear expectations are necessary. She adds, “Often, people get into relationships because that’s what society expects. But rather than doing things the 'society-approved' way, women should focus on what they truly want.” And then, never ignore the red flags. “Watch out for controlling behaviour, lack of respect, and emotional unavailability. If you notice toxic traits, distance yourself,” says Dr Khanna. For single mothers, a word of caution from Dr Khanna: “If you are a single mother, consider how a new relationship will impact your child. Introducing a new partner too soon can create confusion or comparisons with the past. Prioritise your child's well-being before finalising any commitment.”How does a divorce impact men in India? If experts are to be believed, it isn’t any better for divorced men either. However, compared to what women face, they still have it a bit easier. “Families are generally more accepting (comparatively) of divorced men because a lot of women look at men as providers, and this makes their marital history less of an issue,” says Absy Sam. Adding to this, Dr Khanna says, “It's not that men in society are appreciated for having gone through a divorce. In fact, other men often mock them if their marriage doesn’t work out. Additionally, men are not as expressive in relationships, which creates further problems, as they are also judged for it.” That being said, there’s no denying that when it comes to dating, men are more likely to be active on dating apps, whereas women, especially in India, do not find as much acceptance in the online dating scene, particularly when looking for a committed relationship. Moreover, in most divorce cases, men do not get custody of their children, so the responsibility of raising kids usually falls on women. This adds another layer of difficulty for divorced women, as they have to take on parental responsibilities while also navigating relationships. While the father may have to pay monthly child support to financially assist the child/children, the mothers end up taking on the majority of the responsibility.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 21, 2025

755929d1-e90e-4b24-a89c-44b8a3f4565d,"Not just Mahakumbh, how spiritual tourism is taking Indians abroadExperts believe that Mahakumbh has put India firmly on the global map of spiritual tourism. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/not-just-mahakumbh-how-spiritual-tourism-is-taking-indians-abroad-2683565-2025-02-22,"The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 is more than just a festival; it is a grand celebration of India’s spiritual heritage and a major attraction for travellers from around the world. This once-in-144-years event is drawing millions of pilgrims, seekers, and tourists, offering a unique blend of devotion, tradition, and cultural vibrancy. Now, we are not saying that this world’s largest gathering of humans did not come with its own set of challenges, and that’s a different story. But for now, let's focus on how Mahakumbh has changed spiritual tourism. India Today spoke to four travel and hospitality experts to understand how Mahakumbh has impacted India’s spiritual tourism scene. Here’s what we found: Dr Vikram Kamat, chairman and managing director of The VITS Kamats Group, describes Mahakumbh as a game-changer in spiritual tourism. ""Earlier, spiritual tourism was seen as something primarily for the elderly. But the 2025 Mahakumbh has attracted younger generations, who are now forging a lifelong bond with India's spiritual traditions,"" he adds.

 Improved infrastructure, enhanced connectivity, and widespread digital access have made the event more inclusive, ensuring that Mahakumbh reaches a larger and more diverse audience than ever before. Harish Khatri, founder & MD of India Assist, adds how the event has gone beyond a mere pilgrimage to become a structured and technologically enabled experience. ""From real-time assistance and emergency services to guided tours and language support, Mahakumbh now offers a level of convenience that was unheard of in the past. International visitors, in particular, find it much easier to participate, making this a truly global event."" Ritwik Khare, founder & CEO of ELIVAAS, agrees and adds that Mahakumbh represents a perfect balance between tradition and innovation. ""With live-streamed ceremonies, mobile booking platforms, and curated hospitality experiences, Mahakumbh is no longer just about physically being there, it’s about making spirituality more accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are,"" he says. Jatinder Paul Singh, co-founder and CEO of Viacation, says, ""From better roads and bridges to eco-friendly accommodations and meditation retreats, this edition of Mahakumbh has set a new standard for how spiritual tourism is managed. More people are looking for deeper, well-organised experiences that merge the spiritual with the modern.""The impact of Mahakumbh in India and abroad Mahakumbh’s impact is not just spiritual - it’s economic, social, and global. The event is expected to generate Rs 2 lakh crore in direct revenue, contributing over 1 per cent to Uttar Pradesh's GDP. With the Uttar Pradesh government investing Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructure, the event has created thousands of jobs and transformed Prayagraj into a world-class pilgrimage destination. Dr Kamat observes that the sheer scale of participation has set a precedent for other religious events worldwide, and according to him, ""The way Mahakumbh has blended faith with large-scale tourism infrastructure is something that many countries are now keen to study and replicate."" Experts agree that India’s spiritual heritage is becoming an international talking point. They believe that Mahakumbh has put India firmly on the global map of spiritual tourism, attracting curious travellers from across the world. The experience of witnessing millions of people gather in one place for a single spiritual purpose is something that leaves a lasting impact.It's not just Mahakumbh  Spiritual tourism is emerging as a way to embrace slow living. Harish Khatri agrees, noting that international interest in India’s spiritual traditions has surged. ""Mahakumbh serves as a gateway to India’s rich spiritual ecosystem, introducing travellers to places like Varanasi, Rishikesh, and Bodh Gaya. With improved digital platforms and guided tours, the experience is now easier to navigate for foreigners,"" he says. In 2022-23, searches for religious destinations in tier II and III cities increased by 97 per cent. Specifically, searches for Ayodhya grew by 585 per cent, Ujjain by 359 per cent, and Badrinath by 343 per cent from 2022 to 2023. Ritwik Khare adds that spiritual tourism isn’t just about visiting religious sites - it’s about transformation. ""The hospitality sector plays a crucial role in ensuring that visitors have an immersive, distraction-free experience. The moment someone decides to embark on a spiritual journey, their mindset shifts, and everything - from accommodation to food - should complement that journey,"" he says. Jatinder Paul Singh highlights that the pandemic has accelerated the demand for spiritual experiences.

 ""Destinations like Varanasi, Rishikesh, and Dharamshala have witnessed a surge in travellers seeking not just a trip, but a transformational journey. More people now want experiences that blend culture, mindfulness, and adventure,"" he adds. Data also supports this. Apart from Mahakumbh, data from the Ministry of Tourism shows that the number of people engaging in religious or spiritual tourism in India rose to 1,439 million in 2022 from 677 million in 2021. Along with this growth, the revenues generated by the sector reached a level of USD 16.2 billion (Rs 1.34 lakh crore) in 2022, up from USD 7.9 billion (Rs 65.1 thousand crore). The ministry also projected that by 2030, more than one hundred million people will be gainfully employed through temporary and permanent jobs driven by India’s spiritual tourism alone, which is anticipated to be worth around USD 59 billion by 2028.Where do Indians travel abroad for spiritual tourism? While India remains a spiritual hub, Indians also seek spiritual experiences abroad. Even though there is no exact data, experts agree with the trend. For ages, Indian Muslims travelling abroad for spiritual tourism have often visited Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia, which are significant pilgrimage sites for Muslims. Among Hindus, Sri Lanka is receiving a lot of attention, especially from younger millennials. One of the reasons apart from the scenery, is because of the ‘Ramayana Trail’, which takes you to 20 significant locations in Sri Lanka, each deeply woven into the Ramayana story. The Sri Lankan government's visa-free policy for Indians also further boosted travel. Additionally, SriLankan Airlines has also introduced their 'exclusive Ramayana Trail package’, designed especially for Indian travellers. This experience immerses the traveller in the places where Lord Rama, Sita, and Hanuman’s adventures unfolded, set against the lush backdrop of Sri Lanka.

 From October to March 2024, it was estimated that 60-70 per cent of tourists in Sri Lanka were Ramayana Trail visitors. Moreover, countries like Thailand, Nepal, and Japan are popular for their Buddhist and Zen heritage, with places like Bodh Gaya’s counterpart in Lumbini attracting Indian visitors. Mount Kailash in Tibet continues to be a significant pilgrimage site, drawing devout travellers despite its challenging terrain. In recent years, there has also been a rise in Indians visiting Bali for its unique blend of Hindu traditions, scenic temples, and meditation retreats. Israel’s Jerusalem, home to sacred sites across religions, also draws Indian travellers interested in interfaith spiritual exploration. This growing trend reflects a desire among Indians to connect with spiritual traditions beyond their homeland, enriching their global spiritual perspective.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 22, 2025Must Watch

Eating out is a novelty for many - especially those in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. But, according to food anthropologists, our deep-rooted obsession with home-cooked food stems not only from the price and hygiene factor but also from various cultural influences, including patriarchy and the caste system. The cultural factors “There was a caste-based stigma - ‘We don’t know who made the food outside’,” says Kurush F Dalal, an archaeologist, historian and culinary anthropologist. “Historically, upper-caste Hindus wouldn’t eat out; it was taboo,” adds Shirin Mehrotra, a food writer and anthropologist. Experts also believe that the sacrosanctity of home-cooked food is rooted in patriarchy, though masked with emotions and love. “In countries like China and Singapore, women mostly go to work. For their families, women are now educated and therefore independent in their own rights. But we don’t want that to happen, do we? We don’t want women to be powerful. So instead, we have this narrative that a woman’s place is in the kitchen, that women are the custodians of food. The idea that ‘home-cooked meals are sacred’ usually means the mother cooks and serves while everyone else enjoys,” says Dalal. “The love for home-cooked food in India rests on the shoulders of women. It is mostly the women of the family who take on the labour of cooking. From planning and cleaning the kitchen before and after cooking to ensuring nutrition and preparing meals that everyone enjoys, the emotional and physical labour involved has largely been carried by women,” adds Mehrotra.

 



Dr Cyriac Abby Philips, known as The Liver Doc, tweets about India's obsession with home-cooked food.
 “We glorify ‘mother’s cooking’ and guilt-trip women into taking on this unpaid, exhausting labour. Of course, we love the food we grew up with - it’s part of our memories. But that doesn’t mean eating outside food is inherently bad,” Dalal adds. An unspoken pressure on women? Dalal shares how the responsibility of cooking continues to rest on women’s shoulders. “A friend, who is a highly educated woman with a PhD, hired someone to help with cooking so she could manage her job and home efficiently. But her in-laws disapproved, claiming it was her duty to cook for her family. Even her parents agreed.” Reminds you of the film Mrs. too?

 However, things are changing, with many modern couples sharing household chores and learning to cook as a basic skill. Noted nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar, who reacted to Kamath’s post by advocating for ghar ka khaana over eating out, also urged people to learn cooking irrespective of gender.

 Is eating out always unhealthy? Contrary to popular belief, home-cooked food can be unhealthy too. Excessive oil, spices, improper plating, and lack of portion control - even when the food is prepared at home - can take away the healthy quotient from your ghar ka khaana. On the other hand, eating out can be healthy. Many fitness enthusiasts order meals as per their nutritional needs. For instance, many X users lauded the hawker centre culture in Singapore, which makes healthy food easily accessible. “That is because Singapore has a delightful hawker centre culture; India does not. It is not because everyone in Singapore orders food or goes to posh restaurants. India needs to treat our hawkers with respect and provide cleaning services and clean water; India too can do it,” a user commented on Kamath’s tweet.

I live in Singapore - been here for 15 years. You are right, but if I may add, Singapore’s eating out culture is primarily an outcome of the 121 hawker centres promoted by the government. The 6000 stalls under these centres have to adhere to strict quality standards and provide...

— Parminder Singh (@parrysingh) February 18, 2025 “I would think the key is having an unbiased rating system. I’ve lived in Singapore, where every food court stall or restaurant has this clearly displayed, or else they are heavily fined. London is the same. India, unfortunately, lacks this, and hence it is very hard to trust hygiene,” wrote another. Dalal also adds: “Look at hawker centres in Singapore - they serve simple, everyday meals, the kind people would make at home. Many large buildings have hawker centres beneath them, offering a variety of dishes so people don’t need to cook.” In India, the food scene outside is far from being trusted owing to the lack of vigilance. ""Profit-making wins the race for food vendors, leading to compromised quality of ingredients and unhygienic conditions. You don't know what kind of ingredients they are using. At home, at least you know there is no compromise on quality. So, I always recommend eating home-cooked food,"" says Dr Monica B Sood, an ayurveda specialist and CEO, Navjivan Health Services. The emotional bond with home-cooked food For those living away from home, a home-cooked meal is more than just about taste - it’s an emotion. It’s the unmatched warmth of a loved one serving food with care, the hearty giggles shared over a meal, and a mother’s love language. “We often say that a mother’s cooking is the best - you grow up eating it, and it becomes her love language. Naturally, you’ll love it. But that doesn’t mean eating out is inherently bad. As long as you eat sensibly and make healthy choices, that’s what truly matters,” says Kurush F Dalal. This is why, if you ask a young single person living alone for education or work, the absence of an operational kitchen in their flat would not be unusual. Of course, many are forced to take matters into their own hands and finally learn to cook (to essentially save money). But many also manage without a kitchen - especially when cooking isn’t their thing or when they don’t have extra hours to spend in the kitchen. The convenience of tiffin services, home-style cloud kitchens, or online food delivery makes it possible for them.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 23, 2025Must Watch

But is it your body fatigue or mind?We often brush off fatigue as just physical tiredness, but is that really the case?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/feeling-tired-but-is-it-your-body-fatigue-or-mind-the-white-lotus-2684486-2025-02-24,"Have you felt tired, so tired that the only thing you think that could relieve you of your fatigue is a good body massage? (We can hear a yes!) But have you ever stopped to consider whether your fatigue is mental or physical? In the first episode of The White Lotus, Arrival (Season 1), as Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) arrives at the resort feeling all distressed and drained, the only thing she thinks could relieve her of that uneasy feeling is a good spa. However, sensing her vulnerabilities, Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the spa manager, suggests a treatment of another kind, one that is more holistic and spiritual because she sees Tanya frazzled and desperate for relief, rambling about her anxiety and grief (of losing her mother). Of course, we know how that session went down and how bamboozled (in a good way) she was after the treatment.   Sometimes what we tend to think that the feeling of being drained or exhausted is generally due to a tiring day at work but the reality could be quite the unexpected – your mind and stress could be the reason you are feeling low on energy. But how do you tell them apart? Well, here are some experts to your rescue.Mental fatigue vs Physical fatigue: Spotting the difference Dr Sonal Anand, a psychiatrist at Wockhardt Hospitals, Mira Road, Mumbai, explains that mental fatigue and physical fatigue have some overlap. It can change the way you think and behave, affecting your productivity and overall mood. You may feel sad, gloomy, or even prone to anxiety and panic attacks. Your ability to focus and organise may take a hit, and overwhelming thoughts can dominate your mind. In severe cases, you might experience psychomotor retardation, where your thoughts feel sluggish and unproductive. On the other hand, mental fatigue can also manifest in physical symptoms. Headaches, an upset stomach, difficulty falling asleep, and changes in appetite (either an increase or decrease) are common indicators. Some people even experience weight fluctuations as a result. According to Dr Gautam Arora, senior consultant in neurology at Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, physical fatigue is easier to identify. “Physical fatigue generally manifests as tiredness in the muscles, a heavy or sluggish feeling, and an overall need for rest. The basic key to identifying the difference is to reflect on your activity levels, if your body has been active or you’ve had poor sleep, it might be physical tiredness if your mind has been under stress or overworked, it’s likely mental fatigue,” he says.What’s draining your energy? There are several factors that can contribute to both mental and physical fatigue. Physical fatigue can be caused by overexertion, lack of sleep, dehydration, nutritional deficiencies, or underlying medical conditions like anaemia or chronic fatigue syndrome. Mental fatigue, on the other hand, is triggered by prolonged stress, anxiety, emotional strain, poor sleep, or excessive mental workload. Lifestyle factors like poor time management, lack of breaks, and constant multitasking can also contribute to mental exhaustion. Additionally, conditions such as depression or anxiety can heighten feelings of mental fatigue. However, Dr Anand suggests the most common causes of mental fatigue are stress and burnout. “When you are facing continuous stress and are unable to handle it well, or your coping mechanisms are reduced, it can lead to mental fatigue. Certain circumstances, such as pre-existing mental health disorders like anxiety or depression, can also affect how you handle stress and contribute to mental exhaustion,” she says.When mental stress turns into physical exhaustion Have you ever noticed how stress can leave you feeling completely drained? “Mental stress activates the body’s stress response, releasing hormones like cortisol and adrenaline,” says Dr Arora. This triggers the ""fight or flight"" reaction, which leads to increased heart rate, muscle tension, and heightened alertness. When the stress response is prolonged, it can lead to physical symptoms such as headaches, body aches, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Over time, chronic stress can sap your energy reserves, leaving you feeling exhausted—even if you haven’t been physically active.How to recharge your mind and body While we know that the answer to physical fatigue is some rest and a good night’s sleep, mental well-being rests on many factors and it is important to manage them. Here are some tips to manage mental fatigue, as suggested by Dr Gautam Arora.

Tips on managing mental fatigue:
Relaxation techniques: Mindfulness, meditation, Yoga, and deep breathing exercises can help calm the mind and reduce stress levels
Regular breaks: Short, frequent breaks during work or study can help refresh your mind and prevent burnout
Sleep well: Quality sleep is essential for mental recovery, aim for 7-8 hours of restful sleep each night to allow your brain to recharge
Exercise regularly: Physical activities as simple as walking, releases endorphins, which help reduce stress and improve mental clarity
Stay hydrated and eat well: Proper nutrition and hydration can help your body and mind function optimally, reducing mental fatigue
Set boundaries: Avoid overloading yourself with tasks, learn to say no when you’re feeling overwhelmed, and prioritize your mental well-being
Seek support: Talk to someone you trust or a professional therapist, sharing your thoughts can relieve mental pressure and provide clarity

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/can-the-viral-moroccan-nila-powder-really-help-brighten-your-skin-2684864-2025-02-25,"In the world of beauty, certain products go viral from time to time. One major trend we've noticed is influencers turning back to natural remedies for their skincare concerns. The latest addition to this wave apparently hails from Morocco—Nila Powder. Nila Powder is taking the internet by storm, with influencers covering themselves in striking shades of blue. The claims around this product are simple: it's anti-inflammatory, brightens the skin, and helps reduce hyperpigmentation (sounds like an all-in-one miracle, right?). Given that many Indians struggle with hyperpigmentation and our obsession with skin-brightening hasn’t quite faded, it’s no surprise that this product is making its way into the reels of nearly every beauty enthusiast.But what exactly is Moroccan Nila Powder? Historically, in India, the plant indigo has played a very important role. In fact, in 1917, Mahatma Gandhi started a nonviolent protest, or satyagraha, against the British to protest the forced cultivation of Indigo by the British. Today, indigo is also known (apart from the textile industry), for skincare and hair care benefits.  A quick search online will reveal various brands selling it under names like Indigo Ubtan, Moroccan Nila Powder, and more - enough to leave anyone confused as almost all of them are in the same shades of blue. If you're wondering what it really is, well, we had to do some digging too, because its origins weren’t exactly clear.

It differs slightly from regular indigo powder, which is made directly from plants like Indigofera Suffruticosa without fermentation. However, others say that this Nila powder is a natural mineral found in the rocky mountains of the Sahara. This mineral is naturally indigo blue and is simply extracted before being reduced into pieces or a fine powder.  Indigo powder is often mixed with henna for hair colouring, creating shades ranging from deep blue to black, while Nila powder is currently going viral for its potential benefits. Today, you can get this powder easily online on e-commerce websites. The potential benefits Moroccan Nila powder, derived from the indigo plant, has gained attention for its supposed skin-brightening properties. While its traditional use in Morocco has contributed to its popularity, experts remain divided on its effectiveness.

 Dr Sonali Kohli, consultant dermatology, Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai, notes, ""Nila Powder has deep roots in traditional medicine, particularly in Morocco and other parts of North Africa where it has been used for centuries in both textile dyeing and skincare preparations."" Potential benefits include, according to Dr Mahnaz Jahan Begum, aesthetic expert, and founder of Keraderm Clinics: 
Anti-inflammatory properties: Indigo naturalis, a traditional Chinese medicine preparation containing indigo, possesses significant anti-inflammatory properties, which may help calm irritated skin and reduce redness.
Antioxidant activity: The powder exhibits antioxidant properties that could protect skin cells from oxidative stress and environmental damage.
Treatment of skin conditions: Some studies have demonstrated indigo's effectiveness in treating psoriasis and eczema.
Skin hydration: Indigo plays a role in hydration and softens the rough parts of the skin like knees and elbows.
What do experts have to say? The effectiveness of Moroccan Nila powder for skin brightening remains questionable, according to experts.   Dr Ameesha Mahajan, cosmetic dermatologist and founder, Eden Skin Clinic, warns, ""There is no strong scientific evidence that indigo itself has melanin-inhibiting properties to lighten hyperpigmentation. Some brands may mix indigo with liquorice, kojic acid, or vitamin C, which are known for brightening effects, creating the illusion that indigo itself is responsible."" Similarly, Dr Praveen says, ""The idea that it is a 'Moroccan secret' for skin brightening is more of a social media myth than a historical fact.""  But she says that its antibacterial and antifungal qualities may help with skin conditions like eczema. India Today also tried finding scientific studies related to the plant and its application on the skin, but there’s none. The side effects Nila powder’s benefits are questionable and, if experts are to be believed, it does have side effects too. Have a look at some: 
Skin irritation: ""Some people may develop contact dermatitis from indigo, especially if it’s not properly processed or mixed with harsh ingredients,"" Dr Mahajan explains.
Allergic reactions: As a botanical extract, indigo can trigger allergic responses in some individuals. Dr Begum suggests, ""Before you go forward with it, you should always do a small skin patch test.""
Drying effect: Certain indigo-based pastes can be drying on the skin, making them unsuitable for those with dry or sensitive skin.
Pigmentation risks: Ironically enough, experts suggest that the powder might cause pigmentation. Dr Mahajan says, ""Indigo acts as a skin sensitiser in many cases and leads to an extremely stubborn hyperpigmentation called lichen planus pigmentosus or ashy dermatosis. This condition can be triggered by even a single use of indigo in some individuals.""
 Moreover, Dr Kohli points out that our market lacks standardisation, leading to:
Varying purity levels in commercial products
Potential contamination with harmful substances
Inconsistent concentrations of active compounds
The bigger problem: our obsession with fair skin When products like Nila Powder go viral for ‘its skin-brightening effects’, we should take a moment to analyse why. Today, many influencers are promoting this product as the way to get ‘fairer skin’ or ‘lighten your skin tone’. But as many people in the comment section (of these viral videos) have pointed out, what’s the obsession with fair skin? Hyperpigmentation? We get it. It’s a condition that needs to be dealt with. However, it’s 2025 - do we really need products to lighten our skin tone?What can be done if you want to add it to your routine  Now if you are still keen on trying Moroccan Nila powder, Dr Kohli recommends a cautious approach:
Patch testing: Always conduct a patch test before applying it to your face to rule out allergic reactions.
Seek professional advice: Consult with a dermatologist before incorporating indigo into your skincare routine, especially if you have sensitive skin or existing skin conditions.
Opt for high-quality products: Look for reputable brands that provide transparency about their sourcing and processing methods.
Introduce it gradually: Start with properly formulated products rather than raw indigo powder and monitor your skin’s response carefully.

While some experts acknowledge its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, but they also caution against potential risks like skin irritation and pigmentation.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 25, 2025

From cult classics to trend-setting films, Rebello has been at the forefront of Bollywood’s evolving style landscape. In an exclusive interview with India Today Digital, Ashley spoke about some of his favourite looks and actors. Reflecting on his journey, Rebello highlighted a few standout films that continue to be iconic for their fashion. “The two films that I have done that are iconic to date are Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, Josh, and Ek Tha Tiger. These are iconic films where people actually started copying the style and the outfits that the actors wore. Everybody under the sun was wearing them. That is something I always look forward to. I love it,” he shared.

 His designs have resonated deeply with audiences, particularly in the heartlands of India. “Whenever I go to the interiors, everyone tells me that the best films I have done to date are Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Hum Saath Saath Hain. Those films were like a costume drama. Sonali Bendre, Karisma Kapoor, Neelam Kothari—everybody looked so beautiful in the clothes that they wore.” Rebello also spoke about his contributions to Salman Khan’s filmography, where his styling choices became cultural phenomena. “Yes! During Ek Tha Tiger, the scarf that he wore became a trend. When he started wearing fitted shirts as a cop in Wanted, a lot of cops followed that style. His checkered shirts in the same film also became a trend. It was a huge trendsetter, and I am glad I got to be part of it.”

Discussing actors who effortlessly bring costumes to life, Rebello praised Tabu and Aamir Khan for their ability to make styling look seamless. “Tabu, she’s an incredible actor who makes costumes look effortless. We have done so many films together, like Chandni Bar and many others. She makes it feel so natural that you don’t feel she is wearing a costume; you feel that she is born and brought up in that look. In reality, she is acting. I like her.”

His admiration extended to Aamir Khan as well. “The other person I like a lot is Aamir Khan. He brings costumes to life. When I worked with him right from Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, where he was not a college boy but a high schooler, how easily, with panache, whatever I gave him, he wore it, and it became a huge cult, the song, the movie, everything. Even post that, I have worked with him on a couple of movies, and it’s always great.”advertisement

My styling has evolved over the years. When it comes to survival in this industry, it’s just Manish Malhotra, Neeta Lulla, and me. We’ve survived because we keep reinventing and innovating ourselves and adapting to changing times.” With a legacy that continues to inspire, Ashley Rebello remains one of Bollywood’s most influential costume designers, setting trends that transcend the silver screen.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 25, 2025Trending Reel

Now, the YouTuber-turned-actress is stepping into a new chapter as she prepares to marry her longtime boyfriend, Vrishank Khanal, on February 25. Prajakta has been sharing one dreamy photo after another from her pre-wedding festivities, leaving us completely in awe! On Tuesday morning, the ‘Mismatched’ actor posted a set of pictures from her sangeet night, where she looked stunning in a gorgeous paithani saree from her mother's wardrobe. She embraced the classic ""Marathi mulgi"" look for the musical night—stacking her hands with green glass bangles, adorning a traditional nath, and completing the ensemble with the signature Marathi Chandrakor bindi. The groom picked a statement bandhgala in black, but something special caught our attention—his adorable little brooch. Vrishank, Prajakta’s fiance, who hails from Kathmandu, Nepal, paid tribute to his roots with a brooch featuring two curved knives called khukuri. For the people of Nepal, the khukuri holds deep cultural, historical, and practical significance. It is more than just a weapon or a tool—it symbolises heritage, valour, and identity, especially for the Gorkha soldiers, who are globally renowned for their bravery.

 So, while Prajakta paid tribute to her Maharashtrian roots with her sangeet look, Vrishank honored his Nepalese heritage in his own way. How sweet, right? See the photos here:

 While we all wait with bated breath for Prajakta’s final wedding look, she has kept her fans engaged by sharing a steady stream of photos from her wedding festivities, including the mehendi and haldi ceremonies. For the mehendi ceremony, the lovebirds donned outfits designed by Anita Dongre. The bride looked stunning in an embroidered bottle green lehenga, while the groom looked dapper in a mint-green embroidered Nehru jacket paired with a matching kurta and white trousers. See photos here:

 The haldi was a joyous affair, and Prajakta and Vrishank’s glowing faces say it all. She wore a delicate white and gold ensemble featuring a flared sharara, an embroidered blouse, and a sheer dupatta. Of course, the floral jewelry stole the spotlight (ngl). Vrishank complemented her look in an ivory embroidered kurta—just perfect! More photos here:

 As for their love story, Prajakta Koli and Vrishank Khanal met through a mutual friend.

 However, beyond social media, pop culture now plays a major role in influencing our travel choices. Remember when Netflix’s Emily in Paris had everyone dreaming of strolling through the City of Love? And by the time we reached the fourth season, we were equally in love with Rome? Now, a new destination is sparking interest, Thailand’s Koh Samui, after its feature in The White Lotus Season 3. If you’ve been searching for things to do in Koh Samui, trust me, you’re not alone.

 Data from Agoda, an online travel platform, shows that since the Season 3 premiere earlier this week, accommodation searches from India to Koh Samui have risen by 15% compared to the January average and by 50% compared to the same period last year. ""Pop culture has the power to inspire travel, and The White Lotus is a great example. After the previous two seasons boosted tourism in Hawaii and Sicily, Thailand's Koh Samui is now in the spotlight. Intevrest from India has grown even more than the global average of 12%,"" says Mr Krishna Rathi, senior country director for the India Subcontinent and MEA at Agoda. But beyond The White Lotus, there are a few more reasons why Koh Samui (Thailand’s second-largest island) is gaining popularity among Indian travellers.The luxury staycation While Thailand is often marketed as the ultimate party destination, many Zillennial Indians are now prioritising luxury and relaxation. When The White Lotus showcased a world of indulgence: lavish resorts, serene spas, and pure relaxation—it’s no surprise that Indian travellers took notice. Ko Samui offers a perfect blend of high-end comfort and tranquillity, with well-developed infrastructure, international airports, and upscale resorts catering to those seeking a more refined experience.The land not so far away Koh Samui is about a seven-hour car journey from Phuket, or you can take a ferry if you’re feeling fancy. Speaking of Phuket, Air India and IndiGo both offer direct, non-stop flights from Delhi, with a flight time of just four and a half hours. This easy accessibility makes Ko Samui a tempting destination for Indian travellers.

Thailand is visa-free for Indians Thailand has been actively promoting tourism, particularly targeting Indian visitors. The country’s visa exemption policy has made travel even more convenient. If you want to extend your stay beyond the 60 visa-free days, Thailand has also introduced an e-visa system for Indian passport holders. This hassle-free visa process (looking at you, Schengen visa) has made Thailand, and especially Koh Samui, a preferred choice for Indian travellers. Whether it’s pop culture, easy accessibility, or the promise of an indulgent escape, Koh Samui is quickly becoming the next big thing for Indian tourists. So, are you ready to pack your bags?

This year’s Mahakumbh was a spectacle for many reasons. Held from January 13 to February 26 2025, it boasted a staggering budget of Rs 7,500 crore and contributed nearly 1 per cent to Uttar Pradesh’s GDP - a whopping Rs 2 lakh crore. But beyond the sheer scale of the event, something else stood out: the fusion of tradition with technology. Was it a step towards modern convenience, or just another way for brands and individuals to cash in? Well, that’s for you to decide. Technology, AI, and the internet have become such an integral part of our lives that, ironically, you’re using them right now to read this. So, when you have a once-in-a-lifetime event, of course, brands and entrepreneurs will find ways to cater to every possible need - often with a tech-driven twist. We rounded up a few such innovations that stood out at this year's Mahakumbh. 1. Missed Mahakumbh? Fret not get the Prasad and Sangam jal at home Even though nearly 400 million people attended the Kumbh, of course, many still missed out. If you were one of them, don’t worry - there’s an app for the rescue. Yes, you read that right. Waayu, a zero-commission food delivery app launched in October 2022, stepped in to bridge the gap. Partnering with ONDC, it made Mahaprasad and Sangam Jal available across 19,000 pincodes, ensuring devotees could still receive the sacred offerings.

He shared that the app has made over 1 lakh Mahaprasad deliveries, with 40% of orders from Tier 1 cities like Bangalore, Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, and Hyderabad; 35% from Tier 3 towns across Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu; and 20% from Tier 2 states including Maharashtra, Gujarat, and West Bengal.

Talk about the ultimate home delivery, faith? “The Mahaprasad, consisting of Shuddh Desi Ghee Besan Laddoos, is freshly prepared in Prayagraj, Ayodhya, and Varanasi using traditional methods while maintaining high standards of cleanliness. It is packaged in eco-friendly, plastic-free materials, aligning with Mahakumbh’s sustainability goals. Additionally, the Sangam jal is sourced directly from the Prayagraj Sangam Ghat, maintaining its purity and sacred significance,” says Mandar. 2. Digital Snan at Rs 1,100 Deepak Goyal is a resident of Prayagraj, where the Kumbh Mela is held. Deepak also found a way to bring the sacred waters of the Ganga to the devotees - well, at least their photographs. His ""Digital Snan"" service is the modern devotee’s answer to missing the Maha Kumbh Mela. Can’t make it to Prayagraj? No worries. Just send your picture, and Rs 1,100, Goyal will give it a holy dip. He even sweetens the deal by sending back a video of your photo taking the plunge, because what’s a ritual without a little digital proof? His little digital entrepreneurship soon went viral, and while some people on the internet are calling it an innovative way to keep faith alive in the digital age, others aren’t as convinced. Critics argue that dunking a printed photo is hardly the same as a soul-cleansing dip in the Ganga. Exploitation or innovation? You decide.  Here’s the viral video (if you’ve missed it):

Devotion took a digital twist at the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj when a woman found a rather immersive way to include her absent husband in the holy dip. A video of the moment has now gone viral, leaving the internet both amused and amazed. Since her husband couldn’t make it to the grand religious gathering, she came up with a creative solution. She video-called him and, without hesitation, plunged her phone straight into the sacred Sangam waters. Meanwhile, on the other end of the call, her husband appeared to be comfortably watching from his bed.  The people on the internet called her ‘Gopi Bahu 2025’, ifykyk.  Have a look at the video here:

People in almost every generation have struggled with managing weight. While the intensity may have changed, the woes remain the same. And when people struggle, they are ready to resort to anything and everything that promises to give them what they desire. In this case, it is the ideal body weight. A type of diet that is currently trending is the mono diet or monotrophic diet, and celebrities swear by it. Who? Well, Victoria Beckham, Anushka Sharma, and Virat Kohli, for starters. The idea is simple - eat only one type of food per meal or even per day. No complicated meal planning, no calorie counting, and no confusion. But our question is (and we know many of you have the same one) - is it even practical? If your question resonates, then let’s find out.Understanding the mono diet The monotrophic diet, or mono diet, involves eating just one food item for an extended period, with the primary goal of shedding weight. Dr Karthigai Selvi A, head of clinical nutrition and dietetics, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Kengeri, Bengaluru, explains, “The mono diet is a diet plan that involves consuming only one food item per meal or per day. It offers some initial appeal due to its simplicity and the potential for short-term weight loss. Some common foods used in monotrophic diets include various fruits, eggs, potatoes, grapefruit, cabbage, milk, bananas, brown rice, chicken breast, and even nuts. In a nutshell, any food or food group can become the focus of a monotropic diet.” For example, someone might eat only watermelon or apples for all meals, either for a few days or a few weeks. Dieting for weight loss is a significant challenge (you will agree) and that is where this diet seems to be winning some brownie points. “Mono diet promises to simplify this process of choosing the right kind of food for weight loss by eliminating the need for calculations - no food logging, carbohydrate counting, fat tracking, or calorie counting is required. The diet removes the guesswork about meal preparation, making it easy to follow,” she adds.The pitfalls of the mono diet Mono diet is typically best when you need to lose weight in a very short period of time but experts warn that its risks far outweigh its benefits. According to Dr Archana Batra, a Gurgaon-based nutritionist, it is simply not a practical approach to weight management.
Nutrient deficiencies – No single food provides all the essential macro and micronutrients the body needs. A diet restricted to just one type of food can cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies, leading to fatigue, weakness, and long-term health complications.
 Dr Selvi believes that the mono diet has gained popularity, especially with social media's ability to mainstream pseudoscience. “Many people promote this way of eating, preying on the human tendency to seek shortcuts. But if something sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. There is no substitute for a balanced approach to eating—a diverse and nutritious diet is essential for promoting long-term health and maintaining a healthy weight,” she says.
Muscle loss and slower metabolism - Relying on a single food group often means missing out on essential proteins, healthy fats, or complex carbohydrates. This can lead to muscle loss, which in turn slows metabolism, making future weight management even harder.
 A monotrophic diet causes lean muscle to burn more calories than other types of body mass. If you lose lean muscle mass, your metabolic rate can decline, and you tend to gain weight later, experts suggest.
Risk of nutrient toxicity - Too much of any one food can be harmful, says Dr Batra. Some examples include:
 Tender coconut water – Excessive potassium can cause irregular heartbeat. Chicken breast-only diet – Lack of fiber and Vitamin C, and too much protein may stress the kidneys. Banana-only diet – High carbohydrate intake can impact blood sugar levels and pancreatic function.
advertisementMental health consequences – If you think this is sustainable in the long wrong, you are misleading yourself because a monotrophic diet for an extended period can lead to an eating disorder. Such kind of eating restrictions promotes disordered eating patterns, including food moralising, which is the labelling of foods as ""good"" or ""bad”.
When you feel deprived, it can result in a cycle of binge-eating, guilt, and anxiety.
The rebound weight gain – “If you're eating only one food, even if it's your favourite, you'll eventually get tired of it. This flavour fatigue may either make you stop eating altogether or push you into overeating. As a result, you may regain any weight you initially lost and could even gain more weight than before,” says Dr Selvi.
Is the mono diet practical?While it may seem like an easy way to lose weight, experts agree that the mono diet is far from sustainable. According to Dr Batra, a healthier, more realistic approach involves:
A balanced and varied diet rich in all essential nutrients.
Regular physical activity to support metabolism and muscle health.
Mindful eating habits that promote long-term weight management rather than quick fixes.

But do health experts approve of it?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/does-skipping-dinner-help-with-weight-loss-or-make-it-difficult-2686397-2025-02-27,"Reducing calorie intake is one of the most significant steps towards weight loss. This is ideally teamed with a regular workout routine to create a calorie deficit. However, many take the route of skipping dinner, believing that ditching this meal will naturally lead to lower calorie consumption and result in quick weight loss.According to health experts, however, skipping dinner causes more harm to the body than good. While it may result in quick weight loss in some cases, experts say it is not sustainable and can lead to various health issues.How does skipping dinner affect your body?Dr Karthigai Selvi A, Head of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, explains that not having dinner leads to blood glucose fluctuations, which can further make you feel shaky and stressed.“The body also begins to increase the production of cortisol (the stress hormone), which makes you feel more stressed and hungry. It slows down the body’s metabolism, leading it into fat-storing mode, which can actually make you gain weight or make it harder for your body to lose it,” Dr Selvi A adds.

Rabiya, Senior Dietitian at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, adds that one also ends up eating more when trying to skip meals.“Skipping dinner may help reduce daily calorie intake in the short term, but it is not a sustainable approach. It is ineffective as a long-term strategy and can lead to overeating during the day or night cravings. It may also slow down metabolism and increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies,” Rabiya explains.One is also likely to feel more irritable if they adapt to the no-dinner routine, as low energy levels can affect mood as well.Children, teenagers, athletes, pregnant women, people with type 1 diabetes, or those with a history of eating disorders, anxiety, or depression should avoid skipping dinner.An early dinner is a better ideaA light or early dinner is a better alternative to skipping the last meal of the day altogether.Have your dinner 2–3 hours before bedtime, and an overall window of 10 hours (between your dinner and breakfast) is ideal.Keeping a gap of 3 hours between your dinner and bedtime can positively impact your well-being. It helps with digestion, sleep quality, and weight management.On the contrary, eating late or right before sleeping can cause significant harm and makes you prone to developing issues like acidity, indigestion, acid reflux, and nausea.“There is always a link between our internal body clock and the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Our body's circadian rhythms are designed in such a way that eating during the day and sleeping at night support overall health. If this rhythm is disrupted, it can have negative effects,” says Dr Selvi A.“There is also some evidence that eating late at night may be linked to obesity and can affect blood glucose regulation. A smaller overnight gap has been associated with weight gain and fluctuations in blood glucose levels. We need to limit eating hours to the daytime, which aligns better with circadian rhythms, and avoid eating at night. A 10-hour overnight gap would be a better option,” she explains.Remember...Skipping any meal, not just dinner, is not a good idea. Contrary to your goal of losing weight, it can slow down your metabolism and make weight loss even more difficult. Research links it to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases as well.Portion control and timely meals (including an early dinner) should be your best allies if losing weight is the goal. You can consult a dietitian for a guided plan to ensure you don’t miss out on essential nutrients.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 27, 2025Trending Reel

advertisement “Skipping dinner may help reduce daily calorie intake in the short term, but it is not a sustainable approach. It is ineffective as a long-term strategy and can lead to overeating during the day or night cravings. It may also slow down metabolism and increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies,” Rabiya explains.One is also likely to feel more irritable if they adapt to the no-dinner routine, as low energy levels can affect mood as well.Children, teenagers, athletes, pregnant women, people with type 1 diabetes, or those with a history of eating disorders, anxiety, or depression should avoid skipping dinner.An early dinner is a better ideaA light or early dinner is a better alternative to skipping the last meal of the day altogether.Have your dinner 2–3 hours before bedtime, and an overall window of 10 hours (between your dinner and breakfast) is ideal.Keeping a gap of 3 hours between your dinner and bedtime can positively impact your well-being. It helps with digestion, sleep quality, and weight management.On the contrary, eating late or right before sleeping can cause significant harm and makes you prone to developing issues like acidity, indigestion, acid reflux, and nausea.“There is always a link between our internal body clock and the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Our body's circadian rhythms are designed in such a way that eating during the day and sleeping at night support overall health. If this rhythm is disrupted, it can have negative effects,” says Dr Selvi A.“There is also some evidence that eating late at night may be linked to obesity and can affect blood glucose regulation.

Whether it’s the battle over biryani supremacy or the heated discourse around entertainment industries, the competition between the two neighbours plays out in nearly every sphere. However, the fashion world seems to have made an exception. Pakistani actress Mahira Khan, for instance, has time and again worn Indian designers like Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna, Manish Malhotra, and a few others. Indian celebrities, too, have not shied away from endorsing Pakistani designers—Alia Bhatt, AP Dhillon, Akash Ambani and Sara Ali Khan wore outfits designed by Pakistani designers like Faraz Manan, Iqbal Hussain.

 This time, yet again, fashion has managed to bridge borders, and at the forefront of it this time are Hania Aamir (not her first time though) and Tara Sutaria.What Hania Aamir wore Hania Aamir dazzled in a gilded Rahul Mishra gown from his Spring 2024 Couture collection. The outfit, ‘Queen of Thar’, is a striking piece from Mishra’s ‘Superheroes’ collection, inspired by nature’s smallest yet most resilient beings. The ensemble featured intricate embellishments, with a delicately encrusted tulle dupatta adorned with a beetle motif, custom-crafted for Aamir. For makeup, she opted for her signature look—fresh, radiant skin with a glowing base and a dewy finish. Flushed cheeks and a natural pink-nude lip brought the look together, complemented by defined brows and subtle yet luminous eye makeup. Hania’s look for the night was a blend of old-school Bollywood charm (think of Deepika Padukone in Om Shanti Om) and contemporary glam - reminiscent of classic Bollywood divas yet effortlessly modern.

Another crucial element now shapes the way we jet, set, and go—Instagram.The photo and video-sharing social media platform has completely changed the way the world travels. It is no longer just a digital diary for sharing glimpses of our travel escapades; it has, in fact, become the starting point for many travel plans. You come across a viral Reel featuring an unconventional destination with scenic views and an incredible experience, and you instantly share it with your friends or save it for later. That hidden gem stays etched in your mind and your ‘Saved’ folder. You’re either tempted to plan a trip right away or revisit those Reels when life allows you to travel next.Apart from introducing you to hidden destinations or viral wonders, Instagram also becomes an itinerary planner. All thanks to tools like hashtags, geo-tags, the search option, and, of course, the user-generated content that lets people gauge the aesthetic appeal of a location, find out about unmissable experiences at a destination, and visit places beyond the generic ‘touristy’ spots.For instance, when Gargy Sharma, a 20-year-old student from Delhi, was planning a trip to Pondicherry with her family, Instagram became her travel guide. She bookmarked almost six Instagram Reels and several ‘Pondicherry guide’ posts. Through them, she discovered a lot of unconventional places like a handmade paper workshop, sound healing, Serenity Beach, some exclusive shopping stores, cafes, and workshops for her two-day itinerary.But it is all great until it is not. What you have read so far is equivalent to the majority of travel content you consume on Instagram—just a highlight of the positive aspects.

What you see is not always what you getWhat you see in a carefully created, heavily edited Reel is not always the entire picture. What you see is just the best bit of what you may experience. Those short clips don’t tell you about the ordeals you may face while reaching that particular point for an Insta-worthy moment.“There is an overdependency on Instagram for travel, especially among young travellers. Many plan their trips based on what they see on their feeds, instantly saving posts that catch their attention. While this is great for awareness, it often leads to disappointing experiences. People tend to showcase only the best parts of a destination, influencing their friends and followers, but they rarely present the full picture,” shares Ryan Prazeres, co-founder of OneBoard App, a travel platform.Unlike when you read a well-researched travel feature or watch a long-form vlog video, the short clips on Instagram do not highlight the not-so-green side of the story. For instance, a viral video may show you the breathtaking scenes from Dudhsagar Waterfalls in Goa with a train passing in the frame on the tracks above, but it may not necessarily tell you about the 30-minute rocky trek that you need to cross before you actually reach the waterfalls. If you are not someone who enjoys such treks or decide to go with your ageing parents, the whole experience may feel disappointing.When Gargy made a special trip to Serenity Beach in Pondicherry, drawn by countless posts of people posing on a rock bridge against the vast blue ocean, she expected a unique experience. Instead, she was met with a disappointing reality—a beach that was just a photo op rather than a paradise, littered and far from serene.Unrealistic expectationsInstagram also ruins plans by setting unrealistic expectations. The algorithm is likely to flood your feed with videos and posts about a certain place, setting a particular image in your mind. But when your holiday doesn’t turn out like that, you are likely to feel cheated and disappointed.“When I visited Kashi Vishwanath, I was eagerly looking forward to the surreal aarti and darshan I had seen in countless Instagram videos. But the reality was far from it. Despite arriving early in the morning, we were rushed through the temple, leaving us with only a fleeting glimpse of the divine,” shares Anupriya Khanna, a social media manager.Battling overtourismOvertourism is yet another way Instagram has been killing travel plans. When a destination goes viral, millions of travel enthusiasts watch those videos and rush to experience the hype for themselves. But upon arrival, they’re met with overwhelming crowds. Overbooked hotels, packed restaurants, hours spent in traffic, and skyrocketing prices soon follow, turning what was supposed to be a dream getaway into a logistical nightmare.“The platform's algorithm-driven curation tends to surface the same photogenic spots repeatedly, creating overtourism at specific locations while leaving equally beautiful alternatives undiscovered. I've seen clients reject perfectly wonderful accommodations because they lack that ‘Instagram aesthetic,’ even when they offer superior experiences and value,” shares Raj Kumar Varma, co-founder of Travjoy – a travel agency.Overcrowded ‘hidden gems’. You get the irony, right?So, what to do?There is no denying that Instagram can be a valuable tool for travel planning, but over-relying on it can lead to a disappointing experience. With the rise of travel influencers and the growing interest in content creation, it becomes increasingly difficult to dodge information overload and sift through incomplete or misleading details.But you can keep a few things in mind:
Use Instagram to discover new places and activities, but don’t rely solely on it.
If a particular place or experience interests you, ensure you do a deep dive and research further on other platforms. You can read blogs, check travel forums (like Reddit, TripAdvisor, or OneBoard), and watch YouTube vlogs to get a more realistic perspective.
Just because a place is trending doesn’t mean it is right for you. Choose destinations according to your personal preferences.
Search for honest reviews, behind-the-scenes stories, and unedited pictures to set accurate expectations before visiting a place.
Live in the moment. Don't let capturing content or getting that Insta-perfect shot control your mind.
Consider visiting an Instagram hotspot during off-peak hours or explore lesser-known alternatives nearby.
Lastly, no matter how much you plan, travel often comes with its share of unexpected situations. Be open to embracing spontaneity!

You come across a viral Reel featuring an unconventional destination with scenic views and an incredible experience, and you instantly share it with your friends or save it for later. That hidden gem stays etched in your mind and your ‘Saved’ folder. You’re either tempted to plan a trip right away or revisit those Reels when life allows you to travel next.Apart from introducing you to hidden destinations or viral wonders, Instagram also becomes an itinerary planner. All thanks to tools like hashtags, geo-tags, the search option, and, of course, the user-generated content that lets people gauge the aesthetic appeal of a location, find out about unmissable experiences at a destination, and visit places beyond the generic ‘touristy’ spots.For instance, when Gargy Sharma, a 20-year-old student from Delhi, was planning a trip to Pondicherry with her family, Instagram became her travel guide. She bookmarked almost six Instagram Reels and several ‘Pondicherry guide’ posts. Through them, she discovered a lot of unconventional places like a handmade paper workshop, sound healing, Serenity Beach, some exclusive shopping stores, cafes, and workshops for her two-day itinerary.But it is all great until it is not. What you have read so far is equivalent to the majority of travel content you consume on Instagram—just a highlight of the positive aspects. In reality, Instagram is also responsible for ruining a lot of travel plans. And it does so on multiple levels.

What you see is not always what you getWhat you see in a carefully created, heavily edited Reel is not always the entire picture. What you see is just the best bit of what you may experience. Those short clips don’t tell you about the ordeals you may face while reaching that particular point for an Insta-worthy moment.“There is an overdependency on Instagram for travel, especially among young travellers. Many plan their trips based on what they see on their feeds, instantly saving posts that catch their attention. While this is great for awareness, it often leads to disappointing experiences. People tend to showcase only the best parts of a destination, influencing their friends and followers, but they rarely present the full picture,” shares Ryan Prazeres, co-founder of OneBoard App, a travel platform.Unlike when you read a well-researched travel feature or watch a long-form vlog video, the short clips on Instagram do not highlight the not-so-green side of the story. For instance, a viral video may show you the breathtaking scenes from Dudhsagar Waterfalls in Goa with a train passing in the frame on the tracks above, but it may not necessarily tell you about the 30-minute rocky trek that you need to cross before you actually reach the waterfalls. If you are not someone who enjoys such treks or decide to go with your ageing parents, the whole experience may feel disappointing.When Gargy made a special trip to Serenity Beach in Pondicherry, drawn by countless posts of people posing on a rock bridge against the vast blue ocean, she expected a unique experience. Instead, she was met with a disappointing reality—a beach that was just a photo op rather than a paradise, littered and far from serene.Unrealistic expectationsInstagram also ruins plans by setting unrealistic expectations. The algorithm is likely to flood your feed with videos and posts about a certain place, setting a particular image in your mind. But when your holiday doesn’t turn out like that, you are likely to feel cheated and disappointed.“When I visited Kashi Vishwanath, I was eagerly looking forward to the surreal aarti and darshan I had seen in countless Instagram videos. But the reality was far from it. Despite arriving early in the morning, we were rushed through the temple, leaving us with only a fleeting glimpse of the divine,” shares Anupriya Khanna, a social media manager.Battling overtourismOvertourism is yet another way Instagram has been killing travel plans. When a destination goes viral, millions of travel enthusiasts watch those videos and rush to experience the hype for themselves. But upon arrival, they’re met with overwhelming crowds. Overbooked hotels, packed restaurants, hours spent in traffic, and skyrocketing prices soon follow, turning what was supposed to be a dream getaway into a logistical nightmare.“The platform's algorithm-driven curation tends to surface the same photogenic spots repeatedly, creating overtourism at specific locations while leaving equally beautiful alternatives undiscovered. I've seen clients reject perfectly wonderful accommodations because they lack that ‘Instagram aesthetic,’ even when they offer superior experiences and value,” shares Raj Kumar Varma, co-founder of Travjoy – a travel agency.Overcrowded ‘hidden gems’. You get the irony, right?So, what to do?There is no denying that Instagram can be a valuable tool for travel planning, but over-relying on it can lead to a disappointing experience. With the rise of travel influencers and the growing interest in content creation, it becomes increasingly difficult to dodge information overload and sift through incomplete or misleading details.But you can keep a few things in mind:
Use Instagram to discover new places and activities, but don’t rely solely on it.
If a particular place or experience interests you, ensure you do a deep dive and research further on other platforms. You can read blogs, check travel forums (like Reddit, TripAdvisor, or OneBoard), and watch YouTube vlogs to get a more realistic perspective.
Just because a place is trending doesn’t mean it is right for you. Choose destinations according to your personal preferences.
Search for honest reviews, behind-the-scenes stories, and unedited pictures to set accurate expectations before visiting a place.
Live in the moment. Don't let capturing content or getting that Insta-perfect shot control your mind.
Consider visiting an Instagram hotspot during off-peak hours or explore lesser-known alternatives nearby.
Lastly, no matter how much you plan, travel often comes with its share of unexpected situations. Be open to embracing spontaneity!

Yes, you read that right, and from what it appears, we’re drinking almost half of the world's supply. Not sure if that’s great news for your liver (doctors would agree), but when it comes to the Indian spirits market, the buzz is definitely exciting. Currently valued at around $52.5 billion, the industry is expected to reach $64 billion by 2028. And here’s the kicker—it’s not just whiskey at the forefront, as most might assume. The overall spirits market is booming. This is a lucrative space for both domestic and international brands, and from the looks of it, Indians are more than willing to experiment. Right now, there’s a growing demand for Indian craft brands and locally produced spirits because, well, no one is satisfied with the same old expensive few. People want variety, diverse flavour profiles, and, most importantly, all things exotic and refined and brands are playing their cards just right. While we’ve seen a surge in people’s love for locally made alcohol, another emerging trend that experts point out is the rise of country liquor finding a spot on local bar menus like Tongba (Sikkim, Darjeeling), Judima (Asaam), Sekmai Yu (Manipur) and many more. You know that famous 'Cocktail' song - ‘Chadi mujhe yaari teri aisi jaise daru desi’? Well, it seems like desi daru itself is getting a high of its own, making its way from rural corners to upscale drinking spaces.

advertisementSo, does this mean that these once-looked-down-upon concoctions are finally set for mainstream recognition?Desi daru love...ahem!Country liquor, or desi daru as it is widely known, was once a looked-down-upon choice of liquor (it still is, ngl). However, in the last couple of years, it has made a humble entry into local bars. For instance, Feni, a country liquor native to Goa made from fermented cashew, is found in almost every bar across the state. The reason? A rise in demand. So, does this mean that these once-looked-down-upon concoctions are finally set for mainstream recognition?Desi daru love...ahem! Country liquor, or desi daru as it is widely known, was once a looked-down-upon choice of liquor (it still is, ngl). However, in the last couple of years, it has made a humble entry into local bars. For instance, Feni, a country liquor native to Goa made from fermented cashew, is found in almost every bar across the state. The reason? A rise in demand. Nitin Tewari, a consultant mixologist who goes by the name ‘Mr Bartrender’ on Instagram, says, “Feni has a significant Portuguese influence, much like port wines, which were introduced to India centuries ago. However, for a long time, Indian consumers have had a tendency to look down on locally produced goods, favouring international products instead.” For the uninitiated, Feni or Urak (a drink made from the liquor) retails for as cheap as Rs 100 a glass while a port wine sells for Rs 200-250 onwards.

 However, he insists that perception has changed. “This perception has shifted in the last 15–20 years and there’s been a growing emphasis on Indian-made products, driven by campaigns like ‘Make in India’ and ‘Vocal for Local.’ Brands in various sectors - whether luxury goods, fabrics, clothing, or even watches - have started focusing on quality over quantity. This same idea has begun to reflect in the world of beverages as well.” Besides perception, Vikram Achanta, founder and CEO of Tulleeho and co-founder of 30BestBarsIndia and India Bartender Week gives it to education and advocacy that has brought about the change. “The surge in popularity of Indian spirits in 2024 can be wholly credited to education and advocacy. The Indian consumer is savvy and status-conscious about what’s in their glass—driven largely by brands and the cocktail culture making their efforts widely known.” “What began with a push on craft Indian spirits earlier in the year, has now turned the spotlight onto native Indian spirits. Bar menus across the country reflect this shift,” he adds. Mixologist Ami Shroff, who has also worked as a consultant for the Netflix documentary ‘Midnight Asia’, says that since people always tend to love all things exotic and unique in taste profiles, these country liquors (at least some) are striking a chord with drinkers. And, of course, affordability is a plus. “These spirits are affordable and locally available, so people are definitely interested in them. The main issue right now is accessibility. Once that’s sorted, more people will want to try them,” she says.Vikas Kumar, general manager at PCO, Delhi, pointed out that social media has played a huge role in the rising awareness of local spirits. While more people are now familiar with Feni, in terms of other indigenous drinks, none have quite reached the same level of popularity yet.He mentioned that Himachal also has various spirits made using cooked grains, including rice wine, but they haven’t gained as much recognition as Feni.Based on his travels, especially across Southeast Asia, he hasn’t seen any other Indian local spirits getting as much attention as Feni and Mahua.Meanwhile, Vikram Damodaran, chief innovation officer at Diageo India, believes that this is not just a passing trend.“This isn’t just a passing trend - it’s part of a larger shift in the industry toward provenance, craftsmanship, and a deeper appreciation for India’s rich distilling traditions.”advertisementDesi daru turns luxe?Whenever there is a demand, it’s only wise to capitalise on the opportunity, and some brands are doing just that. Kimberly Pereira, chief operating officer, Maya Pistola Agavepura, says, “What was once a niche movement is now becoming a defining aspect of cocktail culture, with spirits like Indian agave, Feni, Mahua; among others finding their way into menus, tastings, and paired food experiences. This growing interest is driven both by a more adventurous consumer base and the industry’s constant push for innovation.”She also believes that mixologists are at the forefront of this evolution and we agree.“As the first touchpoint for many consumers, they influence trends by experimenting with local ingredients, introducing new flavours, and shaping how these spirits are perceived. Their ability to bridge storytelling and education into cocktails has helped shift certain local spirits from being seen as ‘regional’ to being appreciated as authentic, premium and versatile,” she adds.Rupi Chinoy, director, South Seas Distilleries, believes that Mahura (Mahua) has a story worth telling – of a heritage spirit that was unfairly sidelined during the colonial era to make way for imported spirits. But they are on this journey to break the conventions one new launch at a time.

advertisement“With Six Brothers Mahura, India’s first luxury Mahura spirit, we’ve taken on the responsibility of reviving this forgotten treasure to allow people to rediscover a spirit deeply rooted in India’s history,” she says.

 



Six Brothers Mahura is made by first fermenting Mahura flowers and then applying sophisticated methods to add to that crisp, clean finish.
However, reviving Mahura isn’t just about bringing back a spirit; it’s about changing perceptions. “If you look at spirit categories from around the world, they also began as local spirits at first before becoming global spirit categories. This is the same path we envision for Mahura as well. It is our endeavour to help consumers see Mahura for what it truly is - a smooth, versatile spirit that reflects India’s rich distilling heritage,” she adds.Country liquor goes globalNot to mention, the appreciation for native Indian alcohol is now just not limited to the country but it is going places, if you are to believe Vikram Achanta.He points out that, not just in India but globally, there is a growing appreciation for indigenous spirits and heritage liquors. Tequila and Agave spirits from Mexico are gaining widespread recognition, Baijiu is experiencing a resurgence in China, and Sake and Soju are becoming increasingly popular in Japan. He affirms that these are no longer just niche trends but part of a larger movement toward embracing traditional and culturally rich beverages.

“In September 2024, I was invited to the Berlin Bar Convent for a workshop on Indian native spirits, where I had the opportunity to showcase leading Indian brands of Feni and Mahura (Mahua) to a global audience. There was a deep appreciation for these spirits, which have few parallels worldwide—whether it’s the earthy taste of a Dukshiri Feni or the silkiness of a Mahura—a good sign of global inclination,” says Achanta.The elephant in the roomWhile speaking to these industry experts, one most common issues that seems to have plagued (too strong but can’t agree more) most businesses is the licensing policy.Speaking to India Today Ami Shroff says, “One of the main concerns I’ve noticed is the whole licensing issue. Quite often, it’s unclear which brands or products have proper licensing and branding in place. There’s also the question of permissions required for bars to serve specific types of alcohol.”“Maybe that’s the reason why these spirits aren’t as mainstream as they could be. Many bartenders would love to experiment with these ingredients and appreciate these spirits. Guests, too, are now looking for unique things—something they haven’t tried before. Many have travelled the world and experienced a variety of spirits, so they’re always seeking something new. International spirits are widely available in India, but these local ones are still considered special, almost exotic,” she adds.Storytelling, strong branding, and compelling narratives are helping Indian spirits gain prominence and reach a broader audience beyond niche circles. However, there is still much to be done in terms of category creation and evangelism to truly establish their place in the global market.“What could ease the process is the smoother inter-state movement of these products, requiring the involvement of both the state governments as well as brand owners. While the potential of these spirits is extremely high, not just in India but on the global stage, it needs acceleration on the part of all stakeholders in order for them to reach the status and awareness they deserve,” says Achanta.Even though these traditional spirits have been around for ages, they've mostly stayed within their regions because of government restrictions and excise laws. Since each state has its own policies, local liquors like Chaang (Tibetian/Nepalese) or Apong (Arunachal Pradesh) are often limited to specific areas and technically can’t be sold outside their home state.But there’s a welcome change, say Nitin Tewari. “Take Feni, for example. It’s mostly from Goa and has been one of the few regional spirits slowly breaking through these restrictions. It was traditionally labelled as ""country liquor,"" meaning it could only be sold within the state where it was made. But now, there’s talk of changing that.""""In fact, I’ve heard that Feni might already be available in Delhi—or will be soon. Some brands, like Cazulo, are even making their way to international markets like London and the US. Ironically, though, they still struggle with inter-state sales within India because of regulatory barriers,"" he concludes.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 1, 2025Must Watch

There was a deep appreciation for these spirits, which have few parallels worldwide—whether it’s the earthy taste of a Dukshiri Feni or the silkiness of a Mahura—a good sign of global inclination,” says Achanta.The elephant in the roomWhile speaking to these industry experts, one most common issues that seems to have plagued (too strong but can’t agree more) most businesses is the licensing policy.Speaking to India Today Ami Shroff says, “One of the main concerns I’ve noticed is the whole licensing issue. Quite often, it’s unclear which brands or products have proper licensing and branding in place. There’s also the question of permissions required for bars to serve specific types of alcohol.”“Maybe that’s the reason why these spirits aren’t as mainstream as they could be. Many bartenders would love to experiment with these ingredients and appreciate these spirits. Guests, too, are now looking for unique things—something they haven’t tried before. Many have travelled the world and experienced a variety of spirits, so they’re always seeking something new. International spirits are widely available in India, but these local ones are still considered special, almost exotic,” she adds.Storytelling, strong branding, and compelling narratives are helping Indian spirits gain prominence and reach a broader audience beyond niche circles. However, there is still much to be done in terms of category creation and evangelism to truly establish their place in the global market.“What could ease the process is the smoother inter-state movement of these products, requiring the involvement of both the state governments as well as brand owners. While the potential of these spirits is extremely high, not just in India but on the global stage, it needs acceleration on the part of all stakeholders in order for them to reach the status and awareness they deserve,” says Achanta.Even though these traditional spirits have been around for ages, they've mostly stayed within their regions because of government restrictions and excise laws. Since each state has its own policies, local liquors like Chaang (Tibetian/Nepalese) or Apong (Arunachal Pradesh) are often limited to specific areas and technically can’t be sold outside their home state.But there’s a welcome change, say Nitin Tewari. “Take Feni, for example. It’s mostly from Goa and has been one of the few regional spirits slowly breaking through these restrictions. It was traditionally labelled as ""country liquor,"" meaning it could only be sold within the state where it was made. But now, there’s talk of changing that.""""In fact, I’ve heard that Feni might already be available in Delhi—or will be soon. Some brands, like Cazulo, are even making their way to international markets like London and the US.

 He mentioned that Himachal also has various spirits made using cooked grains, including rice wine, but they haven’t gained as much recognition as Feni.Based on his travels, especially across Southeast Asia, he hasn’t seen any other Indian local spirits getting as much attention as Feni and Mahua.Meanwhile, Vikram Damodaran, chief innovation officer at Diageo India, believes that this is not just a passing trend.“This isn’t just a passing trend - it’s part of a larger shift in the industry toward provenance, craftsmanship, and a deeper appreciation for India’s rich distilling traditions.”advertisementDesi daru turns luxe?Whenever there is a demand, it’s only wise to capitalise on the opportunity, and some brands are doing just that.

Their ability to bridge storytelling and education into cocktails has helped shift certain local spirits from being seen as ‘regional’ to being appreciated as authentic, premium and versatile,” she adds.Rupi Chinoy, director, South Seas Distilleries, believes that Mahura (Mahua) has a story worth telling – of a heritage spirit that was unfairly sidelined during the colonial era to make way for imported spirits.

He affirms that these are no longer just niche trends but part of a larger movement toward embracing traditional and culturally rich beverages.

f703d177-59ba-47aa-b486-6f02e5804ad0,Why some Indian parents are homeschooling their kidsHomeschooling is an alternative form of education where parents or guardians take direct responsibility for teaching their children at home instead of sending them to a traditional school.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/why-some-indian-parents-are-homeschooling-their-kids-2687164-2025-03-02,"Picture this: 'you’re a kid again. You wake up in the morning not to the sound of your parents screaming that you’re late for school, but simply when your body decides it’s time. No groggy struggle to drag yourself out of bed. No rushing to get ready. Instead, you wake up feeling rested, your circadian rhythm in charge. After waking up, you don’t have to force yourself through a rigid school routine. You might spend a couple of years studying intensively if needed, or you might start your day doing what you truly enjoy - playing sports, learning music, or painting. You learn throughout the day, with your parents as your first teachers. No lugging around heavy books and copies. No suffocating structure'. Sounds like a dream, right? Believe it or not, it’s a reality for many children, even in India, whose parents have chosen to teach them at home. Call it homeschooling or unschooling - whatever you prefer - but it is becoming an unconventional yet growing way for parents to educate their children, not just in science, maths, or English, but also in life itself. Take Urvashi Shah, a pregnancy and child sleep consultant and paediatric nutritionist from Gurugram, for instance. When Urvashi had her first daughter, she knew she didn’t want to follow the traditional schooling system. However, societal and work pressures crept in, and she eventually enrolled her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter in a nearby daycare and pre-school. Just five days in, she realised it wasn’t for her.

“My partner and I saw her transforming into a different person in just five days. The moment she entered the school premises, the first thing she noticed was children her age crying and feeling anxious about being separated from their loved ones,” says Urvashi. A post shared by Vishruti Shah | Conscious Parenting, Unschooling (@vishruti_joyes_parenting)
 “My partner and I saw her transforming into a different person in just five days. The moment she entered the school premises, the first thing she noticed was children her age crying and feeling anxious about being separated from their loved ones,” says Urvashi. “When a child at this age struggles to even pick up a chapaati properly, how can we expect them to handle such anxiety? Is this how schooling should begin? We didn’t think so,” she adds. For Sireen Ahmed, a freelance writer and small garment business owner from Metiabruz, and her husband, the experience was similar. When they decided to homeschool their daughter, they initially had doubts, but everything became clear during the school admission process. Sireen recalls that when she tried to ‘train’ her daughter for school admission and interviews, she saw her withdrawing. Before this, she had been learning everything organically. “Her enthusiasm was fading, and at that moment, I decided she wouldn’t go to school. I hadn’t planned for the future - it was an impulsive decision,” says Sireen. She adds that, over time, things worked out for her daughter, and now, at nine years old, she is ‘going strong’. For Iftekhar Ahsan and his wife Shaheera Bano, a couple from Kolkata, the journey was slightly different. They knew from the start that unschooling was their only option. Iftekhar shares that his wife was initially hesitant, but after meeting other parents who were doing the same, she was convinced that unschooling was the best choice for their children.How do children learn in homeschooling? Now, if you’re wondering how these kids actually learn? Well, the answer isn’t straightforward. Just like parenting, homeschooling and unschooling vary from family to family, depending on what and how parents want their children to learn. For instance, Iftekhar and Shaheera’s twins learn what they want, with no fixed curriculum. “Who teaches a child to walk? They learn by themselves. So, why should we put them into rigid grades?” says Iftekhar. Today, their 11-year-old twins learn English naturally through conversations with their family. In a now-viral Reel showcasing their ‘unschooling method’, Iftekhar explains that his children learn history through travel, while his son picked up maths by playing cricket and keeping track of scores.

 Beyond academics, they engage in various activities like learning Sufi music, painting, cooking, and more. Sireen also shares that her daughter also picked up English naturally by listening to conversations, just as she did with Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu. “I never formally taught her to read. I simply surrounded her with age-appropriate books and took her to children’s libraries. Eventually, she started recognising words on her own,” she says. For maths, she took a practical approach - sending her daughter shopping. Whether it was the supermarket or the local shop, real-world exposure became her learning ground. Recently, Sireen also enrolled in an abacus class. For Neha Sharma, a mother from Siliguri, the priorities are different. Since her son is just four-and-a-half years old, she doesn’t believe english and maths should be his main focus right now. “At this stage, we are concentrating on his behaviour and communication skills, how he speaks, his tone, and his choice of words,” she shares. Neha believes real-life experiences are the best teachers. “I take him with me wherever I go. He observes, asks questions, and I answer. That’s how he learns. For instance, last night, we had an earthquake and had to leave our building in the middle of the night. This morning, I told him about houses made of paper in Japan and showed him pictures on my phone. Tonight, I plan to teach him more about Japan,” she says.advertisementWhy unschooling?India Today spoke to several parents who homeschool their children to understand what led them to choose this unconventional path. While their reasons varied, the essence boiled down to a few key factors:
They didn’t want their children to be tied to a rigid schedule.
They wanted their kids to have the freedom to explore their interests beyond bookish knowledge.
For some, homeschooling proved to be a more affordable alternative. Others believed that the early years- crucial for brain development - should be shaped by them rather than an institution.
For Urvashi Shah, who has spent years studying child development as both a profession and a passion, the Montessori method resonated with her the most. This teaching approach encourages self-directed learning, hands-on activities, and collaborative play. She refers to multiple studies suggesting that a child’s first 4–5 years are foundational and shape them as young adults.Urvashi isn’t wrong.A February 2019 study found that a child’s developing brain is highly sensitive to environmental influences in the womb and early years. Several other studies reinforce how a child’s surroundings play a critical role in early development.advertisementFor Neha, the decision to homeschool was deeply personal—it was about opting out of the ‘rat race’.“I am fully capable of teaching my child, at least in the early years. When I look around, I see most adults doing something entirely different from what they studied. I am no exception - I studied Arts but work in the electrical industry. Now, I feel it would have been better to learn practical skills from my father than to spend years in school, college, and postgraduation,” she shares. For many, the shift towards homeschooling came after the pandemic.According to Divya Jain and Pooja Khurana, co-founders of The Class of One - a global online school providing structured homeschooling - the pandemic changed everything.

The duo also run traditional physical schools. However, when education moved online during lockdowns, they noticed students became more productive. This led them to establish a school where children never have to attend in person.Their target audience? Parents who are NRIs and want their children to receive an Indian education, parents with transferable jobs, and those whose children wish to focus on extracurricular activities more than conventional academics.Today, The Class of One has over 1,000 students, ranging from playschool to class 12, with a significant portion being Indian students. The school emphasises maintaining a child’s ‘happiness quotient’, instilling ‘morals and ethics’, and ensuring ‘physical fitness’, all within just 2–3 hours of daily schooling (yes, exams are still part of the system).The challenges of homeschoolingWhile homeschooling may sound like a dream for both parents and children, it comes with its own set of challenges.In today’s fast-paced world, families often struggle with both time and financial constraints. Not everyone has the flexibility to create a structured learning environment and dedicate sufficient time to their child’s education.Iftekhar points out that since homeschooling relies heavily on learning from one’s environment, children in less interactive surroundings - like modern metro cities with limited neighbourly interactions - may not benefit as much.Praneet Mungali, trustee and secretary, Sanskriti Group says that homeschooling can surely be an isolating experience for children. She highlights that while education is the foremost priority of a traditional school, children learn immensely from their peer groups, which reflects in growth of children’s emotional and social quotients.

“Homeschooling families do try to bridge this by enrolling their children in various extracurricular classes and activities. However, it is difficult to create a similar environment for a child, who in a traditional school, spends hours on end operating independently in the company of their peers versus short activity focused classes,” she adds. A spokesperson of Modern Public School agrees and adds that, even though homeschooling provides flexibility and personalised learning, traditional schooling offers a structured environment, social interaction, and holistic development through extracurricular activities and peer learning. “Schools foster teamwork, discipline, and real-world problem-solving skills, which are crucial for a child’s overall growth. Qualified educators bring subject expertise and diverse perspectives, ensuring a well-rounded education,” they said. Is homeschooling even legal in India?Long before modern schools, education in India was deeply personal, often beginning at home under the guidance of a guru. This system focused on more than just academics, fostering personal and spiritual growth. The gurukul model later introduced a communal learning approach, still centred on holistic development rather than rigid classroom instruction.

Legally, homeschooling is permissible in India. The Right to Education (RTE) Act of 2009 mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14 but does not explicitly state that education must take place in a conventional school setting.This allows parents to homeschool their children without violating any legal provisions. While India lacks a dedicated regulatory body for homeschooling, families can opt for distance learning programmes through institutions like the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) to obtain recognised certifications.Additionally, post-pandemic, the Ministry of Education launched ePathshala, an online learning platform offering digital resources.Ultimately, homeschooling is emerging as a new, unconventional method of education.

For Hollywood’s biggest night, the Academy Award-winning actress rocked a golden corset dress from Dolce & Gabbana. The sublime gold (quite close to the trending butter-yellow shade) dress was accentuated with glimmering rhinestones and crystal embellishments. She paired it with a matching shawl. The cynosure of Goldie Hawn’s Oscars look was the Sabyasachi necklace. She chose a diamond chain-link necklace accented with tourmalines and spinels from the designer’s eponymous high-end jewellery line.

 Sabyasachi is one of the most celebrated Indian designers, with a strong presence in the international landscape. Known for his ethereal wedding lehengas, the ace couturier is on a mission to build India’s first global luxury brand – the reason why lehengas took a backseat during his 25th anniversary show. His jewellery line continues to be instrumental in his vision. In the last few months, prominent international celebrities like Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez, Kate Hudson and Scarlett Johansson have worn exquisite jewels from his collection. As for Goldie Hawn, she completed her look with a diamond tennis bracelet. Black eyeliner, lipstick and subtle pink blush were her beauty picks. She styled her hair in curls with bangs covering her forehead The Oscars 2025 was a fashionable affair, with eminent names from the global film industry turning up in their sartorial best. Sparkle supremacy, bow details, metallic dresses, butter yellow, and statement men’s jewellery emerged as the major fashion trends.advertisementPublished By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Mar 3, 2025

Excessive caffeine intake (more than 400-600 mg daily) can interfere with iron absorption, leading to thinning bones, early ageing, and even anxiety and insomnia.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/food/story/who-should-not-have-coffee-2688300-2025-03-04,"“I need coffee, whatever form you’ve got. I haven’t had it all day. I’ll drink it, shoot it, eat it, snort it—whatever it takes.”
— Lorelai Gilmore If there’s one pop culture character who shares an unbreakable bond with coffee, it’s Lorelai Gilmore from Gilmore Girls. If you’ve watched the show, you know her love for coffee isn’t just a morning ritual; it’s a full-time commitment. So, when we ask who should not consume coffee, the answer is definitely not Lorelai Gilmore. She needs it for basic survival. And if you relate to Lorelai (whether for her questionable taste in life partners or her undying love for caffeine), just know, you’re in good company. But despite the claims that coffee (especially black) can be beneficial for your health, there are some people who should avoid coffee, as it can impact your health.  Now, before getting into that, let’s settle the longtime debate: Is coffee really bad for you? The never-ending debate India Today spoke to various experts and looked into various studies to figure out if and how exactly coffee is bad or good for you.  While coffee often gets a bad rap, experts believe it’s not the villain it’s made out to be. In fact, moderate coffee consumption can be a part of a healthy diet for most people. A study involving over 40,000 adults found that drinking coffee in the morning was associated with a 16% lower risk of dying from any cause and a 31% lower risk of cardiovascular disease over nearly a decade compared to non-coffee drinkers. 

 



Coffee might not be the villain. Photo: Unsplash
 Swatee Sandhan, senior dietician at Jupiter Hospital, Baner, Pune, says ""coffee contains antioxidants like phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may help protect against chronic conditions like diabetes, endometrial cancer, Parkinson’s disease, and even depression."" Mansi Gupta, dietician at Maianutritionn, adds that ""coffee is known to boost performance, energy levels, and stimulate the nervous system.""  So, if you’re reaching for your morning cup, it might actually be doing you some good.Who should avoid coffee? Not everyone should consume coffee. Certain people should limit or avoid coffee due to its effects on health. Dr Vikas Bharti, MD (Medicine), DNB (Medical Gastroenterology) at Ruby Hall Clinic, Hinjawadi, warns : 
Those with anxiety or insomnia may find that caffeine worsens their symptoms by increasing restlessness and interfering with sleep. 
Individuals with high blood pressure should be cautious, as coffee can cause temporary spikes in blood pressure levels.
Pregnant women are advised to limit caffeine intake, as excessive consumption may affect fetal development. 
Additionally, people with heart conditions or irregular heartbeats may experience palpitations due to caffeine. 
Those who are caffeine-sensitive or prone to migraines should also consider reducing or eliminating coffee from their diet.
Those struggling with poor gut health or digestive issues like IBS and IBD may also experience discomfort.
 And if you’re someone who gets jittery after a single espresso shot, it might be best to cut back.Side effects of coffee While it can be an energy booster, coffee can have side effects, esepcially if you’re overdoing it.  ""Excessive caffeine intake (more than 400-600 mg daily) can interfere with iron absorption, leading to thinning bones, early ageing, and even anxiety and insomnia,"" says Mansi.   Dr Bharti further explains that ""too much coffee can disrupt sleep, cause palpitations, and increase acid reflux."" Another issue? Dependency. If you can’t function without your daily dose, you might be facing caffeine withdrawal symptoms like headaches, fatigue, and irritability. 

 



Coffee does come with side effects. Photo: Unsplash
 Swatee says A single Arabica coffee bean contains about 6 milligrams of caffeine, and it is recommended that a single dose of caffeine doesn't exceed 200mg and daily usage is up to 400mg.Black coffee or milk - which one is better? Now, even after reading the side effects, you can't break up with coffee, and want to know which one is better, well, experts suggest that there’s no definitive answer to it - all depends on personal preference and dietary goals. Swatee explains that ""black coffee is low in calories, high in antioxidants, and delivers a stronger caffeine kick. If you love the pure, unadulterated flavour of coffee and want a calorie-conscious choice, black coffee is your go-to."" On the other hand, milk coffee offers a creamier texture and additional nutrients like calcium and protein, making it a good choice for those who need extra nutrition. Swatee also suggests that milk coffee is gentler on the stomach (if you’re not lactose intolerant, which most of us Indians are), as milk reduces coffee’s acidity.  However, Mansi Gupta warns that ""milk coffee can be high in calories and may not be suitable for those looking to lose weight or individuals with hormonal imbalances or dairy allergies."" At the end of the day, both are fine - as long as you’re not turning your coffee into a dessert loaded with sugar and whipped cream.Best time to consume coffee Timing is everything, even when it comes to coffee. Dr Bharti suggests that ""the best time for most people to consume coffee is between 9:30 am and 11:30 am, when cortisol levels start to dip, allowing caffeine to provide a sustained energy boost without overstimulating the body."" If you’re hitting the gym, having coffee 30–60 minutes before your workout can enhance endurance and performance. However, drinking coffee too early in the morning (right after waking up) might interfere with your body’s natural cortisol production, making it less effective. And here’s a tip - avoid coffee after 3 pm unless you enjoy staring at the ceiling at night, wondering why sleep refuses to come! Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 4, 2025

ab16232d-128b-47a0-b4a3-e8545504f24f,How to choose the perfect cheese for a health-conscious dietLove cheese but unsure if it should be part of your diet? Let experts help you decide.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/how-to-choose-the-perfect-cheese-mozzarella-cheddar-parmesan-for-a-health-conscious-weight-loss-diet-2688911-2025-03-04,"A large Margherita pizza with extra cheese? Yes, please because who can resist the delectable, gooey, milky goodness, right? Cheese is delicious, comforting, and sometimes downright irresistible. But if you're on a health-conscious journey, you might find yourself asking: Can I still eat cheese without sabotaging my goals? Well, we spoke to several experts who mentioned that cheese is a good source of protein, but it all depends on the kind we consume.What to look for when choosing cheese One thing that several experts agreed upon is that it is only wise to choose a particular kind of cheese after checking the labels. Dr Narendra K Shetty, chief wellness officer of Kshemavana (a naturopathy treatment centre), says, “We should look for the cholesterol and fat content on the labels, especially if a person is on a weight-loss journey, as well as the calcium and other vitamin levels, so that we can choose the best kind of product that suits our health goals."" ""We must also check the manufacturing and expiry dates, overall nutritional composition, serving size, daily values, and nutrient additives added to it for ideal portion control and the recommended daily allowance (RDA),” he adds.  Doctors suggest it is wise to stay off processed cheese and invest in good craft cheese, as it is healthier and devoid of emulsifiers, preservatives, and added salt. In fact, celebrities like Kareena Kapoor, who is known to follow a very health-conscious and mindful diet, love cheese—but only the craft variety. Mitushi Ajmera, nutritionist and senior master fitness trainer, recommends adding specific cheese to the diet with 2 per cent fat content. If such options aren't available, she suggests controlling portion size based on the amount of fat or calories the cheese contains—even if the label says high protein. “To calculate how much protein you're actually consuming, simply divide the number of calories per 100 grams by the grams of protein mentioned on the label. This will help you understand how many calories you're consuming to get one gram of protein, making it easier to track your intake,” she adds.Can cheese aid weight loss? To simply answer: yes, cheese can aid in weight loss as long as it is carefully selected. Dr Karthigai Selvi A, head of clinical nutrition and dietetics at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Kengeri, Bengaluru, explains, “The real secret to weight loss is choosing simple, unprocessed foods with lots of vegetables and fewer calories. Three servings of low-fat cheese with vegetables, required cereals, and reduced fat, combined with exercise, definitely aid weight loss.” Cheese is nutritious, but overindulging can add up to calories. Experts suggest consuming approximately 1-3 servings per day to enjoy the benefits without the extra weight. However, the ideal portion depends on your daily calorie intake and health goals.The best cheeses for a health-conscious diet If you want to enjoy cheese without feeling guilty, here are some great options:
Cottage Cheese – The simplest of them all and one that is most easily available in India. Cottage cheese is high in protein, low in fat, and great for muscle building.
Mozzarella – Finally, some good news for pizza lovers (or maybe not, considering the refined flour in the crust)! Mozzarella has a lower sodium content than other cheeses and is a good source of calcium.
Feta Cheese – It contains beneficial probiotics and pairs well with salads, but its sodium content could be a little high.
Ricotta Cheese – Light and creamy, with a lower fat content when made from skim milk.
Who should stay away from cheese? The experts mention that no one really needs to completely avoid cheese. However, aspects like processing, sodium levels, and fat content should be kept in mind before making a purchase. Additionally, people with certain conditions, such as IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), should try to avoid it as much as possible. “Someone with severe heart issues who is trying to monitor blood pressure should probably limit or omit cheese to be on the safer side due to its high sodium and saturated fat content. Pregnant women are advised not to eat soft cheeses, as there is a small chance that unpasteurised varieties may contain Listeria. Additionally, people with lactose intolerance should monitor their cheese consumption, as excessive intake can worsen symptoms related to lactose intolerance,” says Dr Selvi A.Smart ways to incorporate cheese into your daily diet “One of the best ways to incorporate cheese into your diet is by including it as a snack,” says Mitushi Ajmera. “Usually, most people consume three meals that are mostly balanced in carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. However, snack time is when people often struggle and end up choosing unhealthy junk food. This is where good-quality cheese can be a game-changer, as it not only satisfies hunger but also meets your protein and calcium needs,” she adds. Besides, you can always add cheese to your salads—it’s one of the most delectable ways to relish it. Alternatively, you can include it in your meals. Make a nice cottage cheese (paneer) bhurji and have it with roti, or try some ricotta to make your pasta both delicious and healthy.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 4, 2025Must Watch

Feeling stuck in the office? Tired of the same 9-to-5 routine? Done waiting for the weekend to roll around every week? Gen Z, as always, has a peppy solution - micro-retirement. Unlike traditional retirement, where you work until 60 (or whatever your personal goal is) and then retire for good, micro-retirement is about taking intentional, short breaks from work. These breaks can last a few weeks, a few months, or even a year - entirely based on your choice. Is micro-retirement a new concept? Not really. Sabbaticals have always been a part of work culture. But what’s changing is the perception. Unlike sabbaticals, which are rarely taken (often only in health emergencies), micro-retirement is emerging as a frequent practice among young professionals who prioritise work-life balance. It may mean taking three one-month-long breaks in a year or taking a year off after working consecutively for two to three years. It is meant to be accessible, unlike ultimate retirement, where your professional journey finally concludes. Some use these breaks... err... micro-retirement to travel, while others use them to simply unwind, pursue their hobbies, or just rest. Even experts agree that micro-retirement has several benefits - think improved mental health, increased productivity, better work-life balance, and personal growth. It even helps keep burnout at bay. Micro-retirement sounds like a dream, but not everyone can afford it. Before informing your HR manager about your retirement plans (even if it’s a micro-retirement), you need to have a few things in place - most importantly, your finances. (Unless, of course, you have strong financial backing from your family!)Financing your micro retirement Financial planning can make or break your micro-retirement plans. The last thing you want is to worry about running out of money while trying to unwind from work. ""Retiring (whether temporarily or permanently) means losing a steady income, which makes financial planning essential. Your expenses won’t stop; you'll still need to cover housing, transportation, food, internet, and countless other costs. Before taking a career break, it’s crucial to have a solid financial plan in place,"" says Gaurav Goel, founder-director of Fynocrat Technologies. It becomes imperative to assess the following factors: Savings and investments: Do you have enough capital to sustain your lifestyle? Passive income sources: This could be from fixed deposits, dividends, rental properties, or other investments. Expense management: Calculate your expected expenses and ensure your finances are sufficient for the duration of your retirement or break. ""If you are taking a break for three months, you should have enough money for six months' expenses. You never know the uncertainties of life,"" adds Dipika Singh, a learning facilitator and content creator. If you don’t yet have the money to fuel your micro-retirement dreams, here are some financial planning tips to help you get there: ""Building a micro-retirement fund with at least 6–12 months' worth of savings in a liquid, low-risk investment ensures financial security during the break. Parking these funds in a high-yield savings account, liquid mutual funds, or fixed deposits can offer both stability and easy access when needed,"" says CA (Dr) Suresh Surana.

 Be it through a freelance gig, a hobby project, or rental income, some money should keep coming in. CA Surana suggests adding passive income sources by exploring alternative income streams like rental income, dividends, or part-time freelancing to help cover a portion of expenses. Experts say having at least one source of passive income can make the break more sustainable, reducing the need to rely entirely on savings. Ensure you have health insurance. ""Losing employer-provided insurance during a career break can pose a risk, so securing a reliable health insurance plan in advance is crucial,"" suggests CA Surana. If you have active debts or credit card loans, clearing them beforehand is a better idea to prevent financial strain. ""For long-term loans like home or education loans, it is important to have a structured repayment plan to avoid financial stress during the micro-retirement period."" While some organisations may allow micro-retirement plans for their employees, especially if they are infrequent, many are still resistant to the idea. In such cases, it's essential to have a career re-entry plan. Re-entering the job market becomes easier if you invest time during your break in upskilling and set aside extra funds to support yourself in case job hunting takes longer than expected. Hear it from someone who took a micro-retirement (and shared the experience on Reddit): ""The way to go about this is to have your expenses planned and saved up (including your investments) for 8–12 months, have courses for upskilling, and have a plan for what you want to do. In my last mini-retirement/work break, I worked on a creative project and was quite happy. It also helps reset your health, gives you better sleep and relationships. I also freelanced a little bit in both those stints."" Lastly, consider taking professional financial advice to plan your micro-retirement better.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Mar 5, 2025ALSO READ |  How you can build a travel fund for that dream foreign trip

Even books, while Millennials were growing up, did not help the idea of love beyond a happy marriage. However, the good thing is that narrative is evolving eventually. Marriage, once seen as the grand finale of love stories, is now just one of many possible endings. A recent Tinder in-app survey among women aged 18-25 in India reveals a growing preference for meaningful connections, safety, and authenticity over traditional dating norms. Additionally, 29% of young women now appreciate the reduced pressure of chasing a ‘happily ever after'. The findings also shed light on how modern women are reshaping the idea of dating, and men, you just need to follow cues.Respect over outdated gender roles As daters, women’s idea of a perfect date has evolved. Gone are the days when a bunch of roses or a box of chocolates was enough. What they seek now is reliability over symbolic gestures. According to the survey, 51% of women believe that keeping promises like showing up on time or following through on a call defines modern chivalry. Things like who pays the dinner bill or other outdated notions of chivalry no longer concern women. What they crave is consistency in actions, and the survey reveals that 36% of women prioritise genuine engagement over gender-based expectations. Growing up, many of us had a ‘type ’. The 'man of my dreams' should be 6'2"", rich, good-looking, and charming. These were often materialistic preferences, shaped by societal conditioning that made women believe these traits were all that mattered. Turns out, they’re not. Perhaps that’s why the survey reveals that 31% of women expect basic respect from all genders, while only a small percentage (23%) consider traditional norms, like men paying for the first date, essential.Safety as a standard, not an afterthought Safety is a priority and that is non-negotiable. While online dating has become commonplace, things like catfishing have become too, so ladies are making sure the safety standards are met. More than half (53%) of the respondents said that they demand clear profile pictures, while over one-third reject shirtless mirror selfies. The survey further reveals that 44% of women prioritised verified profiles. So, if you are a man reading this right now, you know what not to do. Additionally, suppose you are in the habit of sending inappropriate messages to your prospective date. In that case, you have lost the deal, my boy, as more than half of the respondents said that they would unmatch someone who sends disrespectful texts.Compatibility is king...no queen! As mentioned above, what was once a gold standard for dating, like looks, money, height, etc, (yes, that mattered and you better don’t disagree), is slowly tumbling down from a woman’s list of priorities. 47% of women using Tinder said that they find incomplete profiles a major turnoff as they can assess whether they share common interests, values, and compatibility with a potential match. Also, the full bios help one assess shared hobbies, passion and interests. And for the boys out there, if you are lacking creativity and are sticking to the cliches to attract women on dating platforms, you are in for a big disappointment as 41% of women dislike bios filled with cliches, according to the survey.

For me, growing up in a household in the Northeast, my fondest memory is of seeing my mother using skincare - not the hoity-toity kind that came in a glass bottle with an ingredient name that not everyone can pronounce. Rather, she would use natural ingredients, anything at her disposal. But coming from a household in Bengal, if there’s one thing that remained in her pouch every day, it was, of course, Boroline, an antiseptic cream that she still uses for everything. From dry skin to cuts, wounds, and infections, it was a staple. She would heat the cream and use it to heal wounds, and on normal days, Boroline was used for slugging - way before it became cool.

 



Boroline is India's first antiseptic. Photo: Boroline
 For many households (like ours), Boroline is not just a cream; it is a household legend. No matter the problem, Boroline was the answer. It had this thick, balmy texture that took its sweet time to sink in, but when it did, it worked like magic. Even today, in an age where skincare is all about elaborate routines and high-end serums, Boroline has held its ground. There’s a certain nostalgia attached to it, the trademark green tube, the comforting medicinal scent, and the way our grandmothers, mothers, and now we, still reach for it instinctively. It doesn’t promise glass skin or overnight transformations, but what it does, it does well.How the green tube made history Inspired by the Swadeshi movement, Boroline was introduced in 1929 by Gour Mohun Dutta as more than just a skincare product - it was a quiet act of defiance against British economic exploitation. Gour Mohun Dutta, a wealthy businessman from Kolkata, who decided to join the Swadeshi Movement by producing an indigenous alternative to foreign skincare products. He believed that the best way to help the country was to contribute to its economic self-sufficiency. Instead of relying on expensive imported creams, he chose to manufacture Indian products. Despite the challenges, he successfully created Boroline in Calcutta in 1929, making it the first indigenous skincare product of the movement.

 



Due to wartime (World War II) scarcity, Boroline had to be packed in available containers and not in the packaging prevalent then. Photo: Boroline
 To establish a strong brand identity, he designed a logo featuring an elephant, the symbol of Lord Ganesha, which signifies stability and strength for many Indians. Even today, Boroline is fondly known as ‘Hatiwala cream’ (cream with the elephant logo) in rural India. By the way, the name ""Boroline"" is derived from ""boro"" (from boric acid) and ""oline"" (from the Latin 'oleum', meaning oil). On August 15, 1947, to celebrate independence, GD Pharmaceuticals (the company that owns Boroline) distributed 1,00,000 free tubes of the cream, cementing its place as a household essential.Why Boroline has stood the test of time One of the reasons that Boroline is so famous is because of its simple ingredients and its benefits it offers, making it even experts' favourite. Dr Deepali Bhardwaj, a dermatologist from Delhi, praises Boroline, highlighting that it is free from fragrance, colour, chemicals, parabens, making it a true moisturiser enriched with ceramides. “That’s why it has been used by all of us,” she adds.

Think about how often you’ve believed a Reel or YouTube Shorts where an influencer claims a certain product has been in their family for generations. Data also shows that at least 44 per cent of Gen Z want 'natural' products. Boroline has found its way into the same narrative, being marketed as a timeless, affordable, and effective solution for hyperpigmentation and acne scars. But Even though Dr Bhardwaj states that the cream has no major side effects, it may not suit everyone:Some individuals may be allergic to ingredients like boric acid or lanolin, which could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.Boroline is rich in oils and waxes, making it unsuitable for oily skin types. It may exacerbate acne or pimples caused by excessive oil secretion. So, while Boroline might not be a one-size-fits-all miracle cream, its affordability, effectiveness, and nostalgic charm continue to make it a beloved skincare staple.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 6, 2025

“Use of earphones causes damage to inner ear hair cells, resulting in irreversible nerve damage. The early sign of hearing loss is usually a ringing sensation in the ear called tinnitus or the inability to distinguish subtle sounds or words during conversation. Long-term use of earphones results in permanent hearing loss,” says Dr Satish Nair, skull base surgeon and ENT - head and neck surgeon, Manipal Hospital Old Airport Road, Bengaluru.Not cleaning the earbuds is another significant cause of several problems.“Using earbuds for longer durations, combined with sweating, leads to inflammation and infection of the ear canal, resulting in severe pain, swelling, and pus discharge from the ear that needs medical treatment,” adds Dr Nair.“If the earbuds are not properly hygienically cleaned, then again, they will be a source of infection, and that infection may even travel to the tympanic membrane and cause further damage,” says Dr Ajay Swaroop, senior consultant and advisor, ENT, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.Dr Kalpana Nagpal, ENT, head and neck surgery, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, suggests cleaning the earbuds regularly, especially after workout sessions.“Dirty earbuds introduce harmful bacteria into your ear canal.

Clean them using a small brush, ir a mini vacuum for suction. After cleaning, clean them with a disinfectant wipe to remove earwax, dirt, and other particles.You can also simply remove the silicone tips from the earphones and let them soak in warm, soapy water for around 30 minutes. After cleaning, use a soft cloth or cotton swab to remove any leftover earwax or debris, and then allow the silicone tips to dry fully by air.Just be cautious not to allow any liquid to enter the openings.

You can even use a lens cleaner with a microfibre cloth (yup, the one you use to clean your glasses).Make it a habit to check your devices frequently for dirt. Clean them using a small brush, ir a mini vacuum for suction. After cleaning, clean them with a disinfectant wipe to remove earwax, dirt, and other particles.You can also simply remove the silicone tips from the earphones and let them soak in warm, soapy water for around 30 minutes. After cleaning, use a soft cloth or cotton swab to remove any leftover earwax or debris, and then allow the silicone tips to dry fully by air.Just be cautious not to allow any liquid to enter the openings. Avoid completely immersing your earbuds or earphones in water.Also, avoid using sharp objects such as safety pins, pens, or utensils to clean the speaker or microphone mesh.Oh, and don’t forget to clean the case from the inside.

abcc1039-e2c6-4a68-b7a3-665b4cc85206,"Rise in fatty liver cases among young Indians. Can it be reversed?A recent study found that 80 per cent of IT professionals in India have fatty liver, due to work pressure, a sedentary lifestyle and poor lifestyle choices.  ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/rise-in-fatty-liver-cases-among-young-indians-can-it-be-reversed-2689986-2025-03-07,"For Ashna Gupta, a 24-year-old working professional from Delhi NCR, the discovery of her fatty liver happened by accident. She had visited the gynaecologist due to acute pain in her lower abdomen, which was caused by a UTI. However, during the scan, which only confirmed that she had PCOD (another rising concern amongst women), it also revealed that she had Grade 1 fatty liver. “I have a comparatively better lifestyle, with only occasional cheat meals and alcohol,” she says, still surprised by the diagnosis. What shocked her even more was the doctor’s casual response. “It’s nothing to panic about; in fact, it’s very common. I see countless patients with fatty liver almost every day, especially youngsters,” the doctor says. Ashna’s story is not unique. Many young people today are finding out they have fatty liver purely by accident. But even after the diagnosis, most end up brushing it aside until it’s too late. Both experts and data also agree with this trend. Dr Vishal Khurana, director of gastroenterology and hepatobiliary sciences at Metro Hospital, Faridabad, says, “Fatty liver cases are often diagnosed incidentally during routine health screenings, with 30-40 per cent of the population showing some form of fatty liver.” A recent study found that 80 per cent of IT professionals in India have fatty liver due to work pressure, a sedentary lifestyle, and poor lifestyle choices. Another study in 2021, a meta-analysis of 62 data sets from 50 studies on NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, found that 38 per cent of adults in India have NAFLD, with Chandigarh having the largest share at 53.5 per cent. The prevalence among children was 35 per cent.Understanding fatty liver, its stages, and NAFLD Before getting into the nitty-gritty of liver disease and why there is a sudden jump in cases, let us explain the difference between these diseases, as they might be confusing. Fatty liver disease is a condition where excessive fat builds up in the liver, and it can be classified into two types: alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is more common amongst youngsters like Ashna, particularly those with metabolic disorders. Dr Sanjiv Saigal, principal director and head of liver transplant and biliary sciences, gastroenterology, hepatology and endoscopy at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, explains that fatty liver progresses in stages, ""Fatty liver itself is not very dangerous, but it moves through four stages: simple fatty liver, inflammation (steatohepatitis), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. If caught early, fatty liver can be reversed, but once cirrhosis develops, the damage is permanent."" NAFLD is strongly linked to metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.Why the rise? The increasing number of fatty liver cases is directly linked to lifestyle changes and dietary habits. Dr Pavan Hanchanale, hepatologist, liver transplant physician and gastroenterologist at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, attributes this rise to ""sedentary habits, excessive consumption of fatty and fast food, and increasing alcohol intake."" “This is completely because of a major change in lifestyle, which has impacted the health of these youngsters. They are not exercising. The tendency to stay indoors, be on computers, play on iPads, or study indoors has had a major impact. The usual practice of children going out and playing for hours in the fields has really reduced,” says Dr Saigal.

 Secondly, Dr Saigal mentions how food patterns have changed from traditional home-cooked meals to online delivery. “Having junk food and snacks at midnight while studying, just sitting at computers, and frequently ordering foodthese habits lead to a high intake of junk food, which is generally not of good quality in terms of nutritional content. These dietary habits, which include more fat, more trans fats, and fewer healthy nutrients, are concerning. If I had to name a few, I would say pizza, burgers, and so on. These things are really impacting children's lives,” he adds. He further adds that routine health check-ups have played a role in identifying more cases, stating, ""More patients are being diagnosed during routine screenings, revealing that fatty liver is a growing concern across all age groups."" Dr Khurana says that metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes have surged, contributing to the growing prevalence of NAFLD.Are there other reasons too? Several factors contribute to fatty liver, with lifestyle being a key driver, according to experts. Dr Khurana lists other common causes, such as:Obesity and metabolic syndromeHigh sugar and processed food intakeAlcohol consumptionCertain medications and underlying conditions like hepatitis C and autoimmune diseases Dr Hanchanale agrees and adds that genetics can be a contributing factor, stating, ""Certain genes, such as PNPLA3, increase susceptibility to fatty liver, particularly in Asian populations.""advertisementHow to know if you have a fatty liver?Fatty liver disease is often called a ""silent disease"" for a reason. The disease may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. However, as it progresses, certain signs may indicate liver trouble. Some common symptoms, according to Nausheen Shaikh, nutritionist and diet consultant at Alyve Health, include:Persistent fatigue and weaknessPain or discomfort in the upper right abdomenUnexplained weight lossSwelling in the abdomen (ascites)Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes in severe cases)Dark urine and pale stoolsMoreover, according to Nausheen, there are various tests one can take to understand the severity of their liver disease:Liver function tests (LFTs): Measures liver enzyme levels to assess liver healthUltrasound or FibroScan: Helps detect fat accumulation and liver stiffnessBlood tests (fasting blood sugar, lipid profile, HbA1c): Identifies risk factors like insulin resistance and high cholesterolMRI or CT scan: Provides detailed imaging for more accurate diagnosis in advanced casesCan fatty liver really be reversed?Fatty liver can be reversed if detected early. Dr Saigal reassures, ""It goes through four stages (as we told you). It starts with fatty liver, then a state of hepatitis, which is inflammation, then fibrosis, and finally cirrhosis.advertisementHowever, he mentions that if you have cirrhosis, the damage is typically permanent.Now, if you’ve spotted it in the early stages (before cirrhosis), Dr Vishal Khurana and Dr Pavan Hanchanale recommend the following lifestyle modifications to help reverse the damage done to your liver:Dietary changesReduce junk food and processed foods high in trans fats.Eat a balanced diet rich in proteins, fibre, and healthy fats.Cut down on refined carbohydrates and sugary beverages.Increase intake of green vegetables and whole grains.Stay hydrated and avoid alcohol.Physical activityEngage in at least 30-45 minutes of exercise five days a week.

 



Working out (4-5 times a week) can help reverse fatty livers. Photo: Pexels
Include a mix of aerobic activities like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.Strength training can also help manage weight and metabolism.Weight managementLosing even 3-5% of body weight can significantly reduce liver fat.A 10% reduction in body weight can help reverse inflammation and early fibrosis.Other lifestyle modificationsAvoid reusing cooking oils, as they generate harmful trans fats.Manage conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension.Some medications may help, but they are only effective alongside lifestyle changes.Drinking black coffee in moderation has been shown to support liver health.""Have a fit liver, not a fatty liver. The best treatment is prevention through a healthy lifestyle,"" Dr Saigal concludes.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 7, 2025Tune InTrending Reel

For this gown, we wanted to depict the life cycle of a garden. The beginning of the gown represents wilted flowers, but in nature, when a flower dies, it’s not the end; it’s a new beginning. This idea was depicted using golden tones that gradually transitioned into vibrant floral elements.”

 Additionally, he explained how the dress incorporated sustainability, which was also Isha’s vision. “The pallu was multiple feet long, designed to resemble a floating river with flowers drifting along its surface. In fact, the flowers used in the embroidery were samples collected over a span of ten years, making the gown a tribute to time itself. The creation involved extensive recycling and repurposing, aligning with the sustainability vision that Isha also wanted to incorporate.”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 7, 2025Trending Reel

Here's howSooraj Cherukat, aka Hanumankind, is a rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor from Kerala, and he recently released his new song, 'Run It Up'.

The song made waves not just in India but also helped put the Indian rap scene on the global map. Produced by Kalmi, Big Dawgs gained significant international traction, reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Global 200 charts and the Billboard Hot 100. Now, if you loved Big Dawgs, chances are pretty high that you’ll be hooked on another banger from the duo -Run It Up. One thing both videos have in common is their powerful representation of India and its culture. In Big Dawgs, the singer showcases the “Well of Death”, a stunt that almost every Indian has likely seen at fairs (Melas). But in this latest track, he takes it up a notch, featuring at least seven traditional Indian folk performances in the video already going viral just hours after its release. Let’s have a look at them, one by one:1. Kalaripayattu: The oldest form of martial art in the world Kalaripayattu, often called Kalari, is one of the oldest martial arts in the world, with roots stretching back over 3,000 years. Developed in Kerala, it combines strikes, kicks, grappling, weaponry, and even healing techniques. This art form was once essential for warriors and kings, especially during the time of the Chera and Chola dynasties, when battles demanded both physical prowess and agility. The training is rigorous, with students starting as young as seven, learning to wield swords, spears, and even the deadly urumi (a flexible whip-like sword).

advertisementDespite its decline during British rule, Kalari has made a strong comeback in modern times, finding a place in cinema, choreography, and self-defence techniques.The movements are often compared to a beautifully choreographed dance, but don’t be fooled - every move is designed to strike with precision. Today, it is kept alive by dedicated schools across Kerala, and if you ever get the chance, watching a live demonstration is nothing short of mesmerising.2. Mardani Khel, the fearless fighter of the MarathasEven though the video features a woman performing martial arts, the Mardani Khel, is a martial that quite literally translates to “manly game"" or ""war game"".The art is as fierce as the warriors who wield it. Developed in Maharashtra, this weapon-based combat form was integral to the Marathas, especially under the leadership of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

The training involves mastery of swords, lathis (long sticks), daggers, and even the unique weapon called ‘bhala’ (a type of spear).Even today, the art is kept alive as they are taught in ""talims"" (training centers) across Maharashtra, popularising the martial art legacy of Shivaji Maharaj. It is also said that Rani Tarabai, a Maratha queen, encouraged the training of women in Mardani Khel, and the art form is now practiced by both men and women.3. Gatka: The Sikh martial artGatka isn’t just a martial art - it’s a spectacle of strength, speed, and devotion. Originating from Punjab, this Sikh combat form was developed by the warriors of Guru Gobind Singh’s time. It involves an astonishing display of swordplay, sticks, shields, and even flexible weapons like the chakram.

Thang-Ta: From the land of the NortheastThang-ta is a traditional martial art from Manipur, which literally translates to ‘sword and spear’. It is a martial art that once defined the warriors of Manipur.Dating back to the days of kings and tribal wars, this combat form isn’t just about brute strength, it is a mix of precision, agility, and breathtaking fluidity.Our talented Thang-Ta athletes continue to amaze with their skill, dedication, and unwavering determination in mastering this incredible martial art.A heartfelt salute to Thang-Ta Maheikol, Yumnam Huidrom, Imphal, Manipur (Headquarters of Thang-Ta Martial Arts). #ThangTa pic.twitter.com/AL250RgoCkTHANG-TA ASSOCIATION, HARYANA (@ttah0001) January 26, 2025advertisementPractitioners master the art of sword fighting, spear combat, with some claiming that here, the spear is mightier than the sword. During colonial rule, Thang-Ta was nearly lost as the British banned its practice, fearing its potential in uprisings. However, today, the art is thought in parts of Manipur, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir.Fun fact: Until 1985, the knowledge of thang-ta was not shared with non-Meitei people.5. Chendamelam - the beats of KeralaApart from the martial arts - ‘Run It Up’ also features Kerala’s rhythm - Chendamelam.This powerful percussion ensemble, featuring the ‘chenda’ (a cylindrical drum), is an inseparable part of temple festivals, processions, and cultural celebrations in Kerala. The beats start slow, gradually building into an electrifying crescendo.Traditionally performed in religious settings, Chendamelam is more than just music; it is a spiritual call, an invitation to feel the divine through sound whose origins trace back centuries.advertisement6. Parai and Urumi, the drums that echo through Tamil NaduAnother musical instrument that has traditionally been part of Tamil Nadu, that was featured in the song were parai and urumi. The parai, one of the oldest drums in India, was historically played on everything from battlefields to village gatherings. Its loud, commanding beats were used to rally troops, announce important events, and even perform rituals.The urumi, on the other hand, is a unique hourglass-shaped drum that produces a deep, almost hypnotic sound, often played during religious festivals and folk performances.Over time, these instruments have become powerful symbols of resistance and tradition. Once associated with lower castes and marginalised communities, parai drumming has seen a revival, breaking barriers and reclaiming its place in mainstream culture through videos like this one.7. TheyyamNow, receiving mainstream attention thanks to movies like 'Kantara'; Hanumankind also showcases Theyyam, a ritualistic art, where the performer transforms into a living deity. With elaborate face paint, towering headdresses, and intense drumming, the dancer embodies spirits and gods, offering blessings and even answering prayers.

There are no brownie points for guessing that the way they travel has also changed. For years, travel was considered a luxury or a family-centered activity, especially for women, as most of them were at the mercy of the men of the house - first their father, then their husband, and eventually their son. However, a new report by Aquaterra Adventures, based on a survey of 10,000 women from tier 1 and 2 cities, reveals a remarkable shift in the way women travel and the things that are now non-negotiable for them.The rise of adventure travel The survey reveals that women in their mid-forties are increasingly exploring adventure travel. Sounds unbelievable, right? But here’s what Vaibhav Kala, founder of Aquaterra Adventures India Pvt Ltd, has to say: ""Over the last 30 years in adventure travel, 50% are women solo travellers seeking the outdoors to feel liberated. At this age, most of them have completed their family duties, with children out of school, and they feel the need to explore and get out of their comfort zones."" Adventure travel is unlike any other travel experience, it allows a person to experience peace, solitude, and personal growth. Many women see adventure travel as a way to challenge their status quo and step out of their comfort zones.Why women are travelling in their 40s Call it society’s double standards or whatever you may, but for some women, life truly begins after they have completed the “duties” expected of them. According to the survey, most women in India begin travelling extensively between the ages of 45-55. The main reasons? They now have more time, a higher disposable income, and fewer family responsibilities. With kids all grown up and fewer household obligations, many women feel liberated to travel solo or with their girl gang.
 


Safety first, but companionship matters too For solo female travellers, safety is the top priority. However, the survey also highlights that most solo women travellers prefer travelling with other like-minded women, reinforcing the importance of companionship and shared experiences.
 


Travel for healing and introspection Whether you’re an avid traveller or not, you’ve probably heard about the healing power of travel. For many women, especially those dealing with personal loss or life changes like divorce, travel - and particularly, adventure travel becomes a way to disconnect, reflect, and gain clarity.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 9, 2025Must Watch

We don’t forget them or the past that they once shared, even if they’ve moved on and are happily married to their respective partners. But Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship expert, called their gleeful, chatty exchange a “masterclass in maturity and professionalism.” Not all encounters with your ex (even if accidental) have to be dramatic or unpleasant. The mere thought of running into a bad ex can make some people jittery. But as we know, the world is a small place. It could be at a mutual friend’s wedding or an unexpected run-in at a shopping mall - life has a way of surprising you with an ex when you least expect it. You may want to take some cues from Shahid and Kareena - at least their latest public interaction. “It (the meetup) showed that they had fully resolved their past, with no resentment or toxicity. There was no visible discomfort, no forced cordiality - just two people talking, smiling, and laughing,” says Ruchi. “It was a great reminder for people who badmouth their exes, turn away, or act distant. You don’t have to do any of that. You can simply be nice, say hello, and keep the interaction brief, simple, and graceful - for both them and yourself,” she adds. Time doesn’t always heal a broken heart. Running into an ex can feel awkward and may even bring back some unpleasant memories. So, how do you handle an unexpected encounter with your ex? Well, hear it from experts. Stay calm Coming across your ex-partner can be hailed as the ultimate test of maturity - this tells a lot about whether you have moved on and how well you’ve resolved your own issues. It shouldn’t feel like a task if you both don’t have unresolved emotions towards each other. But in case you do feel angry, hurt or nostalgic -stay calm (or at least pretend). “While your emotions may flare up, do your best not to have a visible reaction. Take a few deep breaths to collect yourself before proceeding. Any drama could make the situation worse,” says Dr Shailesh Jha, consultant psychiatrist at Indraprastha Apollo Saarthak Mental Health Services. “The key is to remain absolutely calm and handle the moment with grace. You don’t have to be overly excited or make any grand gestures - a polite nod, a smile, or a simple ‘Hi, how are you?’ is sufficient,” says Ruuh. Avoid long conversation Don't get into long conversations with them unless you share that dynamic. Polite, basic, and short is a good way to operate in such situations. Most importantly, don’t bring up the past. “Avoid bringing up past issues, accusations, or emphasising how much either of you has moved on, unless the topic comes up organically. Gauge the situation: in what circumstances are you meeting? Are they receptive? Are they comfortable around you? If you sense discomfort, it’s best to exit gracefully,” suggests Ruuh. Maintain distance Try and maintain a subtle distance. If you want to ignore the person entirely - do so gracefully. “But if you come face-to-face, try to maintain a neutral, composed expression rather than reacting too strongly in either direction. Staying respectful and graceful isn’t just about them - it’s about you, too.” If an exchange happens, that’s fine. Otherwise, just exist in that space with them gracefully - that’s the essence of handling the situation well. Focus on yourself Remain focused on yourself, your current companion, and your friends. Remind yourself of the growth you’ve experienced and the positive changes you’ve made since the breakup. Minimise contact with your ex and prioritise those who support you now. If you are not with anyone else, you can also find a positive distraction - be it food, photos, or your saree’s pallu. Have an exit plan In case you know you will be bumping into your ex at an event: Have an exit plan and excuse yourself politely if the situation gets stressful.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Mar 10, 2025ALSO READ |  Single, not lonely!

8ff13227-b1c0-4c14-b32b-336290588269,Can drinkable sunscreen replace your regular one?Drinkable sunscreen is an oral supplement designed to provide internal sun protection by helping the body combat UV damage from within.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/can-drinkable-sunscreen-replace-your-regular-one-2691690-2025-03-11,"Out of all the skincare products on the market, if there’s one that has undergone intensive clinical studies to prove its effectiveness, it has to be sunscreen. Its importance in your skincare routine is paramount; not only does it protect your skin from sunburn, but it also plays a significant role in helping to prevent skin cancer. Yet, despite all the evidence, there are still people who fail to acknowledge the value of sunscreen. They often end up promoting alternative products that claim to offer sun protection in one form or another. One such product, although it doesn’t explicitly promise to replace your sunscreen (as stated in the fine print of some websites), is marketed as a ‘drinkable sunscreen’. This kind of branding can easily mislead consumers into thinking it's a suitable substitute for topical sunscreen, but it's not.

 Now, even though drinkable sunscreen is not a new concept; it has quite an interesting history in the US that involves a lawsuit (we’ll delve into this later), but it is making an entrance in the Indian market with the same name but with different ingredients. What we have analysed is that these products contain tons of antioxidants and vitamins that might offer some way of protection from the effects of the sun but cannot protect your body from UV rays, no matter what the claim is. Let’s dive into this further, but before that, we asked the experts what they think is drinkable sunscreen.What are drinkable sunscreens, though? As the name suggests, it’s a sunscreen that you can consume directly from the tube. Just kidding. Don’t gross yourself out just yet. Well, jokes apart, according to Dr Vinata Shetty, a dermatologist and medical advisor at Kaya Limited, drinkable sunscreen is an oral supplement designed to provide internal sun protection by helping the body combat UV damage from within. These sunscreens are in two forms: tablet ones, which are called oral sunscreen and the ingredients are not so naturale, and the other one, which is available in sachets and has all natural ingredients, is generally marketed as drinkable sunscreen. Here we are talking about the latter.

 



Drinkable sunscreen is not a new concept. Photo: Setu.in
 “These supplements are typically marketed as an alternative or complement to traditional topical sunscreens. They contain antioxidants, botanical extracts, and sometimes UV-filtering compounds that claim to neutralise free radicals and reduce skin damage caused by sun exposure,” says Dr Shetty. Dr Niketa Sonavane, a celebrity dermatologist and founder of Ambrosia Aesthetics, Mumbai, agrees. She says that these products generally contain a combination of antioxidants that work from within to reduce the negative effects of UV rays on your skin.What can drinkable sunscreen do? Dr Sonavane says that even though these supplements don’t prevent UV rays from reaching your skin like topical sunscreens do, they contain ingredients that help buffer the damage caused by sun exposure. Unlike topical sunscreens that create a physical or chemical barrier on the skin, drinkable sunscreens work at a cellular level by enhancing the body's defence mechanisms against UV radiation, explains Dr Shetty. These sunscreens are priced as high as Rs 2,000-3,000 for 30 sachets. But the question of the hour is...Do they even work? Dr Shetty says, while drinkable sunscreen supplements may provide some degree of protection, they are not a substitute for traditional sunscreen. “Clinical studies suggest that certain antioxidants and plant-derived compounds can help mitigate UV-induced skin damage, but they do not offer the same level of direct protection as SPF-based creams or lotions,” says Dr Shetty. Dr Sonavane says that drinkable sunscreen does not stop UV rays from reaching our skin. “They do not prevent tanning, sunburn, or skin cancer the way a broad-spectrum sunscreen does. So, if you’re relying only on drinkable sunscreen, you’re leaving your skin unprotected,” she adds. Dr Sonavane says to understand the drinkable sunscreen, we can think of it as a good diet for your skin i.e, eating healthily can improve our skin’s health, but it doesn’t mean you can skip your moisturiser or sunscreen. You still need that external layer of protection. Now, to understand if a product is even effective, we need to look at the ingredients. So to find out its effectiveness, that’s what we did. We analysed a few famous drinkable sunscreen brands, including ‘India’s first drinkable sunscreen’. Here’s what we found: Most drinkable sunscreens contain antioxidants, vitamins, and plant extracts that help fight free radical damage from the sun. Here's a breakdown:advertisementPolypodium Leucotomos: A fern extract that has the ability to reduce sun damage as well as inflammation. I often recommend it to patients who have hyperpigmentation.Astaxanthin:  A powerful antioxidant found in algae that protects skin cells from oxidative stress. It also helps with anti-ageing.Lycopene: Found in tomatoes, this antioxidant has been shown to offer mild UV protection over time.Vitamin C and E: These work together to repair sun damage and boost skin’s natural healing process.Beta Carotene: A form of vitamin A that strengthens the skin’s defence against UV rays.Dr Sonavane says that even though all these ingredients might help to boost our skin health, help our skin recover faster from sun exposure and reduce chances of long-term damage, but, they do not work instantly; the effect builds up over time.Dermatologists emphasise that oral sunscreens can be used as an additional layer of sun defence rather than a primary protective measure.For complete sun protection, remember, topical sunscreens, protective clothing, and sun-safe behaviours (such as seeking shade and wearing hats) are important. So, even if you’re thinking of adding drinkable sunscreen to your routine, experts suggest that you should first speak to experts.The curious case of world’s first ‘drinkable sunscreen’When Dr Ben Johnson, a former (his licence was revoked) aesthetic physician and skincare entrepreneur, announced the launch of 'drinkable sunscreen', the skincare world did a collective double-take.advertisementMarketed under his brand, Osmosis Skincare, this ‘UV Neutraliser Harmonised Water’ claimed to protect users from UVA and UVB rays for up to three hours with just a few drops in water. Bold claim? Absolutely. Backed by peer-reviewed science? Erm... not quite.As the product gained buzz, so did the scepticism.The brand claimed the water contained vibrational frequencies that somehow cancelled out UV radiation. That’s right, no chemicals, no SPF, just ""harmonised"" water with what they call 24K gold. If you’re wondering what that 'harmonised water' means, you’re not alone. According to the company, it is essentially a form of water that has higher frequency or vibration, whatever. But not so soon after, in March 2017, the Iowa Attorney General filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against Johnson's companies (yes, he had two companies that sold things like harmonised water for mosquito bites), alleging that the product's promises were not only unsubstantiated but also potentially dangerous.The lawsuit highlighted that relying on such a product could give consumers a false sense of security, leading them to forego proven sun protection methods. Facing mounting legal pressure, Johnson's company settled with the Iowa Attorney General in October 2017 for USD 70,000 but did not admit any wrongdoing.Now, even though in India we don’t have any brand like Dr Johnson's, oops, sorry, Johnson’s brand’s drinkable sunscreen, the case does serve as a warning for us, to look at the ingredient list before reaching out for such products and instead stick to expert's trusted products.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 11, 2025Must Watch

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/food/story/cockroach-milk-the-superfood-you-never-saw-coming-glbs-2692221-2025-03-11,"The term superfood is commonly used in health and fitness to describe nutrient-rich foods. Common examples include leafy vegetables, berries, and nuts, which are known for their high levels of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Such foods enhance general health when added to a healthy diet. Cockroach Milk A Surprising New Contender Recent scientific research has found an unexpected new addition to the superfood group cockroach milk. It may sound bizarre, but scientists have discovered that milk from the Pacific beetle cockroach (Diploptera punctata) is potentially three times more nutritious than cow's milk. This cockroach species produces a nutrient-rich milky substabce to nourish its young ones. Scientists believe that this liquid contains proteins, fat, and sugar, thus is one of the most nutrition-dense naturally occurring substances identified until now. Given its nutrition content, researchers believe that it could play a role in future food technology. What Does Research Say? A 2016 study, published in the Journal of the International Union of Crystallography, investigated this peculiar milk-like substance. Scientists discovered that when young cockroaches ingested it, the material crystallized within their stomachs. According to a report in The Independent, this milk has three times the calories of buffalo milk, which was once thought to be the most calorie-dense mammalian milk. It is also full of proteins, amino acids, and good sugars, all of which are vital for cell repair and growth. Can Humans Eat Cockroach Milk? Despite its remarkable nutritional profile, cockroach milk is not yet attainable for human consumption. The most significant hurdle lies in its production, as extracting milk from cockroaches is an elaborate and labor-intensive process. Like all superfoods, cockroach milk should be viewed as a supplement. While further research is needed, this research could open the way for sustainable and nutritious food options in the future.Published By: Rivanshi RakhraiPublished On: Mar 11, 2025

But do you think these changes could have an impact, whether positive or negative, on society?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/will-the-surge-in-divorces-and-single-living-reshape-indian-society-2692247-2025-03-12,"The way we look at relationships has evolved. There was a time when marriage was the ultimate commitment, and people looked down upon individuals who sought divorce for any reason (domestic abuse, mental torture, infidelity). Of course, the idea of a man or woman choosing not to marry was equally blasphemous. But things are changing for the better.Shifting values, growing individualism, and economic factors are transforming the way Indians approach relationships. Divorce rates are rising, more individuals are now open to the idea of leading a single life, and DINK (Double Income, No Kids) couples are on the rise.And these, mind you, are not just whimsical notions we have strong data to prove it. For the longest time, India had one of the lowest divorce rates in the world, at just 1% (not something to be proud of, and you know why). However, last year, a Moneycontrol analysis of data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey revealed that Indians are getting divorced more now than they did seven years ago, and the proportion of divorced or separated women in rural areas is also on the rise.In fact, according to a study conducted by Bumble, a dating app, about 81% of Indian women prefer living a single life.Another study by Investopedia suggests that around 65% of newly married Indian couples don't wish to have a child.So, you see how marriage as an institution has transformed. The meaning of relationships, marriage, and children is now up for debate. But do you think these changes could have an impact, whether positive or negative, on society?What explains the rise in divorce rates in India?There are several reasons for the rise, but the main one has to be better financial independence.Gayatri Sapru, CEO and founder of Folk Frequency (cultural strategy consultancy), highlights the evolving gender dynamics at play.""Women initiate divorces in around 70% of cases globally, and India is no different. Financial independence has given them the power to leave unhappy marriages, and the societal pressure to marry young is reducing. Parents are equipping daughters with education and skills so they can support themselves if needed,"" she notes.Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing, emphasises the role of changing priorities.""Marriage is no longer about duty; it is about mutual respect and personal growth. Many couples struggle with emotional intimacy, exacerbated by digital distractions. If a marriage becomes stifling or toxic, people are increasingly open to ending it rather than enduring it.""Moreover, the new generation wants to break free from the shackles of the old mentality, where ""what society will think"" comes first, rather than an individual's personal well-being.Dr Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based psychologist and marriage counsellor, says, “Millennials and Gen Z prioritise personal well-being, career goals, and emotional wellness before committing to marriage. Marriage is now seen as just one aspect of life rather than a necessity. People are delaying marriage to focus on their careers, with many choosing to marry in their late 30s. Independence is valued more than ever, with fewer individuals willing to compromise for familial or societal expectations.”The conscious choice of staying singleAyee haaye, you are still single at 30? This would be the common reaction of aunties and uncles to individuals who were “unfortunate” enough not to find a suitor before what society deemed the perfect marriageable age. Being single was once an embarrassment, a taboo and it was taken for granted that a bachelor or spinster was either unfortunate or lonely. However, the narrative is slowly but steadily changing.For some, singlehood is a way of escaping rigid societal expectations. ""It’s not about rejecting love or companionship, but about rejecting the toxic structures that often come with them,"" says Tugnait. ""It allows people to reclaim time, energy, and mental space without the pressures of traditional roles.""Moreover, Dr Khanna adds that singlehood is now seen as a path to empowerment. ""Many people, especially millennials and Gen Z, are delaying or even rejecting marriage in favour of personal growth, financial independence, and career ambitions.""The long-term effect on societySimantini Ghosh, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Ashoka University, mentions a possible shift in birth rates over the next few years, though nothing majorly significant.She believes that over the next two decades, romantic relationships will be further re-envisioned, with the proliferation of dating apps, a rise in situationships, and speed dating shooting into prominence, particularly among people currently in their 20s and 30s. Emotional unavailability, too, will become more common.“Increasingly, people will perhaps seek more instant gratification and refuse the work and time it takes to build a deeper bond. However, this trend is mostly true for a young, urban, upper-middle-class, educated India living in tier 1 and 2 cities. I don't foresee any large-scale shifts in relationship patterns in the greater part of the country,” she adds.Positive or negative effect?While Prof. Ghosh mentions that ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ are highly subjective terms, she also predicts a future that may feel lonely.Prof. Ghosh further states that while we may see more loneliness, alienation, and promiscuity going against the collectivistic nature of Indian culture at the same time, people no longer want to live a lie.“I do foresee nuclear families becoming more common, and single parenthood gaining more acceptance in society, along with non-traditional forms of parenting and child-rearing, especially in urban metros.”“It is only an audacious hope that society becomes more accepting of plural and non-traditional families, treating children adopted into same-sex parents' households with equal acceptance as they would children from traditional families. Particularly in the context of India beyond metros, I see a lot of loneliness for the elderly as younger generations move to cities in search of livelihoods,” she adds.Is India heading toward an individualistic society?An individualistic society (US, Sweden) is one where personal independence, self-reliance, and individual goals are prioritised over collective or group interests, in India heading toward one? Prof. Ghosh feels the answer is subjective.She believes the answer depends on several factors, including where a person lives, their cultural background, their connection to indigenous roots, and their social strata. Given India's ongoing urbanisation, Prof. Ghosh suggests that people are likely to become more individualistic. However, with only 30% of the population living in cities, the majority, 70%, still remains outside urban influence.“The Indian society is not a monolithic, homogeneous entity, never has been. All I think is that complex cultures evolve in unlikely ways, influenced by market forces, politics, and natural resource changes. These will continue to drive changes in how people behave within relationships in the future,” she concludes.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 12, 2025Trending Reel

Prof. Ghosh feels the answer is subjective.She believes the answer depends on several factors, including where a person lives, their cultural background, their connection to indigenous roots, and their social strata. Given India's ongoing urbanisation, Prof. Ghosh suggests that people are likely to become more individualistic. However, with only 30% of the population living in cities, the majority, 70%, still remains outside urban influence.“The Indian society is not a monolithic, homogeneous entity, never has been.

advertisement Shifting values, growing individualism, and economic factors are transforming the way Indians approach relationships. Divorce rates are rising, more individuals are now open to the idea of leading a single life, and DINK (Double Income, No Kids) couples are on the rise.And these, mind you, are not just whimsical notions we have strong data to prove it.

This would be the common reaction of aunties and uncles to individuals who were “unfortunate” enough not to find a suitor before what society deemed the perfect marriageable age. Being single was once an embarrassment, a taboo and it was taken for granted that a bachelor or spinster was either unfortunate or lonely. However, the narrative is slowly but steadily changing.For some, singlehood is a way of escaping rigid societal expectations. ""It’s not about rejecting love or companionship, but about rejecting the toxic structures that often come with them,"" says Tugnait. ""It allows people to reclaim time, energy, and mental space without the pressures of traditional roles.""Moreover, Dr Khanna adds that singlehood is now seen as a path to empowerment. ""Many people, especially millennials and Gen Z, are delaying or even rejecting marriage in favour of personal growth, financial independence, and career ambitions.""The long-term effect on societySimantini Ghosh, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Ashoka University, mentions a possible shift in birth rates over the next few years, though nothing majorly significant.She believes that over the next two decades, romantic relationships will be further re-envisioned, with the proliferation of dating apps, a rise in situationships, and speed dating shooting into prominence, particularly among people currently in their 20s and 30s. Emotional unavailability, too, will become more common.“Increasingly, people will perhaps seek more instant gratification and refuse the work and time it takes to build a deeper bond. However, this trend is mostly true for a young, urban, upper-middle-class, educated India living in tier 1 and 2 cities. I don't foresee any large-scale shifts in relationship patterns in the greater part of the country,” she adds.Positive or negative effect?While Prof. Ghosh mentions that ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ are highly subjective terms, she also predicts a future that may feel lonely.Prof. Ghosh further states that while we may see more loneliness, alienation, and promiscuity going against the collectivistic nature of Indian culture at the same time, people no longer want to live a lie.“I do foresee nuclear families becoming more common, and single parenthood gaining more acceptance in society, along with non-traditional forms of parenting and child-rearing, especially in urban metros.”“It is only an audacious hope that society becomes more accepting of plural and non-traditional families, treating children adopted into same-sex parents' households with equal acceptance as they would children from traditional families. Particularly in the context of India beyond metros, I see a lot of loneliness for the elderly as younger generations move to cities in search of livelihoods,” she adds.Is India heading toward an individualistic society?An individualistic society (US, Sweden) is one where personal independence, self-reliance, and individual goals are prioritised over collective or group interests, in India heading toward one? Prof. Ghosh feels the answer is subjective.She believes the answer depends on several factors, including where a person lives, their cultural background, their connection to indigenous roots, and their social strata. Given India's ongoing urbanisation, Prof. Ghosh suggests that people are likely to become more individualistic. However, with only 30% of the population living in cities, the majority, 70%, still remains outside urban influence.“The Indian society is not a monolithic, homogeneous entity, never has been. All I think is that complex cultures evolve in unlikely ways, influenced by market forces, politics, and natural resource changes. These will continue to drive changes in how people behave within relationships in the future,” she concludes.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 12, 2025Trending Reel

I don't foresee any large-scale shifts in relationship patterns in the greater part of the country,” she adds.Positive or negative effect?While Prof. Ghosh mentions that ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ are highly subjective terms, she also predicts a future that may feel lonely.Prof. Ghosh further states that while we may see more loneliness, alienation, and promiscuity going against the collectivistic nature of Indian culture at the same time, people no longer want to live a lie.“I do foresee nuclear families becoming more common, and single parenthood gaining more acceptance in society, along with non-traditional forms of parenting and child-rearing, especially in urban metros.”“It is only an audacious hope that society becomes more accepting of plural and non-traditional families, treating children adopted into same-sex parents' households with equal acceptance as they would children from traditional families. Particularly in the context of India beyond metros, I see a lot of loneliness for the elderly as younger generations move to cities in search of livelihoods,” she adds.Is India heading toward an individualistic society?An individualistic society (US, Sweden) is one where personal independence, self-reliance, and individual goals are prioritised over collective or group interests, in India heading toward one? Prof. Ghosh feels the answer is subjective.She believes the answer depends on several factors, including where a person lives, their cultural background, their connection to indigenous roots, and their social strata. Given India's ongoing urbanisation, Prof. Ghosh suggests that people are likely to become more individualistic. However, with only 30% of the population living in cities, the majority, 70%, still remains outside urban influence.“The Indian society is not a monolithic, homogeneous entity, never has been. All I think is that complex cultures evolve in unlikely ways, influenced by market forces, politics, and natural resource changes. These will continue to drive changes in how people behave within relationships in the future,” she concludes.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 12, 2025Trending Reel

It is a mindful approach to skincare that focuses on doing less, not more.Now, you might wonder if you really need it or if you should go ahead and use the bunch of skincare products you hoarded from the last ‘big’ sale! The answer? Let the experts decode and decide for you.What is a skin reset?Think of a skin reset as a detox for your face. ""A skin reset is about stripping things back to the basics - just a gentle cleanser, a solid moisturiser, and SPF - so your skin can breathe, repair, and reset,"" explains Malvika Jain, founder and CEO of Sereko.More than dermatologists, young women these days rely on influencers for their daily dose of skincare advice, which often leads to disastrous effects on the skin. A one-size-fits-all approach is anything but helpful when it comes to skincare.Overuse of skincare products, especially actives like retinol, AHAs, and BHAs, can weaken the skin barrier, leading to inflammation, sensitivity, and breakouts. A reset allows your skin to breathe with the most minimal and basic ingredients, making it suitable for every skin type. It’s about letting the skin heal naturally.Skin reset vs. skin fasting: What’s the difference?Though they sound quite similar, these skincare approaches have distinct differences.Dr Kashish Kalra, dermatologist and HOD at Max Hospital, points out that skin fasting is a short-term break (about a week), while a skin reset is a more structured process lasting 6-8 weeks to fully restore skin health.Skin reset: You cut back to the essentials - cleanser, moisturiser, and SPF - but still provide hydration and protection to maintain a healthy barrier.Skin fasting: A more extreme approach where you completely stop using all skincare products, even moisturisers. While some believe it allows the skin to ""breathe,"" experts caution that it can backfire, causing dryness, irritation, and breakouts.How do you know if your skin needs a reset?Just like any other organ, when your skin needs help, it sends out signals - your cue to take action.“If you’re dealing with constant breakouts, irritation, or dryness, no matter what products you use, it might be time for a skin reset,” says Malvika Jain.“If your usual products suddenly start stinging or burning, your skin barrier might be compromised due to overuse of actives. Over-exfoliation and excessive cleansing can strip your skin, making it tight, rough, and prone to peeling. If your skin constantly looks inflamed, your routine might be too harsh or overloaded. Sometimes, too many products can lead to clogged pores, inflammation, or even a damaged microbiome. These are signs that your skin needs a reset to help restore balance,” she adds.How to do it correctlyDr. Kalra suggests that if someone wants to reset their skin, they should stop using any active skincare products, such as vitamin C, retinol, AHAs, and BHAs. Additionally, they should:Use a mild cleanser and a moisturiser, ideally one that contains ceramides and hyaluronic acid.Use a physical sunscreen and avoid chemical sunscreens that contain additional active ingredients, such as vitamin C.Stick to this minimal routine for at least 6-8 weeks to allow a full skin cycle (30-40 days) to complete.Reintroduce products gradually, starting with a light antioxidant serum such as vitamin C.Observe how the skin responds before adding new products.Once your skin feels healthy and free of irritation, you can end the reset and gradually return to your regular skincare regimen. However, if needed, always consult a dermatologist before making significant changes to your routine.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 13, 2025

A one-size-fits-all approach is anything but helpful when it comes to skincare.Overuse of skincare products, especially actives like retinol, AHAs, and BHAs, can weaken the skin barrier, leading to inflammation, sensitivity, and breakouts. A reset allows your skin to breathe with the most minimal and basic ingredients, making it suitable for every skin type. It’s about letting the skin heal naturally.Skin reset vs. skin fasting: What’s the difference?Though they sound quite similar, these skincare approaches have distinct differences.Dr Kashish Kalra, dermatologist and HOD at Max Hospital, points out that skin fasting is a short-term break (about a week), while a skin reset is a more structured process lasting 6-8 weeks to fully restore skin health.Skin reset: You cut back to the essentials - cleanser, moisturiser, and SPF - but still provide hydration and protection to maintain a healthy barrier.Skin fasting: A more extreme approach where you completely stop using all skincare products, even moisturisers. While some believe it allows the skin to ""breathe,"" experts caution that it can backfire, causing dryness, irritation, and breakouts.How do you know if your skin needs a reset?Just like any other organ, when your skin needs help, it sends out signals - your cue to take action.“If you’re dealing with constant breakouts, irritation, or dryness, no matter what products you use, it might be time for a skin reset,” says Malvika Jain.“If your usual products suddenly start stinging or burning, your skin barrier might be compromised due to overuse of actives. Over-exfoliation and excessive cleansing can strip your skin, making it tight, rough, and prone to peeling. If your skin constantly looks inflamed, your routine might be too harsh or overloaded. Sometimes, too many products can lead to clogged pores, inflammation, or even a damaged microbiome. These are signs that your skin needs a reset to help restore balance,” she adds.How to do it correctlyDr. Kalra suggests that if someone wants to reset their skin, they should stop using any active skincare products, such as vitamin C, retinol, AHAs, and BHAs. Additionally, they should:Use a mild cleanser and a moisturiser, ideally one that contains ceramides and hyaluronic acid.Use a physical sunscreen and avoid chemical sunscreens that contain additional active ingredients, such as vitamin C.Stick to this minimal routine for at least 6-8 weeks to allow a full skin cycle (30-40 days) to complete.Reintroduce products gradually, starting with a light antioxidant serum such as vitamin C.Observe how the skin responds before adding new products.Once your skin feels healthy and free of irritation, you can end the reset and gradually return to your regular skincare regimen. However, if needed, always consult a dermatologist before making significant changes to your routine.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 13, 2025

View this post on Instagram           A post shared by (@lefleur.clay) A post shared by (@lefleur.clay) According to a local Thai press, by 2022, his business had grown to around 14 million USD. Considering the inhaler retails for just Rs 60-70 in Thailand, that’s lakhs of bottles sold. Today, however, various companies are selling this viral inhaler at a much higher price. Keng grew up in the Talat Phlu area of Bangkok, near Wat Sra Kaew in Thonburi. He was one of six children in a struggling family his father was a taxi driver, his mother managed the home, and the living space was tight. His journey with the inhaler began (20 years ago) when he came across a recipe in a newspaper, which he adapted into his own formula. He started selling it at nearby petrol stations. After years of trial, error, and tweaking the recipe based on customer feedback, the current version was born. The key ingredients include:Menthol (provides a cooling sensation, clears nasal passages, and gives that “wake-up” effect)CamphorEucalyptus oilBorneol These ingredients can slightly stimulate the nervous system, helping you feel more alert. While it’s not chemically addictive, it can easily become a psychological crutch, especially during travel, work, or periods of stress. So, while this green bottle might feel like a magical pick-me-up when you’re feeling low, if you find yourself reaching for it every other hour, you might just be a little hooked. Btw, it is also available on e-commerce websites like Amazon (we are not sure about its authenticity, tho).Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 13, 2025Must Watch

Corning originally was named for the corn kernel-size pellets of salt used to preserve meat in times before refrigeration, but the method today is used to permeate food with flavor. For a vegetable-forward take on the classic boiled dinner, we submerge a whole head of cauliflower in a spice-infused brine for several hours, allowing thorough absorption. Salt also weakens the cellular walls of the vegetable by drawing moisture out of them, rendering the vegetable more tender. To ensure the brine reaches into the dense core, we use a paring knife to pierce into the stem end before dropping the head into the hot liquid. After removing it and patting it dry, into the oven it goes. To finish, a mixture of butter and whole-grain mustard is slathered on the brined vegetable before it’s coated with dill and panko breadcrumbs and returned to the oven until the surface is nicely browned. Every bit of the cauliflower ends up deliciously seasoned, and its meaty yet tender texture is complemented by the crispness of the breadcrumb crust. Cut into wedges for serving, the cauliflower makes a fine vegetarian main or side. Roasted “Corned” CauliflowerStart to finish: 1 hour (25 minutes active), plus cooling and brining Servings: 4 Ingredients:4 bay leaves 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons caraway seeds 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds 1 teaspoon black peppercorns teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon white sugar Kosher salt 2-pound head cauliflower, trimmed, core pierced several times with a paring knife (see headnote) 2 tablespoons salted butter, room temperature 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill, divided cup panko breadcrumbs 2 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil Directions: In a large saucepan over medium-low, toast the bay, coriander, caraway, mustard seeds, peppercorns and pepper flakes, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 2 quarts water, the sugar and 3 tablespoons salt; bring to a boil over medium-high. Carefully add the cauliflower, stem side down, then cover and turn off the heat. The cauliflower will float; it’s fine if the top of the head is not submerged. Let cool until barely warm, then refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours. When you are ready to cook the cauliflower, heat the oven to 425F with a rack in the middle position. Remove the cauliflower from the brine and thoroughly pat it dry. Place it stem side down on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until lightly browned and a skewer inserted all the way through the head and into the core meets some resistance, 40 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the butter, mustard and 1 tablespoon dill. In another small bowl, combine the panko, oil and remaining 1 tablespoon dill; stir until the breadcrumbs are evenly moistened. When the cauliflower is done, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Brush the butter mixture evenly over the entire head, then apply the panko mixture in an even layer, lightly pressing so it adheres. Return to the oven and roast until the coating is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Using a wide metal spatula, transfer the cauliflower to a cutting board. Cut the head into wedges for serving.Published By: Rivanshi RakhraiPublished On: Mar 14, 2025

The survey has found that more than 57% of corporate men suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, a crucial nutrient for energy and brain function. The study analysed data from around 4,400 individuals (3,338 men and 1,059 women), all urban corporate employees. Even among women, nearly 50% exhibit deficient levels. ButWhy is vitamin B12 deficiency so common among corporate professionals? It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that for most of us, our work has gained prevalence over everything else. With demanding schedules, erratic eating habits, and high stress levels, corporate professionals often overlook essential nutrition - until the symptoms start. Inadequate dietary intake is one of the main causes behind the rise in vitamin B12 deficiency among men and women. Besides, dietitian Vidhi Chawla, founder of Fisico Diet and Aesthetic Clinic, points out that vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, making vegetarians particularly vulnerable. Additionally, Dr Archana Batra, a dietitian and certified diabetes educator, highlights that lifestyle changes, including frequent consumption of over-processed foods, alcohol, and excess caffeine, significantly reduce B12 absorption. Furthermore, heightened stress levels among corporate employees lead to increased cortisol production, which depletes B12 reserves in the body.Early signs of vitamin B12 deficiency In case you did not know vitamin B12 is important for neurological function and energy metabolism, its deficiency often goes unnoticed until severe symptoms arise. Some early warning signs include:Chronic fatigue and muscle weaknessTingling sensations in hands and feetMemory problems and difficulty concentratingMood swings, irritability, and depressionDizziness and shortness of breath We often dismiss these symptoms as work-related fatigue, but it’s best to take note if the fatigue or any of these symptoms keep recurring.Does sedentary lifestyle and work stress have a role to play? A desk-bound lifestyle coupled with high work stress plays a critical role in worsening B12 deficiency. With low physical activity, our metabolism slows down and it hinders nutrient absorption. Additionally, chronic stress weakens gut health, making it harder for the body to absorb essential vitamins. Dr Batra reiterates that frequent consumption of alcohol and excessive caffeine intake further exacerbate the issue. ""These habits impair digestion and reduce the body's ability to absorb B12 from food sources,"" she warns.Can you reverse B12 deficiency? While people are more prone to having a deficiency in Vitamin B12, it is also possible to reverse it (and supplements are not the only solutions). Small dietary and lifestyle changes go a long way. Dr Batra suggests:Include B12-rich foods in daily meals - chicken, eggs, milk, fish, yogurt, fermented foodsConsider supplements only if dietary intake is insufficientReduce caffeine and alcohol consumptionTake short breaks at work and engage in light physical activityManage stress through meditation or relaxation techniquesStay hydrated and ensure proper gut healthGet yourself checked Experts recommend an annual vitamin B12 test, particularly for vegetarians, individuals experiencing chronic fatigue, or those with digestive issues. Routine monitoring will ensure early detection and timely intervention before symptoms start showing up.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 14, 2025

44b9969c-8954-4234-b11c-85915f49ea9e,How much sleep do you really need? Experts reveal the truthThe amount of sleep we need changes throughout our lives. Newborns need the most somewhere between 14 to 17 hours.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/story/how-much-sleep-do-you-really-need-experts-reveal-the-truth-glbs-2693756-2025-03-14,"Chances are, if you’re reading this, you got some sleep last night. But are you feeling rested? Experts say it’s an important question to consider. Most of us spend a third of our lives sleeping, but you may need more or less than eight hours a night. The number of hours needed changes throughout your life, with babies and kids needing more sleep and people 65 and older able to function on slightly less than seven to nine hours. Here’s what sleep scientists and doctors say about how much you really need  and whether your gender plays a role. Sleep quality over quantity Sleep is still a mystery, despite how critical it is for our health. “The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but it’s an essential thing that we all do,” said Dr. Rafael Pelayo, a sleep specialist at Stanford University. “Something remarkable happens when you sleep. It’s the most natural form of self-care that we have.” Most of the population gets between seven to nine hours  and that particular category has the lowest association with health problems, said Molly Atwood, a behavioral sleep medicine clinician at Johns Hopkins. Once people either dip into less than six hours of sleep or get more than nine hours on average, the risk of health problems inches up, Atwood said, but everybody is different. Before, during or after? Tips on when to eat if you’re exercising' When you’re trying to figure out how much sleep you need, it’s important to think about the quality of it, Pelayo said: “What you really want to do is wake up feeling refreshed  that’s what it’s about.” “If somebody tells me that they sleep many hours but they wake up tired, something is wrong,” Pelayo said. “You shouldn’t leave your favorite restaurant feeling hungry.” How much sleep we need changes The amount of sleep we need changes throughout our lives. Newborns need the most  somewhere between 14 to 17 hours. “Definitely when we’re babies and children, because we are growing so rapidly, we do need a lot more sleep,” Atwood said. The National Sleep Foundation recommends most adults between 26 and 64 get between seven to nine hours of sleep. People who are 65 and older can get slightly less, and young adults between ages 16 and 25 can get slightly more. Humans cycle through sleep stages roughly every 90 minutes. In the first portion of the night, Atwood said that more of the cycle is slow wave sleep, or deep sleep, which is essential to repairing and restoring the body. It’s also when “growth hormone” is released. In the latter hours of the night, more of the sleep cycle is spent in rapid-eye movement sleep, or dream sleep, which is important for learning and memory consolidation, or the process in which short-term memory gets turned into long-term memory. Kids get more “deep sleep,” with about 50% of the night in that realm, she said. That drops at adolescence, Atwood said, because our body doesn’t need the same kind of repair and restoration. Something else interesting happens around puberty: Gender-based differences in sleep start to crop up. Do women need more sleep than men? Research doesn’t show that women need more sleep  but women do get slightly more sleep on average than men, Atwood said. It starts at a young age. Though they have the same sleep needs, teenage girls seem to get less sleep than teenage boys, Pelayo said. Additionally, teenage girls tend to complain of insomnia more frequently. When women become first-time mothers, they often care for newborns throughout the night more frequently, which means less sleep, said Allison Harvey, a clinical psychologist and professor who studies sleep at UC Berkeley. Hormones may also impact women’s sleep quantity and quality during pregnancy and menopause. “With menopause in particular, women can develop deterioration in their sleep with an increased number and duration of nighttime awakenings,” said Dr. Mithri Junna, a Mayo Clinic neurologist who specializes in sleep. Atwood said women may also need more sleep right before their menstrual cycle. “There are definitely times that your body’s telling you that you need more sleep,” she said. “It’s important to listen.” When to seek help sleeping You’ll know if you’re not getting enough sleep if you’re feeling grumpy, irritable and inattentive. Long-term, those minor symptoms can become serious problems  even deadly. “If you’re not getting enough sleep or you have untreated insomnia or sleep apnea, your risk of depression increases,” Atwood said. “Your risk of cardiovascular issues like high blood pressure, risk of heart attack and stroke increases. Your immune system is compromised. You’re at greater risk for Alzheimer’s.” If you’re getting the recommended amount of sleep every night but still waking up feeling tired, you might consider going to your primary care physician. They can rule out other health conditions that may affect your sleep, Atwood said. But if problems persist, seeking out a sleep specialist could be helpful.Published By: Rivanshi RakhraiPublished On: Mar 14, 2025

One of the major reasons why patches might help was that they promise to replace oral supplements, as many of us have problems swallowing pills, including supplements that help in this case. Today, the Indian nutritional supplements market, valued at USD 42.97 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 46.39 billion in 2025. But can it replace your traditional supplement tablets? The consensus among experts is a clear NO.

 Debjani Gupta, a nutritionist and wellness expert from Mumbai, says, “These patch supplements don't have any extensive research to support their effectiveness. They contain a very small concentration of the nutrients they claim to provide.” Vriti Srivastav agrees. “Patches cannot cater to all nutrients needs,” she says. “Oral supplementation will still be needed for other nutrients, especially those with larger molecular structures like fat-soluble vitamins A, E and K, which may not be absorbed effectively,” she adds. While Shivi Tyagi, a therapeutic nutritionist, agrees that these patches are a “convenient, needle-friendly” alternative, she agrees they cannot fully replace tablets. “Our skin acts as a barrier and does not allow certain nutrients to pass through. Water-soluble vitamins like B-complex and C require special formulations, making them better suited for oral consumption,” says Shivi.Potential side effects Patches might seem easy to use, but they’re not without side effects. According to all three experts, common issues include:Skin allergies and irritationRedness, swelling or itching at the application siteIn hot climates, excessive sweating may affect patch adhesionUneven or over-absorption of nutrientsSensitivity to added ingredients like essential oils or caffeine Shivi Tyagi adds, “Some patches marketed for energy, sleep or anxiety relief may contain ingredients that interfere with hormones, leading to mood changes or hormonal imbalances.” National Geographic also published a report examining vitamin patches and found the evidence for efficacy lacking, especially in comparison to traditional oral supplements.Things are quite patchy Experts say that these patches may be a helpful complement to oral supplements in specific cases, but they are far from a miracle solution. Their effectiveness varies based on:Skin type and thicknessHydration and body temperaturePlacement and formulation of the patch Moreover, as it was pointed out in Shark Tank by Namita Thapar, on the show, we need more research before even promoting it as an alternative to supplements. As Debjani says, “People who find eating three balanced, wholesome meals difficult are quick to jump on supplement trends, but it doesn't work like that.”For now, these stick-on patches might make for an interesting addition to your wellness routine, but don’t ditch your daily vitamins (which you should be getting from your food, not supplements) just yet. And perhaps, keep a lookout for more solid research before letting stickers replace your supplements.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 15, 2025Must Watch

9e444ea3-0c8c-44d6-a217-921d67d427fb,Floodlighting in a relationship is overwhelming. How to deal with it?Floodlighting is when someone overshares personal information just too soon. The term has been creating quite a buzz on social media lately. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/floodlighting-in-a-relationship-is-overwhelming-how-to-deal-with-it-2693335-2025-03-16,"Imagine you are on a first date with someone and while you are still devouring that slice of pizza, they are already deep into a trauma dump. Minutes after exchanging basic pleasantries and talking about work, favourite movies and deciding what to order, your date is walking you through their childhood abandonment issues, a toxic ex and an existential dread that keeps them up at night. Well, this is called floodlighting. It is when someone overshares personal information just too soon. The term has been creating quite a buzz on social media lately. Experts warn it is a toxic relationship trend one should deal with smartly.Why people floodlight A person may engage in floodlighting for several reasons: it could be out of guilt, a desire to accelerate the relationship dynamic, or simply a need for sympathy. However, it often leaves the recipient feeling overwhelmed and confused.

 



Some people floodlight out of guilt while others may do it to gain sympathy. There can be several reasons. (Photo: Getty)
advertisement “Floodlighting in relationships is when one partner overshares deep emotions or personal struggles too soon. Instead of creating intimacy, it can feel overwhelming. While vulnerability is important, dumping unfiltered emotions early on isn’t the same as genuine emotional connection,” says relationship expert Ruchi Ruuh. Some of the possible reasons people do floodlighting are:They may have made mistakes in previous relationships or feel unworthy of love, leading them to overshare out of guilt.Some believe that being brutally honest from the start will create a stronger foundation for the relationship.It can be a way to ""warn"" their partner about their flaws or test if they will still be accepted despite them.Some floodlight as an attempt to present their unfiltered, raw self upfront.They may think intense vulnerability will fast-track intimacy and create an instant bond. Floodlighting could also be an unintentional cry for help. But it can be difficult to discern your partner’s true intentions - there’s also a chance they’re doing it deliberately. Regardless, floodlighting puts unnecessary pressure on the other person. The situation can obviously feel tricky. In your heart, you may want to ask the person to stop and warn them about sharing TMI (too much information), but at the same time, you don’t want to come across as insensitive (especially when they’re opening up about their life difficulties and trauma).Dealing with floodlighting This blurring of boundaries is the biggest downside of floodlighting. “The receiving partner might feel obligated to play therapist rather than being a romantic equal. It can also be a red flag for emotional dependencywhere one person seeks validation instead of building mutual trust over time,” says Ruuh. Ideally, one must first sense the relationship dynamic and progressively share as the couple goes along. Unloading everything at once is not real intimacy. If you ever find yourself with a partner (or potential partner) who is floodlighting you, there are ways to navigate the situation and set boundaries. Even if their trauma dumping is a way to test your loyalty or gauge your reaction to their vulnerabilities, it’s important to remind them that boundaries matter - especially when the bond is still in its early stages. Acknowledging their feelings, whether you want to or not, is the first things to do. You don’t want to be rude or deepen their trauma. “I suggest acknowledging somebody's feelings because they could be coming from a certain place. They're sharing such deep things with you, it's important that you acknowledge that,” says Ruuh. But... While acknowledging their emotions is important, it is important to prioritise yourself too. Their trauma dumping can take a toll on you as well, wreaking havoc to your mental well-being. What if you are also battling personal issues and don’t have bandwidth to cater to their issues? “Remember that you need to set some boundaries there. So if it's getting overwhelming, you need to tell them that ‘I know it's important for you to share this with me, but right now I don't think I am in a position to understand this better’. So, boundaries would really protect you if you see somebody is floodlighting you,” says Ruuh. Try to assess their intentions too, and understand they might be oversharing. Are they seeking validation, trying to fast-track intimacy, or simply struggling with boundaries? Understanding their motivations can help you respond appropriately. If floodlighting goes on to become a pattern, you should consider taking a direct route. “If you're noticing a pattern here, like you think that they have been oversharing from last two days and that your boundaries are also not working, tell them to indulge in self-reflection. Ask them to talk in safe spaces before opening up with you. You can suggest them to try journaling, talking to their close friend,” says Ruuh. In an early stage of a relationship, you don’t need to know every detail of someone’s past. Protecting yourself emotionally is just as important as supporting them.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Mar 16, 2025ALSO READ |  Anxious about bumping into your ex?

68e2badb-ee2d-4cc2-8f45-a9b2c313642d,"Still using baby cream as a moisturiser? It's time to stopMany people still rely on baby products to keep their skin soft, supple, and flawless—just like a baby's. But did you even check with your dermatologist if doing so is benefitting your skin?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/still-using-baby-cream-as-a-moisturiser-its-time-to-stop-2694773-2025-03-17,"Would it be an exaggeration to say that we are living in a paradox? Every day, a new skincare product is launched and stocked on the shelves of your nearest Sephora, and consumers are going berserk over the insane number of choices. So much so that most end up hoarding products they don’t even need, a practice abhorred by dermatologists. Meanwhile, there’s also a category of people who love thriving in nostalgia. It’s as if time has stopped for them, but only when it comes to their skincare routine, as they’ve never moved beyond baby products for supple, soft, and flawless skin. Even you need to stop! What works for an infant’s delicate skin may not be doing your adult skin any favours. If you’ve been using baby creams as your go-to moisturiser, it might be time for an upgrade.Baby skin vs adult skin: The key differences According to Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant aesthetic physician at Gleneagles Hospital Bengaluru, baby creams are designed for infant skin, which is much thinner, has higher water content, and produces less oil. Their needs are different as compared to the adult skin. On the other hand, adult skin is much thicker, produces oil, has sebum and sebaceous glands, and is exposed to harsher environments like stress, pollution, and UV rays. Hence, a moisturiser meant for babies may not be enough to provide sufficient hydration and protection for adult skin. Dr Niketa Sonavane, celebrity dermatologist and founder of Ambrosia Aesthetics, Mumbai, agrees. She points out that adult skin loses moisture faster and requires ingredients that repair, protect as well as hydrate deeply. Meanwhile, baby creams are too basic for this. While they may feel soft and soothing upon application, but they don't contain active ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides and peptides (skin barrier protection) that adult skin benefits from.Are baby creams really that ineffective for adults? While there is no denying that for the time being the skin may feel baby-like, it’s not for the long run and there is reason for it. Many baby creams rely on occlusives like mineral oil, which simply sit on the skin rather than deeply hydrating or addressing issues like ageing, sun damage, or pigmentation. Dr Sachdeva further explains that adult skin benefits from additional elements like SPF for sun protection, exfoliants like AHAs and BHAs for skin renewal, and richer moisturisers with ceramides, shea butter, and vitamin E to combat dryness and environmental damage.What about other baby products? Not just baby creams, many people use baby shampoo, soaps and lotions too. Are they any good? Many people opt for baby shampoos, body lotions, and soaps, thinking they’re gentler alternatives. But while these products are mild, they often fall short when it comes to cleansing and hydration. Baby shampoo: “Designed to be tear-free and ultra-mild, baby shampoos don’t cleanse adult scalps thoroughly. If you use styling products, have coloured hair, or an oily scalp, baby shampoo won’t be effective,” says Dr Sonavane. Baby soaps: These are too mild to remove sweat, oil, and pollution. Over time, this can lead to dull skin and clogged pores. Baby lotions: They lack the rich hydration needed for adult skin, baby lotions won’t effectively combat dryness or damage caused due to environmental conditions (like pollution). That said, you can’t call them absolutely useless as people with certain conditions can make use of them. “For extremely sensitive skin, conditions like eczema or atopic dermatitis, baby products can be helpful as they avoid harsh chemicals,” notes Dr Sachdev. But for everyday use, adult skin requires more tailored care.Move over baby stuff, here’s what adult skin needs If you want to achieve healthy, glowing skin, swap baby cream for a well-formulated adult moisturiser.For dry skin: Your skincare should include ceramides, fatty acids, and shea butter for deep hydration.For oily or acne-prone skin: You need to choose a non-comedogenic hydration like a gel-based moisturiser with niacinamide.For anti-ageing: Opt for moisturisers with hyaluronic acid, peptides, retinol, and vitamin C.For sun protection: A moisturiser with SPF 50 is essential to prevent sun damage and premature ageing.For exfoliation: Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) help with dead skin removal and cell turnover.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 17, 2025

Then you probably know how tricky trio friendships can be. There is no denying that being in a trio brings the blissful feeling of having a support system, one that is not limited to just one person or lost in a large group. But trio friendships also come with their fair share of challenges. We just saw it in The White Lotus season 3.There is even an infamous notion on social media: ""In a group of three friends, there is always a stronger duo.""

Practically speaking, it can become difficult to maintain a trio friendship. But is it impossible to do so? Certainly not.But what makes trio friendships complex?Balancing attention, avoiding exclusion and managing differing dynamics are the key challenges a trio mostly faces.""It is natural for two members to bond more closely at times, but if this becomes a pattern, the third person may feel left out, leading to resentment or insecurity. Decision making can also be tricky, as reaching a consensus among three people is often more complicated,"" says Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing.""Another challenge is conflict resolution. If two friends have a disagreement, the third often gets caught in the middle and feels pressured to pick a side. This can lead to tension, resentment and division within the group,"" adds Dr Beppari.Unlike one-on-one friendships, where mutual investment is clear, trio friendships always carry the risk of exclusion. When two people share personal details and spend more time together, the third person may feel disconnected, leading to misunderstandings.A trio’s key to successA group of three friends might be a bit challenging to maintain, but it is always worth it. It is not without reason that we have had so many trios in films and shows, including Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Dil Chahta Hai, Mean Girls, The Aspirants and Kai Po Che! among several others.What makes these friendships extra special? Hear it from Dr Tugnait:""Trio friendships bring together diverse perspectives, creating a rich narrative of ideas, interests and experiences. This diversity can lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of different viewpoints.

Make an effort to include all three members in plans, conversations and decisions. Even for a small decision, ensure that all three are participating so that no one feels excluded.Maintain transparency. Avoid secrecy and favouritism to prevent jealousy or misunderstandings.Build individual connections. Each friend should nurture their bond with the other two. It is important for a balanced dynamic. If you cannot talk to one friend in a trio unless the other is present, the tripod is not balanced.Communicate openly. Address conflicts early to prevent resentment and unspoken tensions.Avoid gossip and negativity. Talking behind a friend’s back can erode trust.Handle conflicts carefully. Jokes or comments that hurt someone’s feelings should be avoided. If misunderstandings arise, they should be resolved with sensitivity.When all members actively work to include one another, address conflicts and celebrate their unique bond, trios can thrive.When to step away from a trio friendshipNot all friendships are meant to last forever, and that is absolutely okay. Growth and change are natural, and many trios fall apart eventually. It ultimately depends on all three individuals' commitment to nurture and strengthen the friendship. If you see a pattern of being left out and not being included in most plans, you may want to step away.The complexities of a trio friendship can significantly affect your mental well-being.""It can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness and poor self-esteem, as the person might feel rejected or unimportant in the group. Over time, it can cause anxiety and even lead to depression. The sense of being 'the third wheel' can be emotionally draining, especially if the individual feels their connection with the other two is not as strong. There can also be feelings of self-doubt,"" says Shreya Malik, lead clinical psychologist at Lissun, a mental health platform.Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a trio friendship may become unhealthy. Here are signs it is time to step away:You consistently feel left out or unimportant.The friendship requires too much effort to maintain.There is constant stress or tension instead of joy and support.There is a lack of trust, respect or mutual investment.The group dynamics make you feel drained rather than uplifted.You have outgrown the friendship, and it no longer serves your emotional well-being.But before you step away, express your feelings to your friends in a calm and honest manner.

But can gentle parenting find its place here?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/can-gentle-parenting-ever-go-mainstream-in-india-2695265-2025-03-18,"“I see you’re upset. Would you like a hug or some space?”“It’s okay to feel angry, but it’s not okay to hurt others. Let’s find a safe way to express it.”“I’m here to help you figure this out. We’ll solve it together.” If you ever Google phrases related to gentle parenting, chances are you may come across lines like these. And if you grew up in a typical desi household, the words probably sound like they belong in a foreign film. In India, parenting is often seen as synonymous with discipline, strict limits, and that occasional 'flying chappal'. In fact, slapping a child for misbehaviour has long been considered a fairly standard form of correction. But what if we told you that there’s another way to raise children - one that focuses on clarity, consistency, respectful communication, boundaries and empathy? A style that replaces harshness with kindness? Sounds like a dream for many, doesn’t it? Yes, we’re talking about gentle parenting, a concept that’s not entirely new in the West but is only just beginning to gain traction among young parents in India. advertisement   View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Kimberly Bepler, IBCLC, Doula (@thegrandparentdoula)So, what exactly is gentle parenting?Back in 2015, British author and parent Sarah Ockwell-Smith introduced the term ‘gentle parenting’, drawing from her own experiences as a mother. Since then, she’s written several books emphasising the importance of empathy, respect, understanding, and clear boundaries in parenting. A post shared by Kimberly Bepler, IBCLC, Doula (@thegrandparentdoula) Back in 2015, British author and parent Sarah Ockwell-Smith introduced the term ‘gentle parenting’, drawing from her own experiences as a mother. Since then, she’s written several books emphasising the importance of empathy, respect, understanding, and clear boundaries in parenting. Over the past few decades, parenting has steadily moved towards a more ‘child-first’ approach. Gentle parenting is one such method, embraced by many parents who believe it offers the best foundation for raising confident, emotionally secure children. To put it simply, gentle parenting focuses on empathy, respect, connection, and firm boundaries, all without yelling, punishments, or using fear as a tool to discipline.

 Instead of the age-old “because I said so” attitude, gentle parenting encourages understanding the ‘why’ behind a child’s behaviour, guiding them with compassion, and establishing boundaries in a calm and consistent manner. Here’s what gentle parenting usually involves:Respecting emotions: A child crying or throwing a tantrum isn’t labelled as “bad behaviour”, but rather a signal that they’re struggling with big feelings.Setting kind but firm boundaries: It doesn’t mean letting children run wild. Boundaries still exist, but they’re enforced with empathy, not threats.Modelling desired behaviour: Instead of saying “Don’t shout!”, you demonstrate calm communication yourself.Being patient and present: This style demands more time and involvement but aims to raise emotionally intelligent and resilient kids. Let’s look at an example. Imagine your child is throwing a tantrum and crying in front of everyone at an event. You’ve tried everything you can think of, but they’re still not listening. What will be your first instinct? Yelling or scolding might seem like the logical choice, right? But here’s where gentle parenting steps in. Instead of snapping, “Stop crying or I’ll give you a reason to cry”, a gentle parenting approach might sound like, “I can see you’re upset. Would you like to talk or take a moment?” But, will this always work? Well, parents who practise gentle parenting IRL and social media, believe it does. However, now is a good time to tell you that there isn’t a vast body of scientific data supporting gentle parenting yet. It’s only recently begun to be studied more seriously, especially regarding long-term effects on children. According to Anupriya M Banerjee, a therapist based in Mumbai, gentle parenting is essentially parenting without using shame, guilt, or punishment, opting instead for a compassionate and mindful approach.But can gentle parenting work in India? Let’s face it, traditional Indian parenting doesn’t quite align with the principles of gentle parenting. Most of us grew up dodging flying slippers, hiding relationships, and struggling with non-existent personal boundaries. Yet, some experts believe gentle parenting might be the antidote to India’s cycle of toxic parenting. Still, it comes with its own set of challenges. “I often hear millennials say, ‘I don’t want my child to go through what I did.’ That, in essence, captures the spirit of gentle parenting - a conscious decision to rewrite the narrative instead of repeating it,” says Soumya Sanghvi, an expressive arts therapy practitioner based in Pune. She believes the shift from ‘tough love’ to gentle parenting isn’t just about parenting choices; it’s a broader generational shift. Vasundhara Gupta, founder and counselling psychologist at Humraahi Psychotherapy, adds that gentle parenting is possible in India, but it requires a cultural shift in how we view discipline and authority. Many Indian households still function in a strictly hierarchical structure, where obedience is king and questioning authority is frowned upon.

 



Gentle parenting focuses more on the child than the parent. Photo: Unsplash
 As more parents learn about child psychology and the importance of understanding emotions, they’re beginning to prioritise building trust and connection over rigid control. Gupta explains that this means listening to children’s feelings, teaching them right from wrong with kindness, and setting rules that make them feel safe and understood rather than fearful and resentful. That said, gentle parenting in India isn’t without roadblocks. Payal Narang, a child psychologist and parent coach, points out that in India, there’s still a heavy focus on obedience, respect for elders, and traditional discipline styles. “Many well-meaning relatives or caregivers might struggle to understand why you don’t raise your voice or punish your child. But gentle parenting isn’t about being permissive; it’s about setting respectful, thoughtful boundaries,” says Narang. She adds, “Over time, I’ve noticed that leading by example helps. When family members, or even domestic help, see that my child listens to me not out of fear but mutual respect, they begin to understand. It takes patience, consistency, and a few uncomfortable conversations but it’s possible.” Ultimately, parenting is a personal choice, not a cultural obligation. If gentle parenting aligns with your values, you can make it work anywhere, even in a society that hasn’t fully caught up yet.What are the benefits of gentle parenting, according to experts? While there may be limited scientific studies on gentle parenting, experts still see potential benefits in this approach. Banerjee highlights the deep, often underestimated impact of gentle parenting through the ABCS:Affect:  It nurtures emotionally stable, regulated, empathetic children who are in tune with their feelings.Behaviour:  It fosters confidence, competence, and a healthy attitude towards mistakes, helping kids become holistic learners.Cognitive: It encourages self-awareness and sensitivity towards one’s thoughts and belief systems.Stability:  It may help reverse the effects of intergenerational trauma. Preeti Bhandary, co-founder and curriculum director of Little Elly Preschools, agrees. She says that since gentle parenting promotes emotional intelligence, open communication, and mutual respect, children raised with this approach often feel heard and valued. This builds strong communication skills and emotional self-awareness. She adds that children also learn to express themselves healthily rather than suppressing emotions out of fear. This not only improves family dynamics but also helps in building stronger social and professional relationships in the future. Another advantage, according to Bhandary, is that children raised this way tend to develop a stronger sense of autonomy and problem-solving ability. Since they’re encouraged to make choices and understand consequences, they grow up with a deeper sense of accountability.The flip side: gentle parenting isn’t always gentle on parents One of the biggest challenges with gentle parenting is that it demands much more from parents and far less from the child. Bhandary points out that it requires a tremendous amount of patience and emotional regulation, which can be exhausting especially when parents are juggling multiple responsibilities. Since it focuses on teaching instead of punishing, it naturally takes more time and effort. In cultures where strict discipline is the norm, parents who choose a gentler route often face criticism or unsolicited advice. There’s also the risk of becoming overly lenient if boundaries aren’t communicated clearly. Gentle parenting needs consistency if limits aren’t reinforced, children might not take them seriously. “Practising gentle parenting can lead to stress and frustration,” says Dr Sneha Sharma, consultant in psychiatry, drug de-addiction, and child counselling at Aakash Healthcare. It’s not always realistic to drop everything to talk through a meltdown when you're rushing to school. If taken to an extreme, it can disrupt a family’s routine.”    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Olivia J Owen (@livjowen) A post shared by Olivia J Owen (@livjowen) Dr Sharma also warns that some children may misbehave to get attention. Gentle parenting, with its emphasis on dialogue, could inadvertently reinforce that behaviour if not approached mindfully. Another tricky area is school. How do parents ensure teachers are also being ‘gentle’? Preeti believes it's unfair to generalise, as teachers’ methods vary. However, she suggests that at the preschool level, teachers can align with gentle parenting by fostering an environment built on patience, empathy, and mutual respect, rather than fear. So, while gentle parenting has its share of advantages, it certainly isn't without challenges. What do you think gentle parenting is the way to go?

Her protein-heavy meals, including eggs, high-protein yogurt, and steak, caused elevated protein levels and a hospital visit. Catherine, who ignored early warnings, later experienced severe symptoms like blood in her urine and required emergency care. She has since warned followers about the dangers of excessive protein intake and neglecting fibre. During her hospital stay, she was given morphine for the pain and eventually passed a kidney stone. She attributed her symptoms to excessive protein intake. The New York Post reported that Catherine had an obsession with protein, which she now believes contributed to her health scare. Following the incident, she took to social media to warn her followers, advising them, ""Don't eat too much protein, OK? Don't neglect your fiber intake."" According to the Mayo Clinic, high-protein diets ""may worsen how well a kidney works in people with kidney disease,"" affecting how the body processes protein waste products. Experts have warned that excessive protein consumption can have unintended health consequences, including: Reduced fibre intake, potentially leading to constipation, headaches, and bad breath. Increased risk of heart disease due to high levels of saturated fats found in red meat and processed meat. In recent years, the carnivore diet which consists nearly exclusively of meat, fish, and poultry has become more and more well-liked on social media.  Health experts frequently warned about its possible risks, including kidney stone formation. Experts also cautioned that this diet can hasten aging and cause inflammation, likening it to ""playing with fire."" Ms. Catherine's experience has reignited conversations about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet. Many of her fans have praised her for sharing her story and highlighting the risks of extreme dietary trends.Published By: Rivanshi RakhraiPublished On: Mar 18, 2025

Do dermatologists agree?Rubbing raw ginger directly on your skin isn't exactly a glow-up move – it could make things worse.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/instagram-says-rubbing-raw-ginger-can-cure-acne-do-dermatologists-agree-2695839-2025-03-19,"Another day, another viral skincare hack doing the rounds on Instagram. If you suffer from acne, your feed (like mine) must be filled with skincare advice on how to deal with it. From eating raw garlic to flax seeds for ‘botox’, social media is turning to natural ingredients found in your kitchen. And, this time, the spotlight is on raw ginger, with influencers claiming that rubbing it directly onto the skin can help banish acne. Sounds like an easy way to deal with your acne, right?    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by EZ | Content Creator (@eraajzaidi_) A post shared by EZ | Content Creator (@eraajzaidi_) Today, you can find countless videos online featuring Indian skinfluencers with glowing skin claiming that the secret isn’t expensive facials, but rather instantly tackling acne breakouts by rubbing raw ginger directly onto them. But is there actually any science behind this spicy suggestion?

 Let’s peel back the layers with some expert advice to see if this trend holds any weight.What do experts have to say? Let’s get this out of the way first. Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s good for your skin. Especially when applied raw and undiluted. Dr Gulhima Arora, senior consultant dermatologist at Mehektagul Dermaclinic, says, “Ginger has been proven useful for acne in scientific publications, but only as an indirect approach. It should not be considered a first-line or main treatment.” She emphasises that acne is a multifactorial condition - one spice won’t tackle all its triggers.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Mansi Gulati (@mansifaceyoga) A post shared by Mansi Gulati (@mansifaceyoga) Dr Saranya B, dermatologist and medical advisor at Kaya Limited, agrees, “Rubbing raw ginger on the face is not a scientifically proven acne treatment. While it has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, direct application may cause irritation.” Dr Bindu Sthalekar, founder and chief dermatologist of Skin Smart Solutions, adds, “There is no scientific evidence to prove that applying raw ginger topically treats acne. It could theoretically help, but only as an add-on to other medications, and only if tolerated well.”But are there any benefits of ginger? There are some promising aspects of ginger (in general if it is part of your diet or through skincare), especially its bioactive compounds like gingerol and shogaol. Here’s what the experts highlight:Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial: These properties may help reduce redness, swelling and bacteria related to acne, particularly cystic acne.Antioxidant-rich: Helps neutralise free radicals and reduce oxidative stress on the skin.

Gut-friendly: Dr Arora explains that ginger aids digestion and gut health, which is linked to skin health. It acts as a prebiotic, promoting good gut bacteria that, in turn, support better skin.Oil control and scar fading: Ginger has been known to reduce sebum production and may help lighten pigmented acne scars over time. However, the form in which ginger is used matters greatly. Dr Arora says, “Only certain extracts not raw ginger are useful. These should be consumed or applied in diluted form, like mixed with glycerine, honey or carrier oils. Ginger masks and scrubs are safer options.”The side effects Rubbing raw ginger directly on your skin isn’t exactly a glow-up move it could make things worse. Dr Arora says that, “Raw ginger is alkaline and can alter the skin’s pH, disrupting the barrier and microflora. This could increase breakouts rather than help them.” Dr Saranya B adds, “Applying raw ginger directly can cause irritation, allergic reactions, excessive dryness and burning, especially in those with acne-prone skin.” “The high concentration of oils and pungent phenols in raw ginger can cause irritant contact dermatitis and allergies due to their astringent properties,” Dr Sthalekar says.So, can ginger help with acne in any way at all? Yes, but not in the way Instagram suggests. All three dermatologists agree that ginger can be helpful when consumed as part of a balanced diet or used in controlled formulations.Ginger tea or extracts may help reduce inflammation from within.Skincare products containing gingerol or shogaol in measured doses may offer benefits without the harsh side effects.Always do a patch test before trying anything new topically. “Ginger is best tolerated when consumed orally rather than applied on the skin. Its actives are great antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, but for acne, they're an addition, not a cure,” Dr Sthalekar concludes.One last peel That viral ginger hack won’t do your skin any favours if you rub it on raw. Experts agree: skip the DIY and stick to clinically approved treatments or gentler, ginger-infused products, preferably after a chat with your dermatologist.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 19, 2025Must Watch

34014897-036f-4a99-ba20-2dfd6650821c,"Why are experts calling this 1990s drug a breakthrough for hair growth?Starting in 1991, a lower dose was approved for women and the brand was aggressively marketed as an over-the-counter medication on TV and in print",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/story/why-are-experts-calling-this-1990s-drug-a-breakthrough-for-hair-growth-glbs-2696043-2025-03-19,"The latest trend in treating hair loss may sound familiar — essentially, it’s a repurposed drug first popularized in the 1990s. Back then, TV viewers were inundated with ads for Rogaine, a sticky topical solution that could help treat thinning hair when applied to the scalp. Now dermatologists are increasingly prescribing the drug, known generically as minoxidil, in low-dose pills to help men and women maintain or regrow hair. The practice follows a handful of recent studies suggesting the ingredient works as well — and possibly better — when swallowed, rather than applied to hair follicles on the head. Telehealth companies are also driving new demand by offering a quick, easy way to get a prescription and have the pills shipped directly to customers’ doors. A retro approach to hair loss Minoxidil was originally developed as a pill to treat high blood pressure in the 1970s. Researchers noticed that some patients taking it experienced increased hair growth as a side effect. Rogaine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1988, the first drug to win the agency’s endorsement for male pattern baldness. Studies showed that men on the medication, which was applied directly to the scalp, had a slower rate of hair loss and, in some cases, regrew hair. Starting in 1991, a lower dose was approved for women and the brand was aggressively marketed as an over-the-counter medication on TV and in print. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. The drug’s ability to slow hair loss is likely related to its effect on blood circulation, according to experts. “By increasing blood flow to the scalp it signals hairs to stay in their grow phase for longer,” said Dr. Adam Friedman, chair of dermatology at George Washington University. “We’re trying to keep those hairs in that growth phase as long as possible.” A recent consensus paper by more than 40 U.S. and international dermatologists concluded that minoxidil pills are effective and often more convenient and affordable than the liquid formulation. Patients prefer the pill There’s little research comparing the two forms of minoxidil, but many dermatologists believe the drug works better as a pill. At a chemical level, minoxidil is absorbed more directly when digested in the gut than when applied to the hairline. It’s also more convenient, with patients taking the drug by mouth once a day, instead of applying the liquid once or twice daily using a dropper. “As you can imagine, that can be rather onerous,” said Dr. Susan Taylor of the University of Pennsylvania. “Although people often enthusiastically begin therapy— and even see results — after a while there are many who drop off.” The doses prescribed for oral use are also very low. Dermatologists often direct men to take one half of the lowest-dose pill; women may only need a quarter of a pill. Those low doses can also reduce the chances for side effects, which can include dizziness, rapid heartbeat and swollen legs. The drug isn’t recommended for people with a history of heart issues or who are pregnant or breastfeeding. The only other FDA-approved medication for hair loss is finasteride, sold under the brand name Propecia, a drug that blocks a byproduct of testosterone that triggers hair loss in men. That drug is generally considered more effective than minoxidil, but it can occasionally cause troubling sexual side effects, including erectile dysfunction. For optimal results, some dermatologists prescribe the two drugs in combination. Why aren’t minoxidil pills FDA-approved for hair loss? In short, because there’s very little money to be made. Minoxidil’s patent has expired and it is now available as a low-cost generic medication. That means drugmakers have little financial incentive to spend millions on the new studies that would be needed to win FDA approval for hair loss. “For a drug like oral minoxidil — which is as old as dirt at this point — there are no reasons to do that,” said Friedman. Like other dermatologists, Friedman gives hair-loss patients a prescription for the pills intended to treat blood pressure, a practice known as off-label prescribing. The upside for patients is that minoxidil is extremely affordable, with some pharmacies offering a month’s supply for less than $5. “Not a single patient has complained to me about the cost of this medication, which is extremely rare,” said Dr. Luiz Garza of Johns Hopkins University. Telehealth firms open up access The vast majority of doctors prescribing minoxidil for hair loss are dermatologists, who often turn to older drugs off-label for various hair and skin conditions. A survey of U.S. dermatologists published last year found 80% reported prescribing oral minoxidil. But with only about 12,000 dermatologists in the U.S., some patients may have trouble finding a provider. Telehealth providers like Hims and Ro say they are helping fill the gap. The companies’ business model offers patients quick access to the medications they are seeking, often after simply filling out a questionnaire about their medical history, medications and treatment goals. The information is reviewed by a health provider who can quickly approve a prescription, assuming there are no red flags. Hims and Ro each say that their providers won’t prescribe minoxidil for patients who have complicating health conditions or prescriptions that could negatively interact with the drug. In some cases, patients may be referred for an office visit. Many dermatologists say patients are better served by an in-person appointment, where a doctor will usually take a blood pressure reading, evaluate medical history, prescriptions and discuss the drug’s side effects. “I’m not a proponent of going to an online service,” said Taylor. “I recommend seeing your board-certified dermatologist who’s trained, who knows the data and can evaluate all of you.”Published By: Rivanshi RakhraiPublished On: Mar 19, 2025

Even those with no professional or educational connection to art thronged the Okhla NSIC Grounds (the venue for both events) to appreciate innovations in the world of art and design. Was it Instagram-induced FOMO, or has art genuinely become a mainstream area of interest? Well, that’s a topic of discussion for another day. For now, the spotlight is on a major trend shining bright in India’s art landscape - textile art. Think of it as art, but with an added depth of textiles and fabrics. Take a look at this Viraj Khanna a young artist creating waves in the art landscape and son of couturier Anamika Khanna - creation brought to life using meticulous hand embroidery:

 But textile art is not restricted to swapping paint with embroidery on a canvas. It can take the form of a 3D installation, an evocative, plushie-like sculpture, a quirky wall hanging or a vast panel. A rich variety of such works has been on display at several recent exhibitions across the country, including the much-talked-about IAF and India Design ID - both of which have become highly anticipated annual events among art enthusiasts. Young artists like Gurjeet Singh, Shradha Kochhar, Liactuallee are at the helm of the textile art’s contemporary wave. Fabric scraps? Chandigarh-based Gurjeet Singh turns them into eccentric, vibrant art pieces. Kochhar is renowned for her large-scale, hand-knitted sculptures made from khadi and kala cotton, exploring themes of material memory, sustainability, and intergenerational healing.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Gurjeet Singh (@softgurjeet) A post shared by Gurjeet Singh (@softgurjeet) At the India Design ID, textile art made its presence felt across the grand exhibition’s varied sections - ranging from art halls, installations to interior design spaces. Tarun Tahiliani presented embroidered wall artwork featuring aari embroidery and French knots on hand-painted textile. The master couturier first dabbled into textile art during Covid lockdown - to keep the artisans busy and offer them reassurance, the idea of making wall hangings was conceived. After the lockdown, the Tarun Tahiliani Design Studio incorporated this embroidery technique into their lehengas, quickly making it their best-selling collection. Over time, the intricate work was also displayed on the walls of their stores, showcasing embroidery not just as a clothing detail but as an independent art form.

Known for her signature linen sarees and collaborations with craft clusters from various states, she drew inspiration from Jharkhand’s Birhor Tribe for her debut home line. In addition to sophisticated home linen in neutral hues, textile artwork took centre stage with her Tree of Life collection, created by six artisan women from Jharkhand - their names embroidered on the fabric.

 But is textile art a new trend? Dare we say that! India’s rich textile and handcraft heritage has always dotted homes in India and has not been limited to sartorial celebrations. Think of traditional wall hangings (like Kalamkari and Pattachitra among many others), and even rich home furnishings (traditional quilts, dhurries). It is, however, gaining further prominence in the mainstream art and home decor scene. The use of textile art for home decor is a time-honoured tradition, deeply woven into our history. “Textile art has been an integral part of India’s artistic and cultural heritage for centuries, deeply rooted in weaving, embroidery, and dyeing traditions. While it may seem like a contemporary trend in art and home decor, textiles have historically been revered as both utilitarian and artistic expressions - seen in the rich legacy of Phulkari from Punjab, Kalamkari from Andhra Pradesh, and intricate brocades of Banaras. What we are witnessing today is a resurgence,” says Bhavna Kakar, founder-director of LATITUDE 28, a contemporary art gallery. She has worked with a bevy of artists championing textile art, like Al-Qawi Nanavati, Viraj Khanna, Veena Advani, and Khadim Ali. Al-Qawi Nanavati weaves personal grief into art using her late mother’s clothing through weaving, papermaking, and screen printing, transforming memory and loss into a meditative practice. Viraj Khanna tells surreal, narrative-driven stories with embroidery, capturing social interactions. Veena Advani reinterprets Ikat weaving in mixed-media paintings with hand embroidery, blending tradition with abstraction to honour textile craftsmanship.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Veena Advani (@veenaadvani_art) A post shared by Veena Advani (@veenaadvani_art) “From ancient times, and notably during the Mughal era, textiles have been employed to infuse living spaces with vibrancy and beauty. The Mughals were renowned for their patronage of the arts, and handcrafted textiles played an important role. They introduced Persian and Central Asian influences, leading to the development of intricate designs, luxurious fabrics like silk and brocade, and sophisticated techniques such as Zardozi embroidery, hand-painted Kalamkari, and block-printed cotton textiles. The Mughal courts utilised these textiles to adorn palaces, create sumptuous furnishings, and display wealth and power,” Gaurang Shah, a celebrated designer dedicated to preserving and innovating India's weaving heritage, tells India Today. The changing perception and treatment is the novelty factor - textile art is transcending traditional craft practices and embracing more contemporary expressions.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Gallery XXL (@xxl.gallery) A post shared by Gallery XXL (@xxl.gallery) “Historically, textile arts were seen as craft, often linked to specific regions or communities. Artists have elevated textile-based art to a high cultural status, transforming traditional techniques into contemporary masterpieces. What’s new is how these art forms are now integrated into the global art world and interior design, making them more accessible and admired across the world,” says Samarth Mathur, founder and managing director of Masha Art.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by shradha (@shradhakochhar) A post shared by shradha (@shradhakochhar) Art connoisseurs credit the newfound popularity of textile art to several factors like renewed appreciation for traditional crafts, a focus on sustainability, and changing artistic perspectives. People are now drawn to textiles not just for their beauty but also for their cultural and eco-friendly value. “Patrons such as Lekha Poddar, Monisha Ahmed, Lavina Baldota, Rasika Kawalkar, and curator and writer Mayank Mansingh Kaul have played a crucial role in pushing the boundaries of textile art, blending age-old craftsmanship with avant-garde concepts,” says Kakar. It is also the multi-sensory appeal of textile artworks that makes them even more special. “Unlike other art forms, textiles carry the weight of centuries of tradition, with each thread and weave offering insight into regional craftsmanship and techniques. The flexibility of fabric allows for innovation from sculptures to large-scale installations and the ability to blend different textures, colours, and patterns in a way that adds emotional depth to a work,” says Samarth Mathur. “Textile art is multi-sensoryit’s not just about visuals but also touch and texture. The use of diverse materials and embroidery techniques creates a captivating 3D effect, making the art more interactive and dynamic,” adds Gayatri Khanna, creator and founder, Milaaya Art Gallery. Khanna has worked with leading Indian contemporary artists like Rekha Rodwittiya, Ranbir Kaleka, Manjunath Kamath, Nikhil Chopra, and several others. “They’ve loved seeing their works translated into intricate embroidery, which adds depth and almost a three-dimensional effect,” Khanna tells India Today. In January 2025, Khanna’s Milaaya Art Gallery showcased a special exhibition ‘Terra: Unraveling the Earth’s Story in Embroidery’ featuring embroidered artworks.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Mumbai Gallery Association (@mumbaigalleryassoc) A post shared by Mumbai Gallery Association (@mumbaigalleryassoc) Textile art also plays a vital role in sustaining traditional hand embroidery and supporting artisans. Artists often collaborate with local artisans and create opportunities for these communities to showcase their skills on a global stage. “This collaboration preserves India’s rich textile heritage but also supports the livelihoods of artisans. With the growing recognition of textile art in mainstream spaces, artisans from various regions will receive more exposure, ensuring that their traditional craft continues to thrive in the modern world,” shares Mathur. Another reason why art patrons think that textile art is going mainstream is because of how it resonates with a wider range of people. “Textile art is going mainstream now because it not only adds personalised decor to your spaces but also resonates with both heritage lovers and modern design enthusiasts,” says Uday Jain, director of Dhoomimal Gallery. Fabric has always been a medium of profound storytelling. As Kakar highlights: “Beyond aesthetics, fabric holds historical, cultural, and even political significance. From Gandhi’s Swadeshi movement, where Khadi became a symbol of resistance, to contemporary artists using textiles to challenge gender norms or environmental concerns.” It is only befitting that it relishes a key spotlight in the realm of art.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Mar 20, 2025Must Watch

From beauty bottles to Bollywood, and even beverage brands, everything now has a touch of bling. So let’s dive into the most bedazzled corners of social media and see what’s sparkling these days. Skincare is getting a glow-up—literally If you open Instagram, and you’ll spot it immediately: people aren’t just doing their skincare routines, they’re accessorising them. And no, we’re not talking serums and fancy toners - we’re talking rhinestones on skincare bottles. Yes, even our humble Vaseline jar is getting a glam makeover. From budget-friendly brands to luxe skincare like influencers are sticking on gems, pearls, glitter decals and custom initials to make their skincare shine (quite literally). It’s giving self-care, but make it couture. Have a look this video (here the influencer is using all bedazzled skincare): Tumblers are turning into statement accessoriesGone are the days of boring hydration. If your water bottle doesn’t double as a fashion accessory, are you even drinking water?

And trust us, they’ve jumped on this trend wagon too.Take Lipton, for example.

It’s part rebellion, part therapy, and part ‘it looks good’.For some, bedazzling is meditative. Think of it as painting, but shinier.For others, it's about standing out in a world full of copy-paste consumer goods. Slapping rhinestones on your moisturiser? That’s your way of saying, “This is mine.”And of course... it just looks so damn good. Need we say more?So how do you bedazzle like a pro?If you’re thinking, “This is cute, but how do I even start?”—we’ve got you. Bedazzling your favourite things doesn’t require an art degree. Just a few basics and a dash of patience.Here’s your glittery guide to getting started:Get your sparkle on: First things first, you’ll need rhinestones (or rhinestone tapes if you're lazy). You can easily find a wide variety online on sites like Amazon India, Flipkart or even niche craft stores like Itsy Bitsy. From classic clear crystals to neon hearts, pastel pearls and holographic shapes, pick whatever you want.Pick your canvas: Anything can be bedazzled. Water bottles, skincare bottles, phone cases, makeup mirrors, even your wireless earbuds case.Stick with the best: For long-lasting bling, you’ll need a good adhesive. Hot glue guns are great for quick DIYs, but go for more durable sparkle, go for E6000 glue (a cult favourite among crafters), or Fevicryl fabric glue if you're working with clothes and soft items.advertisementPro tip: Always test the glue on a small patch first - you don’t want a melted Vaseline label situation.Use a wax pencil or rhinestone picker: Trust us, picking up those tiny stones with your fingers is a pain. Grab a wax pencil or a rhinestone picker tool (again, easily available online for under Rs 200.For items that are handled often, like phone covers or tumblers, you can spray a light layer of clear sealant or top coat once the glue dries to lock in that shine.Another pro tip: Start filling the corners first, and then fill the rest in. Trust us it makes all the difference.Make it personal: Don’t just randomly throw stones around. You can spell your name, create patterns, or even match the colours to your zodiac sign.In an age where minimalism ruled for far too long, maximalism is making a comeback, and we’re totally here for it. So whether you’re sticking gems in your lip balm or investing in a crystal-studded corset, remember: bling is king.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 20, 2025Trending Reel

5e6f27b3-fcc1-4f0c-a4fc-c9428dadd368,"Can a parent's affair shape a child's emotional world?For a child who is in his teens or pre-teens and struggling with numerous things like puberty, peers, and relationships, the revelation of a parent's affair can be a blow big enough to shape how the person grows up emotionally.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/can-a-parents-affair-shape-a-childs-emotional-world-2696525-2025-03-21,"Years ago on Rendezvous with Simi Garewal, actress Rekha opened up about her complicated childhood and her parents’ - actor Gemini Ganesan and Pushpavalli’s - convoluted relationship. Rekha was a baby when Ganesan moved out of their home to marry actress Savitri. Her relationship with Ganesan never evolved - or rather, was never truly formed - because he was almost entirely absent during her growing-up years. In the interview, Rekha acknowledged how the absence of a father figure affected her behaviour around men. More often than not, such emotional ‘cracks’ remain hidden from the world. Affairs are rarely discussed openly because no one wants to expose the imperfections of an unhappy relationship. While discovering a spouse’s affair can be devastating for the partner, for children - whether young or fully grown - the revelation can cause an upheaval of emotions that they may struggle to understand. For a child who is in his teens or pre-teens and struggling with numerous things like puberty, peers, and relationships, the revelation of a parent’s affair can be a blow big enough to shape how the person grows up emotionally.The emotional shockwave Studies have shown that children who come from happy and supportive families often grow up to be jovial and well-adjusted adults. The same is not the case with children who hail from dysfunctional families. Psychologists say that a parent’s affair is not just about infidelity - it’s about the rupture of trust, stability, and identity. Children often internalise the pain and betrayal, and it keeps them wondering: ""Was I not enough to keep my family together?"" This misplaced guilt can lead to long-term emotional patterns - hyper-independence, fear of intimacy, or even subconscious attempts to overcompensate in relationships. Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai, explains, “If these emotions aren’t processed, they can manifest as anxiety, trust issues, or avoidance in future relationships.” Many children, especially teens, react with rebellion or perfectionism - either acting out to regain a sense of control or striving for flawlessness in hopes of keeping other relationships intact. She adds that children may often take a parent’s affair personally, feeling that it happened because of them or something they did. This thought could eat them up internally and manifest in various ways, such as low self-esteem, trust issues, fear of abandonment, or difficulty forming healthy relationships.The age factor: Does it change the impact? Growing up, for any child, parents are their heroes. They visualise them as having the power to conquer anything in this world. When that idea shatters - be it for a child in his teens or pre-teens - the emotional damage is immense. A child’s age doesn’t necessarily determine the emotional impact, but older children might respond differently from younger ones. “Emotional dysregulation is common,” says Sam.Children (9-12 years) might experience mood swings, concentration difficulties, or outbursts. They often experience confusion and instability. They might question themselves: ""Did I do something wrong?""For teenagers, they tend to oscillate between anger and sadness, sometimes exhibiting defiance or detachment. Anxiety, relationship insecurities, and even hyper-independence can develop.Young adults and grown children can feel an existential loss, questioning whether their parents’ past love was ever real. They may also struggle to trust romantic partners in the future. Discovering a parent’s infidelity as a young adult may seem easier to process, but the case is quite the opposite. Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing, says, “At this stage of life, you’ve likely developed a mature understanding of relationships, loyalty, and trust, only to have those very beliefs shaken by someone you’ve always looked up to.” “Regardless of age, trust issues are a major consequence,” says child psychologist Riddhi Doshi. “Many children emotionally disconnect from the parent who had the affair, and in some cases, develop lifelong anxiety about betrayal.” A lot of times, a child’s innocence and trust can be manipulated by one parent to turn them against the other, especially in the context of an affair (like we saw in The Squid and the Whale). This can be a revenge move, but in the long run it can emotionally turn him ‘sinister.’The social ripple effect The worst is when the affair becomes public. The child may feel ashamed or embarrassed and start withdrawing from social gatherings. While on the outside they may put up a brave face, internally they are vulnerable. Some retreat into isolation, while others overcompensate - curating a picture-perfect image of their lives to counterbalance the chaos at home. It’s common to see teenagers or young adults creating ‘aspirational’ social media lives, but internally, they are still struggling with trust and insecurity,” Doshi adds.Emotional responses: What’s normal The spectrum of emotions is vast, but the most common reactions include:Anger: “How could you do this to us?”Guilt: “Did I do enough to keep my family together?”Insecurity: “Are relationships ever truly safe?”Grief: The loss of the parent they once idealised. Sometimes, it is not just manipulation; children often tend to take sides - especially when one parent has been affected by infidelity. They take sides, villainising one parent while feeling the need to protect the other. Others, in an attempt to cope, suppress their emotions, only for them to resurface in adult relationships.advertisementSo, what can parents do?If an affair has come to light, it’s best that the parent takes responsibility for it. This means they are not just taking accountability for their actions but also for the emotional damage they have caused.“One of the first steps is taking accountability - owning up to the hurt caused to the family and child. Parents should reinforce a sense of unconditional love, making sure the child knows they are deeply loved despite the situation,” says Sam.“Adjusting the parent-child relationship to meet the child’s needs helps them feel included and supported,” she adds.Around this time, if needed, therapy is recommended to help the child understand what is going on.“Most importantly, if the affair is already known, do not make the child choose sides. Open conversations, rather than secrecy or blame, can help them process the situation in a healthier way,” Sam further mentions.For a young adult, Dr Tugnait says, they must understand that a parent’s infidelity is their decision, not a reflection of them or their family’s values. So, it is important they remind themselves that the parent’s mistakes do not define their ability to have healthy, fulfilling relationships.advertisementBreaking the cycleFor a child, nothing can be more devastating than seeing the parents they have idealised since childhood on the brink of a failing marriage. Here, the parents must take accountability for their actions. They need to understand that it is not just their relationship at stake but also a young life that may internalise the idea of a broken marriage and carry its burden into their own future.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 21, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/story/uk-artist-with-bipolar-disorder-seeks-euthanasia-but-not-before-a-last-supper-2697063-2025-03-22,"Trigger Warning: Mention of suicide and sexual harassment ""Hi, I’m Joseph. I’m bipolar, and I’ve moved to the Netherlands to legally end my life.” On December 9, 2024, Joseph “Nana Kwame” Awuah-Darko, aka Okuntakinte, posted a reel on Instagram with the message above. The message was clear, yet painful. The decision behind it was far from easy and was not impulsive. After the request, it will take him almost four years to get approval to legally end his life through assisted euthanasia.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Joseph “Nana Kwame” Awuah-Darko (@okuntakinte) A post shared by Joseph “Nana Kwame” Awuah-Darko (@okuntakinte) The public’s reaction was, to say the least, shocking. In a digital space often clouded by mockery or denial, Joseph’s message was met with unexpected empathy. While some accused him of glorifying death and suicide, others (hundreds) invited him for dinner. Many shared their own experiences - stories of loved ones lost to suicide or personal battles kept silent for too long. Joseph says he has been living with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder for years now. After long and painful contemplation, he decided to legally end his life by moving to the Netherlands. The 28-year-old artist from Ghana, Joseph, said, “I’m not special, I’m just ready.” In 2023, the Netherlands recorded 9,068 cases of euthanasia, accounting for 5.4 percent of all deaths in the country. Still, Joseph may be one of the first to document such a deeply personal journey so openly on social media. “Two days ago, I announced my decision to legally end my life due to my struggles with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder. And now my fianc has left me. And I don’t blame him. We’re still friends, but the pain is still quite real,” he shared in a post.The last supper While waiting for his final approval, Joseph – always an artist – began a new project titled ‘The Last Supper’. Inspired by the dinner invitations he received following his ethunasia announcement, he visits the homes of strangers who invite him, sharing meals, conversations, and moments of connection. So far, Joseph has attended 70 such dinners. His calendar filled up within hours of opening it. Many hosts were people battling their own mental health conditions, some even preparing for their own assisted deaths. One of those was Emmanuel, with whom Joseph shared his 70th dinner. Emmanuel is scheduled to receive medically assisted death on 30 July. “Today was the first (and perhaps last) time my dear friend Emmanuel cooked for me as he prepares towards his medically assisted death on the 30th of July. It was beautiful to see him thriving in the kitchen as someone who considers cooking to be a love language. I’m glad I can be by his side during this uniquely intense chapter in his life. He seemed happy, relaxed and eager for the final day in a way that I can painfully appreciate,” Joseph wrote.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Joseph “Nana Kwame” Awuah-Darko (@okuntakinte) A post shared by Joseph “Nana Kwame” Awuah-Darko (@okuntakinte) For his 40th dinner, Joseph was hosted by a South Indian woman and her friends. He was also invited by pop sensation SZA.
 


But why does Joseph want to die? Joseph’s decision is deeply personal, and while we can’t fully know what pushed him to this point, one thing is certain – his life has not been easy. According to Joseph, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 16. He also alleges having been sexually assaulted. In May 2024, he stated he was sexually assaulted twice in June 2021 by artist Kehinde Wiley during and after a dinner event in Ghana. As a child, he was repeatedly molested by his math teacher. Yet his greatest battle has been with his mental illness. After countless failed treatments, he found no relief. He has attempted suicide three times before and now believes euthanasia is a more dignified way to go.The disorder’s chaos “I am not saying that life (as a phenomenon) isn’t worth living. It ABSOLUTELY is. What I am saying is that the mental weight of MINE has become entirely unbearable,” Joseph shared in another post. According to him, the primary reason for pursuing euthanasia is his bipolar disorder. The American Psychiatric Association defines bipolar disorders as conditions characterised by intense emotional states – periods lasting from days to weeks – that affect mood, energy, and functioning. Absy Sam, a psychologist from Mumbai, explains that bipolar disorder is far from just mood swings. It's a cycle of emotional extremes - a war between euphoric highs and crushing lows. She says many people with bipolar disorder also carry deep trauma, repeated invalidation, and often feel socially excluded due to the intensity of their emotions.

 “From a purely psychiatric standpoint, there is care - sure- but often it feels like a band-aid being placed over a deep wound. The core pain, the emotional turmoil, remains largely unaddressed. And this makes healing questionable if we only rely on medication or hospitalisation,” she adds. Shikha Shah, an expressive arts therapy practitioner at Doctor Drama, says, “Honestly, I get why Joseph chose that path, especially when nothing seemed to work. People forget that mental pain can be just as unbearable as physical pain. I think having the option of euthanasia in extreme cases gives people agency over their own suffering.” Many mental health experts agree that Joseph’s case—and others like his—should be a wake-up call to make mental health a mainstream conversation. “Until mental health concerns are given the same—or even more—attention as physical health by physicians, specialists, doctors, and the broader healthcare system, stories like this will continue. And that’s tragic,” says Sam. Mental health is still neglected in many parts of the world, including India. Joseph’s story reminds us of that. In May 2024, a similar debate erupted online when Zoraya ter Beek, a 28-year-old Dutch woman, ended her life through euthanasia due to long-term, treatment-resistant mental illness. Diagnosed with chronic depression, autism, and borderline personality disorder, Zoraya had battled suicidal thoughts since childhood. Despite extensive therapy, medication, and over 30 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy, doctors eventually declared her condition untreatable. Beek and Joseph’s stories both highlight an important shift: euthanasia is no longer just about physical pain—it now includes unbearable mental suffering too.The act of dying: is it legal in India? On a spiritual level, Anupriya M Banerjee, a therapist based in Mumbai, draws attention to Jainism’s practice of Santhara or Sallekhana. It isn’t the same as suicide. Rather, it is a voluntary spiritual act of detachment, where one gradually stops eating, drinking, and participating in worldly life. It’s often compared to how some animals, like cats, isolate themselves and stop eating when they sense the end is near. In that sense, both Sallekhana and euthanasia reflect a deep awareness of the self, says Anupriya. From a legal standpoint, though, Abhinav Shrivastava, co-founding partner at GSL Chambers and advocate-on-record at the Supreme Court of India, explains that euthanasia remains highly debated in the country. As of now, India only permits passive euthanasia, which means withdrawing life support or stopping medical treatment to allow a terminally ill person to die naturally. Abhinav notes that passive euthanasia was first legalised after the landmark Aruna Shanbaug case. Aruna had been left in a vegetative state for over four decades following a brutal rape in 1973. Though the court rejected the plea to actively end her life, it recognised the possibility of allowing life support to be withdrawn in similar cases under court supervision. In January 2023, the Supreme Court further eased the process for advance medical directives, making it easier for individuals to express their wish to die with dignity in certain medical scenarios. But active euthanasia (using lethal substances to end life) and assisted suicide (where someone helps another end their life) remain illegal in India. In fact, they are considered criminal offences. That said, euthanasia is not something to take lightly.

But there needs to be strict boundaries and ethical checks to make sure it’s really the last option,” says Shah. We close with a question that refuses to leave us – if Joseph and others had access to better care, an earlier intervention, a safer space to process their trauma, grief, and pain, would euthanasia still have felt like their only way out?

The monk and author, who was a guest speaker at BT MindRush 2025, believes “finding the right balance” is everything. When asked about the ongoing debate on what should be the ideal work hour, Swami Gaur Gopal Das, says, “My point is, if somebody can work day and night, 24/7, who am I to stop that? If someone has that work ethic and believes in that ideology, who are we to interfere? We live in a free world, a world of free ideologies and free thinking. If someone believes in toiling day and night to achieve a certain goal, who are we to stop them, right?” he said, acknowledging the drive of individuals who push themselves to the limit. However, he warned that glorifying long hours as a universal benchmark could have serious consequences. “Now, turning that ideology into the norm could lead to nonstop burnout among the very people we need. What we were just discussing was servant leadership. When we talk about servant leadership, we focus on the well-being of our employees and the people we lead,” he explained. Swami Gaur Gopal Das also talked about the importance of holistic well-being, stating that professional success alone does not equate to true fulfillment. “Well-being includes professional and financial aspects, of course. But trust me, while people today are professionally skilled, they are not necessarily professionally well. There’s a difference between being professionally skilled and truly thriving in one’s professional career.” To illustrate his philosophy, he referenced a couplet by poet Bashar: “You find success in peace, and you find peace in success.” “Can we do without success? No. You have to run, chase, hustle, and give your 200%. There’s no debate about that. But why are you doing all of this if you can’t find peace in success? If you don’t find fulfillment in stillness? The ability to unwind, to pause, is equally important,” he said. The debate over work-life balance intensified after Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan suggested that employees should work 90 hours a week, including Sundays, to remain competitive. Earlier, Infosys Founder Narayana Murthy had advocated for a 70-hour work-week to boost productivity.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 22, 2025

And if you don’t, let us introduce you. Shukla, from Maharashtra, broke six Guinness World Records in a single day during a mental maths competition in Dubai. Following his remarkable feat, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra took a special interest in him. Sharing his thoughts on X, Mahindra expressed that he was “dazed and bewildered” and showed curiosity about learning the technique that aids in calculations—not to break records, but to help with daily business calculations.14-year-old Aaryan Shukla from India, last month broke the world record for the Fastest time to mentally add 100 four-digit numbers - 30.9 secLeaves you dazed & bewildered.Congratulations Aaryan!I’ve seen some videos before of kids using this technique where the hands are pic.twitter.com/XvOBU6vmC1— anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) March 18, 2025 14-year-old Aaryan Shukla from India, last month broke the world record for the Fastest time to mentally add 100 four-digit numbers - 30.9 secLeaves you dazed & bewildered.Congratulations Aaryan!I’ve seen some videos before of kids using this technique where the hands are pic.twitter.com/XvOBU6vmC1— anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) March 18, 2025 The 14-year-old responded to Mahindra’s query, mentioning that the technique he used is ‘Flash Anzan’ and that it took him almost eight years to perfect it.Thank you very much Sir. I am a Mental Calculator (Human Calculator). The technique is called ""Flash Anzan"" where you have to process the numbers flashing on the screen at lightning speed. The base is Abacus. While I have been training for last 8 years to achieve this. Thanks!— Aaryan Nitin Shukla - Human Calculator (@geniusaaryan) March 18, 2025 Thank you very much Sir. I am a Mental Calculator (Human Calculator). The technique is called ""Flash Anzan"" where you have to process the numbers flashing on the screen at lightning speed. The base is Abacus. While I have been training for last 8 years to achieve this. Thanks!— Aaryan Nitin Shukla - Human Calculator (@geniusaaryan) March 18, 2025 Now, the question is: can this maths technique make anyone a prodigy?What is Flash Anzan and how does it work? Flash Anzan is a super-fast mental maths technique based on the Japanese abacus (soroban), where you visualise and move numbers in your mind instead of crunching them the usual way. It trains your brain to handle multiple numbers at once, making calculations almost second nature. Since it taps into the right brain, it boosts memory, focus, and processing speed - so much so that some people can add numbers faster than a calculator! According to Nischal Narayanam, founder and mentor at Nischal’s Smart Learning Solutions, Flash Anzan is not just about speed but also about accuracy and cognitive agility. “It’s a powerful tool that trains the right brain, allowing individuals to perform calculations faster than a calculator. Aaryan Shukla’s feat of adding 100 numbers in just 30.9 seconds is a testament to the effectiveness of this method.”Why do children use hand movements while calculating? Not just children, you must have noticed that several math experts while solving problems may use rapid hand gestures. These movements are more than just habit - they serve a critical role in reinforcing memory and speed. “Hand gestures are a powerful tool in mental math, reinforcing memory, visualisation, and speed. In abacus-based methods, students first use a physical abacus but later visualize it while mimicking bead movements with their fingers, making calculations almost automatic. Gestures help recognise patterns, improve focus, and strengthen number processing,” explains Nischal. This practice strengthens pattern recognition, focus, and numerical processing speed. While Shukla’s method aligns with Flash Anzan, other techniques also incorporate gestures. Chisanbop (Korean finger maths) assigns values to fingers for quick calculations, while the UCMAS 6-Finger Technique simulates an abacus through hand movements. Even skip-counting with claps or taps aids number retention.Can anyone learn Flash Anzan, or is it just for prodigies? Breaking six world records in a go – sounds like a feat of the prodigies, but is it though? The Flash Anzan sounds like technique only the prodigies can master, the truth is anyone can learn and perfect this mathematical technique. “Every expert was once a beginner,” says Nischal. “Mental maths is like learning to ride a bike - at first, it feels impossible, but with practice, your brain adapts.” Think of it like learning to ride a bicycle. At first, it seems impossible, but with consistency, your brain adapts. “While breaking world records takes years of training, anyone can use these techniques for faster daily calculations, whether it’s grocery bills, quick estimations, or financial planning ,” adds Nischal. Even 10 minutes of daily abacus or mental maths practice can sharpen focus, boost memory, and improve numerical intuition. So, that solves Anand Mahindra’s query!Are schools teaching Flash Anzan? Flash Anzan is an important part of education in Japan and China, where abacus training is widely integrated. However, it is yet to be mainstream in Indian schools. Dr Aastha Gupta, assistant professor, School of Technology Management and Engineering, SVKMS, NMIMS Chandigarh, mentions that not all schools teach these techniques due to curriculum limitations and lack of trained instructors and school. Therefore, traditional maths methods remain the focus in many educational systems. However, Nischal believes that there is an increasing awareness of mental maths' benefits among parents and students. “Many parents now enroll their children in abacus and Vedic maths programs outside of school to strengthen their numerical abilities,” he says. Dr V Sireesha, professor and Head of the Mathematics Department at GITAM University, emphasises the broader value of such techniques. “Mathematics is not just about numbers - it’s about patterns, logic, and innovative thinking. Methods like Flash Anzan showcase how the brain can process calculations beyond conventional approaches, opening new doors in cognitive learning.” So, can Aaryan Shukla’s technique turn your child into a prodigy? Yes, but with dedication and practice.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 24, 2025Trending Reel

Think about 50 Cent with his signature number 50 ring, Tyga with his big Versace Medusa pendant, Jay-Z with his thick rope chains, or even A$AP Rocky, who now incorporates more diverse jewellery choices like pearls. Jewellery has always been a staple in the music scene,” Akanksha Bhakoo, Yo Yo Honey Singh’s fashion stylist, tells India Today.“Regarding more men wearing jewellery today—yes, as hip-hop and street culture grow in India, more youth are embracing jewellery. Many Indian brands are now catering specifically to men’s jewellery, such as Zillionaire and Dripp Project, among others, offering unique and interesting pieces. A decade ago, most jewellery brands focused on women’s traditional Indian jewellery. Now, with more options available, people have greater freedom to incorporate jewellery into their looks,” Bhakoo adds.The growing penchant for elaborate men’s jewellery pieces – going beyond the regular brooches and bracelets – was also seen at the FDCI’s India Men’s Weekend 2025. Labels like Ashish N Soni, Arjan Dugal, and Antar-Agni by Ujjwal Dubey styled their runway looks with scene-stealing jewellery creations.

Even though she was known for her ‘sexy’ role in 'The Sopranos' and a string of similar performances, De Matteo was the last person many expected to see on the platform. But behind the decision lay a story far removed from glitz and glamour - it was one of financial struggle, survival, and an unexpected suggestion from her teenage daughter.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by DREA DE MATTEO (@dreadematteo) A post shared by DREA DE MATTEO (@dreadematteo) The actress, once a staple in the industry, found herself struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. After refusing to take the vaccine, work opportunities dwindled, and she was left scrambling for a way to support herself and her family. That’s when OnlyFans (a subscription social platform ) became her lifeline. Setting her subscription price at 15 dollars a month, De Matteo went from near financial ruin to a staggering monthly income of over Rs 7,58,84,439 (that’s 7 crore+), excluding commission of the app. But there’s a catch. If you’re assuming this massive sum is linked to nudity, think again. In fact, Drea insists she doesn’t do nudity on OF. “They don't really ask me to do crazy things. Because they know it's me. You know, so I'm talking to their friends, 'Can you make me a video for this person, for that person?' And then there's some guys that want some intense foot stuff,"" De Matteo revealed in an interview with ABC. OnlyFans is an exclusive, subscription-based platform that takes a 20 per cent cut of creators' earnings, allowing fans to connect directly with artists and content creators. The app does allow nudity and porn as part of its content and is known for that, but of late, not just content creators but also celebrities are posting sans-nude content and earning millions, which is contrary to what you'd expect when you open the site. (we’ll get into more details on that soon). ""I signed up [for] that OnlyFans thing, and I thought, wow, I didn't think it was gonna work, but I didn't think anybody would care. I didn't think anybody would care. I'm, you know, Adriana from The Sopranos from 100 years ago,"" De Matteo told ABC News. She further says that she was just three days away from foreclosure, and OnlyFans saved her from financial ruin. Now, like we told you, De Matteo is not alone. Over the past five years, since the pandemic, numerous celebrities have quickly set up their own accounts, earning millions of dollars along the way. Among them are TV personality Blac Chyna, who reportedly made 20 million from her page, comedian Whitney Cummings, actress Denise Richards, 1990s sex symbol Carmen Electra, Real Housewives stars Sonja Morgan and Larsa Pippen, and even DJ Khaled and Cardi B. Yes, you read this right.‘Just purely aesthetic’ The most recent one to join this trend is the Harry Potter actress Jessie Cave, best known for playing Lavender Brown, who appeared in three Harry Potter films. She revealed that she is joined the platform to pay off debt but made it clear that her content will not be sexual in nature.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by JeSsIe CaVE (@jessiecave) A post shared by JeSsIe CaVE (@jessiecave) ""I'm starting an OnlyFans for my hair. It's niche even for me. Join me on this strange new journey,"" she wrote alongside a video on Instagram. The 37-year-old actress explained that her content will focus entirely on her hair, offering subscribers ""best quality hair sounds"" and ""very sensual stuff."" ""I'm going for a very pure aesthetic. There will be no feet or bums involved,"" Cave shares on while having a conversation with her boyfriend.The trend trickling down Now, the trend of opening an OnlyFans account for content beyond pornography is gaining traction online. Today, you can find various queries on Reddit, with people asking about how well non-sexual content does on these apps and many people are making the switch. A notable example is a 24-year-old woman who recently joined this trend - a PhD dropout who made headlines. Zara Dar, a former PhD student, left academia behind for OnlyFans and has earned a staggering one million dollars in a short span of time. Previously a YouTuber with over 100,000 subscribers focusing on machine learning, Dar pursued a master’s in computer science at the University of Texas and was working towards a PhD before deciding to drop out. Frustrated with academia’s emphasis on grant writing over actual research and its limited earning potential, she opted for a different path - one that offered both financial freedom and creative control.Since making the switch, Dar has paid off her family’s mortgage, bought a car, and is now planning to purchase her own home—all while avoiding student loan debt. Interestingly, she also teaches physics (yes, really) on OnlyFans. On top of that, she uploads her content on Pornhub (an adult content website) as well.This trend of uploading non-sexual content on platforms primarily known for adult material is not limited to women. Some men, too, are exploring these platforms without resorting to nudity. For instance, Taiwanese maths teacher Changshu made headlines for teaching mathematics on Pornhub. Has he been successful? Absolutely. His videos attract millions of views, and he reportedly earns around Rs 2 crore per year.advertisement“Since very few people teach math on adult video platforms, and since there are so many people who watch videos on them, I thought that if I uploaded my videos there, a lot of people would see them,” Changshu told Mel Magazine.The 20 per cent commissionThe decision to stand out on a platform where most creators follow a similar formula could be a key reason why many individuals choose to upload their content on these sites. Another factor is the business model of such platforms and their direct connection with the audience.On OnlyFans, for example, creators set their own subscription fees, typically ranging from USD 4.99 to USD 49.99 per month. Fans pay this fee to access exclusive content from their favourite creators.How well does your non sexual content do?byu/calliopebbw00 inonlyfansadviceOnlyFans retains 20 per cent of all transactions, including subscription fees, tips, and pay-per-view (PPV) charges, while the remaining 80 per cent goes to the creator. This model has proven highly lucrative, leading to a surge in content creators joining the platform. In contrast, YouTube reportedly takes a commission as high as 45 per cent.advertisementMoreover, OnlyFans actively promotes itself as a platform for more than just adult content.

Oversharing is not a virtue and often keeps the person doing it on the back foot. A friend was recently on a date with a girl. The highlight of their meeting was their conversation, where the girl went on and on about her life - sharing deets about her first relationship to her last breakup. While the two are happily married now, there’s no denying that the trait was off-putting enough to almost prevent a second date. But now, that’s history. At a time when social media thrives on personal content, it isn't easy to draw the line. While many dismiss oversharing as mere attention-seeking, psychologists suggest it often stems from a deeper emotional need - a silent cry for connection.Why do people overshare? Dr Dhruti Anklesaria, clinical psychologist, explains that oversharing isn’t just about talking too much; it’s often rooted in loneliness and the desire to be seen, heard, and validated. ""When we find ourselves alone and meet someone new, we may instinctively share too much, seeking sympathy or emotional support. But afterward, we might feel regret or awkwardness,” she says. Who knew that childhood experiences could play a part in enhancing the trait? “As kids, we were often told to ‘be quiet’ or not express too many emotions. Even in adulthood, if our feelings are dismissed in relationships, we internalise the idea that no one is willing to listen. Oversharing then becomes a desperate attempt to reclaim our voice,” she explains. Besides childhood experiences, oversharing can also be driven by deeper psychological needs, including the craving for validation. “When people share intimate details, they are subconsciously asking, ‘Am I understood? Do I matter?’ In a world where genuine connections feel rare, oversharing becomes a shortcut to feeling seen and accepted,” she says. They want to share the smallest updates of their life with people and seek validation – be it as basic as their appearance or outfit. Also, experts believe, sometimes, oversharing can be a trait born out of the urge to stay in control of the narrative.Oversharing and emotional struggles While loneliness is a major trigger, oversharing can also signal deeper emotional struggles. Dr. Tugnait identifies several underlying psychological factors:Cognitive dissonance discharge: Some individuals overshare as an unconscious attempt to reconcile conflicting self-perceptions, for example, ""I'm successful but feel like an impostor."" Such dissonance leads to contradictions that subconsciously seek external clarity.Temporal disorientation: Those with unprocessed past trauma may overshare as their brain struggles to distinguish past events from present reality, verbally re-enacting memories to ground themselves in the now.Emotional hoarding: Like compulsive collectors, some oversharers stockpile reactions and responses from others as emotional ""supplies"" to compensate for an internal void they can't name.Proximity seeking through words: For individuals who experienced inconsistent caregiving, oversharing becomes a modern-day attachment behavior by using verbal means to create a sense of physical or emotional closeness that feels otherwise unreachable.Narrative addiction: The act of structuring life experiences into spoken stories can become compulsive, as the storyteller depends on this external framing to maintain a coherent sense of self.How oversharing affects relationships as an adult The positive impactsReveals emotional patterns early: Oversharing can act as a window into deep-seated emotional habits, helping both partners recognise potential challenges before they become major conflicts.Acts as a filter for compatibility: Sharing deeply personal experiences early on can quickly reveal whether two individuals are emotionally aligned or incompatible, saving time in relationships.Encourages self-reflection: When someone shares openly, they often gain clarity about their own emotions and experiences, leading to personal growth within the relationship.Creates a safe space for difficult topics: Some conversations, like past traumas or fears, are hard to bring up. Oversharing can normalise discussing deeper issues, making it easier to address complex emotions later. The negative impactsadvertisementIt can feel emotionally overwhelming: Too much information too soon may overwhelm the other person, making them feel pressured or burdened.Blurs healthy boundaries: Oversharing can lead to a lack of personal space, making the relationship feel emotionally intense or codependent.Reduces emotional mystery: Sharing too much too quickly can remove the gradual process of getting to know someone, which is often essential for relationship growth.Can push people away: If the oversharing feels excessive or one-sided, it may create discomfort and drive the other person to withdraw emotionally or physically.Is oversharing a personality trait?Some individuals may be naturally more expressive than others due to their personality traits, while others develop the habit of oversharing based on par experiences. Extroverts, for example, may naturally share more as a way of forming connections. Moreover, people with massive emotional sensitivity or anxious attachment styles may overshare as a way to seek validation and build an intimate relationship with others.However, Dr Tugnait emphasises that habitual oversharing isn’t necessarily a fixed personality trait. “It can be a learned behaviour shaped by past relationships and environments. Finding a balance between self-expression and emotional boundaries is key to forming healthier interactions.”Finding a healthy balanceWhile oversharing may seem a little off-putting, you have to understand it does not come with the wrong intention. But having said that, understanding its root causes can help individuals develop more mindful communication habits.Dr Anklesaria suggests self-reflection as the first step: “Ask yourself - Am I sharing to connect, or am I seeking validation? Is this an authentic expression, or am I trying to fill an emotional void?”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 26, 2025Trending Reel

It involves taking time to wake up, enjoying a mindful routine, and easing into the day with calmness. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/why-a-slow-morning-is-the-best-way-to-start-your-day-2699468-2025-03-26,"Your alarm rings. You wake up with your phone in your hand. You turn your Wi-Fi on, or maybe it’s already on. You start your day with work or important emails, texts, and whatnot. You head to the washroom, but you don’t leave your phone on the bed—you still want some information overload. So, you scroll through social media for a while. But then reality hits, and you start your race against time, with mornings being the most rushed part of the day.

 



For many, their day doesn't start with the sun; it starts with the screen. Photo: Unsplash
 For many, blaring alarms, checking their phones, gulping down breakfast, and dashing out the door have become a morning ritual. Their day doesn’t start with the sun - it starts with a screen and often ends with it. However, we don’t realise that this chaotic start can set a stressful tone for the entire day, affecting mood, productivity, and even long-term health. How to fight it? Slow mornings. Yes, you read that right.Slow living: Is it practical? Recently, to combat this fast-paced life, many have found various alternatives. Some retire early, take micro-retirements, or even move to villages to fully embrace slow living - a way of life where you focus on doing less and being more mindful about your day rather than simply doing nothing. One famous example is the owner and founder of Zoho, Sridhar Vembu, who, in 2019, moved to a village in the Tenkasi district of Tamil Nadu. But here’s the thing - he’s a billionaire, so he can. Now, let’s be honest. Not everyone can live ‘slowly’ for various reasons. Some might not have the money, while others simply don’t want to move to a rural setting. This is why slow mornings are a step in the right direction.All those economic rationalisations aside, here is why I am here in a village. This is my walk, here's where I do my thinking.The ponds are full and the rice paddies planted. Heavenly. pic.twitter.com/qB9NvddqfM— Sridhar Vembu (@svembu) September 27, 2020 All those economic rationalisations aside, here is why I am here in a village. This is my walk, here's where I do my thinking.The ponds are full and the rice paddies planted. Heavenly. pic.twitter.com/qB9NvddqfM— Sridhar Vembu (@svembu) September 27, 2020 Studies and experts agree that high levels of stress can contribute to increased cortisol levels, which, if prolonged, may lead to anxiety, high blood pressure, and even weakened immune function, causing various health-related issues. In fact, a stressful start to the day is the worst. A 2018 study shows that high levels of morning stress can contribute to increased cortisol levels, which, if prolonged, may lead to anxiety, high blood pressure, and even weakened immune function. Slow mornings, on the other hand, offer a more peaceful and intentional way to begin the day, promoting both mental and physical well-being. Dr Mayurika Das Biswas, a psychologist and manager of the inner transformation department of Freedom from Diabetes, notes that a fast-paced life often leads to numerous physical and mental health issues. ""It tends to be less rewarding because the quality of life diminishes, making experiences feel less fulfilling. Even if friends live nearby, a busy schedule can make it hard to connect and socialise with them. As a result, many people find that a slower-paced life is healthier for their mental well-being and essential for a longer, more satisfying life,"" she adds.But what is a slow morning? A slow morning is about starting the day at a relaxed pace, without the stress of rushing. It involves taking time to wake up, enjoying a mindful routine, and easing into the day with calmness. Instead of jumping straight into work or responsibilities, a slow morning allows for activities that nourish the mind and body, such as journaling, meditation, or a quiet breakfast. However, to achieve this, you need to wake up a little earlier than usual. This means that if your work starts at, let’s say, 9, and you generally wake up at 7:30 (assuming you need half an hour for your commute), you would end up rushing through the entire morning to make sure you're out the door by 8:30 at the latest. However, to embrace slow mornings and start the day at a relaxed pace, you need to wake up by at least 6. This way, you have at least an hour for yourself - without the screen.

 Research suggests that engaging in mindful activities in the morning can enhance cognitive function and emotional resilience throughout the day. A study in 2015 showed that engaging in mindful activities in the morning can enhance cognitive function and emotional resilience throughout the day. Dr Sayali Agashe, a clinical psychologist at Jupiter Hospital, Baner, Pune, tells India Today, “Starting your day at a slow and steady pace allows your brain, body, and mind to ease into action gradually and function efficiently. It helps with a calmer transition into daily activities, reducing overall stress and improving productivity.” She further adds that taking time to plan your day and being mindful provides clarity, a sense of control, and emotional stability, setting a positive tone for the day. “Rushing in the morning can result in neglected physical health, such as skipping breakfast or not exercising, whereas a slow start encourages healthier habits. Beginning your morning gently gives you the time and mental space to connect with yourself, enhancing your effectiveness. Being productive, emotionally stable, and efficient prepares you to take on the day with confidence. It reminds me of an age-old saying: slow and steady wins the race,” says Dr Agashe. Remember, when you give yourself time to ease into the day, your brain moves from a reactive mode to a proactive one, allowing for better decision-making and creativity.How slow mornings can be an alternative to slow living Now, as we told you, not everyone can adopt slow living in its entirety due to work schedules, family responsibilities, and the general fast-paced nature of modern life. This is where slow mornings come in—they provide a more accessible way to incorporate the essence of slow living into daily routines. By dedicating the first hour or so of the day to intentional and unhurried activities, individuals can experience the benefits of a slower lifestyle without making drastic changes. A slow morning acts as an anchor, offering a sense of stability and presence before the external demands of the day take over.advertisementHow to start your morning right?Ankur Warikoo, an entrepreneur and content creator, is one such follower of slow mornings. His morning routine gives him 5 hours for himself. This routine includes everything - from working out to meditation to reading the newspaper.So, how do you start your day the right way? We asked experts, and according to both Dr Agashe and Dr Biswas, here are a few tips:Wake up a little earlierThe first step is, of course, giving yourself extra time in the morning. This allows you to move at a comfortable pace without feeling rushed.Avoid checking your phone immediately Put the phone down. Your phone shouldn’t be the first thing you stare at in the morning. Starting the day without notifications or social media helps to maintain a calm mindset. Numerous studies have shown that mobile phones cause poor sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and stress.Engage in a mindful activity Whether it's stretching, doing yoga, deep breathing, or reading, starting slow mornings by incorporating a peaceful habit can set a positive tone for the day.Enjoy a proper breakfast One of the best ways to embrace slow mornings is by making food for yourself. It can be breakfast or the lunch that you’ll be carrying with you or can be both. Taking the time to prepare and savour a meal rather than eating in a hurry can be a grounding experience.A morning ritual goes a long wayEstablishing a routine that includes self-care and reflection can help bring a sense of purpose and stability, and try to follow it every day. This can include doing meditation, listening to good calming music, and doing skincare.Listen to calming music The type of music that you listen to really impacts your mood. Studies show that music can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, which can lead to feelings of happiness and well-being. So find the music that can help you release dopamine in the morning!Step outside A short walk or simply breathing in fresh air can enhance mood and increase alertness. Sunlight exposure in the morning helps regulate circadian rhythms, improving sleep and energy levels. If you don't want to go outside, open your windows or your balcony and let the sunlight come in.Remember, while not everyone may be able to fully embrace slow living, slow mornings provide a practical and fulfilling way to experience its benefits - one peaceful moment at a time.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Mar 26, 2025

It begins as a child, and when it goes unchecked, it could turn someone 'sinister'.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/not-a-disney-movie-princess-syndrome-can-mess-with-real-life-relationships-2699772-2025-03-27,"More often than not, we tend to casually throw the phrase – papa ki pari (daddy’s princess) – around, not realising it could be an effect of a deep-seated problem. We associate the phrase with privilege, narcissism and materialism, again not virtues to say the least, and by all means, they are. Women/girls who tend to exhibit these traits, for them, the notion of being a ‘princess’ often extends beyond childhood fantasies into adulthood, sometimes with unintended consequences. ‘Princess Syndrome’ - a term used to describe a mindset of entitlement, dependency, and unrealistic expectations - can significantly impact personal and professional growth. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that they are ‘delusional’ regarding the realities of the world and put themselves on a pedestal. Now, this Karen-like behaviour is not born out of nothing. It begins as a child, and when it goes unchecked, it could turn someone ‘sinister’.Whatever is ‘Princess Syndrome’? Princess Syndrome refers to individuals, often women, who expect special treatment, excessive admiration, or privileges without putting in proportional effort. According to Dr Rajendra More (Ph.D, Army Medical Corps-Retd.), it often stems from a childhood marked by excessive pampering, external validation, and social media’s portrayals of idealised princess figures. While anyone can exhibit the traits, most often you will see this common amongst individuals raised in environments where they were shielded from responsibilities or constantly praised without accountability. Psychologists link this syndrome to narcissistic tendencies, a fear of failure, and an aversion to criticism.Adulting isn’t easy for them What are the salient features of adulating? Well, the most important ones are: independence, resilience, and the ability to navigate challenges. However, individuals exhibiting 'Princess Syndrome' often struggle with:Independence and self-sufficiency.Expect others to solve their problems.Find it difficult to accept criticism or failure.Prioritise superficial qualities over emotional intelligence and resilience. “This can lead to difficulty in navigating adult responsibilities, from handling finances to managing relationships maturely,” says Dr More. “Such individuals often expect life to be handed to them on a silver platter,” says Dr Nisha Khanna, psychologist and marriage counsellor. “When reality does not align with their expectations, they experience frustration, dissatisfaction, and even self-esteem issues.”The impact on relationships and social interactions Now, imagine being friends with someone who has ‘Princess Syndrome’ - entitled and spoilt all the time. How long would you put up with them, even as a friend? Now, picture yourself as their partner - how far would you be willing to go? Those with 'Princess Syndrome' often have one-sided friendships where they expect attention and favours without reciprocation. Over time, this creates strain and distance. “In friendships and workplace relationships, individuals with these traits may struggle with collaboration. They often expect others to cater to their needs, which can create tension. Their lack of empathy and excessive self-focus can negatively impact social interactions, making it difficult to build strong connections,” says Sumalatha Vasudeva, psychologist, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Kengeri, Bengaluru. The syndrome can also create unrealistic expectations in dating. Many expect grand gestures and a ‘Prince Charming’ figure to cater to their every need. They view relationships as a means of validation rather than partnerships built on mutual effort. “They also use manipulation, playing the victim by claiming, ‘I don't know how to do this,’ or ‘You handle it better.’ In romantic relationships, they may demand financial dependence without contributing, expecting their partners to fulfill all their needs,” says Dr Khanna.Breaking the cycle As friends or partners, we may often overlook this entitled behaviour and give in to their whims and fancies. However, experts say this is the wrong approach. Instead, they suggest several ways to address and overcome these tendencies.advertisementDevelop self-awareness – Recognising entitled behaviours is the first step toward change.Practice gratitude – Shifting focus from entitlement to appreciation helps build healthier relationships.Build resilience – Facing challenges without expecting rescue fosters personal growth.Contribute to others – Acts of kindness and service create a sense of reciprocity in relationships.Work on independence – Taking responsibility for finances, career, and life choices enhances self-sufficiency.Seek constructive feedback – Accepting and applying criticism allows for continuous self-improvement.Dr Khanna emphasises the role of external intervention: “Friends, partners, and family members should set boundaries. Instead of indulging entitled behaviour, they should encourage self-reliance.”Got a 'papa ki pari' in your group? How do you deal with them?Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 27, 2025

He was professionally successful but struggled to find a life partner. He was convinced that certain sun signs determined personality and compatibility,"" shares Radhika Mohta, a matchmaker and relationship coach from Indore. Mohta, who has been a relationship expert for years, tells India Today that she has ‘definitely’ seen people create stories about why they are drawn to someone. It could be a ‘meet-cute’ in college, an introduction by a mutual friend, and where they convince themselves, ""Oh, I’m an Aquarius, and this sign is supposed to be compatible with me, so let’s give it a shot."" ""Sometimes, we need a story to make a connection feel more believable or possible, and astrology can serve that role,"" says Mohta. If you find yourself thinking the same way, you are not alone. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that astrology has always been a part of our culture. In fact, the art of ‘Kundali Matching’ or horoscope matching has been practised in India since Vedic times. Of course, it has evolved over the years, and it seems like astrology - especially zodiac signs - is gaining preference in the dating scene. A recent in-app survey by Happn, a dating app, found that 51 per cent of Indian singles believe zodiac signs play a significant role in attraction and compatibility, while 27 per cent think they matter but aren’t a dealbreaker.

What sets it apart is its engaging nature and its ability to help individuals combat body dysmorphia, ultimately boosting their confidence.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/pole-dancing-as-fitness-india-2700036-2025-03-28,"When Mishtha, a 23-year-old working professional in Delhi, told her mother about taking pole dance classes on Sundays, she was met with immediate disapproval. Her mother’s reaction was blunt: “Next, are you going to dance in bars?” This has long been (and continues to be) the perception about pole dancing – limited to bars and strip clubs. But a whole lot of youngsters in India are turning to it to enhance their fitness game. A physically demanding activity, pole dancing helps build strength, improve flexibility, manage weight, and enhance core stability. Like a full-body workout, it offers numerous health benefits. What sets it apart, experts say, is its engaging nature and its ability to help individuals combat body dysmorphia, ultimately boosting confidence. Popularised by actors like Jacqueline Fernandez, Yami Gautam, and Malaika Arora, pole dancing is shedding its stigma and emerging as a liberating fitness form across India. Beyond the usual hubs of Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, pole dance studios are now thriving in cities like Kolkata, Ahmedabad, and Dehradun as well.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Jacqueline Fernandez (@jacquelienefernandez) A post shared by Jacqueline Fernandez (@jacquelienefernandez) Learners pay somewhere between Rs 1,500 to Rs 5,000 for a one-to-one class, depending on where they are learning from. Celebrity pole dance trainers charge even more. The charges are comparatively lower for a group class. Experts recommend one to three classes a week, based on the purpose. “If someone wants to take it up as a hobby, one class a week is fine. But if they want to do it for fitness, two to three classes a week is what we suggest,” says Tania Sudan Wahal, a Delhi-based pole trainer who has taught over 7,000 students in a span of six to seven years. After conducting training classes at her home and makeshift studio, Sudan is now all set to launch an elaborate pole dance studio setup in Delhi’s Chirag Enclave – the first of its kind in the capital, she tells India Today.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Tania Sudan’s Pole Studio (@taniaspolestudio) A post shared by Tania Sudan’s Pole Studio (@taniaspolestudio) ""Most people who take our classes either want to learn something new as a hobby or struggle to stick to regular gym routines. They find our classes engaging and easier to commit to,"" she adds. The community of pole dancers on Reddit also echoes this sentiment. “Of all the hobbies and exercises I have tried over the years, pole is the only one I have stuck with consistently. There is a gamified aspect to it—almost like ‘gotta catch ’em all’—when it comes to learning tricks and skills, especially in the beginning. That’s one of the things that makes pole so addictive,” writes a Reddit user on social media. There are various kinds of pole training, like static, spinning, and exotic. What performers do is the exotic variant, which focuses on sensual choreography and is performed in heels. Most trainers in India, however, focus on pole tricks and the sports side of it.

 Kirpit Kaur Arora, a Delhi-based content creator, gave pole dancing a try four years ago while navigating a tragic situation in her life. She does it as a sport now. “I took it up for fun and as a hobby. It was a break from the hectic life and helped me find peace in the chaos. I usually do one or two classes a week but had to take a break after a shoulder injury and to pursue travel. Now, I’m all set to join again in a few weeks,” she tells us. Much like many other pole dance enthusiasts, Arora too met with a lot of hate and judgement online. “I remember how I received a lot of hate comments on my first pole dance video that I posted on social media. It was a lot like: ‘Are you a stripper?’, ‘Will you strip for me?’, ‘Why are you exposing so much?’” Arora shares. Owing to its association with stripping and clubs, one of her elder sisters also suggested she pursue belly dancing instead of pole dancing. “But when she saw me live in the studio and realised how much effort and strength it takes, it changed her perception.” This is a common experience for many pole dance enthusiasts. Some choose not to tell their families that they are learning it, while others hide their videos from relatives on social media. On the contrary, many people are also getting poles installed at their homes. “Our biggest share of sales comes from individuals who wish to exercise, dance and practise within the comforts of their own home. This passion then morphs into becoming an instructor or a competitor – with added incentives if you reach this level,” Kash Suntharamoorthy, global marketing director at X-POLE (a global brand that innovates, designs and manufactures the full range of pole and aerial equipment), tells India Today. “We have definitely been seeing a rise in sales and interest, as this discipline allows you to lose weight, get toned and tap into free movement. Many of our community members rave about how the discipline helps them reconnect with their bodies in ways that other disciplines cannot do,” adds Suntharamoorthy. Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Goa have a high demand for poles. Priyanka Gulabani, an Ahmedabad-based pole dance instructor, shares: “I did not anticipate the crazy response I got in Ahmedabad when I started teaching women over a year ago. I started just with two students, but now I have 50 students.”    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by @flowithpri A post shared by @flowithpri Women of all ages, including those in their 60s, are taking pole dance classes. In Ahmedabad, Priyanka teaches many women in their 40s, as does Delhi-based Sudan. “A 63-year-old woman is the oldest student I have taught, and many women in their 40s and 50s are also learning,” she shares. While age is no bar, it is best to consult a doctor before embarking on your pole dance journey. Many believe that pole dancing isn’t for those on the heavier side of the scale. However, Arora, who has been practising for over four years and has met a lot of pole dance enthusiasts, disagrees. “It’s a body-positive activity. I’ve seen so many women who weigh much more than me excel at it—far better than I do,” she says. “Pole dance is incredibly empowering, especially for women. Being required to strip down for better grip helps combat body dysmorphia. Those who are initially self-conscious often feel thrilled and flattered when they watch videos of themselves mastering a movement. It gives a significant confidence boost,” says Sudan. Bruises, however, are indispensable when one begins to learn pole dancing. “We call them pole kisses. And it’s a rule that if I get bruised on the left side, I should have one on the right side too. The idea is to engage and strengthen both sides of the body,” Arora shares. Men are also taking up pole dance classes now. “In my batch of eight students, we have three men,” Kirpit Kaur Arora shares. Far from being mainstream, even in cities like Delhi, pole dancing as a fitness form is still at a nascent stage. But with a growing number of fitness centres incorporating poles at their facilities and the cropping up of dedicated pole dance studios, the craze is all set to soar.

 Meanwhile, the patrons are also fighting for pole dance to be included in the Olympics, especially after breaking – a style of street dance – debuted at the Olympics in 2024. Pole dancing was recognised as a sport by the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) in 2017 after being essentially confined to cabarets and strip clubs. With breaking making its first Olympic appearance at the Paris Games, pole dancers feel it could soon be their turn to be in the limelight. ""When I see that breaking is at the 2024 Olympics, then pole dance really has a strong case to have a place. When I see what it requires of the body, I don't see the difference between gymnastics with parallel bars and a vertical bar. I think it really has its place,"" Clara Pauchet, a pole dancing instructor in Lannion, Brittany, told Reuters.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Mar 28, 2025ALSO READ |  A trampoline workout is fun, but can leave you with injuries.

Experts share tips on how to slow down, be mindful, and enjoy your meals while improving digestion and overall health.
",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/story/finish-meals-in-under-20-minutes-the-hidden-risks-of-eating-quickly-glbs-2700767-2025-03-28,"You can have your cake and eat it too — just do it slowly. Experts tend to focus on the kinds of foods you can eat to improve your health. But the speed at which you devour your dinner matters just as much. There are risks with eating too fast — think stuck food and the potential to overeat before your brain tells you to stop. (Inhaling your food also risks annoying your slower-paced dining companions or the person who took the time to cook your meal.) Here are some tips from scientists on how to slow down and take a more mindful approach to consuming your diet. How fast is too fast? If you’re the kind of person who can regularly polish off breakfast, lunch or dinner in less than 20-30 minutes, you are eating too fast. “It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to communicate to the brain via a whole host of hormonal signals that it’s full,” said Leslie Heinberg, at the Center for Behavioral Health at the Cleveland Clinic. “So when people eat rapidly, they can miss these signals and it’s very easy to eat beyond the point of fullness.” Why is that a problem? People who eat quickly are likely to swallow more air, Heinberg said, which could lead to bloating or indigestion. Not chewing your food properly can also compromise digestion, meaning you won’t get all of the nutrients from your food. Unchewed pieces of food also could get stuck in your esophagus. Some previous studies have suggested that people who eat quickly have the highest risk of obesity, while the slowest eaters were the least likely to be obese. How can you slow down when eating? For starters, turn off the TV and put down your phone. “If you’re eating while you watch TV, people tend to eat until there’s a commercial or the show is over,” Heinberg said, adding that people are less inclined to pay attention to the body’s own signals that it’s full. “When we do things while we’re eating, we’re eating less mindfully. And that often causes us to eat more.” She said that when people focus exclusively on eating, they tend to enjoy the meal more and eat less. Heinberg also acknowledged the pace at which you eat is often an ingrained habit, but said change is still possible. She suggested things like using your non-dominant hand to eat, trying utensils you might not ordinarily use like chopsticks or taking a deliberate break to drink water when your plate is partially empty. If you have a busy life, it might be unavoidable to eat lunch at a work meeting or snack while running errands. But Sarah Berry, chief scientist at the British nutritional company ZOE, said when possible, “be mindful of what the food tastes and feels like.” “If we’re not fully present, it’s very easy to eat more quickly and not notice how much we’ve consumed,” Berry said. Chew your food, just like mom told you to One of the simplest things to do is to increase the number of bites you take, said Helen McCarthy, a clinical psychologist with the British Psychological Society. “If you chew each mouthful a little bit longer, that will slow down your eating,” she said. The kind of food you eat may also make a difference, pointing out that it’s much easier to eat ultraprocessed or fast foods quicker, because they typically have a softer texture. “It’s hard to eat vegetables and protein at the same rate as something that’s highly processed and requires less chewing,” McCarthy said. Some of her patients also reported an unintentional side effect once they began eating more slowly, referencing one woman who often ate a tube of potato chips every evening. When McCarthy told her to slow down and eat every single chip individually, her patient told her “it was like having a mouthful of claggy chemicals.” “She didn’t find (the chips) enjoyable anymore,” McCarthy said.Published By: Rivanshi RakhraiPublished On: Mar 28, 2025Trending Reel

If yes, great, if not, we need some talking to do as it is trending.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/what-is-brain-flossing-and-can-it-scientifically-reduce-stress-2700777-2025-03-29,"Brain flossing - does the phrase remind you of dental flossing, by any chance? If so, you are quite on the right track, except instead of your teeth, your brain is involved. The trend is taking prevalence on TikTok, and it involves listening to 8D audio or binaural beats to stimulate both brain hemispheres. Our daily struggles have gone way beyond just physical, it’s more of mental exhaustion that we succumb to. The reasons could be too many - personal or professional – but individuals are having difficulty trying to keep up with mental exhaustion. That’s where brain flossing comes into play.What is brain flossing? Just like dental floss gets rid of food stuck between your teeth, brain flossing helps remove lingering worries, distractions, and stress so your mind can function at its best. Think of it as a deep clean for your thoughts - leaving you sharper, more focused, and mentally lighter. A trending wellness practice that aims to clear mental clutter and promote relaxation involves listening to 8D audio. This music is created to feel multidimensional, creating an immersive listening experience in which the sensation of music or sounds feels like they are moving around your head. This auditory experience is believed to stimulate both brain hemispheres, leading to reduced stress and enhanced focus. Several people who have done it claimed they felt refreshed, mentally lighter, and calmer, butHow to do it? Select 8D audio content: You need to choose 8D audio tracks and they are available on platforms like YouTube and Spotify. Use headphones: For the full effect, you should use headphones. Then, you can experience the directional movement of sounds. Find a quiet environment: Sit in a comfortable, quiet space where you can relax without interruptions. Engage in the experience: Close your eyes and focus on the movement of sounds. This will allow your mind to clear and your body to relax. Practice regularly: You need to incorporate these sessions into your routine, especially during times of stress or when seeking mental clarity.Does science back it? While it may be a rage on social media, because why not? If decluttering were just an audio away, who wouldn’t have loved the prospect of it? However, there’s a bit of a let-down because science does not yet back the idea. There’s limited data to prove that this actually works for individuals.So, what else can you resort to? Both Aanya Jai, psychologist, writer, and founder of Pro Behave, and Sumalatha Vasudeva, psychologist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Kengeri, Bengaluru, agree that practices like journaling, breathwork, and mindfulness can be incredibly effective. These techniques have been scientifically proven to benefit many people, helping them reduce stress, enhance focus, and improve overall well-being. Other practices that may help people declutter their brains could include:Meditation: Initially, meditation can be challenging because we are not used to quieting our minds. However, dedicating 15 to 30 minutes a day to focusing on the breath helps clear the mind. Over time, it reduces excessive thoughts, making individuals feel calmer and more grounded.Cognitive games and learning activities: Engaging in puzzles, reading books, and discussing different perspectives stimulates the brain. Playing games is one of the best ways to relieve stress and improve cognitive function. Body movement: Shake out tension to music or stretch gently.Physical exercise: Regular physical activity is crucial for both mental and physical well-being. Exercise promotes mental clarity, enhances mood, and reduces stress.Digital detox: No phone 30 mins before bed to let your mind rest.Cognitive games and learning activities: Engaging in puzzles, reading books, and discussing different perspectives stimulates the brain.

Glimpses of Falguni Shane Peacock's 'Ashen Roses' collection displayed at the Lakme Fashion Week 2025
During the fashion week, Falguni and Shane spoke to India Today about the inspiration behind their latest collection, the new elements to watch out for, and their emphasis on sustainable fashion.Excerpts from the interview:advertisementWhat was the inspiration behind this year’s collection? This collection is a reimagining of our brand’s DNA—familiar, yet entirely new. We’ve taken the signature elements that define us—bold silhouettes, intricate embellishments, glamour—and given them a fresh perspective. It’s about evolution rather than reinvention, pushing the boundaries of what we’ve done before while staying true to the essence of Falguni Shane Peacock. Every detail, from the embroidery to the form, carries our signature but in a way that feels unexpected, modern, and undeniably powerful.Falguni Shane Peacock is synonymous with glamour. How did you amp up the drama for 2025?Glamour is in our DNA, but for this collection, we’ve taken it a notch higher. It builds on our signature aesthetic but with elements that elevate the drama even further. Think exaggerated proportions, unexpected textures and statement details that push the boundaries. Every piece is designed to command attention, ensuring that the wearer owns the room they walk into!advertisementWhat’s one statement piece from this collection that you think will define the season?Rather than a single outfit, it’s a specific element—the trousers. This season, we’ve redefined the role of trousers in womenswear. These trousers challenge conventional styling. They’re versatile yet powerful, proving that pants can be just as transformative as any couture gown.

 



Falguni and Shane say they have redefined the role of trousers in womenswear in their new collection.
From feathers to embellishments, your signature is unmistakable. How have you reinvented it this time?Reinvention is at the heart of what we do. We love taking our signature elements—feathers, intricate embellishments, sculpted silhouettes—and giving them a fresh twist, presenting them in ways we haven’t before. Every collection carries a piece of our past, but always through a new lens, reimagined with unexpected details and modern craftsmanship. This time is no different. You’ll see familiar elements, but in ways you wouldn’t expect. All we can say is—wait and watch the show. You’ll know exactly what we mean.Your designs have graced international red carpets. Did global fashion trends influence this collection in any way?advertisementWe don’t follow trends—we create experiences. At Falguni Shane Peacock, we never set out to chase what’s “in.” Instead, we focus on pushing boundaries, crafting pieces that feel unique, out of the box and unmistakably us. Every collection is a deep dive into creativity, designed to give the wearer something they’ve never experienced before—something exquisite, something unmatched. And when that resonates on global red carpets, it’s not because we followed a trend—it’s because we stayed true to our vision.With OTT fashion on the rise, how do you ensure your designs remain both extravagant and elegant?Extravagance and elegance don’t have to be opposites—they can, and should, coexist. Our RTW and advanced contemporary edit is designed to bring couture-level drama into everyday wear—having pieces that are bold yet wearable, striking yet sophisticated. It’s all about balance. We combine statement-making details with easy silhouettes, ensuring that our designs transition seamlessly from 9 am to 9 pm. Whether it’s power tailoring with fine embellishments or fluid dresses with an edge, we make sure extravagance feels natural, never overdone and looks elegant.Sustainability is a growing focus in the industry. How have you incorporated conscious design into this year’s show?advertisementWe believe sustainability is the only way to go forward. At Falguni Shane Peacock, we’re continuously working towards making our processes more responsible. While we’re striving to be 100% sustainable, we’ve already integrated the 3R approach—reduce, reuse and recycle—into our production and operations. We ensure that we only use what’s needed, avoiding excess procurement. We reuse as much as possible, ensuring that nothing goes to waste. And we rehash or recycle materials left behind in the production process, giving them a new life. We are fully committed to creating fashion with purpose.If you had to describe the Falguni Shane Peacock muse for 2025, what three qualities would define her?She’s FSP—fearless and fierce, strong and positive. Fearless, because she moves through life with the same bold energy as our logo of the panther—unapologetic, untamed and always ready to take sartorial risks. Strong, because she trusts her instincts, makes her own choices and never waits for permission to stand out. And positive, because she believes in the power of possibility, of saying yes to new experiences and embracing life with an unstoppable spirit. She doesn’t follow trends—she defines them on her own terms.advertisementCollaboration has become a buzzword in fashion. If you could collaborate with one artist or designer, who would it be and why?Banksy—because fashion, like art, should challenge, disrupt, and provoke thought. Banksy’s ability to create impact through subversion, storytelling and striking visuals aligns with the way we design. A collaboration like this would be a meeting of two worlds: the raw, provocative energy of street art and the meticulous, high-glamour precision of couture. It would be a dialogue, a movement, and a statement that fashion is as much about meaning as it is about form.Fashion week is all about pushing boundaries. What’s one bold fashion rule you think people should break this season?The idea that there aren’t rules in fashion at all. Fashion, for us, is all about breaking the mould. We have always championed individuality. Forget the “dos” and “don’ts” you’ve been told and do what speaks to you. Life is too short to blend in, so stand out in a way that feels authentic to you. Because the best style isn’t about following the trends—it’s about making your own!Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Mar 29, 2025ALSO READ |  Anamika Khanna's AK | OK show is a love letter to the white shirtTrending Reel

Falguni and Shane say they have redefined the role of trousers in womenswear in their new collection.
From feathers to embellishments, your signature is unmistakable. How have you reinvented it this time?Reinvention is at the heart of what we do. We love taking our signature elements—feathers, intricate embellishments, sculpted silhouettes—and giving them a fresh twist, presenting them in ways we haven’t before. Every collection carries a piece of our past, but always through a new lens, reimagined with unexpected details and modern craftsmanship. This time is no different.

Did global fashion trends influence this collection in any way?advertisementWe don’t follow trends—we create experiences. At Falguni Shane Peacock, we never set out to chase what’s “in.” Instead, we focus on pushing boundaries, crafting pieces that feel unique, out of the box and unmistakably us.

Fearless, because she moves through life with the same bold energy as our logo of the panther—unapologetic, untamed and always ready to take sartorial risks. Strong, because she trusts her instincts, makes her own choices and never waits for permission to stand out. And positive, because she believes in the power of possibility, of saying yes to new experiences and embracing life with an unstoppable spirit. She doesn’t follow trends—she defines them on her own terms.advertisementCollaboration has become a buzzword in fashion. If you could collaborate with one artist or designer, who would it be and why?Banksy—because fashion, like art, should challenge, disrupt, and provoke thought. Banksy’s ability to create impact through subversion, storytelling and striking visuals aligns with the way we design.

 Filmmaker Karan Johar and actress Tamannaah Bhatia walked the ramp for the celebrated couturiers, who are known for their glamorous and extravagant design sensibilities. At the show, models walked the ramp clad in cropped jackets with razor-sharp tailoring, power-shouldered minis, feathered overcoats, and embellished gowns. It was essentially a display of statement separates—designed to be layered, interchanged, and reimagined.

This shift reflects a larger transformation in the country's fashion landscape and, to a great extent, is driven by demand. As Indian consumers seek luxury that extends beyond grand occasions, designers known for their exquisite craftsmanship are now venturing into refined yet wearable everyday fashion. Tarun Tahiliani is one of them. Tarun Tahiliani recently launched his pret label, OTT, which he assures is Indian but with a twist - an answer to today’s needs. The designer, who showcased his latest collection on Day 4 of the ongoing Lakme Fashion Week X FDCI, talked about his pret label, his collection and much more Excerpts from the interview:OTT is described as a celebration of the urban woman's sartorial needs. What inspired you to create this pret-a-porter line, and how does it reflect the essence of “India Modern”? It takes Indian techniques and drapes and reinterprets them in a simple, modern way. It’s designed for the Indian body, complements our skin tones, and is something I’ve been working on for years. But it needed its own identity because, within our stores, it would get lost or drowned in the bridal space. So now, OTT stands on its own - created for women’s everyday-to-dinner wardrobe needs. I hope these pieces mix and match seamlessly with their own wardrobes and with the collections I produce season after season, eventually defining a very cool, India-modern way of dressing. advertisement   View this post on Instagram           A post shared by India Today (@indiatoday)After the grand launch at 2024 LFW, what new can we expect this year, and what inspired it?This marks our 30th year, so we’re going even bigger. I think our studio has made incredible strides in technique and in understanding fit - which, to me, is a designer’s true role. We want to push that even further.Luxury is often associated with exclusivity, but OTT emphasizes wearable luxury. How did you strike a balance between opulence and everyday comfort in this collection?Luxury abroad might be associated with caviar, but for me, having a fresh roti made just before I sit down to dinner is just as luxurious - if not more. It’s about what we consider luxury in our culture. I don’t think luxury has to be out of reach; that’s a myth. Luxury is about how something is made, how it feels, and how true it is to its purpose. Everyday clothes need to be priced appropriately - there’s no reason for them to be unreasonably expensive. This isn’t a game; it’s about answering a need. And that’s what good businesses do. So, the balance isn’t about opulence - it’s about timelessness, beauty, and elegance. It’s Indian, but with a twist. It’s an answer to today’s needs.

Whether it's for better or worse, well, that's a discussion for another time. But from situationships to nanoships, dating, dear friends, has moved far beyond just liking someone or being compatible. Both men and women are now extremely particular about certain aspects of life, and for them, these are simply non-negotiable. Even something as small as a zodiac sign can be a dealbreaker. Just as DINKWADs (Dual Income, No Kids, With a Dog) are on the rise, people today feel increasingly obliged to ask potential partners whether they like animals - especially dogs or cats - before considering dating them. If not, it’s often a swipe left, no matter how well they match otherwise. Among the many factors that influence modern dating, such as political views, food preferences, and parenting outlook, one’s fondness (or lack thereof) for pets can be a deal-maker or breaker. People are bonding over their love for golden retrievers, matching with fellow cat lovers, and heading out on pet-friendly dates. More than ever, our furry (or feathered) friends are playing a crucial role in relationships. In fact, data from Tinder India reveals a 7.6% increase in bios asking, “Do you have a pet?” between January 2024 and February 2025. According to Tinder’s Year in Swipe 2024, dogs remain the most mentioned pet, followed closely by cats. But it’s not just pet owners weighing in - bios with phrases like “Don’t have one, but love them” or “Want a pet” highlight that even those without furry friends still consider them an essential factor in dating compatibility. Remember Must Love Dogs?The icebreaker From witty bios to adorable profile pictures, pets make breaking the ice effortless. And it’s not just about clever lines - adding a pet to a profile picture can instantly spark engagement. Whether it’s “Who’s the adorable pup in your photo?” or “Tell me your dog’s name, and I’ll guess your personality,” pet-focused conversations are making first moves easier and more fun - just like Samahita Das and Adil Sen Sharma’s story, who met through a dating app. Guess what made them swipe right? Their respective profile pictures which featured their little furry friends. “He had these cute photos with his dog Frooti, whom he rescued from the streets three years ago. That’s how we connected and started talking. It’s been two years since we met and six since we have been living together with our dogs. Our dogs, too, have grown fond of each other,” says Das. However, for Sharma, the picture was a little different initially. “For me, I needed someone who could share my love for dogs, as I also do a lot of rescue work and spend a good amount of time doing it. My partner had to understand that. Someone who dislikes dogs would never have been the right fit."" ""A few people swiped left because of my passion, and I don’t blame them - it’s a preference, after all. But ignorance and insensitivity were another matter. I remember someone once telling me, ‘All street dogs should be killed for the ruckus they create.’ I blocked her without a second thought,"" was Sharma's startling conversation.A sign of compassion and empathy Do you remember what one of the most famous characters from the Amazon Prime series Paatal Lok, Hatoda Tyagi (Abhishek Banerjee), said about a man and a dog's relationship? “If a man loves dogs, he is a good man. If a dog loves a man, he is a good man.” This has a brilliant context in the series (watch it if you haven’t yet), and IRL, it only highlights the kindness and compassion in a person – the traits which are very important for a person to exhibit, agree? A love for animals often signals kindness, responsibility, and a nurturing nature, all traits that stand out in online dating. Maitrayee Sen, 31, a psychology Ph.D scholar, recalls a conversation involving a cat parent whom she met on a dating app. “I called him very randomly, like I did every day, and he had just got back home from work. We just started talking when he cut the conversation short and told me, ‘My cat has just got her period, give me some time. I will just clean her, give her some food and call you.’ Our relationship might not have evolved, but that conversation really moved me.”No room for ambiguity While pets can enhance your relationship, make sure about drawing certain lines before plunging into relationships where pets are involved.advertisementAcknowledge who the pet truly belongs to: In relationships where pets are shared - or were originally a gift from an ex - it’s crucial to have an open conversation about who is better suited to care for the animal, both emotionally and practically. “The dog may have been a gift, but if you’ve been the primary caregiver, it’s okay to speak up,” says Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing.Visiting your ex for the pet? Set clear limits: Still stopping by your ex’s place just to see the dog? It may seem harmless, but it can complicate emotions. “If it’s keeping you emotionally stuck or causing confusion, it might be time to create some distance,” Dr. Chandni advises. “Consider what’s best for both you and your pet in the long run.”Let your pet guide you into a new chapter: A shared love for pets can also open doors to new relationships. “Including your pet in your dating profile, going on pet-friendly first dates, and embracing them as part of your journey can be a beautiful way to connect with someone new,” says Dr Tugnait.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Mar 31, 2025

Shantnu & Nikhil, too, presented their collection 'Piazza Nova', marking five years of their pret brand, S&N by Shantnu & Nikhil.This show is more than just a collection - it’s a celebration of the brand’s journey, from military-inspired tailoring to contemporary rebellion. Inspired by the effortless elegance of Italian fashion, Piazza Nova reinvents the bandhgala, elevates waistcoats, and champions mix-and-match styling, all while staying rooted in craftsmanship.In an exclusive conversation with India Today, the ace designers opened up about their pret brand, sustainable fashion, and their latest collection.Excerpts from the interviewYour first runway show post starting S&N during the pandemic. Tell us a bit about how special this is and the prep that went behind it.advertisementIn 2020, when the world came to a halt, we chose to move forward. Launching India’s first prestige-pret brand during a global crisis was a bold decision - one that defied logic but felt instinctively right. What followed was nothing short of extraordinary: a movement that transformed the perception of Indian menswear, leading to 17 stores, a thriving e-commerce presence, and a growing community that shares our vision of democratic fashion.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Lakm Fashion Week (@lakmefashionwk)Yet, something was missing- the energy of the runway, the electricity of a live audience, and the raw storytelling that only a fashion show can bring to life. Piazza Nova marks the moment where it all comes full circle. It’s not just about a collection; it’s about reclaiming the pulse of our brand on the runway. This show is a tribute to our 25-year journey and 5 years of S&N - an evolution of our signature aesthetic, where military influences meet contemporary rebellion.The preparation behind this show has been just as meticulous as our craftsmanship - every detail, from silhouette construction to accessories, has been designed to reflect the sophistication of the modern Indian man. The excitement isn’t just about presenting a collection; it’s about celebrating an ideology that has shaped who we are today.S&N is known for its seamless blend of heritage and contemporary fashion. How does this collection reflect that signature ethos while pushing boundaries?advertisementHeritage is our foundation, but innovation is our driving force. Piazza Nova challenges conventions while staying rooted in our signature structured drapes and military influence.This season, we’ve redefined the bandhgala—styling it with shirts and ties to create a sharp, international appeal. Waistcoats have been elevated to jacket-like structures, while mix-and-match styling is at the core of the collection. Every piece is designed for versatility, allowing men to express themselves through layered, thoughtful dressing.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Lakm Fashion Week (@lakmefashionwk)Accessories are pivotal in completing the look, adding a layer of refinement that enhances individuality. Our signature crests and tapes are not just embellishments; they are statements - symbols of power and precision that embody the S&N identity. This collection doesn’t just blur lines between tradition and modernity - it redraws them entirely.Every collection tells a story. What narrative are you hoping to convey on the runway this season?Piazza Nova is a tribute to our journey - an evolution of the signature aesthetic that has redefined Indian menswear couture. Our sartorial revolution began in 2016 with The Cabinet Mission, laying the foundation for a new-age interpretation of structured drapes and military-inspired detailing. This vision was further amplified through collections like Tribe, Independence, and The Regiment, where we seamlessly blended fluidity with precision tailoring, infusing menswear with a regal yet contemporary edge.advertisementWith Piazza Nova, we take this narrative forward, refining our craft while staying true to the essence of modern Indian couture. This collection is a testament to impeccable tailoring and craftsmanship, designed to exude power, elegance, and versatility. But more than just fashion, Piazza Nova is about redefining the way men embrace luxury and self-expression.Our journey took another bold leap in 2020 with the launch of S&N by Shantnu Nikhil, making our aesthetic more accessible to a wider audience. Piazza Nova is the bridge between our past and future, showcasing how we continue to evolve while remaining rooted in the philosophy that started it all.Were there any specific cultural, architectural, or artistic inspirations that shaped this collection?The essence of Piazza Nova was sparked at Pitti Uomo, where we witnessed a masterclass in effortless elegance. The men there weren’t just well-dressed; they carried themselves with an unspoken confidence - an effortless sophistication that felt instinctive.That experience led us to imagine a seamless blend of Indian sartorial heritage with the finesse of Italian dressing. We wanted to bring that world into ours, where the sharpness of European tailoring meets the richness of Indian craftsmanship. The result is a collection that redefines Indian menswear with a global outlook - bold yet classic, structured yet fluid.advertisementHow do you strike the perfect balance between tradition and innovation in your designs?For us, tradition isn’t about looking back - it’s about evolving forward. We’ve built a design language that is both progressive and rooted, allowing us to create silhouettes that feel powerful yet effortless.Our strength lies in crafting a balance, where military influences meet fluid draping, where sharp tailoring coexists with a rebellious spirit. Every element we introduce, from our signature crests to the way we construct a bandhgala, is intentional. We don’t believe in excess; we believe in precision.What makes S&N by Shantnu Nikhil stand apart is this ability to shape a narrative, one that reflects the modern Indian identity. Bold, confident, and unapologetically contemporary.From the first sketch to the final stitch - what’s the one moment that made you say, ""Yes, this is it!""?It was during one of our final fittings when we saw the bandhgala styled with a crisp shirt and tie. That moment felt like a revelation - it was everything we envisioned: a bold reinterpretation of heritage that felt instinctively modern. Seeing the sharp cuts, the way the fabric moved, and the confidence it exuded - it was then we knew, this is the future of Indian menswear.advertisementConsumers today are more conscious than ever. How is S&N incorporating sustainability into its design and production process without compromising on luxury?Sustainability, for us, is about creating a circular ecosystem - one where fashion is as responsible as it is luxurious.

Tired of their world (read: relationships), filled with disappointments, both the protagonists went to a platform called HomeExchange, where they ended up swapping homes and finding a different future. But what if we told you that HomeExchange is very much a real, Paris-based app that is transforming the way people travel? True to its name, HomeExchange allows you to exchange your home or living space with someone else. Hugely popular in the West, this platform has now launched in India and is becoming a new way Indians are travelling by giving them the chance to experience the thrill of home-swapping. Who knows, maybe you’ll find the love of your life along the way?    Ever imagined swapping your flat for a tranquil beach house? Now, you can do it IRL. Unlike hotels, HomeExchange allows you to swipe through options, connect with homeowners, and if both parties feel it's a good fit, you swap homes. If you’re familiar with modern dating apps, HomeExchange feels strikingly similar - you swipe until you find your perfect match. Except this time, it’s your dream home for that long-awaited holiday. After its launch in India, early data shows the highest traction coming from major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Goa, and Bangalore. The platform, however, is still exploring the ideal demographic fit within the country. “Globally, we’re clearly the market leader,” says Emmanuel Arnaud, CEO of HomeExchange to India Today. “Just our name - HomeExchange - is the name of the category, and we’ve acquired eight of our competitors. So, we have a very dominant position globally,” he adds.

 



HomeExchange, a global home-swapping network, launched in India on February 4, 2025. Photo: Unsplash
 While HomeExchange may be a new concept for many Indians, Arnaud is optimistic about its potential. The platform offers an economic advantage over traditional travel accommodation. Let’s look at some numbers. HomeExchange only requires a yearly fee of Rs 7,500, after which you can swap homes as many times as you wish within that year. This flat fee allows members unlimited home exchanges for a full year, making it an affordable alternative to pricey hotels and vacation rentals. Now here we would like to mention that the app, apart from just the exchange, also allows you to pick someone's home and live there while you're travelling, like a non-reciprocal exchange.  As the first phase, Arnaud's company plans to list as many as 5,000 homes from India in their app.

 “For families with kids, being able to exchange homes with another family means you get a fully equipped space - whether it's a high chair, stroller, or even a PlayStation for teenagers. It’s convenient, comfortable, and feels like a home away from home,” Arnaud explains. HomeExchange also caters to niche communities, even in India. Golfers swap homes near courses, surfers find spots with big waves, and even teetotallers can connect with like-minded hosts. The emphasis is on creating personalised experiences based on common interests. “This is not just about being cheap. People with amazing homes also use HomeExchange, it’s a different relationship to travel and hospitality,” Arnaud adds. Unlike Airbnb or homestays, HomeExchange thrives on community building and shared interests, according to its CEO. Whether it's families travelling with kids or surfers chasing the best waves, the idea is to match lifestyles rather than just properties.Challenges in the Indian market Despite its early success in India, there are several hurdles HomeExchange must overcome to truly integrate into the local travel ecosystem. While urban centres are a natural fit for the platform, the more rural areas of India may take longer to adopt home-swapping as a concept, Arnaud believes. The idea of sharing your home with a stranger may also be a foreign concept for many in India (including us), where traditional hospitality values are more prominent. Moreover, security will also be a concern for a lot of Indians, as many YouTube reviews show the exchange going terribly wrong as well. This is where the social nature of HomeExchange comes into play - Arnaud says that this isn’t just about trading spaces; it’s about fostering connections and understanding different cultures, something that can be very attractive in a culturally rich country like India (that means you can swap with someone living abroad as well).What does the future hold?HomeExchange has the potential to revolutionise the way Indians travel. With more affordable travel options and the unique experience of living like a local, the platform could well become a staple in the Indian travel scene, as many are already opting for it.advertisementAs travel trends shift towards more sustainable and immersive travel experiences, ever since the Covid-19, swapping homes rather than staying in hotels or resorts has aligned with the growing demand for more authentic, personalised journeys, even in India.The model has already proven successful in Europe and North America. In India, where domestic travel is booming, HomeExchange could offer not just affordability but also a unique cultural exchange that appeals to millennials and families alike, and if the app’s global success is anything to go by, Indians might just swipe right at this new way of travelling.What do you think of this new way of travelling?Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Apr 1, 2025Must Watch

Yes, we were to discuss Benny Blanco, but still, tell us, have you? The series has been winning a lot of praise for various reasons, including its rich script, stellar performances, and captivating screenplay. But beyond these marvellous elements, Yang Gwan-sik’s (played by Park Bo-gum) character has found a special place in viewers' hearts. Why? Well, he is what most women would call a ‘green forest.’ Small gestures, lovable nature, always taking care of the little things, supportive - in short, he embodies what a doting partner or husband should be (and no, we’re not saying this - the Internet is).

 Now, that was a character from a fictional world, but in real life too, someone is ticking all the boxes of being a ‘green flag’ boyfriend. Dear readers, it’s none other than Benny Blanco - record producer, songwriter, and most importantly, Selena Gomez’s ‘green flag’ fiance - who is giving every husband, partner, and boyfriend sleepless nights. His emotional intelligence has become a major talking point, especially after his appearance on a podcast with Jay Shetty, where his partner was also present.

While he may not fit the stereotypical ""tall, dark, and handsome"" mould, his recent interviews have showcased something far more attractive: playfulness, humility, kindness, and an authentic warmth that’s making women everywhere say – That’s what we want! But what exactly makes him so desirable?Emotional availability Dr. Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based psychologist, breaks it down: “In today’s world, women are increasingly looking for men who are emotionally available, caring, and affectionate. A man’s ability to show vulnerability and warmth makes a woman feel emotionally and physically safe in a relationship. Of course, finances, humour, and intelligence also play significant roles, but for a long-term relationship, key traits like trust, emotional and physical comfort, respect, kindness, ambition, work-life balance, and humour matter the most.” This explains why Benny Blanco has become such a standout figure. He doesn’t just support Selena Gomez; he actively participates in their relationship with intentionality and self-awareness. During the interview, Blanco says, “I'm aware of her strengths, and I'm aware of her weaknesses. And what I try to do is surround her with a lot of things to help her. So, if she's away, and I have to go to a dinner, then a party, then this thing, then that thing, it's a simple text in between each, just saying, ‘Hey babe, I'm going to this next thing, I'm thinking about you.’ Where couples start to struggle is when they miss that text. They don’t call the person. They wait until the next day. It’s just like, I know what she needs to succeed, so I’m going to help her succeed.” “She doesn't need a lot. She's like the easiest person in the world. But I know she wants to talk to me before she goes to bed. She wants me to say ‘I love you.’ She wants me to text her if I wind up having to stay somewhere two hours late. Just a simple, take out your phone and ba ba ba ba ba, done,” he adds.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Beyond The Interview | Podcast | Newsletter (@beyondtheinterview)What women really want in a partner A post shared by Beyond The Interview | Podcast | Newsletter (@beyondtheinterview) To the men out there always discussing how women are confused and whimsical about what they want - for them: Women will always tell you what they want, you just need to have an ear for it, men. And this, dear readers, is what Blanco believes. According to Dr. Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and life coach, his emotional intelligence makes him stand out. ""Because he’s showing us what it actually looks like when a man is emotionally intelligent, self-aware, and fully present. In a world where romantic partners are often emotionally unavailable, Benny stands out by doing something radical: he listens - and not performatively.” Dr. Tugnait highlights some key traits that women increasingly seek in their partners:advertisementPurposeful presence: Not just physical presence, but an emotional attendance that's deliberate rather than distracted. This goes beyond simply ""being there"" to actively engaging with a partner's emotional landscape without waiting for emergencies to tune in.Preparatory partnership: The willingness to do preliminary emotional work before and during relationships. Benny's therapist-guided list shows someone who approached love as something to prepare for, not merely stumble into it when convenient.Reflective receptivity: The capacity to receive emotional information without immediately reframing it through one's own perspective. This differs from problem-solving; it's about absorbing another's reality without defensiveness or redirection.Strength-honouring support: The ability to stand alongside a partner's capabilities rather than trying to rescue or manage them. This represents a fundamental respect for a woman's agency while still offering genuine support.Emotional cartography: The skill of mapping and remembering a partner's emotional terrain, noting triggers, joys, and needs without requiring constant reminders. This demonstrates a commitment to understanding another's inner world as thoroughly as one's own.What sets him apart is the fact that he makes his partner feel seen, adored and understood.During the podcast, Blanco also explained that during Selena’s first few trips away, she was still building trust in the relationship. However, he soon realised something - ""when you start dating someone, you’re not only dating them, you’re also dating every single person they’ve ever dated.""""You’re getting every piece of baggage that person’s had. With partners, parents, this that. I had to find a way to build that trust with her, not being overbearing but make it feel real and make her actually believe it and vice versa,"" he added.If Blanco is not boyfriend goals, we don’t know who is. Have you checked his Instagram yet, bdw?

 



While most men prefer to keep their relationships low-key, Benny Blanco's Instagram feed tells a different story.
advertisementWhy emotional intelligence in men mattersThere was a time when emotional intelligence was an attribute not associated with men; It was an undervalued aspect. However, times are changing.Dr. Tugnait emphasises that “The era of indifference as strength is fading, and emotional intelligence is quickly becoming a marker of relational maturity.”Here’s why it’s crucial:It builds emotional safety: A man who listens, validates, and supports without judgment creates a space where vulnerability can thrive.It reduces emotional labour imbalance: When men take emotional responsibility, they prevent women from carrying the entire mental and emotional load.It deepens everyday connection: Small, intentional acts like check-in texts or verbal affirmations show care in a way that grand gestures can’t always capture.It honours individuality: Emotionally intelligent men don’t try to “fix” strong women; they support them.It redefines masculinity: Strength is no longer about emotional detachment but about being self-aware and relationally mature.Flip side of emotional intelligenceWhile high emotional intelligence among men is a boon in any relationship and can nurture a happy household, there could be an alternate reality.“It’s also important to note that people with high emotional intelligence can sometimes use it to manipulate others. They understand strengths and weaknesses well, making it easy for them to push the right buttons. If a person has strong integrity, they can use emotional intelligence positively, making a relationship more meaningful. But the level of connection and receptiveness from both partners is equally important in maintaining a strong bond,” Dr Khanna concludes.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Apr 2, 2025

Well, the legendary couturier known for his opulent designs presented such creations under his year-old pret label, OTT, at Lakme Fashion Week 2025, held in collaboration with the Fashion Design Council of India in Mumbai.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Lakm Fashion Week (@lakmefashionwk)Tahiliani is among an array of top Indian luxury designers who have now added a pret line alongside their high-end fashion labels (which primarily feed the country's strong wedding wear hunger). The pret lines, known as bridge-to-luxury labels, on the contrary, offer ready-to-wear pieces ranging from elevated everyday staples to occasion wear at a fraction of the cost of an ensemble from their primary label.It is all about separates that one can wear on repeat, unlike the one-time-wear wedding outfits.Lakme Fashion Week 2025 was a testament to India’s booming bridge-to-luxury label scenario. Rahul Mishra, Anamika Khanna, and Shantnu & Nikhil presented their bridge-to-luxury labels, AFEW, AK|OK, and S&N, respectively, at the fashion extravaganza. Even Falguni Shane Peacock presented a pret collection from their ready-to-wear line, which now has a newly opened dedicated store in Delhi as well.

This rise in bridge-to-luxury brands in India says a lot about the changing ways in which India is now consuming fashion.For Tahiliani, who has dabbled in pret with certain collections before launching a dedicated line, it is his extreme fondness for this side of fashion. But it is also a business move to reach a wider audience—all thanks to Gen Z and Millennials’ penchant for accessible luxury, which has encouraged designers to launch pret lines.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Tarun Tahiliani (@taruntahiliani)“Over the years, we've explored pret-a-porter in various capacities, aiming to make high-quality design more accessible. However, it was only recently that we felt the market was truly ready for a dedicated luxury pret line. OTT represents this evolution—a line that embodies the essence of India Modern, blending our rich heritage with contemporary sensibilities. The inspiration stemmed from a desire to dress the new global Indian who values both tradition and modernity in their everyday wardrobe,” Tahiliani tells India Today.Lines like OTT bridge the gap between high fashion and everyday wear—a gap that has been prevalent owing to high fashion’s focus on wedding couture.“The Indian fashion landscape is witnessing a significant shift towards accessible luxury. As the urban Indian consumer becomes more discerning, there's a growing demand for products that offer both quality and value,” says Tahiliani.“While luxury couture remains exclusive, pret and bridge-to-luxury lines offer accessibility to a broader audience. Not every fashion enthusiast can afford a Rs 5–20 lakh lehenga, nor does every past customer require another wedding ensemble. However, they might want a designer outfit for Diwali parties, intimate gatherings, or other special occasions. Bridge-to-luxury collections provide an entry point for these aspirational consumers,” Sunil Sethi, Chairman of the Fashion Design Council of India, tells us.“Historically, international fashion houses have embraced multiple labels as a business model. Take Giorgio Armani, for instance—his empire includes Armani Exchange, Emporio Armani, Giorgio Armani, and even Armani Casa for home dcor. This multi-tiered approach allows designers to cater to different market segments while maintaining a strong brand identity,” Sethi adds.Citing designer JJ Valaya’s example, Sethi shares how this business model is already a success in India. Valaya’s ready-to-wear line, JJV, has expanded with over 8–10 stores in just a couple of years.Gen Z's focus on style, their rising disposable income, and their willingness to spend on accessible luxury create the ideal opportunity for luxury brands to expand their reach.Younger audiences prioritise affordability, versatility, and statement pieces over traditional, occasion-specific couture. So, designers are adapting by introducing contemporary, print-heavy, and streetwear-inspired collections.“OTT is designed to reach a broader audience by offering versatile, high-quality pieces at more accessible price points. While our couture line caters to bespoke needs, OTT allows us to connect with individuals seeking everyday luxury that aligns with their dynamic lifestyles,” says Tahiliani.

“Luxury couture is handcrafted, exclusive, and produced in limited quantities. In contrast, bridge-to-luxury collections allow for scaled production, making them more affordable and widely available,” adds Sethi.While high demand and affordability factors are certainly behind the thriving bridge-to-luxury label scene, it also helps designers in securing collaborations and investments.“In today’s market, designers need collaborations. Brands seeking partnerships often prefer designers with broader appeal. A bridal-only designer might not be the best fit for a youth-centric smartphone brand, whereas a bridge-to-luxury designer with a streetwear line could be a perfect match,” explains Sethi.Sethi explains that their vision of connecting with younger generations is why they chose Ishaan Khatter, rapper KRSNA, and rapper Karma as showstoppers at the Blender’s Pride Fashion Tour show in Guwahati.If you think spending lakhs on a wedding lehenga is the only way to add Tarun Tahiliani to your wardrobe, think again.

Even Falguni Shane Peacock presented a pret collection from their ready-to-wear line, which now has a newly opened dedicated store in Delhi as well.

This rise in bridge-to-luxury brands in India says a lot about the changing ways in which India is now consuming fashion.For Tahiliani, who has dabbled in pret with certain collections before launching a dedicated line, it is his extreme fondness for this side of fashion. But it is also a business move to reach a wider audience—all thanks to Gen Z and Millennials’ penchant for accessible luxury, which has encouraged designers to launch pret lines.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Tarun Tahiliani (@taruntahiliani)“Over the years, we've explored pret-a-porter in various capacities, aiming to make high-quality design more accessible. However, it was only recently that we felt the market was truly ready for a dedicated luxury pret line. OTT represents this evolution—a line that embodies the essence of India Modern, blending our rich heritage with contemporary sensibilities. The inspiration stemmed from a desire to dress the new global Indian who values both tradition and modernity in their everyday wardrobe,” Tahiliani tells India Today.Lines like OTT bridge the gap between high fashion and everyday wear—a gap that has been prevalent owing to high fashion’s focus on wedding couture.“The Indian fashion landscape is witnessing a significant shift towards accessible luxury. As the urban Indian consumer becomes more discerning, there's a growing demand for products that offer both quality and value,” says Tahiliani.“While luxury couture remains exclusive, pret and bridge-to-luxury lines offer accessibility to a broader audience. Not every fashion enthusiast can afford a Rs 5–20 lakh lehenga, nor does every past customer require another wedding ensemble. However, they might want a designer outfit for Diwali parties, intimate gatherings, or other special occasions. Bridge-to-luxury collections provide an entry point for these aspirational consumers,” Sunil Sethi, Chairman of the Fashion Design Council of India, tells us.“Historically, international fashion houses have embraced multiple labels as a business model. Take Giorgio Armani, for instance—his empire includes Armani Exchange, Emporio Armani, Giorgio Armani, and even Armani Casa for home dcor. This multi-tiered approach allows designers to cater to different market segments while maintaining a strong brand identity,” Sethi adds.Citing designer JJ Valaya’s example, Sethi shares how this business model is already a success in India. Valaya’s ready-to-wear line, JJV, has expanded with over 8–10 stores in just a couple of years.Gen Z's focus on style, their rising disposable income, and their willingness to spend on accessible luxury create the ideal opportunity for luxury brands to expand their reach.Younger audiences prioritise affordability, versatility, and statement pieces over traditional, occasion-specific couture. So, designers are adapting by introducing contemporary, print-heavy, and streetwear-inspired collections.“OTT is designed to reach a broader audience by offering versatile, high-quality pieces at more accessible price points. While our couture line caters to bespoke needs, OTT allows us to connect with individuals seeking everyday luxury that aligns with their dynamic lifestyles,” says Tahiliani.

“Luxury couture is handcrafted, exclusive, and produced in limited quantities. In contrast, bridge-to-luxury collections allow for scaled production, making them more affordable and widely available,” adds Sethi.While high demand and affordability factors are certainly behind the thriving bridge-to-luxury label scene, it also helps designers in securing collaborations and investments.“In today’s market, designers need collaborations. Brands seeking partnerships often prefer designers with broader appeal. A bridal-only designer might not be the best fit for a youth-centric smartphone brand, whereas a bridge-to-luxury designer with a streetwear line could be a perfect match,” explains Sethi.Sethi explains that their vision of connecting with younger generations is why they chose Ishaan Khatter, rapper KRSNA, and rapper Karma as showstoppers at the Blender’s Pride Fashion Tour show in Guwahati.If you think spending lakhs on a wedding lehenga is the only way to add Tarun Tahiliani to your wardrobe, think again.

Not the Waqf Bill or the Myanmar earthquake - but ChatGPT’s latest offering, which turns any image into a Studio Ghibli-inspired one with just the right prompt. Instagram, X, Facebook - in short, social media is flooded with users flaunting their “Ghibli-fied” photos. But amid the excitement, these images have also sparked thoughtful debates on creativity, ethics, and copyright. For some, this AI-powered transformation is a tribute - an artistic nod that helps more people discover and appreciate the legendary studio’s work. For others, it feels like a blatant misrepresentation, a commercialisation of an art form painstakingly handcrafted over decades. But amid the hullabaloo, one can’t help but wonder: What would Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki think? Perhaps an old video making the rounds since ChatGPT’s latest feature went viral offers a clue. In it, when Miyazaki was shown an AI-generated animation demo, he called it “an insult to life itself.” Some may argue - isn’t imitation the best form of flattery? Perhaps. But can AI truly capture the heart, soul, and life that Miyazaki poured into every hand-drawn frame - hours of sweat, passion, and dedication? That’s the real question.The case against AI-generated Ghibli art Artist Seema Kohli is unwavering in her stance: AI-generated Ghibli art is not flattery but an outright disrespect to the legacy of the studio. “The proliferation of AI-generated Studio Ghibli art is deeply disrespectful to the artistry and the artists involved. It is a profound mischaracterisation to label such imitation as flattery. True appreciation for an artist's work comes from recognising and valuing their unique creative journey and the immense effort invested in their craft. As an artist myself, I find the replication of my work without genuine understanding or contribution to be fundamentally dismissive,” she asserts. Maybe she is right to some extent. Studio Ghibli’s work is not just about a distinctive aesthetic; it is a philosophy. Every frame is a labour of love, hand-drawn with painstaking detail by hundreds of artists. Some sequences in Ghibli films, lasting just a minute on screen, have taken years to complete. This is the soul of their artistry - something an algorithm simply cannot replicate. Kohli believes that these AI-generated images, in essence, constitute a form of intellectual theft. They are, therefore, equivalent to an intrusion, a violation of creative ownership. “Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's meticulously crafted aesthetic has been appropriated, not celebrated,” she adds. Moreover, Kohli raises an urgent concern about the broader implications of AI in art. “Did the creators of these AI images obtain the necessary legal rights to utilise Studio Ghibli’s distinctive artistic style? This is a critical question that cannot be ignored.”AI as a tool for artistic evolution? Just as people are divided over ChatGPT’s Studio Ghibli-inspired art, artists, too have mixed opinions. For instance, artist Sangeeta Gupta believes that if AI is used to study, reinterpret, and pay homage to Ghibli’s artistry, it can be seen as admiration. “However, if it is used to mass-produce imitations without respect for the original ethos, it risks being a hollow reproduction rather than a true tribute.” Gupta acknowledges the role of imitation in artistic evolution but emphasises that transparency is key. “If AI-generated images are clearly labelled and not passed off as authentic creations from the studio, they could spark curiosity about the original work and bring in new audiences. But the concern is that AI might replace human effort rather than serve as a tool for creative expansion.”The question of authenticity Anoop Kamath, an artist and curator, questions the originality of AI-generated art altogether. “AI art concerns me because the programs used to create these generative digital pieces are trained on copyrighted work and exploit human artists,” he states. He also critiques the often-quoted adage, “Imitation is the best form of flattery.” “Does AI-generated work give credit to the original artists? Many times, the answer is no,” Kamath points out. He also doubts whether such artwork will hold value in the art world. “AI-generated images may lack the emotional depth and artistry of the original, hand-drawn work. They might even appear in galleries, but will they ever be considered as ‘original’ pieces of art? I doubt it.”Does AI dilute the essence of Studio Ghibli’s work? Deepshikha Agarwal, 29, a computer engineer, was ecstatic about the idea of seeing herself through the lens of the legendary Hayao Miyazaki. She is not new to Miyazaki’s soulful world of art - an ardent fan of the artist - but the prospect of reimagining herself in a “Ghibli version” painted in soft watercolours was lucrative. However, does that dilute the essence of Miyazaki’s work? She is doubtful. “I am a millennial and I grew up watching his films. I am also aware of the effort it took for each frame to come to life. Now, seeing everyone get hooked on to it makes me feel very happy. The reason? Well, very few people knew about his works like My Neighbour Totoro, Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies, and many more because most thought anime was a genre for kids - even my friends. Now, look at how everyone wants to look straight out of his world. I also know people who have watched a film or two after this trend went viral. Isn’t it a blessing in disguise?” she asks. Supriya, 21, who is pursuing a course in fashion design, says, “It takes hours to bring a designer piece together, be it Sabyasachi, Rahul Mishra, Tarun Tahiliani - you name it. Artisans put in their all for a piece, but when those get ripped off and sold for one-fourth the price, do they really complain? Yes, you don’t compare apples with oranges, but they are artists after all, and for each of them, their work is really precious.” For instance, before photography came into being, we relied on painters and paintings for capturing memories. But has photography diluted the essence of art? Perhaps not. “For someone who has always enjoyed Studio Ghibli films, they will continue to do so and value them just as much. But this new trend opens a door for people who were yet to discover the magic of Miyazaki,” says Deepshikha. Perhaps they have a point. We can’t deny how AI has been generating some insane images while reimagining these artworks. You can get a glimpse of the eccentric photos here:    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by India Today (@indiatoday) A post shared by India Today (@indiatoday) So, is AI diluting the essence of art? It may or may not be the case - that is up for discussion, given that its accuracy is questionable at this point. That being said, AI is a fast learner, so what we currently perceive as fun and games could be a threat in the future.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Apr 3, 2025

Traditionally, tea comes in two primary forms - black (fermented leaves) and green (unfermented leaves). While the benefits of green tea have been known for decades, what if we told you there’s a drink vying to replace your morning chai or coffee?Enter matcha Matcha, which literally means ‘powdered tea’, is a vibrant green powder made from ground-up, young, shaded green tea leaves, typically from the second or third harvest. These leaves are carefully steamed, dried, sorted, destemmed, and deveined before being finely milled into the brilliant green powder known as matcha. Once exclusive to Japanese households and then to elite Western health freaks (Read: Kourtney Kardashian), matcha now appears to have found its way not only into mainstream Western markets but also into India’s thriving wellness scene.

 In fact, matcha recently made its debut on Shark Tank India, courtesy of the brand Glow Glossary. Although the company couldn’t secure funding from the sharks, they acknowledged the growing demand for matcha in India. This increasing demand is evident from the entry of many well-known tea brands into the matcha market, along with new ones. Today, you can find matcha in Indian cafes and homes. advertisementThe data also shows the same. The matcha tea market in India is experiencing remarkable growth, with projections forecasting a robust compound annual growth rate of 8.6 per cent from 2024 to 2030, potentially reaching 167 million US dollars by the end of the decade.The demand has increased so much that Japan exports almost half of its produce to the world. According to Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan has seen a 185 per cent increase in matcha production in the last decade.   The data also shows the same.

According to Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan has seen a 185 per cent increase in matcha production in the last decade. However, since matcha can only be harvested in the springtime, it has caused a shortage and has significantly impacted the organic matcha market, despite the increase in production.

 According to Vriti Srivastav, a holistic dietitian and gut health expert, “Matcha is essentially a concentrated form of green tea, known for its strong and distinct flavour. It’s more of a developed taste, so not everyone enjoys it. While it has gained popularity, it still caters to a niche audience who consume it regularly.” Despite its niche appeal, matcha’s popularity is growing, driven by its reported health benefits and potential as a coffee/tea alternative.  What experts suggest about the benefits of matcha Experts agree that matcha’s nutritional profile is impressive, boasting antioxidants, fibre, vitamins, and minerals. Dr Navjot Kaur, senior dietician at Livasa Hospital, Khanna, says, “Unlike regular green tea, where leaves are steeped and discarded, matcha involves consuming the entire leaf in powdered form, which enhances its nutritional profile significantly.” According to her, matcha is rich in essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin A, C, E, K, potassium, calcium, and iron. Its antioxidant content, particularly catechins like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), is especially notable for promoting cardiovascular health, boosting metabolism, and supporting mental clarity. “Matcha’s unique combination of caffeine and L-theanine provides a smoother, longer-lasting energy release, improving focus and mental clarity,” she adds. Certified nutrition coach and holistic wellness expert Payal Rangar agrees. She adds, “Matcha is rich in antioxidants, particularly catechins, that help protect against free radicals. It also provides fibre, vitamins like A and C, and minerals like potassium.” Komal Malik, head dietician at Asian Hospital, Faridabad, points out that matcha is a potent superfood with potential benefits ranging from cognitive support to weight management.

 “Because the entire tea leaf is ingested rather than brewed, matcha contains more caffeine and antioxidants than green tea. It may support cognitive function, prevent certain diseases like cancer, and promote weight loss,” she says. Some studies also show it might help with certain types of cancer, but more studies are required to prove the same.What’s inside a cup of matcha? Eti Jain, Dietitian, Dr Morepen, a brand of health products, says that even a tiny amount of matcha (teaspoon) is packed with goodness. It contains: Natural caffeine – Provides energy without the jitters of coffee Amino acids – Help with focus and relaxation Antioxidants – Protect the body from damage Chlorophyll – Supports detox and digestion Essential minerals – Small amounts of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and ironDo Indians really need matcha? While matcha’s health benefits are noteworthy, the question remains - do Indians really need matcha when local alternatives exist? We asked experts. Srivastav emphasises that matcha is not essential for good health, especially when there are easily accessible alternatives. “In India, people are used to herbal options like ashwagandha, hibiscus tea, or simple spice teas made with cinnamon, turmeric, black pepper, lemon, and honey. These alternatives, rich in antioxidants and nutrients, offer potent health benefits, especially for immunity and weight management.” Malik agrees. “India has a rich tradition of herbal teas. Masala chai, basil tea, ginger tea, all provide health benefits like promoting immunity, supporting digestion, and reducing inflammation. These teas are widely consumed and provide antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals,” she says. Now, even though experts suggest that there are alternatives available for matcha, some experts do say that matcha has unique benefits unlike the other beverages available.Matcha vs. chai and coffee: which one is better? If you're wondering whether to replace your tea or coffee with matcha, here’s a quick comparison, according to Jain: Drink Caffeine Energy Boost Acidity Antioxidants Matcha Moderate (25-70mg) Smooth, long-lasting Low Very High Chai (Milk Tea) Moderate (30-50mg) Short burst of energy Medium Low Coffee High (95-150mg) Quick energy spike, crash later High Moderate Despite its various benefits, experts caution against excessive consumption of matcha. “Too much matcha isn’t advisable because of its caffeine content, and excessive consumption could cause digestive discomfort. This is rare, though, as most people consume matcha as tea, lattes, or in various preparations,” explains Srivastav. She also mentions that matcha can potentially lower blood pressure, which might be problematic for individuals already suffering from low blood pressure. Malik adds that matcha may cause allergic reactions in certain individuals, with symptoms including hives, itching, and swelling. “Matcha tea may also interact with certain drugs, such as blood thinners and blood pressure medications, resulting in negative effects,” she warns.

 Furthermore, Dr Kaur advises caution when sourcing matcha. “Low-quality matcha may contain heavy metals like lead, as tea plants absorb these from the soil. It is advisable to choose high-quality, organic matcha from reputable sources,” she says.The last sip Matcha is undoubtedly a nutrient-rich superfood with various health benefits, from boosting metabolism to enhancing mental clarity and heart health. However, like any health trend, it should be consumed in moderation. While matcha offers an exciting alternative to coffee and traditional tea, experts agree that it is not essential for good health. They also suggest that India’s rich heritage of herbal infusions and local teas might offers similar benefits without the hefty price tag associated with imported matcha (prices go as high as Rs 2,000- 3,000 for 50g). For those who enjoy its unique flavour and health properties, matcha can be a great addition to their diet. But for others, traditional Indian alternatives provide equally potent health benefits.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Apr 3, 2025

It’s not entirely a new trend; toy charms and cuddle bears for better sleep have been catching adult attention for a while now. But now, it’s finally becoming relevant in the Indian fashion scene too.Traditional gets a modern touchDesigners have long been experimenting with the art of modernising the traditional treasures of Indian fashion. Over the years, we’ve seen a contemporary take on Benarasi, with the fabric being used in a variety of silhouettes like corsets, pantsuits, mini dresses, and waistcoats. Similarly, Bandhani has also been reimagined for a modern appeal, making its way into kaftans and co-ord sets. But guess what, designers are not done yet!

Rocking India’s rich history of textile and craft in a contemporary way became an even bigger trend this season. Like, Janhvi Kapoor turned showstopper for Rahul Mishra’s AFEW label clad in a sultry Bandhani gown. Even Bhumi Pednekar flaunted a Benarasi corset as she walked the ramp for Amit Aggarwal.

Khadi, too, broke its conventional image and emerged as a stylish superstar!Elevated basicsBe it a white shirt, a jumpsuit, a pantsuit, or a denim jacket – nothing about these everyday staples is basic anymore. Opting for their elevated versions is the way to go if you want to up your style game. Anamika Khanna’s prt label AK-OK did just that by giving the humble white shirt a major makeover. Ritwik Khanna of Rkive also presented a not-so-basic take on denim.

She gave the otherwise predictable world of sportswear a bold appeal with peppy prints, a funky colour palette, and a hint of sequins.

Menswear goes funThe menswear side of fashion too witnessed a fun spin – but in a doable manner. From the introduction of culottes, a playful colour palette, and interesting layering – several collections suggested menswear is all set to get more fun.

Labels like Falguni Shane Peacock, S&N by Shantnu Nikhil and Abhichiq led the trend at the fashion week.

 



Culottes for men? Yes, please.
Corsets are here to stayIndia’s obsession with corsets is only set to soar this year – that’s what the Lakme Fashion Week 2025 suggested. From embellished numbers to the ones boasting zippers, antique appeal and billowing silhouettes – a lot of corsets caught our eyes at the five-day fashion celebration.

Cushioned companions / therapeutic arm candiesCall it a love for nostalgia or the therapeutic side of fashion, but some clingy companions are having their moment too. Fashion label Quarter, for instance, presented a collection featuring toy accessories – even pillows – as arm candy.

It’s not entirely a new trend; toy charms and cuddle bears for better sleep have been catching adult attention for a while now. But now, it’s finally becoming relevant in the Indian fashion scene too.Traditional gets a modern touchDesigners have long been experimenting with the art of modernising the traditional treasures of Indian fashion. Over the years, we’ve seen a contemporary take on Benarasi, with the fabric being used in a variety of silhouettes like corsets, pantsuits, mini dresses, and waistcoats. Similarly, Bandhani has also been reimagined for a modern appeal, making its way into kaftans and co-ord sets. But guess what, designers are not done yet!

Rocking India’s rich history of textile and craft in a contemporary way became an even bigger trend this season. Like, Janhvi Kapoor turned showstopper for Rahul Mishra’s AFEW label clad in a sultry Bandhani gown. Even Bhumi Pednekar flaunted a Benarasi corset as she walked the ramp for Amit Aggarwal.

Khadi, too, broke its conventional image and emerged as a stylish superstar!Elevated basicsBe it a white shirt, a jumpsuit, a pantsuit, or a denim jacket – nothing about these everyday staples is basic anymore. Opting for their elevated versions is the way to go if you want to up your style game. Anamika Khanna’s prt label AK-OK did just that by giving the humble white shirt a major makeover. Ritwik Khanna of Rkive also presented a not-so-basic take on denim.

It’s not entirely a new trend; toy charms and cuddle bears for better sleep have been catching adult attention for a while now. But now, it’s finally becoming relevant in the Indian fashion scene too.Traditional gets a modern touchDesigners have long been experimenting with the art of modernising the traditional treasures of Indian fashion. Over the years, we’ve seen a contemporary take on Benarasi, with the fabric being used in a variety of silhouettes like corsets, pantsuits, mini dresses, and waistcoats. Similarly, Bandhani has also been reimagined for a modern appeal, making its way into kaftans and co-ord sets. But guess what, designers are not done yet!

Rocking India’s rich history of textile and craft in a contemporary way became an even bigger trend this season. Like, Janhvi Kapoor turned showstopper for Rahul Mishra’s AFEW label clad in a sultry Bandhani gown. Even Bhumi Pednekar flaunted a Benarasi corset as she walked the ramp for Amit Aggarwal.

Khadi, too, broke its conventional image and emerged as a stylish superstar!Elevated basicsBe it a white shirt, a jumpsuit, a pantsuit, or a denim jacket – nothing about these everyday staples is basic anymore. Opting for their elevated versions is the way to go if you want to up your style game. Anamika Khanna’s prt label AK-OK did just that by giving the humble white shirt a major makeover. Ritwik Khanna of Rkive also presented a not-so-basic take on denim.

450adba7-1d7a-4ed8-b5e5-162cf8929268,"Bollywood, influencers swear by raw milk for skincare. But do experts approve?From celeb routines to Instagram trends, raw milk is the latest age-old skincare obsession. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/mira-rajput-sobhita-dhulipalas-raw-milk-skincare-hack-is-viral-again-do-experts-approve-2704137-2025-04-04,"Out of all the trends making waves this year, if there is something that has caught our attention, it is the use of natural ingredients and things found in your kitchen for solving your skincare woes. However, experts often don’t agree with the supposed benefits of all-natural products that often go viral on Instagram. One such trend that has resurfaced among Instagram skinfluencers is the use of raw milk as a skincare remedy. They use it as the first step in an elaborate facial or just as a skincare remedy for fading acne marks. However, this time, we think this obsession with raw milk for the face might have been led by Bollywood, as using raw milk has been a favourite amongst celebs for a while now. For instance, Mira Rajput Kapoor, the entrepreneur and wife of the Bollywood celebrity Shahid Kapoor, who is known for her preference for natural beauty ingredients, also shared on her YouTube channel that she and her mother use raw milk as a toner to keep their skin hydrated and radiant.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Priya Goyal (@priyagoyal_lifestyle) A post shared by Priya Goyal (@priyagoyal_lifestyle) Another advocate of raw milk’s benefits is the glamorous actress Shobhita Dhulipala, who, in an interview, shared that she often incorporates natural ingredients like raw milk into her beauty regimen, citing its simplicity and effectiveness, as well as the presence of lactic acid, which aids in gentle exfoliation. What are the benefits, you ask? Generally used as a toner, raw milk is said to be beneficial for fading acne marks, skin glow, and even dealing with hyperpigmentation. Sounds like a dream product, right? But with all the hype surrounding this age-old remedy, what do experts have to say?What are experts saying? Experts, though, acknowledge the benefits (only anecdotal) but claim that the cons outweigh the so-called pros of using raw milk directly on your skin. Celebrity cosmetologist Dr Mahnaz Jahan Begum, an aesthetic expert, entrepreneur, and founder of Keraderm Clinics, Kolkata, says, “Raw milk might help with acne. Its antibacterial properties, particularly lactic acid, deep cleanse pores and remove acne-causing bacteria, reducing inflammation and giving you clear, smooth skin.”

 Dr Begum further adds, “The beta hydroxy acid present in raw milk is effective for exfoliating the skin, while the lactic acid helps remove tan, blemishes, and correct uneven skin tone, resulting in a brighter and more even complexion.” She also notes that raw milk boosts collagen production, which may reduce fine lines and wrinkles. However, she adds, “While these benefits are well-known, it's essential to note that the scientific evidence supporting the use of raw milk for skin care is largely anecdotal and not extensively scientifically proven.” Dr Pallavi Pandey, dermatologist and medical advisor at Kaya Limited, acknowledges raw milk’s antibacterial and anti-inflammatory qualities.

 “These can help reduce acne-causing bacteria and calm the redness and irritation associated with acne. Incorporating raw milk into your skincare routine may help prevent breakouts over time, leading to clearer, healthier skin,” she adds. Dr Archana Batra, dermatologist and founder of SkinSense Clinic, New Delhi, also agrees that raw milk has certain benefits but stresses the importance of caution. She explains, “Raw milk can moisturise and exfoliate the skin mildly due to its lactic acid content. However, it is not a miracle ingredient and should be used carefully to avoid bacterial contamination. Properly formulated skincare products are always safer.”advertisementWhat experts say about the side effectsDespite its popularity, experts warn against the potential risks of using raw milk for skincare. In fact, all the experts we spoke to suggested skipping the trend of raw milk due to lack of scientific studies.Dr Vidushi Jain, dermatologist and medical head at Dermalinks, Noida and Ghaziabad, states, “Since it [milk] is not pasteurised, it can also contain bacteria which can lead to skin infection or irritation.

We shouldn't gossip about anyone."" If that's how you wrap up your elaborate gossip sessions, you're not alone. Gossiping has always been portrayed as a shameful act of demeaning others, leaving a pall of guilt hanging over us after a hearty gossip session. Pope Francis even called it an evil that destroys social life. And that’s not an exaggeration — when done unabashedly and carelessly, gossip has the power to ruin relationships. Nevertheless, we all indulge in it – knowingly or unknowingly. Researchers say that too. But beyond its bad reputation, gossiping can also be healthy (and have several benefits). Psychologists call it ‘social glue’ that brings communities together. It is also deemed good for mental health (when it is harmless).The positive gossip and its benefits “Gossip serves as a way to build bonds, share knowledge, and exchange information,” says Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai. “From the perspective of internal family systems, gossip can also be a means of belonging. It also helps individuals find their place within social dynamics and communities. In some cases, it even amplifies the voices of those who have been isolated or unheard, bringing attention to stories and perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked,” adds Sam.

advertisementTake the case of a young woman living in an apartment in a housing society. She mostly keeps to herself, unaware that the landlord has been unfairly overcharging her compared to other tenants. One day, during a casual evening gathering, a group of neighbours chat about their rents, and someone mentions how much they’re paying for a similar flat. The word spreads, and soon, she realises she’s being charged way more than the usual rate. She confronts the landlord and negotiates a fairer rent or starts looking for another accommodation.

The word spreads, and soon, she realises she’s being charged way more than the usual rate. She confronts the landlord and negotiates a fairer rent or starts looking for another accommodation. It is also through gossip that we understand society’s unwritten social rules. We learn through stories about others. Gossip also promotes mental health by giving us ways to process emotions. Talking about other people's situations helps us think about how we might handle similar challenges. Not to forget how it helps people vent out their feelings and develop close bonds with people. Moreover, complete abstinence from gossip may not even be realistic. People process and bond through sharing stories. It is all about awareness, and intention is everything.“If you’re doing it to connect, understand, or seek advice, it’s human. If it’s for drama or control, it’s harmful. Conscious communication over careless commentary that’s the line,” says Sohini Rohra, a relationship and fertility psychologist and author. Now, this good side of gossip obviously does not include deliberately hurting someone’s reputation or dividing people. In fact, good gossip is a major social skill – it means you understand ethical boundaries, have great judgement of things, and know when to filter what information and what to say (and not) in front of whom. ""As much as I refrain from gossip almost entirely, I can safely say that gossip, in its rawest form, is often just human curiosity trying to understand the world. As a psychologist, I hold confidentiality sacred, so I don’t engage in gossip personally, nor can I afford to. But from a psychological perspective, I can say that when done with compassion, it can even provide emotional relief, promote social learning, and affirm shared values,” says Rohra.How to gossip (in a non-distasteful manner) With intention and practice, you can give gossip a 360 makeover. It is all about reminding your mind of little things like speaking with compassion, turning the subject into the subject of the story, sharing stories of people’s growth and progress, and not passing on speculations. “One way to practise this kind of gossip is by speaking about others with compassion. Instead of jumping to assumptions, try offering empathy for what someone might be going through. It becomes less about ""spilling tea"" and more about understanding,” says Sam. Meanwhile, Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing, suggests the following tips to practise healthy gossip: Protagonist perspective rule: Before sharing information about someone, mentally position them as the hero of their own story rather than a character in yours. This subtle shift promotes empathy and contextual understanding, transforming potential criticism into perspective-taking. Check your inner state first: Ask yourself – am I sharing this from a place of connection, reflection, or unresolved emotion? Often, the energy behind gossip is more telling than the words. When you're grounded, you're less likely to use gossip to vent or project. Practise completion gossip: When encountering half-stories or incomplete narratives about others, intentionally add missing contextual elements that humanise rather than villainise. This conscious effort to complete narratives with compassion counterbalances our natural tendency toward simplistic characterisations. Practise growth gossip: Make it a habit to share stories of how someone grew, changed, or handled a tough situation with grace. Gossip doesn’t have to highlight mistakes – it can highlight resilience, transformation, or wisdom, subtly encouraging those traits in your circle. Develop story stewardship: Recognise that when you share information about others, you're temporarily holding their narrative. Practise treating these stories with the same care you would want for your own, including correcting misrepresentations when you hear them. Set an invisible line of integrity: Decide what kind of information you’d never repeat, no matter how tempting. This private promise builds self-trust and slowly changes how your nervous system responds to juicy, triggering details. It’s a quiet act of character-building that no one else needs to see. Always remember the negative impact of gossip – it spreads shame, silences people. It leads to isolation, which can have a much deeper and harmful impact. Gossip shouldn't become a tool that breaks someone’s confidence or puts them in a vulnerable or powerless position.

This is when the body relaxes, stores energy, and prepares for a possible pregnancy. During this process, metabolism slows down, and appetite increases. All of these changes occur naturally,” explains Kate Novaya, an integrative doctor and 'biohacker' who goes by the username doctor.novik. Kate’s Instagram post, which went viral, has sparked a heated debate online.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Kate | Integrative Doctor NMD | biohacker (@doctor.novik) A post shared by Kate | Integrative Doctor NMD | biohacker (@doctor.novik) In her post, she suggested that women often gain weight when they are in healthy relationships. She also claimed that if a woman significantly loses weight during a relationship, there is a 90 per cent chance that she is not in a healthy relationship. While some agreed with her post, others completely disagreed, saying that it’s actually quite the opposite. Kate is not alone in her observations. It’s a common phenomenon where couples tend to ‘grow together’, and sometimes, that growth includes weight gain. We’ve all come across those relatable Reels where women show their eating habits on a first date versus a year into the relationship. Now, there’s no denying that in many relationships, comfort and familiarity grow over time, and partners often influence each other’s eating habits. Sharing food can be a love language for some, with occasional indulgence becoming part of their bonding experience. And let’s be honest - how many of us have been guilty of ordering extra fries because our partner was craving them? But the larger question remains - can your weight truly indicate the health of your relationship? Can the inches you gain or lose reveal whether your partner is a green or red flag? We spoke to some experts.The relationship weight gain is real Kushal Pal Singh, a fitness and performance expert at Anytime Fitness, explains that having a healthy relationship at times leads to one's weight gain, but it varies with everyone too. He suggests that studies say that happy, secure couples could possibly have habits such as having more takeout, comfort food, or even less exercise.

 Singh says that the scientific explanation for this effect is based on research, where people in stable relationships gain weight due to psychological and behavioral reasons. “The 'relationship weight gain' hypothesis suggests that when a person feels secure in a relationship, he/she will be less concerned about having a certain body weight than when single. Moreover, eating together and being less tense about diet and exercise can contribute to people gaining weight,” Singh adds. Here are a few reasons why:Decreased focus on appearance: During the initial stages of a relationship, there's often a greater effort to look appealing. As comfort and security grow, maintaining a healthy lifestyle through proper eating and exercise might become less of a priority.Dining out more often: Couples often indulge in dining out during dates, exploring various cuisines and restaurants. The generous portion sizes and calorie-rich dishes commonly offered can contribute to weight gain.Increased alcohol consumption: Socialising with a partner, whether at home or outside, often involves drinking alcohol. Each drink adds additional calories to your daily intake.Reduced physical activity: Spending time with your partner can sometimes take precedence over exercising. A decrease in physical activity combined with higher calorie consumption can lead to weight gain.Adapting dietary habits: Many individuals adjust their eating patterns to align with their partner’s preferences. For instance, if your partner skips breakfast, you might begin delaying your first meal, which could result in overeating later. Additionally, if your partner opts for less nutritious foods, you may follow suit, impacting the quality of your overall diet. Dr Rajiv Kovil, weight loss expert and head of diabetology at Zandra Healthcare, also agrees that a new relationship might cause an initial weight gain, but it is on the couples to make sure that they maintain a healthy lifestyle. But talking about hormones, as mentioned in Kate's viral video, here's what experts have to say about that. When you're in a happy, secure relationship, your body releases feel-good hormones like oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin, which can reduce stress and emotional eating. Lower cortisol levels (the stress hormone) can help with weight regulation, while chronic stress in unhealthy relationships might lead to weight gain due to increased cravings and fat storage. Experts suggest that the weight gain should be temporary and not permanent. This is because your stress hormone, cortisol, often determines whether you’re in a healthy relationship over time. Scientifically, higher cortisol levels mean gaining more weight, which is often associated with elevated stress. That’s why the viral phrase, ‘if your body rejects your partner,’ holds some truth. In fact, a study in The American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2018) found that couples who exercise together experience improved physical health and emotional bonding. Also, healthy eating practices support mood regulation and energy levels and that can reduce irritability and enhance positive interactions, according to Dr Kovil.Newlyweds also gain weight Believe it or not, we have a study that tracked the weights of over 8,000 people and found that, on average, married women gain 24 pounds in the first five years of marriage.Women who live with their partners without tying the knot tend to gain around 8 kg, while those in relationships but living separately put on about 6.8 kg.Men aren’t off the hook either - weight gain happens to them, too. Interestingly, the study didn’t find much difference between married men and those just cohabiting with their partners. Researchers concluded that the reason why happy couples gain weight is because they are less motivated to maintain their weight when they don’t need to attract a mate. The bottom line is that newlyweds and couples in new relationships often gain weight due to various hormonal changes and shifts in social settings. However, if you are maintaining a healthy diet and exercising regularly but still gaining weight, it could be your relationship contributing to elevated stress hormone levels. This might be a sign to reassess your relationship.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Apr 6, 2025Must Watch

Your gut might be paying the priceThat post-lunch bloat, those unpredictable bathroom visits, and even chronic conditions like IBS or IBD could be tied to that sunshine vitamin you've been neglecting.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/is-your-vitamin-d-low-your-gut-might-be-paying-the-price-2705491-2025-04-08,"There is no denying that we often associate vitamin D with bone health and sunshine, but there’s a growing body of research - and expert opinion - pointing to another aspect: your gut health. Yes, that post-lunch bloat, those unpredictable bathroom visits, and even chronic conditions like IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) or IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) could be tied to that sunshine vitamin you’ve been neglecting. A study published in the Oman Medical Journal investigated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency amongst patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) compared to a healthy control group. The research included 60 IBS patients and 100 healthy individuals, revealing that 82% of the IBS group had vitamin D deficiency, significantly higher than the 31% observed in the control group. The findings suggested a notable association between vitamin D deficiency and IBS. Another review article titled ""Vitamin D, the Gut Microbiome, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease"" explored the relationship between vitamin D levels, gut microbiota composition, and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It concluded that vitamin D plays an important role in modulating the immune system and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. India Today consulted with top gastroenterologists, and this is what we found:What does vitamin D have to do with your gut? Turns out, quite a bit. Dr. Sanjay Khanna of Manipal Hospitals, Dwarka, says, “Vitamin D modulates the gut microbes. If there’s a deficiency, your microbiota may get disrupted, leading to poor gut health. This imbalance often triggers inflammation, and in many cases, can escalate to conditions like IBS or IBD.” Dr. Kunal Das of Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital, Ghaziabad, further explains that vitamin D and its receptor pathways actually influence how your gut barrier functions. It also determines how your immune system reacts and how balanced your gut bacteria stay.But does that mean low vitamin D causes bloating? Not directly – but don’t dismiss it either. “Vitamin D itself doesn’t cause bloating, but when your gut flora is off balance, which can happen due to a deficiency, bloating might follow. People with such symptoms do report improvement after supplementing,” says Dr Khanna. Dr. Das adds, “Some studies do show that vitamin D deficiency can trigger digestive issues, including bloating.” So, while it might not be the root of all tummy troubles, it definitely doesn’t help.IBS, leaky gut, and more: how bad can it get? According to both doctors, vitamin D deficiency has been tied to worsening symptoms in people with IBS, leaky gut, and even more chronic autoimmune conditions of the gut. “Deficiency leads to an inflammatory state. When corrected, many patients see an improvement in overall gut function and related symptoms,” Dr. Khanna explains.So, how do we fix it? A lot of you might think that popping a supplement can fix the issue, but doctors stress on a more holistic approach. Sun exposure (between 11am–2pm is optimal), a balanced diet that includes vitamin D-rich foods like seafood, eggs, and fortified products, and regular testing to know where your levels stand should help. “People with mostly indoor lifestyles or elderly individuals with limited sun exposure are especially prone,” says Dr. Khanna. Dr. Das also flags smoking and lack of exercise as culprits that can make absorption worse. And while supplements are helpful and often necessary, they’re not a silver bullet. It’s ultimately a combination of good food, regular exercise, sunshine, and healthy habits that help your gut microbiome thrive.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Apr 8, 2025Trending Reel

Forgetting such items in a street-hailed vehicle - with no way to get them back - can be a real shocker. But Uber (like most travel apps) offers an in-app option to help users track down their lost belongings. Mumbai emerged as the most 'forgetful' city, followed by Delhi. Fast city rush to blame?
