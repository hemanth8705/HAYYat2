Psychologists have an innovative solution to help you stick to your resolutions – start them in December.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/why-now-december-is-a-better-time-to-start-your-new-year-resolutions-2652036-2024-12-19,"At the start of every new year, many people create a list of resolutions to improve their lives. For some, it’s finally taking the plunge and joining a gym, committing to never pick up a cigarette again, or embarking on a journey of eating healthily every day. They wait for 1 January to give themselves a fresh start and channel the infamous “new year, new me” energy. And when January actually arrives and it is time to execute those resolutions, many find themselves struggling to follow through as the initial burst of motivation fades and old habits prove difficult to break. Psychologists, meanwhile, have an innovative solution to making your new year resolutions – start them in December.Start your new year resolution right away Experts say that starting new year resolutions in December can improve the chances of sustaining them. The reasons why it works are ample. Firstly, it puts you into a soft practice and a habit-building zone. Building the foundation for habit change takes time; it often requires multiple attempts and some experimentation to identify the best ways to disrupt the context that supports unwanted habits.

“December's built-in challenges – like holiday treats and busy schedules – create an ideal testing ground. If someone can maintain their resolution during this demanding month, they're more likely to sustain it during less challenging times. Think of it as training with weights before running a race – when January arrives, the path feels lighter and more manageable,” explains Dr Chandni Tugnait, a psychotherapist, life and business coach, and founder-director of Gateway of Healing.The December strategy also helps overcome the ‘all-or-nothing’ mindset. After the initial excitement of a New Year’s resolution fades, it’s easy for the goal to lose priority, leading you to revert to old habits. Taking a test run in December can mentally prepare you for the changes you plan to implement in the year ahead. “December's built-in challenges – like holiday treats and busy schedules – create an ideal testing ground.

After the initial excitement of a New Year’s resolution fades, it’s easy for the goal to lose priority, leading you to revert to old habits. Taking a test run in December can mentally prepare you for the changes you plan to implement in the year ahead. “According to the Change Theory, when building new behaviours, a person goes through a cycle of precontemplation, contemplation, decision-making, action, maintenance, and relapse many times. So, if one is unable to maintain their new year resolution for a day or more, instead of taking it as a failure, view it as a slippage and start again,” explains Charu Prabhakar, clinical psychologist at online mental health service platform Lissun. By starting your resolution in December, you allow yourself to experience this cycle early, making it easier to stay resilient and recommit after a slip-up instead of losing hope and abandoning your resolution. Yash Sharma, a fitness coach who practises this approach himself, has already started working on his New Year’s resolution of training early in the morning. He explains that the mind often perceives a New Year’s resolution as an overwhelming task. “When the New Year begins, you spend time deciding what to do, then push yourself to start, all while thinking you need to maintain it for the entire year. It feels like a massive challenge. However, if you start pushing yourself in December, it becomes easier for your mind to continue the habit into the next year,” he shares.

 According to Dr Rahul Chandhok, Senior Consultant and Head Psychiatry at Artemis Lite Hospital, New Delhi, “December is the ‘soft start’ into resolutions. There is not as much tension and anxiety since the change in behaviour has been going on for weeks rather than just a cold turkey kind of change.” When you start those resolutions in December, habits already take root, making the transition into the new year smoother. “The brain has already begun adapting to the changes, whether it's a new exercise routine or a different eating pattern,” explains Dr Tugnait. Additionally, there is also an advantage to fine-tuning goals before the official new year begins. “Rather than diving in headfirst on 1 January, December provides time to adjust strategies and identify potential obstacles. This trial period helps create more realistic and sustainable resolutions, increasing the likelihood of long-term success,” says Dr Tugnait.More ways to make your new resolutions successful Of course, you can introduce or develop a habit at any time of the year. However, many people tend to join the craze for New Year’s resolutions, even though habits require time and consistency to build. It is also very important to be realistic with the resolution you set. Here are some helpful hacks to give a longer life to your new year resolutions:

Set SMART goals
Always set realistic, specific, and achievable goals.
“The goals should be Specific (example: I want to lose 5 kg), Measurable (I’ll measure it on the weighing scale), Achievable (this has to be achieved in a span of 3 months), Relevant (This is relevant for me as I want to work on my physical health), and have a fixed Time of execution (I’ll exercise between 6–7 pm). This approach of SMART goals has scientifically shown to enhance chances of sustaining them,” suggests psychologist Charu Prabhakar.

This approach of SMART goals has scientifically shown to enhance chances of sustaining them,” suggests psychologist Charu Prabhakar.
 Micro-milestone method
Dr Tugnait suggests breaking down your main resolution into monthly mini-goals. Instead of saying, ""I'll save Rs 50,000 this year,"" commit to saving at least Rs 3,000–Rs 4,000 each month. These smaller targets feel more achievable and provide regular wins to celebrate.


 Follow the two-day rule
Never skip your resolution-related activity for more than two consecutive days.
“This flexibility prevents the ‘all-or-nothing’ mindset while maintaining consistency. It's particularly effective for habits like exercise, meditation, or learning a new skill,” says Dr Tugnait.


 Habit stacking
Link your new habits to existing daily routines. If you want to read more, pair it with your morning coffee or evening wind-down. These connections make new habits feel more natural and sustainable.

Celebrities worldwide, from Hollywood A-listers to Indian fitness enthusiasts, are singing its praises, calling it the “magic molecule” for youth, energy, and longevity. But what is NAD+, why are stars obsessed with it, and how is it impacting the Indian wellness market? Dr Anjali Hooda, a renowned MD and Internist, explains, “NAD+ is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It plays a critical role in energy production, DNA repair, and slowing the ageing process. As we age, NAD+ levels decline, leading to fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and visible signs of ageing. Boosting NAD+ levels can help rejuvenate the body at a cellular level.”Why celebrities are hooked From Kendall Jenner to Hailey Beiber, celebrities are reportedly using NAD+ therapies for their anti-ageing and energy-boosting effects. Intravenous (IV) NAD+ drips have become a sought-after treatment among the elite, promising to enhance mental clarity, physical performance, and even recovery from jet lag or rigorous schedules.

 Bollywood has not been left behind. Indian stars, under the guidance of experts like Dr Hooda, are embracing NAD+ to maintain their hectic lifestyles and youthful appearances. “Actors and performers need peak energy levels and radiant skin, which NAD+ helps achieve. It’s no surprise they’re obsessed with it,” she says.How NAD+ works its magic NAD+ supports mitochondrial function - the powerhouse of our cells - helping convert food into energy. It also activates sirtuins, proteins associated with longevity and repair. By replenishing NAD+ levels, individuals may experience improved metabolism, better focus, and resistance to age-related diseases. Dr Hooda points out that while IV treatments are popular among celebrities, oral supplements, NAD+ precursors like NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), and even topical applications are entering the mainstream.Impact on the Indian market India’s wellness industry, already booming with trends like IV therapy bars and biohacking clinics, is rapidly adopting NAD+ treatments. Luxury wellness centers in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru are offering NAD+ IV drips, priced between Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000 per session. “The Indian market is seeing a surge in demand for high-end, evidence-based treatments,” says Dr Hooda. “NAD+ fits perfectly into this space, appealing to health-conscious millennials and the ultra-wealthy alike.” Affordable NAD+ supplements, manufactured by Indian pharmaceutical companies, are also making their way into drugstores and e-commerce platforms. Experts believe this accessibility could make NAD+ the next big thing in India’s burgeoning nutraceutical market.The science vs the hype While NAD+ shows immense promise, skeptics caution against over-reliance on it as a miracle cure. Dr Hooda advises, “It’s important to pair NAD+ therapies with a balanced diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. The molecule is a tool, not a standalone solution.”The verdict As awareness of NAD+ grows, India stands poised to become a major player in this global trend. With celebrities endorsing it and experts advocating its benefits, the “magic molecule” might just be the future of wellness. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast or simply looking to age gracefully, NAD+ offers a compelling promise: a chance to biohack your way to better health.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

Microdosing Ozempic has gained momentum online, with people hoping to use the weight-loss benefits while dodging the side effects. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-microdosing-on-ozempic-help-you-lose-weight-without-any-side-effects-2651165-2024-12-18,"The weight-loss market is evolving more than ever. Crash diets, wellness programmes, injectables, supplements, and more are expected to create a massive global market worth USD 405 billion by 2030. India’s market is also anticipated to reach USD 52.3 billion by 2032. Among all these products and treatments, one that has garnered significant attention, especially after notable personalities like Elon Musk spoke about it, is Ozempic. However, it’s important to note that Ozempic was never originally intended as a weight-loss drug.What is Ozempic? Unless you've been living under a rock, you must have heard of Ozempic, which is actually a brand name for a semaglutide, an injectable medication used primarily to manage Type 2 diabetes. 

 



Microdosing Ozempic is gaining attention online. Photo: Getty Images

It belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which work by mimicking the action of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
This hormone helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes insulin production, and reduces the production of glucose in the liver. One of its notable effects is slowing down stomach emptying, which increases the feeling of fullness.
Although Ozempic was initially developed to manage diabetes, it has gained attention for its potential to aid in weight loss.
Some studies suggest that it can help users shed 5-10 per cent of their body weight when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. This weight loss effect has led to a growing interest in its off-label use for obesity management.
What are the side effects? While Ozempic is effective for managing blood sugar and promoting weight loss, it is not free from side effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Some people may also experience fatigue, dizziness, or mild headaches. These side effects are more common when starting the medication and tend to subside as the body adjusts.

 



Ozempic comes with various side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Photo: Unsplash
 In rare cases, serious side effects such as pancreatitis, gallbladder issues, or allergic reactions may occur. Dr Archana Batra, a dietician and certified diabetes educator, tells India Today, “Some people have experienced side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and fatigue, which create various problems in their daily lives.”  However, if there’s one side effect that almost all people who take Ozempic is losing muscle mass, while losing weight. This has also given rise to terms like “Ozempic face” and “Ozempic body”, which often occur when people lose muscle mass drastically due to taking Ozempic.  To avoid these side effects, and to avoid “Ozempic face and body” and still lose weight, some experts came up with the mircodosing of the drug, and it is now gaining more attention as a better way to take Ozempic. Can microdosing Ozempic actually help?  One of the first people to mention microdosing Ozempic was Dr Craig Koniver, a medical professional with over 1,20,000 followers on Instagram, in October 2024. Craig spoke on the Huberman Lab podcast, where he discussed how he had observed individuals taking Ozempic in much smaller amounts than the conventional doses. According to him, “these people were avoiding the side effects, essentially the loss of muscle mass”.

— Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D. (@hubermanlab) October 8, 2024 For context, microdosing involves administering smaller-than-usual doses of a drug to help the body adapt gradually. For Ozempic, this means starting with a very low dose and slowly increasing it over time.  According to Dr Aprajita Pradhan, senior consultant and unit head of endocrinology at Max Super Speciality Hospital, “Ozempic is usually started with a low weekly dose for 4 weeks, then the dose is up-titrated to reach the desired blood glucose control. This method of starting at a low dose helps in decreasing the side effects of Ozempic.” Dr Bhatra also seems to agree that using this approach, you can reduce the intensity of side effects. However, Niharikka Budhwani, a doctor of medicine and co-founder of Health Hatch, a wellness company, advises caution, stating, “Microdosing of any medication must be done under the supervision of a licenced doctor and is highly subjective, varying on a case-to-case basis. While this method appears promising, it should always be done with medical guidance.”Can other drugs be ‘microdosed’?  Microdosing is the practice of administering subtherapeutic doses of a drug (like Ozempic) to enhance tolerance, minimise side effects, or explore its effects at lower concentrations. The core principle is to allow the body to gradually adjust to the medication, thereby avoiding the ""shock"" that might come with a full dose. Experts suggest that this technique is not unique to Ozempic and is often used for other medications (including other weight-loss drugs), particularly those with strong side effects. Dr Batra says, “By using this approach, you can reduce the intensity of side effects. For example, in the beginning, users should start with low doses and extend to the titration period.” 

 



Experts agree that microdosing can possibly help in avoiding side effects. Photo: Unsplash
 This gradual increase helps users avoid sudden reactions, which can be particularly helpful for drugs with gastrointestinal side effects. Dr Pradhan adds that this could work for other weight-loss drugs too, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro are likely to be launched in India by 2025-26, and can also benefit from microdosing.  He further says, “Most of the recently approved injectable weight loss medications are initially started with a lower dose to improve patient tolerability and reduce side effects.” Experts believe that apart from weight-loss drugs, microdosing can also be applied to other medications as well. For instance, antidepressants are often microdosed to avoid sudden side effects like insomnia or restlessness.  But not all drugs are suitable for microdosing. The feasibility depends on the drug’s mechanism of action, its half-life, and the body’s ability to adapt to it over time.advertisementRememberOzempic’s potential for weight loss has brought it into the spotlight, but its side effects have raised concerns for many users.

db2bfbe8-64b7-468d-9da2-8553dc09fd2a,"You've been misunderstanding Trauma Bonding all along. It's a toxic trapMany may assume trauma bonding is a positive bond shared over a past trauma, but you will be surprised that it is absolutely not what you think.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/youve-been-misunderstanding-trauma-bonding-all-along-its-a-toxic-trap-2651160-2024-12-17,"When we say ""trauma bonding""—what comes to mind? Many might assume it’s a connection formed through shared trauma, but it’s more complex—and far more toxic—than it seems at first instance. Trauma bonding isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a psychological phenomenon that traps individuals in harmful relationships through cycles of abuse and affection.What is trauma bonding? According to Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, trauma bonding occurs when an abuser creates a cycle of manipulation by alternating between abusive behaviour and affectionate gestures. This unpredictable pattern makes the victim emotionally dependent, confusing love with control and harm. “The abuser alternates between harmful behaviour (abuse, manipulation) and positive behaviour (affection, apologies), creating confusion and dependency in the victim. This cycle makes the relationship feel unpredictable yet difficult to leave, as moments of ‘kindness’ can create a 'euphoric recall' of all the good memories,” says Ruuh.

 Relationship expert Shahzeen Shivdasani adds that trauma bonding is not about shared past traumas but staying in a toxic relationship where emotional abuse is followed by periods of kindness. This pattern fosters dependency, keeping victims emotionally hooked. Ekta Khurana, another Delhi-based psychologist and therapist mentions that sometimes victims are absolutely aware that the person showcasing the behaviour is toxic but yet, they cannot break free from the relationship.How does it affect mental health? The psychological toll of trauma bonding is severe. Ruuh explains that the constant highs and lows can lead to anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Victims often internalise blame, suffer from low self-esteem, and mistakenly believe they are responsible for the abuse.

 She also mentions that one of the downsides of forming such a bond is that the abuser’s approval becomes the source of the victim’s worth and safety, creating unhealthy reliance. This creates a unique kind of dependency on the abusers and victims stay too long trying to make sense of this relationship.How does trauma bonding develop? Shivdasani attributes the development of trauma bonding to intermittent reinforcement, where periods of affection follow abusive episodes. Victims try to rationalise their partner’s erratic behaviour, hoping for lasting change, which rarely comes. Additionally, people with insecure attachment styles or unresolved childhood trauma are more prone to falling into such toxic cycles, says Ruuh. “Over time, the tension-abuse-reconciliation cycle becomes normalised, making it harder to recognise the toxicity. Abusers often isolate their victim from their support systems like family and friends, making the abusive relationship the only emotional outlet for the victims,” mentions Ruuh.Breaking free and healing Ekta Khurana outlines the essential steps to break free:
Awareness: Recognise that the relationship is toxic and built on manipulation.
Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, join support groups, or seek therapy.
Document patterns: Keep a journal of abusive incidents to combat gaslighting.
Set boundaries: Establish physical and emotional distance from the abuser.
Rebuild self-worth: Invest in self-care, hobbies, and healthy social connections.
Therapeutic help: Consider therapies like CBT or EMDR for deep-rooted trauma.
Red flags to watch for Shahzeen Shivdasani highlights warning signs of trauma bonding:
The relationship alternates between intense affection and mistreatment.
The abuser justifies harmful behaviour as ‘for your own good’.
You feel isolated from friends and family.
Ending the relationship triggers anxiety or guilt.
Misconceptions about trauma bonding Contrary to popular belief, trauma bonding isn’t mutual or limited to romantic relationships. It can occur in friendships, workplaces, and family dynamics where power imbalances exist. So, watch out!Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 17, 2024

There are several struggles that often go unnoticed despite the ever-growing Indian pet market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/pet-dog-owners-struggles-india-2650652-2024-12-17,"When 20-year-old art student Gargy Sharma from Delhi finally convinced her parents to go on a long-awaited family outing, she was thrilled. More than for herself, she was excited for Cheddar, her 2-year-old poodle, as it was his birthday month. The destination was pre-decided: a high-end, pet-friendly hangout street in Gurugram. However, her excitement quickly turned to disappointment when she discovered that Cheddar wasn’t allowed inside most restaurants there. Pets were restricted to the outdoor street area only. When you bring a pet into your home, it becomes a beloved family member. Your travel plans, daily routines, and overall lifestyle naturally adjust to accommodate their needs and presence. You willingly make compromises in various aspects of your life to prioritise the well-being of your furry companion. Indian pet parents, especially dog owners, however, feel that India is yet to become more accommodating for pets. There are several struggles that often go unnoticed despite the ever-growing Indian pet market. According to the Ken Research report published in July 2024, the Indian pet market was valued at USD 9.85 billion in 2023. This growth is driven by increasing pet ownership, rising disposable incomes, and a shift in consumer attitudes that view pets as family members. Additionally, the rise of DINK (Double Income, No Kids) couples, who often choose pets over having children, has also contributed to this trend. Consequently, there has been a proliferation of pet care products and services, including premium pet food, grooming, and veterinary care.

Dogs dominate the pet market in India. The overall population of pet dogs in India was over 33 million in 2023, and it is is likely to reach more than 51 million by 2028.Yet, pet dog owners in India often witness challenges at basic levels, such as travelling with their pets or gaining acceptance in housing societies.Healthcare hassles Dogs dominate the pet market in India. The overall population of pet dogs in India was over 33 million in 2023, and it is is likely to reach more than 51 million by 2028. Yet, pet dog owners in India often witness challenges at basic levels, such as travelling with their pets or gaining acceptance in housing societies.Healthcare hassles “Although the pet clinic culture is thriving in India, access to proper pet hospitals remains a significant challenge. There is a dire shortage,” says Koustav Das, a Noida resident and owner of a Labrador. “A friend took his dog to a regular veterinarian, where the pet was misdiagnosed. The dog is still suffering because of it,” he shares. Rashi Narang, founder of the leading pet care brand Heads Up For Tails and owner of two pet dogs, agrees and adds, “Reliable veterinary services and specialised care can still be hard to find in certain parts of India. Many pet parents struggle to access timely medical advice, emergency care, or advanced treatments, especially in smaller towns.”Travel woes Travelling with pets is another significant issue. Whether you wish to take a cab, train, or flight – you are likely to encounter several challenges if you are travelling with your pet. Limited carriers allow pet travel, and in India, Air India is one of them. While smaller pets, such as dogs weighing under 10 kg, are permitted to travel in the cabin, larger dogs must travel in the cargo hold. Rashi recalls having an exceptionally difficult experience while travelling with her pets on a flight. “The process involved a significant amount of paperwork, and I had to drop my dog off at the cargo terminal many hours before the flight. She had to stay in a crate for several hours, which was incredibly stressful for both of us. While there are options for very small dogs to travel in the cabin on select airlines, we need to do much more to accommodate dogs of all sizes. Larger dogs are often restricted to travelling in cargo, where they face altitude changes, loud noises, and unfamiliar surroundings. It’s a scary and isolating experience for them, and as pet parents, it’s heartbreaking to think of our pets enduring such stress,” she tells India Today.

 Many pet parents enrol their dogs in air travel training programmes to help them remain calm and unaffected during long-haul journeys in a cargo hold. Rashi, meanwhile, suggests introducing innovative solutions such as pet-friendly cabin options, specialised compartments for pets, and enhanced safety and comfort measures in cargo. “Travelling with a pet should be a positive experience, not a daunting one, and I hope we can work towards a future where all pets, regardless of size, can travel safely and comfortably with their families,” she tells India Today. Among cab providers, Ola does not yet offer a pet-friendly option. Uber, on the other hand, has launched a pet travel service, but it is currently available only in Bengaluru. In terms of train travel, the pet parent is supposed to book a two-seater coupe or a four-berth cabin to travel with their fur buddies. So, availability becomes a huge factor. In case you have to travel urgently, it is really difficult to take your pet along. Alternatively, some trains provide dog boxes where pets travel like 'luggage.' They are placed in a designated dog box located in second-class compartments. If you have a kitten or a puppy that can be carried in a basket, they can be carried by owners in any class after payment of the usual booking charges.advertisementPet boarding – Difficult to find good optionsIf travelling is an issue, leaving behind your pet at a boarding centre is no less challenging.“I discovered a pet boarding centre in Chhatarpur through Just Dial when I had to travel with my family to Dubai for a week. However, during a basic inspection visit, we were shocked by the conditions. It was a simple residential setup with barely any outdoor space for the dogs. Beer bottles were scattered around, suggesting a party had taken place the night before. Naturally, we decided not to leave our Golden Retriever there. The most alarming part was that such boarding centres operate without skilled staff,” Divya Arora, a 32-year-old professional in Delhi, tells India Today.Bengaluru-based Shobhit Mohanty, who founded the pet parent community and educational platform ThePack.in after encountering several hurdles and challenges in his pet parenting journey, shares similar thoughts.“India’s pet-friendliness is improving but lags significantly behind countries like the US, Germany, and the UK. Challenges such as limited access to quality veterinary care, behaviour trainers, pet-friendly parks, trustworthy boarding centres, and pet-friendly travel options remain significant,” he says.advertisementShobhit also highlights the need for stronger pet laws and, more importantly, better enforcement in India.“While laws against illegal breeding and animal cruelty exist, their implementation is weak, leading to widespread illegal breeding and frequent animal cruelty cases,” he says.Housing issuesKoustav adds how Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and housing society managements often impose unreasonable rules on pet owners, such as requiring dogs to be muzzled even when walking in parks.Finding pet-friendly housing remains a significant struggle. Many landlords are hesitant about pets, leaving families in tough situations. This is a deeply emotional issue for pet parents.

“There’s still a lack of understanding about pet behaviour in some communities. Pet parents often find themselves defending their decision to bring pets home or navigating situations where pets are misunderstood or even feared,” she adds.Pet attacks cannot be ignored either, with instances of pet dogs biting people in shared public spaces like elevators. The solution? Pet parent education.Need of the hour: Pet parent educationIn the last few years, India has certainly taken measures to become more pet-friendly. Dedicated festivals and events like Pet Fed and Kukur Tihar (an initiative by the Bengaluru municipal department), along with an increasing number of pet-friendly cafes and holiday properties, have gained prominence. Pet parks are also being set up by governments.The lack of pet parent training is also a reason why pet abandonment is a complex issue in India.“People need to understand that having a pet is a full-time responsibility. It’s their duty to train the pet properly, understand its personality, consult relevant professionals, and take ownership of its behaviour in public. From registering the pet to ensuring it receives annual booster shots, many are unaware of these essential responsibilities,” shares Koustav.He believes that as pet parents become more responsible and better informed, society’s perception of pet dogs will gradually change. “It requires a collective effort from both the government and pet parents,” he adds.“New pet parents need education on basics like toilet training, puppy biting, diet, and health.

 If travelling is an issue, leaving behind your pet at a boarding centre is no less challenging. “I discovered a pet boarding centre in Chhatarpur through Just Dial when I had to travel with my family to Dubai for a week. However, during a basic inspection visit, we were shocked by the conditions. It was a simple residential setup with barely any outdoor space for the dogs. Beer bottles were scattered around, suggesting a party had taken place the night before. Naturally, we decided not to leave our Golden Retriever there. The most alarming part was that such boarding centres operate without skilled staff,” Divya Arora, a 32-year-old professional in Delhi, tells India Today. Bengaluru-based Shobhit Mohanty, who founded the pet parent community and educational platform ThePack.in after encountering several hurdles and challenges in his pet parenting journey, shares similar thoughts. “India’s pet-friendliness is improving but lags significantly behind countries like the US, Germany, and the UK. Challenges such as limited access to quality veterinary care, behaviour trainers, pet-friendly parks, trustworthy boarding centres, and pet-friendly travel options remain significant,” he says. Shobhit also highlights the need for stronger pet laws and, more importantly, better enforcement in India. “While laws against illegal breeding and animal cruelty exist, their implementation is weak, leading to widespread illegal breeding and frequent animal cruelty cases,” he says.Housing issues Koustav adds how Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and housing society managements often impose unreasonable rules on pet owners, such as requiring dogs to be muzzled even when walking in parks. Finding pet-friendly housing remains a significant struggle. Many landlords are hesitant about pets, leaving families in tough situations. This is a deeply emotional issue for pet parents.

 “There’s still a lack of understanding about pet behaviour in some communities. Pet parents often find themselves defending their decision to bring pets home or navigating situations where pets are misunderstood or even feared,” she adds. Pet attacks cannot be ignored either, with instances of pet dogs biting people in shared public spaces like elevators. The solution? Pet parent education.Need of the hour: Pet parent education In the last few years, India has certainly taken measures to become more pet-friendly. Dedicated festivals and events like Pet Fed and Kukur Tihar (an initiative by the Bengaluru municipal department), along with an increasing number of pet-friendly cafes and holiday properties, have gained prominence. Pet parks are also being set up by governments. The lack of pet parent training is also a reason why pet abandonment is a complex issue in India. “People need to understand that having a pet is a full-time responsibility. It’s their duty to train the pet properly, understand its personality, consult relevant professionals, and take ownership of its behaviour in public. From registering the pet to ensuring it receives annual booster shots, many are unaware of these essential responsibilities,” shares Koustav. He believes that as pet parents become more responsible and better informed, society’s perception of pet dogs will gradually change. “It requires a collective effort from both the government and pet parents,” he adds. “New pet parents need education on basics like toilet training, puppy biting, diet, and health. Raising awareness should be a top priority to prevent challenges from arising early. While mandatory training sounds appealing, it’s not feasible due to the shortage of qualified trainers and the lack of dog training programmes in India. Without sufficient trainers, enforcing mandatory training would be impractical,” Shobhit, a vocal voice in the pet parenting community, highlights.

Over time, many of us have begun relying on social media for information, particularly on health-related topics and advice on what we should or shouldn't consume. Recently, one fruit that has been gaining traction across platforms like Instagram and Facebook for its purported anti-cancer properties is soursop (Graviola), a prickly, dark green fruit that commonly grows in tropical and subtropical regions around the world.Soursop for cancer? Soursop, a close cousin of the famous custard apple, is gaining buzz on social media for its anti-cancerous properties. This has led to a surge in products in the market, from supplements to juices to protein powders, with soursop as the main ingredient.

 Since the fruit is primarily grown in tropical areas, its reputation as a cancer-killing agent started gaining hype in the West. Now, it seems that this misinformation has reached India as well, with several influencer doctors promoting the fruit as being as effective as chemotherapy.Here’s what experts have to say India Today spoke to various experts and all of them agreed that even though the fruit is high in antioxidants, there’s no study that shows it can heal cancer.  Chintamani, chairman and head of the department of surgical oncology at Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, emphasises that there is ""no clear evidence to suggest that it is effective and safe for treatment of cancer in humans"".   He highlights that while soursop has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, these benefits have not been objectively assessed in human clinical trials.

 According to him, ""This product has a doubtful role as an anticancer agent and its safety is not established in humans."" Dr Suman S Karanth, senior consultant in medical oncology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, points out that while laboratory studies on animal tissue and cancer cells have demonstrated some anti-cancer activity in prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancer cells, ""these studies are not in humans"".   She warns that without clinical trials, there is no concrete evidence to support soursop’s efficacy in treating cancer in humans. Dr Karanth also raises concerns about the toxic effects of soursop’s acetogenin compounds, which can cause neurotoxicity and immune suppression.

 



Excessive consumption of soursop may cause nausea. Photo: Pexels
 Dr Pooja Babbar, a consultant in medical oncology at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, further explains that even though soursop contains acetogenins, which may have cytotoxic effects (toxic effects on cell function) on cancer cells by inhibiting specific compounds found in cancer cell membranes.  The consensus among experts is clear: While soursop’s potential as a cancer-fighting agent is supported by preclinical studies (on animals), there is no substantial human evidence to validate its use as a cancer treatment. But does it mean that the fruit has no benefits? Well, no. Does it have any benefits? Soursop offers several potential health benefits due to its rich nutritional content. The fruit is a source of essential vitamins (like Vitamin C, B1, and B2), minerals (like potassium, magnesium, and calcium), antioxidants, and dietary fibre. According to Dr Shilpa M R, a consultant and dietitian at Kshemavana Yoga and Naturopathy Centre, Bengaluru, the fruit: 
Boosts immunity: Soursop can ""boost immunity"" through its high Vitamin C content, which promotes the generation of white blood cells.
Rich in antioxidants: Soursop’s ""antioxidant property prevents cancer"" by combating oxidative stress in the body.
Promotes digestive health: Soursop's high fibre content helps maintain gut health and prevent constipation.
Regulates blood pressure: Dr Shilpa M R notes that its potassium content helps control blood pressure by balancing sodium levels and relaxing blood vessels.

Reduces inflammation: Soursop has anti-inflammatory properties, which may offer relief for joint pain and other inflammatory conditions.
Promotes skin and hair health: The antioxidants and Vitamin C in soursop support collagen production and fight signs of ageing.
May help stabilise blood sugar levels: Dr Babbar notes that soursop may help stabilise blood sugar levels, which could benefit those managing diabetes.
 Experts recommend consuming soursop in its natural form as a fruit, as it is considered safe for most people. However, they urge caution when using soursop supplements and other products as they are yet to be approved officially by the Food and Drug Administration. Potential side effects Despite its numerous health benefits, soursop also carries potential side effects. Experts caution that excessive consumption or unsupervised use of soursop could lead to adverse effects, particularly for those with pre-existing health conditions.
Neurotoxicity: Prof Chintamani warns that soursop ""is not very safe for those on treatment for neurological disorders like Parkinson disease"", as it may worsen symptoms and interfere with neurological treatments.
Toxic effects: Dr Karanth highlights that soursop’s fatty acid derivatives, called acetogenins, are ""toxic"" and linked to neurotoxicity, which can cause hair loss and immune system suppression.
Interference with cardiovascular treatments: Soursop could interfere with cardiovascular treatments and metabolic activities, urging caution and the supervision of a medical expert or nutritionist.
Nausea and vomiting: Dr Babbar mentions that soursop consumption can cause ""nausea, vomiting"" and a drop in blood pressure.
Allergic reactions: Dr Shilpa points out that some individuals may experience allergic responses like rashes or itching after consuming soursop.

However, it is certainly possible to keep the spark alive.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/indian-married-couples-romance-alive-while-living-with-family-2648573-2024-12-15,"The thought of cooking a meal together with your spouse, sneaking in playful cuddles along the way, or sharing an evening of passionate romance while curled up on the couch watching a favourite movie, are a few things many couples dream of. These dreams, however, often remain just that for couples living in joint family setups. Couples living with families find it difficult to cherish romance-filled moments owing to a lack of privacy, constant interruptions, and some unspoken expectations. Sometimes, you don’t even have the bandwidth to think of such things because you are so engrossed in family life, children, and all its demands. Sounds like the reality of your life? But does this mean living with family is a bad idea? No! Does it also mean that you let romance take a backseat due to family obligations? Definitely not! Marriage counsellors say finding privacy and keeping romance alive is a common issue for Indian couples who live under the same roof as their families – as it limits privacy and intimacy and creates obstacles for meaningful couple time. Not just physical intimacy, but emotional intimacy can also take a backseat. “Often, couples fall into routines where romance takes a backseat. This happens because their focus shifts to caregiving, household responsibilities, and managing complex family dynamics,” Dr Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based marriage counsellor, tells India Today.

“Many clients seek counselling for these concerns. Common issues include the lack of private time, one partner prioritising time with parents over the couple’s relationship, overwhelming household responsibilities, and the pressures of living with in-laws. If children are involved, the added responsibilities can further strain the relationship,” she adds. “Many clients seek counselling for these concerns. Common issues include the lack of private time, one partner prioritising time with parents over the couple’s relationship, overwhelming household responsibilities, and the pressures of living with in-laws. If children are involved, the added responsibilities can further strain the relationship,” she adds. This dynamic can negatively impact your marriage. Such challenges can leave couples feeling overwhelmed, leading to frustration and resentment. But there is a way out, of course! All you need is an intention along with a bit of creativity.Firstly, be intentional You and your partner need to have an intention to keep the romance alive—only then can you create the mental space and find creative solutions. You have to sit together, talk it out, and express your expectations. “When living with family, keeping the romance alive requires creativity and intentional effort. Couples must ensure that intimacy doesn’t take a backseat by prioritising alone time and setting boundaries with family members,” says Shahzeen Shivdasani, a Mumbai-based relationship expert and author. Be intentional about maintaining physical intimacy.

 “It requires both partners to work intentionally and proactively as a team,” adds Dr Khanna.Set boundaries with family members Setting boundaries with family members is essential for maintaining romance after marriage. It’s never too late to make changes for the better. Your parents or in-laws might not have prioritised such moments with their respective partners due to household responsibilities, but you don’t have to take the same route. It is possible to respect family and have your own personal space as a couple while living in the same house. “Designate time after everyone goes to sleep as your private moments or create a dedicated space in the house that’s just for the two of you,” suggests Shahzeen. Communicate your need for quality time with your partner to your family, and explain it respectfully. Be consistent with your efforts, and present this as non-negotiable. To maintain balance, ensure to encourage family activities on separate occasions.Carve out ‘us’ time – staycations, walks, date nights Stealing those flirty, playful moments beyond the four walls of your bedroom or at unexpected times of the day might be your idea of keeping the romance alive, but there is so much more you can do to keep the spark burning. Dr Khanna, a marriage counsellor with over 15 years of experience, recommends scheduling regular date nights or outings. This could include having lunch or dinner together, going to a movie, enjoying a long drive, or simply spending private moments as a couple. These small gestures create meaningful experiences that strengthen the bond. “To break the monotony of being confined to the bedroom, find creative ways to add excitement while living with family. Couples could perhaps plan activities that take them out of the house, such as walks, short drives, or outdoor picnics, to enjoy private moments in a different setting. Setting up a cosy nook in the living room or balcony for intimate conversations or movie nights might create a change of scene,” suggests Delhi-based marriage counsellor Shivani Sadhoo. If space is limited at home, plan monthly staycations to enjoy quality time together.

 



Go on weekly dates or plan monthly staycations with your partner. (Photo: Pexels)
 At least dedicate one hour to just each other, where no third party is there to interrupt. “Couples often face challenges when one partner feels the other is overly involved with their family. To address this, I suggest dedicating at least an hour each day exclusively to each other, during which family matters are not discussed,” says Dr Khanna. This could be your chai time in the morning, a long walk or a badminton date in the evening, or a little time on the terrace.Little gestures matter Give your partner a peck when they least expect it, don’t shy away from holding their hands or hugging them in front of the family. Plan those little surprises. Leave love-filled notes. These little gestures matter and can keep you two connected. Even activities like solving a puzzle or playing board games help. You can also send playful texts, emojis, or memes to stay connected even while at home. “Scheduling time when other family members are out or engaged may also help. Small surprises such as a home-cooked meal, surprise gifts, or planned activities can bring novelty and joy to their relationship,” suggests Shivani Sadhoo. Intimacy is a vital part of any relationship, and living with family might mean working a bit harder to nurture it. But by being creative, working as a team, and being excited and proactive – your connection is sure to remain strong and vibrant.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 15, 2024Tune InALSO READ |  Should newlyweds live on their own for the first few years of marriage?Trending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/how-to-manage-your-childs-anger-and-stubbornness-2649430-2024-12-14,"When you have a child around, it's common to see them get upset or angry when they don't get what they want. A simple wish can quickly turn into a tantrum, with crying and howling when it's unmet. But when their desires are fulfilled, their faces light up with a big grin. Parenting isn’t easy, and parents often find themselves criticised no matter what they do. If they give in to their child’s demands, they're accused of spoiling them. If they refuse, they’re labelled as heartless or uncaring. But the question here is: should parents give in to their child's stubbornness and anger, or is there a better way to navigate these moments?The loud display of anger Dr Sarthak Dave, an Ahmedabad-based psychiatrist, tells India Today that kids become stubborn and express their anger loudly because they absorb behaviours from their surroundings and consider them normal. If they frequently observe their parents displaying anger or reacting loudly, they learn to replicate this behaviour, believing it to be acceptable. He explains, ""At a young age, their id—the instinctual drive to fulfil their desires—is very strong, while their ego (logical reasoning) and superego (moral understanding) are still underdeveloped and grow with age and experience. When children want something, they struggle to think logically or anticipate the consequences of their actions. If they don’t get what they want, they feel distress and express it in ways they’ve learnt from their environment.""

Additionally, if they’ve previously received what they wanted by acting out, this behaviour gets reinforced, encouraging them to repeat it. Additionally, if they’ve previously received what they wanted by acting out, this behaviour gets reinforced, encouraging them to repeat it. Further, Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, tells us that kids can be stubborn or loud because they don’t yet have the words or skills to express their emotions or because they feel ignored or misunderstood by adults. She mentions that these outbursts are their way of coping with emotions they can’t fully control or explain. According to Patel, while kids do learn from their environment and often replicate their parents, stubbornness is also a natural part of development as children learn to assert themselves. It doesn’t always mean parents are at fault.What does this stubbornness say about your kid? A child’s stubbornness, anger, and loud reactions are often ways of acting out due to their limited ability to handle emotions and distress. ""These behaviours indicate that the child may not yet be developing the emotional tools needed to cope effectively. If such reactions are not addressed or discouraged, they can become ingrained as primitive defence mechanisms, suggesting that the child’s emotional growth is not progressing as it should,"" says Dr Dave. Meanwhile, Patel feels that stubbornness and anger are signs that a child:
Is seeking attention, understanding, or control.
May be feeling overwhelmed, insecure, or unsure how to handle a situation.
Is in a stage of development where they’re learning to test limits and establish independence.
Impact on mental health According to the experts, if left unchecked, constant anger and stubbornness can lead to issues such as difficulty managing emotions later in life, strained relationships with peers and family, and increased feelings of frustration or anxiety.

 



Anger and stubbornness can have long-term effects on a child's emotional development (Photo: Getty Images)
What should you do as a parent? Dr Sajeela Maini, senior consultant, department of psychiatry and behavioural sciences, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, states that parents should not give in to their child’s stubbornness and anger, as this will only make the child more stubborn, and their anger levels will increase multifold. Parents should make sure they are not rewarding such behaviour. By rewarding them, you are feeding stubbornness and anger, and this will only increase the tantrums. While Riddhi Doshi Patel agrees, she mentions that this doesn’t mean parents should ignore their child’s feelings. Instead, they should acknowledge their child’s emotions, set clear and consistent boundaries, and stay calm while avoiding engaging in a power struggle. To this, Dr Sarthak Dave adds that parents should prioritise guiding their children toward healthier ways of expressing their needs and help them move from immature defence mechanisms to more mature ones. Teaching effective and constructive communication methods is vital for their emotional development. To manage a difficult situation, you must...
Stay calm: Children often mirror your emotions. Responding with calmness can help de-escalate the situation.
Acknowledge their feelings: Show empathy by saying, ""I see you’re upset. Do you want to talk about it?""
Set clear boundaries: Be consistent with rules and consequences. Children feel safer when they know what to expect.
Offer choices: Giving children small choices helps them feel in control, reducing the need for stubborn behaviour. 
Teach problem-solving skills: Encourage them to use words to express their feelings or brainstorm solutions together.
Model healthy behaviour: Show them how to handle frustration calmly. For example, say, ""I feel frustrated too sometimes, and I take deep breaths to help.""

It’s spicy. It’s warm. It’s comfort in a bowl. For many Indians, Ema Datshi has become the ultimate go-to comfort food. You can enjoy it with rice or stick to tradition by pairing it with tingmo - a soft, steamed bread from Tibetan cuisine. For Sherya, a 26-year-old working professional from Delhi NCR, it’s the dish she “makes in no time” and whenever she’s craving something spicy yet indulgently cheesy.  “I cook it when I don’t have the time to make anything, and when I am feeling lazy. It’s my comfort food now,” she says.  And Shreya is far from alone. Google India’s year-end report, Year in Search 2024: What Sparked Curiosity Across India on Google, revealed that Ema Datshi was one of the top 10 most-searched recipes in the country. Interestingly, while it has captured Indian hearts (and taste buds), Ema Datshi is actually a culinary treasure from Bhutan and is often known as the country's national dish.   But how did this humble Bhutanese classic become one of India’s most searched recipes this year? The answer lies in the magic of social media,  and, of course, Deepika Padukone.  Let’s whip this up from scratch, and tell you a little about this dish first. Bhutan and their love for “Ema” The picturesque Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan boasts a cuisine that varies from region to region. Yet, if there’s one thing that unites the nation’s palate, it’s their deep-rooted love for chillies. Ema Datshi is a hearty, soul-warming stew where chillies take centre stage, paired with a unique local cheese that melts into a luscious, creamy sauce.  The name itself captures its essence - “Ema” means chilli and “Datshi” means cheese in Dzongkha, the national language of Bhutan. But for the Bhutanese, it’s more than just food; it’s a reflection of culture and tradition served on a plate. No meal in Bhutan is complete without Ema Datshi, and it shows the nation’s enduring love affair with chillies. For generations, it has been a household staple, enjoyed with red rice or tingmo.

 Ema Datshi evolved to meet the specific requirements of Bhutan and its people – the dish is extremely high in fats, and the addition of chillies was meant to help improve circulation and offer warmth in the colder winter months. 
You can also try making different kinds of Datshi. Apart from the OG Ema Datshi, there is Kewa Datshi, which offers a milder twist with thinly sliced potatoes simmered in the same rich, cheesy broth, resulting in a hearty, comforting dish. 
Shamu Datshi, on the other hand, uses mushrooms, and combines them with the signature cheese sauce to create a dish that’s savoury and umami-rich. 
Beyond these classics, there are other creative versions like Goong Datshi (made with spinach) and mixed Datshi, which blends multiple vegetables like cabbage, radish, or green beans into the stew. 
How did it gain fame? In India, however, out of all the types, it is the chillies that have gained more attention for various reasons. Let us discuss each one of them. The Viral Deepika’s video  About a year ago, Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone mentioned a Bhutanese dish in an interview with Curly Tales, noting its similarity to Indian pickles - but with cheese instead of spices. “I forget the name of it, but they have this dish almost a national dish, if I’m not mistaken, which is basically chillies and cheese mashed together. And it’s an achaar equivalent, and they eat it with rice,” Deepika shared in the viral interview.

 Although she couldn’t recall the name at that time, it didn’t take long for the internet to figure it out, the dish she was referring to was none other than Ema Datshi. The clip from the interview quickly went viral, sparking a wave of curiosity.  Food vloggers and social media foodies also jumped on the trend, reimagining the dish in their own creative ways. As the dish is made out of simple ingredients, Ema Datshi became a must-try for home cooks (as it also became viral on YouTube) and food enthusiasts alike, ultimately earning its place as one of India’s most-searched recipes.

 Several eateries have benefited from this growing interest in Ema Datshi. Lha Kitchen, is a Delhi-based restaurant known for its authentic Himalayan cuisine. Amongst its most popular offerings is, unsurprisingly, Ema Datshi. Akshay, the restaurant’s manager of over three years, believes Deepika’s video played a key role in driving interest. Speaking to India Today, he shared, “It was a video by Deepika that also somehow sparked interest, even though there was some interest already for the dish to begin with.” Today, Lha Kitchen serves an average of at least 10 plates of Ema Datshi daily, a significant increase since Deepika's mention put the dish on India’s culinary map.‘Modern Indians have an adventurous palate’ Indians are travelling more than ever. This has also impacted their need and desire to explore various cuisines as authentically as possible. Shivani Sharma, a chefpreneur and founder of Gourmestan, says that the modern Indian is well-travelled, has an adventurous palate, and a desire to explore hitherto underexplored cuisines and dishes.

 “This is further amplified by social media, which have made the world smaller and, at the same time, more intriguing than ever before,” she says. With Bhutan opening its doors to tourists only relatively recently (in the mid-70s), there is a lot of curiosity about the culture and people of one of the happiest countries on earth, Shivani says.Increase curiosity amongst Indians about cuisines  Chef Ishijyot Surri, the executive chef and founder of Mulk, Miniyaturk & SJI Gourmet tells India Today that there is a surge in the popularity of Tibetan and Bhutanese food cultures, especially among urban food lovers.  “These cuisines stand out for their soulful and wholesome nature. I also believe the demand for niche food items such as Ema Datshi has increased in accordance with the rising demand for more commonly known Tibetan dishes such as thukpa and momos,” he says.  He also says this likeness to Indian comfort foods such as dal or curry makes it more approachable for Indians.  Shivani also credits this increased demand for such cuisines to a section of Indians who are becoming more exploratory diners. “There is a deeper understanding of and appreciation for how local cuisines are inextricably tied in to the narratives of the place and its people. Dishes such as Ema Datshi are made with local produce and can be found in nearly every home in Bhutan, the simplicity of such foods and their pastoral roots definitely make them immediate favourites,” Shivani says. Make Ema Datshi, the expert way  We asked experts to share their take on how to make Ema Datshi, so if haven’t tried the dish yet, here’s how you can make it, according to Ishijyot.  “Ema Datshi is all about balance—balancing the heat of the chilies with the creaminess of the cheese,” he says. 
Use fresh green and red chilies for authentic flavour and heat.
Traditionally, yak cheese is used; but a mix of feta and mozzarella works well as a substitute in India.
Simmer the chilies with garlic, onions, and tomatoes in a little water to build a robust base.

Shivani gives us a healthier way to make the Datshi.“Our take on Ema Datshi replaces the full-fat cheese with heart-healthier vegan alternatives, and also adds mushrooms to amplify the innate umami flavour of the yak cheese (Datshi),” she says. Check out the healthier recipe: 
Melt the butter in a thick-bottomed pan and sauté the onion and peppers.
Add the chillies and garlic and sauté until fragrant.
Add the mushrooms and tomato. Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins over medium heat.

   Shivani also credits this increased demand for such cuisines to a section of Indians who are becoming more exploratory diners.  “There is a deeper understanding of and appreciation for how local cuisines are inextricably tied in to the narratives of the place and its people. Dishes such as Ema Datshi are made with local produce and can be found in nearly every home in Bhutan, the simplicity of such foods and their pastoral roots definitely make them immediate favourites,” Shivani says. Make Ema Datshi, the expert way   We asked experts to share their take on how to make Ema Datshi, so if haven’t tried the dish yet, here’s how you can make it, according to Ishijyot.   “Ema Datshi is all about balance—balancing the heat of the chilies with the creaminess of the cheese,” he says. 
Use fresh green and red chilies for authentic flavour and heat.
Traditionally, yak cheese is used; but a mix of feta and mozzarella works well as a substitute in India.
Simmer the chilies with garlic, onions, and tomatoes in a little water to build a robust base.

This buzzword has sparked a wave of obsession, prompting beauty brands to invest heavily in the trend.
How, you ask? By launching a range of collagen-based products - from supplements and protein powders to moisturisers - capturing the attention of beauty influencers everywhere.  However, unlike other trends, which come and go, collagen stayed for all the right reasons, and looks like it is here to stay.But what is collagen?  Debjani Gupta, a nutritionist and wellness expert from Mumbai, tells India Today that collagen is a vital protein that makes up about 30 per cent of the body's total protein.

 It plays a key role in supporting the skin’s elasticity, plumpness, and firmness. In our twenties and thirties, when collagen levels are higher, the skin appears firm, toned, and radiant, especially if diet and lifestyle habits are healthy.  However, as we age into our forties and fifties, collagen production declines, leading to signs of ageing like sagging skin and reduced skin tone. Functions of collagen in the body Collagen serves several vital functions in the body, such as:
Replacing dead cells: It promotes the growth of new cells.
Protecting organs: Collagen serves as a protective layer for vital organs.
Maintaining skin elasticity: It provides the skin with structure, elasticity, suppleness, and strength.
Assisting blood clotting: Collagen plays a key role in blood clotting when injuries occur.
 All these functions (especially skin elasticity) have made collagen quite popular. However, supplements, powders made out of collagen actually is pretty expensive (avg price goes Rs 2,500 for 500 gm), which has made Indians, especially, turned to “juggad” and are opting natural recipes that allegedly help in boosting collagen production in our body. The viral natural collagen  In the quest for youthful, glowing skin, the spotlight has turned to humble kitchen staples- amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple.

 Today, Skinfluencers are calling it the ""OG collagen boosters"" on social media sites like Instagram. But are these everyday fruits and veggies really capable of turning back the clock on ageing skin? We asked the experts. Breaking down the viral ingredients Amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are often known for their antioxidant and Vitamin C content. But Dr Rinky Kapoor, a consultant dermatologist and surgeon at The Esthetic Clinics, Mumbai, says, “Ingredients like amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are called natural collagen boosters because they are rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants. These nutrients help support your body to produce more collagen for better skin health.""

 



Amla is high in antioxidants. Photo: Getty Images
 However, before you start gulping down litres of juice, here’s a reality check. ""While these ingredients are healthy, they may not work as effectively as collagen supplements,"" Dr Kapoor warns.  ""Juicing them can negatively affect their fibre and nutrient properties, so it’s best to consume them raw or cooked,"" she says.  Sujit Shanshanwal, a Mumbai-based dermatologist, highlights the role of Vitamin C in this process.  ""Vitamin C plays a vital role in collagen production, but not directly. It supports the enzyme activity required for collagen synthesis and slows down collagen degradation,"" he adds. Debjani agrees. She adds that the health of the gut is directly linked to skin health and collagen production. Food (like amla, apple and beet) are rich in fibre, antioxidants, and essential vitamins (like vitamin C) promote better gut health. A healthy gut ensures much clearer and firmer skin.  So, are these the ""OG"" collagen boosters? Not quite. But they do support collagen production indirectly by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants that keep your existing collagen healthy.But If you’re picturing a bowl of carrot-beet-apple salad turning into collagen for your skin, hold that thought. Science is a little more complex. Sujit explains, ""To create collagen, your body needs amino acids like proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline, which are primarily found in animal sources like meat, fish, and eggs. For vegetarians, plant-based sources include soy products, mushrooms, cabbage, legumes, spinach, nuts, and seeds.""

 In short, you need more than just amla and beetroot to get that coveted collagen glow. ""Amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple support collagen health by providing antioxidants and Vitamin C, but they alone are not sufficient to create collagen,"" adds Sujit. The star of the collagen world is marine collagen, which comes from fish skin, bones, and scales. ""Marine collagen is considered a rich source of collagen, typically found in the form of collagen peptides or hydrolysed collagen,"" he adds.The side effects  While amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are nutrient powerhouses, experts suggest they’re not without potential side effects if consumed in excess. 
Gastric discomfort: Debjani says, if you’re not used to raw juices or high-fibre fruits, suddenly drinking a large glass of beetroot-carrot-apple juice could leave you feeling bloated. This happens because fibre needs time to adjust in your system.

Digestive sensitivity: People with sensitive digestion may experience bloating, gas, or even diarrhoea if they consume too much of these fruits or their juices. Dr Kapoor recommends starting with small portions and slowly increasing your intake.

Nutrient loss during juicing: According to Shanshanwal, juicing strips away fibre and, if heat is involved, it can also degrade Vitamin C, a key player in collagen production. So, while juice may be trendy, whole fruits and veggies are the better option for overall nutrition.
 Pro tip: If you’re juicing these ingredients, don’t throw away the pulp. Use it to make parathas, tikkis, or even smoothies to retain the fibre.Tips to produce collagen naturally in your body So, if amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple aren’t magic collagen factories, what is? Here's what experts have to say. 
Eat a collagen-friendly diet: Your body needs amino acids like proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline to produce collagen. These amino acids are abundant in animal products like meat, fish, and eggs. Vegetarians can rely on soy products, mushrooms, legumes, spinach, nuts, and seeds.
Amp up your antioxidants: Foods like amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are rich in antioxidants, which protect your existing collagen from damage caused by free radicals (but they can’t produce collagen in your body). Think of them as a shield for your skin’s natural protein.
Get your dose of Vitamin C: No, you don’t have to chug litres of orange juice. Incorporate Vitamin C-rich foods like amla, citrus fruits, guava, and bell peppers into your daily diet. Vitamin C activates the enzymes that support collagen production.
Stay hydrated: Your skin cells are made of water, so staying hydrated keeps your skin plump and supple, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Exercise regularly: Sweat it out! Regular physical activity increases blood circulation, which promotes oxygen and nutrient delivery to the skin, boosting collagen production.
Protect your skin from UV damage: UV rays from the sun break down collagen in your skin, so wearing sunscreen is essential to maintain that youthful glow.
Consider marine collagen: If you’re open to supplements, marine collagen is a strong contender. Derived from fish, it’s often found in hydrolysed form, making it easier for your body to absorb. But, as Dr Kapoor cautions, ""Do not take collagen supplements without consulting a doctor as it may not be suitable for everyone."" Supplements should be your last resort. 
Remember  The hype around amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple as ""OG collagen boosters"" is both right and wrong. These ingredients don’t directly increase collagen production, but they support it by providing essential antioxidants, Vitamin C, and other nutrients that keep existing collagen strong. ""One should understand that no single ingredient or type of juice can help replace the need to adopt a healthy lifestyle,"" Dr Kapoor concludes.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 13, 2024

But can they truly be a game-changer in treating cracked heels and dry feet?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-viral-silicone-moisturising-socks-treat-cracked-heels-and-dry-feet-in-winter-2649006-2024-12-12,"Winter brings a host of skincare challenges, and our feet often bear the brunt of the season's harshness. Dryness and cracked heels are common issues many of us face during the colder months.
While slathering on moisturiser becomes a priority, it’s not always enough—particularly for tackling severely dry feet and cracked heels. So, what to do? The internet, meanwhile, appears to have a solution – using silicone socks. Unlike regular fabric socks, silicone socks function like a snug silicone glove for your feet. To use them, simply wash your feet thoroughly, slip on the socks, and leave them on for 15–30 minutes (or overnight). These reusable socks are easily available on platforms such as Amazon, Meesho, and Nykaa.

 



Silicone socks on sale on Amazon India.
 There is also a single-use moisturising socks variant – also widely available across online platforms. Single-use moisturising socks are infused with nourishing ingredients like shea butter and essential oils. In contrast, reusable silicone socks require you to apply your own moisturiser, balm, or serum before use. Essentially, they are designed to act as an occlusive layer, trapping moisture and enhancing the efficacy of any hydrating products. Both gel and silicone socks are expected to create a spa-like environment, promoting better hydration and healing, ultimately resulting in smoother, softer feet. Sounds great, right? But are these moisturising socks as good as they claim to be? Dermatologists want you to know a few things!Gel socks – a good addition to your winter routine According to experts, moisturising socks can be beneficial for feet during winter, but they are not a magical cure for cracked and dry feet. “Moisturising and gel socks, infused with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, or essential oils, can indeed be a valuable addition to foot care routines, especially during winter. The occlusive nature of these socks helps lock in moisture, promoting better absorption of the active ingredients. They can improve skin hydration, reduce dryness, and even help with cracked heels if used consistently,” says Dr Pratiksha Jain, associate consultant cosmetologist, SPARSH Hospital, Infantry Road, Bengaluru. “Think of them as sheet masks for your feet. These serum-soaked socks promise 20-30 minutes to baby-soft soles. But here’s the tea: they’re more like a band-aid than a cure. The star ingredient, usually butylene glycol, gives temporary hydration but doesn’t fix deep cracks,” adds Dr Geetika Srivastava, dermatologist and founder of Influennz Skin and Hair Clinic, Delhi.

 



Moisturising socks, available for purchase on Nykaa.
 We all love our sheet masks for an instant glow or as a pre-makeup ritual, right? However, the results are often quick but not long-lasting. The same applies to moisturising socks. Alternatively, you can incorporate them into an elaborate at-home pedicure session to give your feet some extra pampering.What about silicone socks? Silicone socks wherein you use your own foot cream or balm before putting these on are also dermat-approved. They can be worn for 15-20 minutes or overnight as well. “These beauties work via occlusion therapy. You slather on your favourite foot cream and wear the socks overnight. This locks in moisture and helps the cream penetrate deeper. It’s like tucking your feet into a spa cocoon while you snooze. We dermatologists love this technique for stubborn dryness,” says Dr Srivastava. For best results, use them with thick, emollient-rich foot creams containing ingredients like urea or hyaluronic acid. The prolonged contact overnight helps in repairing cracked heels and very dry skin.

 However, a few precautions should certainly be taken before using these silicone socks. “Clean and dry silicone socks properly after and before every use to prevent bacterial or fungal growth,” says Dr Jain. It is also very important to clean and dry your feet before using these socks. Wearing them for too long or without proper foot hygiene may create a moist environment, which could promote fungal infections like athlete’s foot. If you have cuts, wounds, or severe skin conditions, consult a dermatologist before using these socks.A good foot care routine Having soft and supple feet even in winter does not essentially require these gel or silicone socks. All you need is a good foot care routine. You can follow the expert-approved tips mentioned below:

Hydrate regularly: Apply a thick, emollient-rich foot cream with ingredients like urea, glycerin, or shea butter twice daily.
Exfoliate weekly: Use a gentle scrub or pumice stone to remove dead skin cells and prevent calluses.
Soak your feet: A warm foot soak with Epsom salts once a week can help soften skin and relieve dryness.
Wear socks: Opt for breathable cotton or wool socks to keep feet warm and protected.
Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from within.
Protect from cold: Avoid walking barefoot on cold floors, and moisturise immediately after bathing or washing your feet to lock in moisture.
So, are these socks a game-changer? For a quick fix, yes! But for long-term care? Stick to the classic winter foot care tips.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Should you wash your feet before going to bed? Doctors have THE answer

44925c52-5c56-496d-b596-6adf4b8baaf6,Does living together before marriage lower the chance of divorce?Thinking about marriage but unsure if you'll be able to adjust to living together? Why not try a live-in relationship first to see how things go before taking the next step?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/does-living-together-before-marriage-lower-the-chance-of-divorce-2648781-2024-12-12,"Being with someone you love is an amazing feeling, right? But where there's love, there are bound to be disagreements. And during those moments, we sometimes say things we've been holding back, like, ""Had I known this about you, I wouldn't have married you."" The truth is, being in a relationship is different from being married and sharing a life together. With the patience levels many have these days, it's no surprise divorce rates are on the rise. But if couples lived together before marriage, would it help the relationship? Could being in a live-in arrangement first be the secret to avoiding a split later? Let's find out from experts.Giving up easily Aarti Chawla, a Mumbai-based relationship psychotherapist and life coach, tells India Today that people are giving up on marriages for a variety of reasons. Fast-paced lifestyles, lack of patience, and low tolerance are key factors. Gone are the days when lovers waited a year to meet, convinced their parents, and wrote letters to woo someone. Now, it's easier to swipe left and right. If things don't work out, people are more willing to move on. Chawla adds that it's become easier to find another 'option' when things don't work out in a relationship. Financial stress is another contributor. With both partners often working and earning, financial issues can create tension. If couples can't meet the financial goals they had when they got married, it leads to disappointment and conflicts. Meanwhile, Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, feels modern society places a high value on personal growth and happiness, which can lead people to leave relationships that feel stagnant or unfulfilling. ""Divorce is no longer seen as a taboo or social stigma, making it an easier option for people,"" she adds. Many individuals have higher or unrealistic expectations of their partners, love, and relationships, often influenced by media portrayals that clash with reality. Ruuh also mentions that there’s a growing recognition that toxic or unbalanced relationships can affect mental well-being, prompting people to prioritise their mental health.Can live-in be a saviour? ""Research shows mixed results: some studies suggest that couples who live together before marriage report higher satisfaction, understanding, and stability, while others suggest it leads to 'cohabitation inertia,' meaning couples marry out of convenience rather than compatibility,"" says Ruchi Ruuh. For her, the answer is nuanced. While living together before marriage isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, it can help partners understand each other's habits, compatibility, and ability to navigate conflicts. Aarti Chawla agrees that a live-in arrangement helps couples understand each other more deeply.

 



A live-in setup helps you understand your partner better (Photo: Pexels/Cottonbro studio)
 ""It helps them see the nuances of living together—not just as roommates, but as companions for the next 40-50 years. Mental preparedness is key. For a couple to thrive, they need to consider all areas of life, including mental wavelength, physical compatibility, basic values, and financial goals. Live-in gives them time to truly understand each other at all levels,"" she says. Living together allows couples to learn each other’s routines and habits, reducing the chances of surprises down the line. In many cases, this makes divorce less likely, as the basics are in place.The pros of a live-in relationship Living together before marriage can serve as a compatibility check. It lets you observe your partner’s behaviour in real-life situations, including finances, responsibilities, stressful life events, and decision-making. Sharing space can also improve communication and conflict-resolution skills. ""You learn to see your partner as a whole person, beyond the idealised version,"" says Ruuh, adding, ""This is invaluable to understanding their true self."" Being in a live-in relationship also allows couples to break up without the fear of family or societal pressure, which can be a relief for those wanting to make the decision on their own terms.Don't skip the downsides However, a live-in relationship has its downsides. One major con is the lack of commitment. Often, after years of living together, couples part ways because there’s no formal commitment. This arrangement gives both partners the freedom to walk away without consequences. Additionally, live-in relationships can attract judgement, especially in conservative societies and cultures. Sometimes, living together can create a false sense of commitment, even when the relationship isn't solid. If the relationship ends, untangling shared living arrangements can be emotionally and financially taxing—often as painful as a divorce.

Thinking of giving it a try? If you’re considering a live-in arrangement before tying the knot, keep a few things in mind:
Clarify your goals: Discuss what the live-in arrangement means for both of you, including long-term plans like marriage. Clear goals keep things on track.
Split expenses: Agree on how to divide rent, groceries, and utilities.
Divide household tasks: Set expectations for chores and responsibilities to avoid resentment.
Check in regularly: Have regular conversations to ensure you're both satisfied with the arrangement.
Plan for the worst: Be clear about what will happen if the relationship doesn't work out, making any potential transition smoother.
Respect personal space: Living together doesn't mean you have to spend every moment together. Make sure you both have time for personal interests and friends.
Set financial expectations: List out your financial goals and expectations ahead of time.
Discuss non-negotiables: Be upfront about what’s acceptable and what isn’t in the relationship.
 If done thoughtfully, a live-in relationship can give you a better sense of whether marriage is the right step for you and your partner.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Move over grand gestures, micro-mance your way to loveTrending Reel

Here's how to deal with airplane ear If you feel a strange sensation in your ear as soon as your flight takes off, you might be dealing with airplane ear. While it can be uncomfortable, it can be relieved with some simple tricks.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/no-more-ear-ritation-heres-how-to-deal-with-airplane-ear-2648173-2024-12-11,"Does the excitement of your much-awaited trip suddenly fade the moment your flight takes off, thanks to a sharp, annoying pain in your ears? And worse, it doesn't just disappear mid-flight—it lingers even after you land. Even if you haven't experienced this yourself, chances are you know someone who can't stop complaining about the discomfort during their flight. This issue is real, and it can be more than just the constant popping of ears—airplane ear can be downright painful.So, why does it happen? ""Airplane ear, also called barotrauma, occurs when the pressure in the middle ear doesn't equalise with the air pressure outside. This may cause ear pain, uneasiness, and even lead to hearing impairment,"" Dr Girish Anand MS, consultant - ENT surgery, Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, tells India Today. The doctor explains that as an airplane takes off or lands, the air pressure in the cabin changes. He states, ""Normally, the Eustachian tube, a small canal connecting the middle ear to the back of the nasal cavity, equalises the pressure. However, sometimes, this tube can get blocked, preventing pressure equalisation."" To this, Dr Amitabh Malik, chief and HOD, department of ENT, Paras Health, Gurugram, adds that factors like sinus congestion, colds, or allergies can also affect the function of the Eustachian tube, making it more difficult for the ear to adjust to changes in pressure.It's quite common As per Dr Malik, airplane ear is a common phenomenon, particularly during flights. ""Almost everyone experiences some level of ear discomfort when flying, but some are more susceptible. People with sinus issues, colds, nasal congestion, or allergies are at higher risk because these conditions can interfere with the Eustachian tube's function,"" the doctor says. Additionally, infants and young children are more likely to struggle with airplane ear because their Eustachian tubes are smaller and may not work as effectively. Those with a history of ear infections or certain anatomical issues may also experience more severe symptoms.

 



You're not alone in dealing with airplane ear (Photo: Getty Images)
Know the symptoms Dr Manjunath MK, senior consultant - ENT surgeon, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, mentions that the most common symptom of airplane ear is a feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear. One may also experience ringing in the ears or temporary hearing loss. In more severe cases, it can lead to ear pain, and rarely, there may be a perforation of the eardrum.Save your ears
To help prevent or relieve the discomfort of airplane ear, try yawning or swallowing frequently, as this helps open the Eustachian tubes and equalise pressure.
Chewing gum or sucking on candy can encourage swallowing, which also balances pressure in the ear.
If you're dealing with sinus congestion or a cold, using a decongestant or nasal spray before your flight may reduce the risk of discomfort.
Valsalva maneuver, gently blowing your nose with your mouth closed, can also help open the Eustachian tubes.
It's best to avoid flying when you're sick, especially if you have a cold, allergies, or sinus infections, and if possible, delay your trip until you're symptom-free.
During the flight, try not to sleep during take-off or landing, as staying alert can help you manage pressure changes.
Keep chewing gum or munching sugar candies to encourage swallowing. You can also gently pop your ears by blowing your nose while pinching your nostrils closed.
When to seek professional help? According to the experts, in most cases, airplane ear resolves on its own after the flight without the need for medical treatment. However, if the symptoms persist, worsen, or cause significant discomfort, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional. If there is an infection or a ruptured eardrum, medical treatment such as antibiotics, pain relief, or ear drops may be required. In extreme cases, a doctor may recommend a procedure to help equalise the pressure in the ear.

 



Don't shy away from seeking help (Photo: Getty Images)
Now, before you check-in... You can easily avoid airplane ear by keeping a few simple tips in mind. Stay well-hydrated throughout your flight and steer clear of alcohol and caffeine. A helpful trick is sipping hot water during the journey to soothe your ears. And don’t forget to pack some chewing gum in your carry-on, it’s a handy way to help manage pressure changes.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 11, 2024ALSO READ |  Unpacking your bags after a vacation is tough.

In fact, even in India, where winter often marks the season of festivities and weddings, many of us also feel our mental well-being taking a hit. As this season approaches, our couch becomes our best friend, and leaving it - or even our bed - starts to feel like a monumental task. More often than not, all we want to do is lie around with our thoughts. Urban slang even has a name for it - seasonal depression - which hits us as sharply as the cold breeze that accompanies winter. But is “wintertime sadness”, aka ""winter depression"", actually real? Or is it just the weather messing with us? A quick scroll through Reddit or Quora reveals that plenty of people are asking the same thing — why does the mood shift as the sun sets or the seasons change?

Is mental health related to season change? Jasreen Birgi, counselling psychologist at Lissun, a digital mental health platform Delhi NCR, explains that winters in India are months of several festivities, but they are also filled with gloom and melancholy due to the chilling winds and shorter days.  She highlights that Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of sadness more prevalent in specific seasons, typically autumn and winter. It’s commonly referred to as ""winter depression,"" she says.   Dr Shilpi Saraswat, clinical psychologist at Sakra World Hospital, Bengaluru, agrees and tells India Today that, “SAD, is a recognised mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide.”  She adds that, like most depressive disorders, it ""affects mood, energy levels, sleep patterns, and appetite,"" and its symptoms include persistent feelings of sadness, low energy, and changes in sleep and eating habits.

 



A query on Quora. Photo: Quora
 Dr Arvind Otta, senior psychologist and mental health activist, further points out that it ""follows a seasonal pattern and typically worsens during autumn and winter months when daylight hours are shorter.”  He explains that ""the biological basis of SAD involves disruptions to circadian rhythms and changes in neurotransmitter levels, especially serotonin and melatonin.”Does science also agree? Experts unanimously agree that the link between weather and mood is undeniable. Birgi explains that reduced exposure to sunlight causes changes in brain chemistry, and this reduction ""triggers an increase in anxiety symptoms throughout the winter.”  According to Birgi, the decrease in sunlight affects our circadian rhythm and, in turn, impacts our sleep-wake cycles, increasing feelings of sluggishness and low energy.  “People also avoid going outside due to the cold weather, further limiting their exposure to natural light and physical activity, both of which are vital for mental health,” she says.

— NHS London (@NHSEnglandLDN) December 9, 2024 Dr Otta points to the role of sunlight in regulating serotonin levels, stating that people with SAD have increased serotonin transporter proteins during winter, leading to lower serotonin availability. He also notes the influence of atmospheric pressure changes, stating that gloomy weather characterised by overcast skies is associated with low serotonin levels, leading to feelings of depression or low mood. However, note that there aren't enough studies done on this area, so more studies are required to understand the illness better. How to deal with it? If the cold weather’s got you feeling blue, here’s what experts have to say on how to manage it. Increase exposure to natural light Mehezabin Dordi, a clinical psychologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, recommends spending time outside during daylight hours, even if it’s cloudy. She says natural light exposure can improve symptoms.   You can also keep curtains and blinds open to let in as much natural light as possible. Rearrange furniture to sit near windows.advertisementStay physically active
Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, increases serotonin levels, which help regulate mood.
If the weather permits, outdoor exercise combines physical activity with exposure to sunlight.
Maintain a healthy routine
Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Avoid oversleeping, as it can worsen symptoms.
Dr Otta suggests that healthy eating not only makes for a healthy weight but also balanced moods. “Omega-3 fatty acids, fruits and vegetables are, to some extent, good for the brain and quite very important with respect to one’s overall well-being. Prepare a menu for the winter so as not to get caught up by events,” he says. 
Be socially active 
Spend time with family and friends to avoid isolation, which can worsen depression. Experts like Dr Otta call it “talk therapy”.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT and other counselling therapies can support one in times of despair and provide strategies for coping. 
“Through this, you can learn to identify their negative thought patterns and ways to change the thinking for healthy counterparts, which seems very appropriate in cases of seasonal depression,” he says. 
Remember, sometimes, just discussing your feelings can make a big difference.
Meditate
Mindfulness practices like meditation can help you stay present and reduce feelings of hopelessness.
Try aromatherapy (avoid scented candles, though) with certain essential oils, like citrus and lavender, which may have mood-boosting effects.
However, if symptoms persist or significantly affect daily life, it’s important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can create a personalised treatment plan tailored to your needs.BottomlineWhether it’s cosy winters, wedding festivities, or grand celebrations, understanding your mental health triggers can help you stay balanced.

It is believed that urinating after sex is not merely a good hygiene practice but also keeps issues like UTI (urinary tract infection) and other infections away, especially among women.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-peeing-after-sex-really-prevent-uti-2647827-2024-12-10,"When Tanya, a 30-year-old writer from Delhi, got married, her mother shared a vital sexual wellness tip: always remember to pee after sex. “It will keep most infections away,” she told her. Sexual health is an essential part of overall well-being, and it comes with the responsibility of maintaining good hygiene to prevent infections. Among the many tips often recommended, one of the simplest (and most popular) is urinating after sexual intercourse. It is believed that doing so is not merely a good hygiene practice but also keeps issues like UTI (urinary tract infection) and other infections away – especially among women. UTIs are a common concern for sexually active women. Why? Well, Dr Vaishali Joshi, senior obstetrician and gynaecologist at Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, points out, ""Women are more prone to UTIs than men due to the proximity of their urinary and genital systems."" “After first intercourse, some women may develop a UTI. This is not uncommon and can occur due to bacteria entering the urinary tract during sexual activity. Common symptoms include burning during urination, frequent urination, or pain in the lower abdomen,” adds Dr Joshi.

But how important is this habit of peeing after intercourse, and does it truly help in preventing infections? We asked experts.Does peeing after sex matter?Dr Geeta Shroff, director of NuBella Centre for Women’s Health, emphasises that urination after intercourse is vital. But how important is this habit of peeing after intercourse, and does it truly help in preventing infections? We asked experts.Does peeing after sex matter? Dr Geeta Shroff, director of NuBella Centre for Women’s Health, emphasises that urination after intercourse is vital. “Peeing after sex can help prevent a urinary tract infection or even other infections, especially in females. During sexual intercourse, bacteria from the genital or anal areas can find their way into the urethra. Urinating after sexual intercourse ensures that these bacteria are expelled before they cause an infection,” Dr Shroff adds. Dr Kanika Jain, vice president of the Association of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Delhi (AOGD), professor and senior consultant, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, further explains, ""Sexual activity can introduce bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), into the urethra. Peeing afterward flushes these out before they ascend to the bladder, lowering the risk of infection."" It is recommended to urinate within 15–30 minutes of intercourse to flush out bacteria. “The first step is to drink plenty of water to help flush out the infection. If symptoms persist, antibiotics may be required to clear it. Prompt treatment is essential, as untreated UTIs can worsen, but they are generally not serious if addressed in time,” adds Dr Joshi.

 



Experts say peeing after sex does not ensure 100 per cent prevention but a reduced risk of getting a UTI. (Photo: Getty)
 Experts, however, add that peeing after sex does not ensure 100 per cent protection but certainly reduces the chances of getting a UTI. While not a foolproof method, it is an effective and simple precautionary measure for urinary health. Hydration also plays a key role here. “Drink enough water to enable you to urinate after sex,” says Dr Shroff. It is important to note while urinating after intercourse can help prevent a urinary infection, it plays no role in preventing STIs or vaginal infection. “Peeing specifically helps prevent UTIs but has no significant impact on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or vaginal infections,” says Dr Jain.Good hygiene tips to follow after intercourse Practising good post-sex hygiene can significantly reduce the risk of UTIs and other infections. It is important to use protection, avoid douching, and maintain overall genital and perineal hygiene. You may feel exhausted or not want to step out of bed and sleep right away, but getting up to pee, changing clothes, and gently cleansing your genitals can go a long way in keeping infections at bay. Here are some more expert-recommended tips:
advertisementGentle cleansing: Dr Shroff advises washing the genital area with warm water. Avoid harsh or scented soaps, which can disrupt the natural pH balance.
Change clothes: Avoid wearing tight clothes or non-breathable fabrics post-sex. Tight or damp clothing can encourage bacterial growth. Opt for loose-fitting, breathable cotton underwear to keep the area dry and fresh.
Wash your hands: Dr Joshi stresses the importance of clean hands before and after intercourse to prevent the transfer of germs.
Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water ensures regular urination, naturally flushing bacteria from the urinary tract.
Practise safe sex: Using condoms helps prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Monitor symptoms: If you notice signs of irritation, pain, or unusual discharge, seek a doctor. ""Ignoring symptoms can worsen infections, requiring more intensive treatment,"" warns Dr Joshi.
Wear breathable underwear: Choose cotton fabrics to prevent moisture build-up, which can encourage bacterial growth.
Clean sex toys: The sex toy culture is rising in India, with these products being just a BlinkIt away. While they are sure to make things exciting for you in the bedroom, cleaning them properly is essential to keep infections at bay. Doctors suggest washing toys with warm water and an appropriate cleanser after use to prevent bacterial transfer.
When to see a doctorRecurrent UTIs—defined as more than two to three infections within six months—may require specialist intervention.In the case of repeated UTIs, “routine tests performed are urine microscopic examination and urine culture and sensitivity. This will pick up the type of bacteria causing UTI and the effective antibiotics to clear the infection. The sonography of the kidney and bladder may be needed to look for after-effects of UTI,” shares Dr Joshi.Lastly...While peeing after sex is not a guarantee against UTIs or other infections, it is a simple and highly recommended practice to reduce risk. Combined with good hygiene habits and adequate hydration, it supports overall sexual and urinary health. As Dr Shroff puts it, ""It’s a small habit, but one that can make a big difference in your health and comfort.""Signs of suggestive infection, like burning while passing urine or frequent urination or pain in the lower part of the tummy, first thing, drink a lot of water, which helps to flush out the infection.

72ca3196-3bc0-42a6-9c8e-a9f8ad3a228e,"How long can you wear makeup without risking skin damage?Who doesn't love showing off flawless skin? While makeup can definitely help you achieve that perfect look, how long should you actually keep these products on?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/how-long-can-you-wear-makeup-without-risking-skin-damage-2647586-2024-12-10,"You might be the 'just a little blush, and I'm good to go' type, or perhaps you're all about that full-glam look—but one thing is for sure: makeup is a crucial part of our daily routine. And now, with men also embracing cosmetics to enhance their appearance, makeup has become even more universal. But here's the thing: as important as applying makeup is, removing it properly is even more crucial. We all know the cardinal rule—never go to bed with makeup on—but do you know how long you can actually wear makeup before it starts taking a toll on your skin?Bidding adieu is crucial Removing makeup well is important to allow your skin to breathe, repair, and regenerate. Dr Vidushi Jain, dermatologist and medical head at Dermalinks, NCR, tells India Today that if makeup is not removed properly, it clogs pores, disrupts the skin's natural barrier, and increases the risk of breakouts and premature ageing. To this, Dr Shifa Yadav, consultant - dermatology and cosmetology at Artemis Hospitals, Gurugram, adds that makeup residue can irritate the skin, causing redness, dryness, and other skin problems. Not only that, but long-term exposure to makeup residue can lead to skin discolouration and hyperpigmentation. It can also hinder the absorption of skincare products, as clean skin absorbs them more effectively, maximising their benefits.For how long should you wear makeup? According to Dr Jain, ideally, makeup should only be used for 8-12 hours at most. She mentions that wearing makeup for long periods can cause the products to settle into the skin and lead to issues, especially if they are non-comedogenic. On the other hand, Dr Yadav states that there's no definitive answer, as it depends on various factors like skin type, product quality, and individual sensitivity. ""However, it's generally recommended to limit makeup wear to a maximum of 10-12 hours per day,"" she adds. As per Dr Yadav, wearing makeup for too long can have the same impact on the skin as leaving residue—clogging pores, skin irritation, premature ageing, and drying out the skin. While makeup creates a protective layer on the skin, it can also disrupt its natural oil balance.

 Meanwhile, Dr Shireen Furtado, senior consultant - medical and cosmetic dermatology at Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, states that it is advisable to limit the application of makeup to a period that allows the skin to breathe and recover. It is often recommended that one should pay attention to their skin's response to prolonged makeup wear. Dr Furtado further tells us that wearing makeup can also have a positive impact. ""It can enhance the appearance of the skin by providing coverage for imperfections, evening out skin tone, and adding a healthy glow. Many formulations contain beneficial ingredients that can hydrate and protect the skin, contributing to a more polished look,"" she says. However, prolonged wear of products that contain harmful chemicals can compromise skin health.Reversing skin troubles To reverse the skin issues caused by wearing makeup for too long, you must detox your skin with a skincare routine that includes double cleansing, exfoliation, hydration, and nourishing serums that contain antioxidants, niacinamide, or hyaluronic acid for healing and rebalancing the skin. Focusing on makeup removal is very important. Make sure to follow a thorough cleansing routine so that no residue is left behind. Apart from this, you also need to focus on what you put in your body, as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and water can help improve skin health. However, if you have severe skin issues, consult a dermatologist for professional advice.

 



Make sure to thoroughly clean your skin after wearing makeup for an extended period (Photo: Getty Images)
Before long hours of makeup wear... Those who apply makeup for extended periods should make certain changes to their skincare regimen to maintain skin health and prevent potential damage. Remember to always use products that are non-comedogenic and do not strip the skin of its natural oils. Additionally, the inclusion of a broad-spectrum sunscreen is crucial, as it protects the skin from harmful UV rays, especially when makeup is worn throughout the day. The way you prep your skin before putting on makeup makes a big difference. Taking a break is vital. Try to minimise makeup wear, especially on days when you're not going out. Lastly, don't forget to include exfoliation and masking once a week.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 10, 2024ALSO READ |  Essential oils are Shraddha Kapoor's beauty secret.

US tech millionaire Bryan Johnson thinks so.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-you-live-forever-like-bryan-johnson-wants-to-2647404-2024-12-10,"Who doesn’t want to live forever? The idea of living a long, healthy life appeals to almost everyone. The quest for immortality has fascinated humans for centuries, serving as a central theme in numerous Bollywood and Hollywood films. But one man is taking this dream seriously—Bryan Johnson, a millionaire from the US, is actively trying to reverse his biological age and achieve what many fictional characters have only dreamed of: living forever. In fact, he believes it’s possible. Bryan even shares his daily routine on his website, offering people the chance to “subscribe” to his “Blueprint” if they want to follow in his footsteps. But is it really possible to extend your lifespan or, better yet, live forever? What do experts have to say about Bryan's lifestyle? And could you apply his routine to your own life? Before diving into these questions, let’s explore exactly what Bryan Johnson is doing in his pursuit of immortality. Bryan Johnson’s blueprint In 2013, after selling his company to eBay’s PayPal for $800 million, Bryan had plenty of options on how to spend his fortune. He could have travelled the world, bought a mansion, and lived a life of luxury. But instead, he decided to dedicate his life to chasing immortality — a quest that has earned him significant attention, especially after making headlines with his ""Project Blueprint"", a protocol-based lifestyle designed to help people live longer. The Blueprint, which is available for free, outlines Bryan's daily routine and how it has allegedly helped him achieve the biological age of an 18-year-old. For context, biological age refers to how old your cells are, and some experts consider it a more accurate measure of ageing than chronological age.

His daily routine includes light therapy, and taking 111 supplements, including the widely discussed 'Rapamycin' (he paused taking it after a few years). Good sleep and daily workouts are also a few key aspects of Bryan’s lifestyle. He consumes precisely 1,977 calories a day and eats 70 pounds of vegetables per month. His breakfast consists of a standard mix of broccoli, cauliflower, black lentils, mushrooms, garlic, and ginger. His next meal is ""nutty pudding"" with nuts and berries, and his final meal includes vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, 15 grams of 100% dark chocolate, and 30 millilitres of extra virgin olive oil.He also allows himself 'three' ounces of wine to end his day.Managing stress is vital for him, and he claims it plays a key role in living longer.PS: Although Bryan's Blueprint is technically free to access, he also sells products like protein powder and (soon-to-be-released) sunscreen under the guise of promoting health and longevity.What has Bryan achieved so far?advertisementBryan claims his lifestyle has helped him reverse his biological age by over 5 years, and his blood transfusion has helped his father do the same.

Here's what they had to say about its key components. 1. Working outBryan prioritises workouts, recommending three days of strength training and three days of cardio each week. Dr Aijaaz Ashai, a physiotherapist and celebrity fitness expert, supports this, stating that exercise can delay age-related diseases, preserve mobility, and enhance mental sharpness.On a cellular level, regular exercise helps maintain the length of telomeres—protective caps on DNA—which slow down the ageing process. ""While no one lives forever, a regular exercise routine can certainly add to your lifespan and improve the quality of your remaining years,” says Dr Ashai.2. Mental healthadvertisementAccording to Bryan’s Blueprint, if you buy his products — especially his “Best-selling longevity kit” with 70+ health actives — you’ll be able to manage daily challenges “with ease as stress-reducing ingredients promote calm and balanced emotions”.While managing stress is undoubtedly a priority for Bryan, can it help you live forever? According to mental health expert Shreya Kaul, the answer is a firm no.“Our bodies naturally start to deteriorate after a certain point. Our cells, organs, and genetics all begin to disintegrate. No living being is truly immortal,” she says.However, she does agree that managing stress is essential for leading a better, healthier life. She highlights that mental and physical health are deeply connected, with better mental health leading to improved immunity, energy, and agility.3. Clean diet and supplementsOne of the biggest pillars of Bryan’s Blueprint is his ultra-clean diet and daily consumption of 111 supplements. While research does show that healthy eating can reduce the risk of premature death by nearly 20%, it’s unlikely to guarantee immortality.Dr Nivedita Pandey, a senior gastroenterologist and director of Dr Good Deed Clinic, Patna, agrees. She highlights that free radicals (unstable molecules generated during digestion) damage our organs, leading to ageing. Eating natural, whole foods can help reduce free radicals, promoting longer and healthier lives.

Dr Aijaaz Ashai, a physiotherapist and celebrity fitness expert, supports this, stating that exercise can delay age-related diseases, preserve mobility, and enhance mental sharpness. On a cellular level, regular exercise helps maintain the length of telomeres—protective caps on DNA—which slow down the ageing process. ""While no one lives forever, a regular exercise routine can certainly add to your lifespan and improve the quality of your remaining years,” says Dr Ashai.2. Mental health According to Bryan’s Blueprint, if you buy his products — especially his “Best-selling longevity kit” with 70+ health actives — you’ll be able to manage daily challenges “with ease as stress-reducing ingredients promote calm and balanced emotions”. While managing stress is undoubtedly a priority for Bryan, can it help you live forever? According to mental health expert Shreya Kaul, the answer is a firm no. “Our bodies naturally start to deteriorate after a certain point. Our cells, organs, and genetics all begin to disintegrate. No living being is truly immortal,” she says. However, she does agree that managing stress is essential for leading a better, healthier life. She highlights that mental and physical health are deeply connected, with better mental health leading to improved immunity, energy, and agility.3. Clean diet and supplements One of the biggest pillars of Bryan’s Blueprint is his ultra-clean diet and daily consumption of 111 supplements. While research does show that healthy eating can reduce the risk of premature death by nearly 20%, it’s unlikely to guarantee immortality. Dr Nivedita Pandey, a senior gastroenterologist and director of Dr Good Deed Clinic, Patna, agrees. She highlights that free radicals (unstable molecules generated during digestion) damage our organs, leading to ageing. Eating natural, whole foods can help reduce free radicals, promoting longer and healthier lives.

 Now let's talk about supplements. When it comes to supplements, dietician Sohom Singh Roy, Redcliffe Labs, says they can bridge nutrient gaps in our diet. Targeted supplements can support immunity, brain function, and overall health. However, Kumaar Bagrodia, a neuroscientist from Mumbai and founder of various companies like HALE, NeuroLeap, Arkni and PhotoBioLife, tells us, not all supplements have enough scientific evidence as to their benefits. He notes that while calcium, iron, Vitamin D, folic acid, and omega-3 have strong evidence supporting their benefits, supplements alone can never replace a balanced diet.4. Sleep, sleep, sleep Bryan treats sleep as a non-negotiable part of his day. Experts agree. Kumaar calls it the ""golden hour"" for mental health, as it helps with memory consolidation, emotional processing, and tissue repair.

 “Sleep is crucial for mood regulation. It reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression and promotes emotional balance. It also supports biological well-being by enhancing energy levels and strengthening immunity,” he says. 5. Light therapy Bryan’s routine also includes light therapy - a growing trend, with even celebrities like Kim Kardashian adopting it.

 Kumaar explains that light of specific wavelengths can stimulate, heal, and regenerate cells and tissues. ""It naturally improves cellular mitochondria function. The therapy is non-invasive and promotes cellular repair, similar to how sunlight influences vitamin D synthesis,"" he says.The final breath: Can you live forever? After speaking with various experts, one thing becomes clear - biological immortality is still a fantasy. While Bryan’s lifestyle may help him maintain youthful biomarkers, there’s no scientific evidence that it will prevent death. ""Biologically, the human body is subject to the processes of ageing and senescence,"" says Kumaar. ""Cells accumulate damage over time due to oxidative stress, DNA mutations, and telomere shortening. Despite advances in regenerative medicine and anti-ageing therapies, these natural constraints make true immortality unlikely,"" he adds. Shreya also points out that discussions on health and longevity are often rooted in privilege. ""Bryan Johnson's 'Don't die' movement is great. Everyone wants to live longer and healthier, so why not? But not everyone has the luxury of prioritising longevity,” she explains. ""For people struggling to survive day to day, thoughts like 'This is killing me faster' don't even cross their minds. Their main concern is, 'How will I get food on the table tomorrow?,"" Shreya adds.  While Bryan Johnson's efforts are admirable, the idea of living forever remains a distant dream. For now, the best we can do is strive for a healthier, longer, and more meaningful life, so think twice before investing in someone's blueprint of living forever.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 10, 2024Must Watch

The alarm rings, but you're so cosy under your layers of blankets that the snooze button is just too tempting. You give in and drift back into sweet sleep, only to be awakened by the alarm again a few minutes later. You may hit snooze once more, but eventually, you know it's time to muster the courage to face the bone-chilling cold. As you prepare for the day, you begin the usual routine - brushing your teeth, enjoying a hot shower, and finally gearing up to pick your OOTD. You want something that keeps you warm while also checking the style box. Sounds like a daily sartorial conundrum? You're not alone. But here's the good news—we have a suggestion: befriend a few turtlenecks.

 Warm and cosy, turtlenecks are a basic winter staple, but when styled well, they can be the secret to a fabulous winter wardrobe. On mornings when you're running late and don't want to spend hours deciding what to wear, turtlenecks come in handy. Pair one with a pair of jeans, and you're good to go! If it’s too cold, layer up with a faux-leather jacket or an overcoat, and you’re all set. For party nights when you want to slay without freezing, pair your turtleneck with a leather skirt and boots. It’s as simple as that! Stylists highly recommend including turtlenecks, even when building a minimalist winter capsule wardrobe. Think of it as the white T-shirt of your summer wardrobe. From beach outings to workdays and brunch dates, your favourite white T-shirt works for almost any occasion, right? A turtleneck serves the same purpose during winter. And let’s not forget how it keeps your neck warm, protecting it from the winter chill. Its versatility is its biggest strength! It goes well with just about anything. You can wear it on its own or layer it with an open jacket or a cosy cardigan. No surprises here that celebrity winter looks are incomplete without a few iconic turtleneck moments every year!
This winter, it has already begun! Priyanka Chopra recently flaunted an ivory turtleneck that she teamed with matching trousers and a black jacket with faux fur accents. So luxe!

 Priyanka has had several stunning turtleneck moments in the last few years! She often throws over long overcoats. Deepika Padukone is the quintessential poster girl for turtleneck sweaters. Whenever the temperatures dip in Mumbai, she turns to her trusted turtlenecks – especially for her airport looks.

 Some pro tips:
Invest in basic turtlenecks like black, beige, fawn, and maroon first.
To give a glam makeover to a turtleneck, add a statement piece – it can be a skirt, a stunning jacket, or a quirky jewellery piece.
Turn to vibrant or multi-coloured turtlenecks to make winter fashion look edgy.
Pair an oversized turtleneck with your favourite jeans and sneakers for a relaxed look.
Layer a neutral-coloured turtleneck under a tailored blazer or a coat to ace the ‘office chic’ vibe.
A black or metallic turtleneck paired with a leather skirt and knee-high boots is the ultimate party combo.
To keep it sporty and athleisure, style a loose turtleneck with tights and chunky sneakers.

20f0639d-7181-4151-935c-51c36a740dcb,"Why solo trips are essential, even when you have a partner or kidsTravelling solo might seem odd when you have a partner, but it offers unique benefits that strengthen both your relationship and personal growth.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/why-solo-trips-are-essential-even-when-you-have-a-partner-or-kids-2646687-2024-12-08,"Happily married with two kids and always vacationing as a family. Does this sound like your story? Then keep reading. You’ve probably heard people say, “It was so much fun when I was single, but things have changed now that I’m married and have kids.”  For many, once a relationship deepens or a family grows, self-care quietly takes a backseat. Prioritising others' needs and happiness often becomes the default - even if it means sacrificing something that once brought you immense joy. Solo travel is often one of the first casualties. Society doesn’t make it any easier. The moment you mention travelling alone post-marriage or post-kids, the raised eyebrows and unsolicited comments begin. “How can you enjoy yourself alone?” or “Won’t you feel guilty leaving your kids behind?” These are just a couple of the judgemental remarks people endure. But pause for a moment and think: Are you holding yourself back because of societal expectations or fear of how your family might cope without you? If so, it’s time you needed some changes. Suppressing your passion - especially something as fulfilling as solo travel - does no good. Neglecting what you love only takes a toll on your mental well-being, and in the long run, this can affect your relationships too.
 


Why is it important to travel solo?An Indian household typical when a girl just randomly asks her parents – can I visit Goa with my college friends, please? Or let’s say she asks – I am going on a solo trip to Himachal Pradesh. Could you lend me some money? The cliché response would be – shaadi ke baad jahaan jana hai jao, not before!And then, after some years, when that girl finally gets married – she has a so-called “permanent travelling partner” for life. So, when is it her time to go and explore the world solo? More than men, it’s women who often have to give up on their aspirations and hobbies. However, irrespective of your relationship status, gender, or profession, everyone should travel solo, and experts highly recommend it.Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai, tells India Today, that travelling solo allows people to explore their preferences, dislikes, goals, and visions for life. It cultivates a sense of autonomy and freedom that is crucial for personal growth.“In the Indian context, where societal norms often emphasise the collective ‘we’ system, marriage or relationships are frequently associated with a sense of responsibility. A solo trip, therefore, becomes a form of self-care, helping you nurture your individuality while still existing as a partner to someone else,” she adds.

Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, says, that in relationships, solo travelling helps maintain a sense of self that is often crucial for a healthy dynamic.“Healthy relationships are built on a concept called differentiation, which simply means that you celebrate being individuals while coming together to be a couple.

98ae2a9c-b5a7-4bb0-a779-8f1a0515a3e2,Pilates vs weight training: Which one helps you lose weight faster?Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century during World War I as a method to rehabilitate injured soldiers and dancers. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/pilates-vs-weight-training-which-one-helps-you-lose-weight-faster-2646112-2024-12-07,"If there’s one thing Bollywood icons like Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, and Janhvi Kapoor all have in common in their fitness routines, it isn’t a magical elixir for their youth and glamour - it’s their dedication to Pilates. In the past few years, Pilates has become quite the buzzword in the fitness industry. Though in India, it is gaining prominence now, Bollywood celebs have been obsessed with pilates for some time now.  But if you’re not aware, let us give you a crash course. What exactly is Pilates? Pilates is a form of low-impact exercise that focusses on strengthening muscles and improving flexibility, balance, and posture.  “The practice emphasises controlled movements, core strength, and proper alignment,” says Dr Vipul Lunawat, a fitness expert and the founder-director of the Institute of Sports Science and Technology of Pune.

 Dr Lunawat says that there are a few core principles of Pilates, like:
1. Concentration: Mindful engagement with each movement.
2. Control: Precision and mastery of your body’s movements.
3. Centering: Focus on your core, often referred to as the ""powerhouse"".
4. Flow: Smooth, continuous movements.
5. Precision: Attention to detail in form and technique.
6. Breathing: Proper breath control to enhance movement and relaxation.From World War I to celeb favorite Meenal Pathak, tells India Today that Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century during World War I as a method to rehabilitate injured soldiers and dancers.

 “Today, it has become particularly relevant because of our sedentary lifestyles, poor posture, and long sitting hours, which often lead to issues like wrist pain, shoulder pain, and joint discomfort,” says Meenal.  According to her, Pilates is highly effective (for both men and women) for addressing these problems as it, focuses on improving mobility and flexibility, alongside other benefits. It works wonders for posture, core strength, and spinal health. Pilates is all about strengthening, lengthening, and protecting your spine, which makes it an excellent choice. Now, there are two ways of doing Pilates: mat Pilates (which is done with very minimal or no equipment) and the more famous and preferred one by celebs is the other type - which uses a machine called reformer.

 This reformer Pilates has not only made quite a buzz on social media, as they are preferred by not only Bollywood celebs but by also influencers.  According to Meenal, “Mat Pilates is a fantastic way to start. It allows you to build strength and learn proper alignment without any tools. Small props like resistance bands can enhance the workout, but they’re not essential.” For those who want more variety, reformer Pilates uses machines with springs and straps to add resistance. Abhishek Bhadauria, Head Coach at MultiFit, notes, “The essence of Pilates lies in core engagement, and that can be achieved with or without equipment.”Weight training and Pilates: which can help you lose weight faster? Now, the question of the hour is, if you are trying to lose weight, which one can help to reach the goal faster, and which one should you prefer? We spoke to experts, and let’s have a look at both of them in depth.   1. Calorie burn
advertisementWeight training: A single high-intensity session burns more calories than Pilates and induces the afterburn effect (EPOC), where the body continues to burn calories post-workout.
Pilates: While it generally burns fewer calories, advanced Pilates sessions incorporating faster transitions or reformer machines can boost calorie expenditure.
2. Muscle building and metabolism
Weight training: Builds lean muscle, increasing resting metabolic rate (RMR) for long-term calorie burn.
Pilates: Tones muscles and enhances functional strength, but its impact on RMR is less significant.
Abhishek says, “Pilates excels in improving flexibility, balance, and core strength, making it an excellent choice for those seeking low-impact exercise or rehabilitation. Weight training, on the other hand, is ideal for building muscle mass and boosting metabolism. Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual goals and preferences.”3. Functional benefits
Pilates: Excels in flexibility, balance, and posture, reducing injury risk. As Dr Lunawat, explains, “Pilates is crucial for mobility and flexibility, which are often overlooked in traditional strength training but are vital for long-term health and injury prevention.”
Weight training: Improves bone density and overall strength, which is essential for physical resilience and metabolism.
Finally, as Jashan Bhumkar, fitness enthusiast, notes, “Both have their merits, but if Pilates motivates you to stay active, it’s just as effective in the long term.”advertisementWhich is faster for weight loss?In simple terms, weight training has the edge for rapid weight loss, largely due to its calorie-burning potential and metabolic benefits. A 2019 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that resistance training significantly improves body composition by reducing fat while preserving lean muscle.Dr Lunawat adds, “A combination of weight training and a calorie-controlled diet is ideal for quicker results. But Pilates can play a complementary role, improving mobility and aiding recovery.”Meenal says, “If your goal is to lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit. Pilates tones and builds functional strength, but adding weight training will help preserve muscle mass.”Why not combine the two?For maximum benefits, a balanced routine combining Pilates and weight training is ideal.

Rida, a content creator based in Bengaluru, currently has over a million followers on Instagram. However, she admits in her video that she hadn’t expected her vision board to become a reality. From spending more time with her friends and family to going on international solo trips and even buying an expensive piece of jewellery, Rida claims her vision board turned into reality.

But Rida is not alone. A quick search on the Internet today will reveal hundreds, uhm perhaps thousands, of influencers sharing videos on vision boards and how ""it has actually worked for them."" Vision boards have become the ""IT"" trend right now, and as each year comes to a close, such videos resurface in full force. From DIY vision board tutorials to ""vision board vs reality"" comparisons, and how they have ""manifested their vision board"" these videos are everywhere. But can a vision board actually help you achieve your goals for the next year, or is it just another passing trend? We asked the experts.What exactly is a vision board? If you haven’t seen the viral videos, let us tell you, a vision board is a creative visual representation of one’s goals, dreams, and aspirations. It typically takes the form of a collage made up of images, quotes, and affirmations that reflect what you aim to achieve in life. Think of it as a personal roadmap in picture form, offering a daily reminder of where you’re headed. As Aamish Dhingra, ICF-PCC certified life coach and co-founder of Cocoweave Coaching International, puts it for India Today, “Vision boards are like a compass. They provide clarity and direction but require you to take the journey.”   But can a vision board actually help you achieve your goals for the next year, or is it just another passing trend?

Absy Sam, a Mumbai-based psychologist, explains, “When we talk about the visual or the images that are created, the brain is able to process them much faster than words. This visual aid helps with clarity, memory retention, and emotional connect.” Today, vision boards are all over all the social media platforms, like YouTube, and is becoming an influencer's way of achieving goals. In fact, a lot of people (read: influencers) are hosting get-togethers so that they can make their vision boards together.

What does science have to say about vision boards? A post shared by Lisa | Toronto (@li.gorbunova)
 The effectiveness of vision boards is backed by psychology and neuroscience. The concept revolves around the brain’s Reticular Activating System (RAS), a network of neurons. Technically, it is a network of nerves in the brainstem that controls wakefulness, sleep-wake transitions, and behaviour. In simple terms, it acts as filtering out the things that are important to our brain.   Clinical psychologist Mehezabin Dordi from Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital explains, “When you visualise a goal, your brain activates neural pathways similar to when you physically work toward that goal. The RAS filters information and directs your focus toward things relevant to your goals.” She explains that if an individual has an exam and makes a vision board about it, it will help them. “Having a look at the vision board on a daily basis keeps your mind aware of your target and your brain functions in a way that syncs with your goal. For instance, if your vision board has a picture of obtaining first position in your final exam, your mind automatically starts functioning in the process of attaining those goals in the form of habits and actions and seeks out opportunities to fulfil that dream,” she says.

 Aamish elaborates, “If you repeatedly and persistently visualise your aspiration in life, your subconscious mind helps you take steps toward it by spotting opportunities or people that align with your goal.” This is why people often feel as though “luck” is on their side when, in reality, they have simply trained their minds to recognise opportunities.Benefits of making a vision board Creating a vision board can bring several emotional, mental, and practical benefits. Here’s a look at how it can make a difference (expert approved):
Clarity of goals: Vision boards make abstract desires concrete. Absy highlights that “when you use a vision board, it helps you bring all your abstract ideas into something visual and more structured.” This clarity allows for more precise goal-setting and action planning.
Motivation and inspiration: Looking at a vision board daily can be a powerful motivator. Aamish says, “The vision boards are quite motivating by giving you an imaginary perspective of success. This motivates you towards goal accomplishment to take needful actions.”
Emotional connection: The use of images and affirmations creates an emotional link with your goals. Shreans Daga, an approved life coach and spiritual teacher and chairman of Pyramid Valley International, says, “It’s not enough to think about a goal; you need to feel it with your entire being.” 
Focus and reduced distractions: Vision boards direct your mind’s focus on what matters. Absy tells India Today, “The ultimate goal of a vision board is to limit your distracted mind towards an image that has your dream encapsulated in a physical form.” This focus is essential for overcoming daily distractions and staying on track.
Increased self-belief and confidence: Visualisation strengthens positive neural pathways in the brain. Mehezabin notes that “visualizing success helps reinforce positive beliefs, boosting confidence and reducing self-doubt.”
advertisement‘Vision board alone can’t help you achieve your dreams’Experts caution that a vision board alone isn’t a magical solution. Shreans says that vision boards are not magic wands; they are tools for focus and intentionality. advertisement“The real magic happens when your thoughts, feelings, and actions align. Visualisation must be paired with action and effort for tangible results,” he says. Mehezabin agrees. She says that a vision board by itself cannot guarantee success, but it can be a valuable tool when combined with action and effort. “Creating a vision board helps clarify goals and serves as a visual reminder of what you want to achieve. It can strengthen motivation by keeping your focus on the end result, especially during challenging times,” she says.

All these have made vision boards popular amongst people, as they have a mix of both scientific and spiritual ways of achieving what you want in life, and working towards it. Social media have further amplified their appeal, with platforms showcasing creative, aesthetic and visually inspiring content that encourages people to adopt this practice. How to make your own vision boardCreating a vision board is a personal and creative process, and there’s no single right way to do it. But if vision boards still interests you, and here’s a quick step-by-step guide to get you started:
Define your goals: Start by reflecting on what you want in key areas of your life—career, relationships, health, personal growth, and finances. Think about where you want to be next year (since this trend focuses on making a new vision board every year).
Gather materials: You’ll need a board (corkboard, cardboard, or even a large piece of paper), scissors, glue, tape, and a collection of magazines, printouts, or photographs. If you prefer a digital version, there are plenty of online vision board tools and apps. But here we are talking about the offline one. 
Select images and words: Choose images, affirmations, and words that resonate with your goals. For example, if you aim to achieve fitness goals, you might add pictures of healthy food, active people, or motivational phrases that match the vibes. 
Organise and design: Arrange your images and words on the board in a way that feels right to you. You can divide it into sections for different life areas or create a free-flowing collage.
Add emotional elements: Make sure your vision board is personal to you. Include words that inspire your feelings of excitement, gratitude, or joy.
Pro tip: Place your vision board somewhere you’ll see it daily—on your bedroom wall, in your workspace, or as a screensaver on your phone.Absy Sam says that setting realistic, manageable goals on your vision board is essential to avoid disappointment. Small, actionable steps are key to maintaining motivation.“One thing that is very crucial for dream fulfilment is action. Vision boards can control your subconscious mind by aligning it with your goal, but physical action has to be done by you,” Aamish concludes.

 Are you also wondering what makes these creams trigger that warming effect on your skin? Well, menthol and capsaicin are mostly the key ingredients in this case. “Warming creams contain specific ingredients like capsicum extract, menthol, or certain essential oils that trigger a warming sensation on the skin. These components improve blood circulation in the applied area, which generates a sense of warmth,” says Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant - aesthetic physician, Gleneagles Hospital, Bengaluru. These lotions, essentially, stimulate the sensory receptors in the skin leading to the warming effect. “The active ingredients include capsaicin, menthol, or camphor. These interact with the nerve endings in the skin, creating a heat response. Capsaicin increases blood flow to the applied area, thereby producing warmth. Menthol initially causes a cooling effect, but this can be followed by a warming effect. This helps to relax the muscles, calm the tension, and comfort at the cold temperature,” explains Dr Shivani Yadav, consultant - dermatology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Gurugram. Warming lotions are popular in the West, and are also being created by Indian brands. Clensta, a skincare brand backed by Parineeti Chopra, has a product in this category. They use ingredients like ginger oil and Vanillyl Butyl Ether to create the warming effect.Are these safe to use? Dermatologists say these creams are mostly harmless, but a patch test is always recommended. Additionally, those with sensitive skin, pre-existing skin conditions, or allergies should exercise caution, as these creams can sometimes cause irritation, redness, or discomfort. Patch test “Generally, most people do not have to worry if winter warming creams are applied correctly, but caution must always be taken. They normally include capsaicin or menthol, causing the skin to feel like it is heating up. This can sometimes cause an irritation of sensitive skin and allergy reactions. One must conduct a patch test before a full application. Use them with great care on broken or inflamed skin,” suggests Dr Yadav. Avoid sensitive areas Dr Sachdev suggests not applying warming lotions on broken skin, near the eyes, or mucous membranes. Follow instructions Read the ingredients and buy from reputable brands. Always read the package to use the recommended amount and avoid excess application. Winter warming creams can be beneficial for providing temporary relief and comfort during cold weather. But individuals with sensitive skin, pre-existing skin conditions, or allergies should exercise caution, as these creams can sometimes cause irritation, redness, or discomfort. If you witness burning, itching or prolonged redness, it is better to stop using the product immediately. Consult a dermatologist immediately in case of allergy issues.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

What is OCD, really? A post shared by Ekta Khurana | PSYCHOLOGIST | THERAPIST (@ektakhurana_)
 We often toss around the term OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) casually, but it is a mental health condition characterised by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) that a person feels driven to perform. These compulsions are not done for fun or preference but to ease the intense anxiety caused by the obsessions. Delhi-based psychologist and therapist Ekta Khurana says, “OCD is a serious issue that many people face daily. It’s not just about occasional intrusive thoughts or habits that people joke about. While it’s normal to have random thoughts, if they’re persistent, intrusive, and cause anxiety, it’s important to take them seriously.” For example: Obsession: Fear of harming loved ones unintentionally. Compulsion: Repeating specific prayers or rituals to prevent harm. While compulsive cleaning can be one symptom, it’s just one possibility in a broad spectrum.Common misconceptions Dr Rajiv Mehta, vice-chairperson of psychiatry at Sir Gangaram Hospital, says, “The most common misconception about OCD is that it is a weakness of self. It is not a disorder, but the person is deliberately repetitively doing the things.” “The other misconception is that as the person is deliberately doing the things, he or she can control the acts by self,” he adds. Besides, the stereotype of OCD is that it is about cleanliness. But it does not highlight a person’s other struggles. Someone with OCD might repeatedly check locks, count in specific patterns, or experience intrusive, distressing thoughts.

 You may like to believe it or not, but OCD can severely impact a person's daily life. People with severe OCD may spend hours a day trapped in obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals, interfering with work, relationships, and overall well-being.What can cause it Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a complex condition, and its exact cause is not fully understood, says Archana Singhal, founder of Mindwell Counsel, Delhi. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is a widely used clinical tool for assessing the severity of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It helps measure the intensity of both obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviours or mental acts) in individuals diagnosed with OCD, she adds. However, several factors are believed to contribute to the development of OCD, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological influences. These factors might work together to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. Singhal states some of the key potential causes: Genetic factors: Research suggests that genetics can play a significant role in the development of OCD. Having a family member with OCD increases the risk of developing the disorder, indicating a genetic predisposition. Studies have shown that OCD tends to run in families, suggesting that inherited genes may influence the brain's functioning in a way that contributes to the disorder. However, it's important to note that genetics alone is unlikely to be the sole cause of OCD. Brain structure and function: There is evidence that abnormalities in certain areas of the brain may contribute to OCD. Specifically, dysfunction in the circuitry involving the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and cingulate cortex has been implicated. These regions of the brain are involved in processing anxiety, decision-making, and behaviour regulation. In individuals with OCD, these brain areas may become overactive or fail to communicate properly, leading to the repetitive, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and actions (compulsions) characteristic of the disorder. Chemical imbalances (neurotransmitters): Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, anxiety, and behaviour, is thought to be involved in OCD. It is believed that people with OCD may have an imbalance of serotonin in their brains, which could contribute to the intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviours that are central to the disorder. This has led to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of OCD, which can help balance serotonin levels and alleviate symptoms for many individuals. Environmental factors: Environmental stressors or traumatic events can play a role in the onset or exacerbation of OCD. For example:
advertisementStressful life events such as the death of a loved one, divorce, abuse, or significant life changes can trigger or worsen OCD symptoms in some people.
Childhood trauma or adverse childhood experiences (such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse) may also increase the risk of developing OCD later in life. Some studies suggest that trauma can trigger OCD symptoms in predisposed individuals, particularly when combined with other factors like genetics.

Additionally, infection has been proposed as a potential trigger for OCD, particularly in children. This is known as PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections), where a strep infection may lead to sudden-onset OCD symptoms, although this theory remains controversial and is not universally accepted.Cognitive and behavioural factors: Some theories of OCD focus on cognitive and behavioural patterns. Cognitive models suggest that people with OCD may have certain cognitive biases, such as: Overestimating threats: They may perceive normal, everyday situations as dangerous or needing to be controlled. Inflated sense of responsibility: People with OCD might believe that they are responsible for preventing harm and that they must perform specific behaviours (compulsions) to prevent disasters.advertisementIntolerance of uncertainty: People with OCD often have difficulty tolerating uncertainty, which leads them to engage in compulsive rituals to reduce anxiety or to seek certainty.Behavioural models focus on the idea that OCD is learnt through classical conditioning, where certain actions become reinforced through repetition. When a person experiences anxiety and then engages in a compulsive behaviour (such as washing hands), the behaviour temporarily reduces the anxiety, reinforcing the cycle and making it more likely to occur again in the future.Is a cure available?OCD is a manageable condition, and seeking professional support can greatly enhance symptom control, enabling individuals to live more fulfilling lives. Effective OCD management typically involves a blend of treatment strategies, including therapy, medication, and lifestyle adjustments.Therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), is highly effective for treating OCD. ERP involves gradually exposing oneself to feared thoughts or situations and learning to resist the urge to perform compulsive behaviours.

Medication:  Several of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)are FDA-approved and commonly prescribed at higher doses to help alleviate anxiety and OCD symptoms.Lifestyle changes: Regular exercise, adequate sleep and a healthy diet can support overall mental health and help manage symptoms.Mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques: “Practices like mindfulness meditation, yoga and deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can alleviate some OCD symptoms,” says Archana Singhal.Support groups: Connecting with others who have OCD can provide valuable support and understanding.Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Deep Brain Stimulation are both approved treatments for patients with OCD and have not responded to other treatments.Piyali Maity, clinical director of counselling operations, 1to1help, concludes, “It is important to create an environment where individuals with OCD feel understood, supported, and empowered to seek help and that can be achieved once there is enough awareness. It is also important to be conscious and understand how we use the term OCD. Equating it with just being ‘neat’ or ‘perfectionistic’ is problematic. It is a stereotype that needs to be challenged so that the casual misuse of the term can be avoided.”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 21, 2024

Recent statistics also reveal a clear shift in how Indians approach their travel plans. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/indians-are-chasing-luxury-travel-like-never-before-whats-driving-this-shift-2653015-2024-12-22,"Luxury, business class, and extravagant retreats are becoming increasingly popular among Indian travellers. Once known for their resourcefulness and practical approach to travel, Indians today prioritise travel like never before, and they’re doing it in style – with a taste for luxury. ""I am ready to shell out a few extra bucks, but when I travel, it has to be comfortable. Brownie points if I can find luxury with that extra money,"" says Muskan Agarwal, a 25-year-old student from Delhi NCR, while sharing why she prefers to travel in luxury. Such is the mindset not only of Muskan but also of many Indians who are shifting from being budget travellers to embracing the idea of luxury travel.What data tells us Luxury travel among Indian tourists is no longer a rare occurrence. In fact, recent statistics reveal a clear shift in how Indians are approaching their travel plans. India Today analysed several year-end reports by various travel agencies, and all indicate the same.  According to data from Skyscanner, an online travel agency, 37 per cent of Indian travellers plan to upgrade their flights to business or first class in 2024. Additionally, 44 per cent intend to purchase access to airport lounges to ensure their trips begin on a luxurious note. Another MakeMyTrip (an online travel agency) data shows the same. In fact, it shows a 50 per cent year-on-year increase in business class bookings, with international flights witnessing a whopping 80  per cent jump, while domestic flights saw a 27 per cent rise. 

 



Data also shows a similar rise. Photo: MakeMyTrip
It also shows that India’s contribution of domestic hotel bookings priced above INR 10,000 has increased to 22 per cent as compared to 20 per cent in the same period last year. This number is almost double for international hotel bookings (a jump of 57 per cent from 51 per cent). These figures paint a compelling picture. For a demographic once known for cost-cutting and resourcefulness, this surge in premium travel choices marks a significant change. It’s not just about getting from point A to point B anymore; it’s about doing so in style, comfort, and with a dash of indulgence.Experts also agreeLouis D’Souza, director at Tamarind Global, says, “Luxury travel among Indian travellers has seen an extraordinary rise and this trend shows no signs of slowing down in 2025.” D’Souza explains that today’s Indian traveller craves unique, bespoke experiences that go beyond traditional sightseeing. “From unwinding in a private villa on an exclusive island to a gastronomic adventure at Michelin-star restaurants in Tokyo, or indulging in bespoke art and fashion tours in Paris, the essence of luxury is shifting toward experiential and meaningful travel,” he adds.Prabhakar Kamat, business head at Red Dot Representations, echoes this sentiment, and says the trend seems to be growing even more strongly for next year.

Let’s break down these reasons one by one. Why Indians prefer luxurySeveral factors have converged to drive the rise in luxury travel among Indians, transforming it from a niche market to a mainstream aspiration. Here’s a closer look at what’s behind this change:
Rising disposable incomes: Experts suggest that economic growth in India has created a more affluent middle and upper class, enabling a larger section of the population to afford premium travel experiences. 
Change in priorities: Experts like D'Souza suggest that the younger generation has prioritised travel as an essential part of their lives being the key contributors (Not 70 hours work week). Rajesh Magow, the co-founder and group CEO of MMT, says, “The trend toward premiumisation is becoming increasingly pronounced, as travellers are willing to spend more for a memorable holiday.”
Exposure to global lifestyles: Thanks to the rise of social media and digital platforms, Indian travellers have a front-row seat to the luxury experiences enjoyed by people around the world. This exposure has cultivated a taste for indulgence and exclusivity.

Celebration tourism: Destination weddings, milestone anniversaries, and large family reunions are on the rise. Grand occasions now call for equally grand destinations, and luxury travel provides the perfect setting for such celebrations.
Post-pandemic priorities: Privacy, safety, and bespoke experiences have become crucial considerations for travellers. Exclusive itineraries and private accommodations naturally align with these needs, making luxury travel a more appealing option. Moreover, ever since the pandemic, there has been a change in the mindset of many people, with them prioritising experiences over anything else. This has led to the rise of a very specific type of travel known as 'revenge travel'. 
Desire for unique experiences: As D’Souza points out, modern travellers are seeking experiences that go beyond sightseeing. Private villas, Michelin-starred dining, and immersive art and fashion tours have become the new definition of luxury.

 It also shows that India’s contribution of domestic hotel bookings priced above INR 10,000 has increased to 22 per cent as compared to 20 per cent in the same period last year. This number is almost double for international hotel bookings (a jump of 57 per cent from 51 per cent).  These figures paint a compelling picture. For a demographic once known for cost-cutting and resourcefulness, this surge in premium travel choices marks a significant change. It’s not just about getting from point A to point B anymore; it’s about doing so in style, comfort, and with a dash of indulgence.Experts also agree Louis D’Souza, director at Tamarind Global, says, “Luxury travel among Indian travellers has seen an extraordinary rise and this trend shows no signs of slowing down in 2025.” D’Souza explains that today’s Indian traveller craves unique, bespoke experiences that go beyond traditional sightseeing.  “From unwinding in a private villa on an exclusive island to a gastronomic adventure at Michelin-star restaurants in Tokyo, or indulging in bespoke art and fashion tours in Paris, the essence of luxury is shifting toward experiential and meaningful travel,” he adds. Prabhakar Kamat, business head at Red Dot Representations, echoes this sentiment, and says the trend seems to be growing even more strongly for next year.

0f8587f3-b100-4bd9-863d-25648330d1d9,"Retirement depression is real and rising in India. How to manage itFor many people, retirement brings feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and worthlessness, which can potentially lead to clinical depression.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/retirement-depression-is-real-how-to-manage-prevent-it-2654219-2024-12-23,"When Ritika, a 29-year-old woman from Delhi, flew from Berlin to celebrate her father's retirement, everything seemed perfect. Her father, a travel enthusiast, already had several trips planned for the months ahead. However, a year and a half later, Ritika found herself packing her bags to return to Delhi. Her father, once so vibrant, had developed a bevy of health issues, including signs of depression. Retirement depression, often caused by the emotional challenges that accompany retirement, is a growing issue in India. People who once led dynamic lives filled with social interactions, daily routines, and a sense of purpose often struggle to adjust to the sudden and stark changes brought on by retirement. Retirement comes with a set of benefits but also some challenges. “Retirement, for many people, comes with feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and worthlessness, which can lead to clinical depression,” says Dr Aarti Anand, senior consultant – psychiatry, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi. Retirement depression refers to feelings of sadness, anxiety, or hopelessness experienced after retiring from active work life. “Certain signs to recognise retirement depression include exhaustion or lack of motivation, along with generalised anxiety and having a persistent low mood,” says Nishtha Jain, counselling psychologist at the online mental health platform Lissun. “It is often caused by a lack of routine, reduced social interactions, and the sudden loss of a professional identity or purpose. Financial instability, health issues, and feelings of loneliness further exacerbate this condition,” says Sumalatha Vasudeva, psychologist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru. “Instead of feeling free, relaxed, and fulfilled, many people feel depressed, aimless, and isolated. They may grieve the loss of their old life, feel stressed about how they are going to fill their days, or worry about the toll that being at home all day is taking on the relationships with family members,” explains Dr Anand.

 Retirement can take away the sense of purpose and self-worth, make you feel lost, and leave behind a void. Though there is no suggestive data, experts say there is an increase in retirement depression among Indians. ""Retirement depression has fairly become more recognised and more prevalent with Indian populations. This change has come because of the changes in societal dynamics and traditional support systems that were previously available for retirees,"" says Jain. The changing family structure is also behind the rise in post-retirement depression among the elderly. “Traditionally, joint families provided emotional and social support for retirees. However, with the rise of nuclear families and urban migration, many retirees experience isolation and a sense of purposelessness, making them more vulnerable to depression,” adds Sumalatha Vasudeva. Not having hobbies outside one’s career is also a major cause of retirement depression.

 This retirement depression can lead to severe consequences, such as:
Chronic physical health issues like hypertension and diabetes due to stress
Cognitive decline, as reduced mental engagement impacts memory and problem-solving skills
Social withdrawal, which may cause strained family relationships
Increased risk of substance abuse or self-harm in severe cases
How to prevent retirement depression Retirement depression, however, can be prevented as well as managed. Prevention, as they say, is the best cure. “The best way to prevent retirement depression is to have a thought-out action plan well before retiring. This action plan should include planning about finances, routines, hobbies, and investments after retirement,” says Jain.

 



As a retiree, leading an active, healthy lifestyle is important for overall well-being. (Photo: AI Generative)
 To prevent retirement depression from affecting your or your parents’ lives, try having a plan ready. Here are a few expert-approved tips:
Plan ahead: Financial and emotional preparation for retirement.
Establish a routine: Stay active with hobbies, volunteer work, or part-time employment.
Social connections: Maintain and expand social networks to reduce loneliness.
Physical activity: Engage in regular exercise to improve mood and overall health.
Learn new skills: Pick up new hobbies or courses to maintain mental stimulation and purpose.
 Meanwhile, having a good support system and staying well-connected with family and friends is also crucial.Managing retirement depression Seeking professional help to manage anxiety and depression is imperative. It will help you navigate the challenges you are facing after retirement. A psychologist or counsellor can provide therapy to address these challenges.

 



Retirement is a major life change that requires not only advanced financial planning but also a strategy to stay occupied and fulfilled. (Photo: Getty)
 Here are additional strategies recommended by mental health experts to help manage retirement depression:
Join support groups: Go out for walks, socialise, and join communities or groups for retirees to share experiences and combat loneliness.
Adopt healthy habits: Ensure you take balanced nutrition, exercise regularly, and practise mindfulness activities such as yoga or meditation.
Set goals: Establish small, achievable goals to foster a sense of accomplishment. It could be something simple like going for a short trip every two months or reading 10 pages a day.
Family support: Express your emotions. Open communication with family members will help you share feelings and seek emotional support.

 The Protein Diet Coke is rooted in the trend of ""dirty soda"", a soda enhanced with syrups, creamers, or other ingredients for added flair. This trend was popularised by shows like The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, dirty soda has become a cultural phenomenon, and this new twist is no exception. But should you be adding Diet Coke to your protein shake or visa versa? We asked the experts. What do experts have to say?  When it comes to the trending combination of protein shakes and Diet Coke, experts have shared their thoughts, and the consensus is not overly optimistic. Parmeet Kaur, HOD-dietician and nutritionist at Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram, highlights that while this mix might sound intriguing, it often leads to digestive discomfort. The carbonation in Diet Coke produces gas when combined with protein powder, and can result in bloating. Moreover, artificial sweeteners like aspartame present in Diet Coke are known to cause sensitivity in some individuals, including headaches or digestive upset.

 Dr Bhavna Garg, senior consultant, dietitian, and nutritionist at Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital Kaushambi, agrees. She adds that the combination does not enhance the nutritional value of protein shakes. She notes that while the frothy mix might appear appealing, the caffeine and carbonation in Diet Coke can disturb digestion and potentially lead to bloating or discomfort. Both experts stress the importance of prioritising balanced nutrition over trendy mixes that may not serve any significant health purpose.Can you add it to your diet? While mixing protein shakes with Diet Coke might not be outright harmful, it isn’t a choice most nutritionists would recommend. According to Dr Garg, incorporating this combination into your diet depends largely on individual tolerance, but it doesn’t offer any substantial health benefits. Parmeet Kaur emphasises that protein shakes are best blended with water, milk, or plant-based alternatives to support proper digestion and nutrient absorption. If you’re aiming to meet your daily protein requirements, it’s better to consume protein shakes on their own rather than experimenting with carbonated beverages. But again, if you don’t like the taste of protein shake alone, you can’t try this trend, if it doesn’t upset your stomach.  For a balanced and healthy diet, focus on nutrient-rich foods and beverages that provide energy and essential nutrients without compromising digestive health.What’s the deal with Diet Coke? There has been a surge in people’s obsession with Diet Coke,  a low-calorie and sugar-free beverage, might seem like a healthier alternative to sugary drinks. Parmeet Kaur points out that its primary and controversial sweetener, aspartame, is not inherently toxic but can cause digestive upset or headaches in some individuals. While calorie intake might decrease with Diet Coke, its artificial sweeteners could trigger cravings for sweet foods, potentially impacting gut health. Dr Garg adds that moderate consumption of Diet Coke is key.  Excessive intake of artificially sweetened beverages has been linked to metabolic changes, digestive discomfort, and increased cravings for sweets. For a truly healthier lifestyle, she recommends opting for water, herbal teas, or natural beverages. In small quantities, Diet Coke may not pose a significant health risk, but it’s essential to ensure it doesn’t replace nutrient-rich and hydrating options in your diet.The last sip  While the combination of protein shakes and Diet Coke may spark curiosity among those who follow trends, it lacks the nutritional benefits that a health-conscious individual should prioritise. Experts recommend sticking to tried-and-tested options like water, milk, or plant-based altern atives for your protein shakes to ensure proper digestion and nutrient absorption.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

While we often think of tanning as a direct result of sun exposure, emerging research suggests that internal factors like gut health may play a subtle role in how our skin reacts to the sun. So, can poor gut health actually cause increased tanning?Gut health and skin: The connection Our gut does much more than just digesting food. It’s home to trillions of microorganisms that make up our gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem essential for overall health. A well-balanced gut microbiome regulates inflammation, supports the immune system, and even influences skin health. When this balance is disrupted—a state known as dysbiosis—it can lead to problems like inflammation and oxidative stress. Inflammation and oxidative stress are known to impact melanin production, the pigment responsible for the colour of our skin, hair, and eyes. They can affect how the skin reacts to UV rays from the sun, potentially leading to uneven pigmentation or an increased likelihood of damage.

Does poor gut health lead to more tanning?Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant and aesthetic physician, Gleneagles Hospital Bengaluru, says, “Emerging research suggests that gut health and skin health are interconnected. Poor gut health can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress, which may exacerbate pigmentation disorders or uneven tanning. A balanced gut microbiome supports overall skin health.”

 



A study has found a causal association between the gut microbiome and ease of skin tanning. (Photo: Getty Images)
However, she adds, that a compromised gut may impair the absorption of essential nutrients like antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that protect our skin from sun damage. This could make the skin more prone to UV-related changes, though not necessarily increased tanning.

This could make the skin more prone to UV-related changes, though not necessarily increased tanning. A study has found a causal association between the gut microbiome and ease of skin tanning. The gut-skin connection is the term used to describe the link between the digestive system and skin health.What Ayurveda says about gut health and tanning In Ayurveda, Vata Prakruti (individuals with a predominant air and space element) naturally have qualities like dryness, lightness, and irregularity in their body functions. This makes their metabolism unpredictable, leading to potential depletion of Rasa Dhatu (plasma or nutritive fluid), which is responsible for nourishing and hydrating the body tissues, including the skin. Dr Milind Salunke, wellness director at Swastik Wellbeing Sanctuary says, “When Rasa Dhatu is not adequately replenished due to Vata's drying nature, it results in dry, rough skin. Additionally, Vata's tendency to disturb digestive processes can cause constipation, as the body struggles to maintain proper moisture and smooth functioning in the digestive tract. This imbalance contributes to skin dryness and makes tanning more likely in Vata Prakruti individuals.What should be done Dr Aparna Santhanam, dermatologist and skin expert at ITC Dermafique, says, “Individuals with higher skin prototypes (a person's skin type in terms of response to ultraviolet radiations), greater eumelanin production, and genetic predisposition will tan more than others. While tanning may be perceived as protective, it is still a sign of UV-induced damage, and sun protection measures are essential for everyone to reduce the risk of photodamage and skin cancers. Experts suggest following these steps:
Use sun protection: Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30+ and wear protective clothing.
Limit sun exposure: Avoid peak UV hours, usually between 10 AM and 4 PM.
Maintain gut health: Eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, probiotics, and hydration to promote healthy skin.
Consult a professional: Seek advice from a dermatologist or aesthetic consultant for personalised treatments such as chemical peels or laser therapy to address pigmentation concerns.
 While poor gut health doesn’t directly cause increased tanning, it can influence your skin’s response to sun exposure by affecting factors like inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutrient availability. Conversely, tanning and sun exposure can also impact your gut microbiota, showing just how interconnected our internal and external health truly are.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

 But if you don’t want to invest Rs 30,000-40,000 in a device or deal with the hassle of using it yourself, you can opt for facials offered at salons. These microcurrent facials are gaining popularity in India, with various salons offering them at prices ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000. But how and when did microcurrent facials become so popular? Should you get one? What do experts have to say about these facials? Here’s a quick guide. Let’s start from the beginning.From the treatment of facial paralysis to celeb favourite Microcurrent facials may sound like a futuristic beauty trend, but their roots trace back to an old medical practice. Initially developed in the 1980s as a treatment for facial paralysis, microcurrent technology was later adopted by the beauty industry when its aesthetic benefits became apparent. Talk about a glow-up!  Today, these facials are promoted as a way to tone facial muscles and improve skin’s overall appearance, offering a non-invasive alternative to more aggressive anti-aging procedures (read: botox).  In recent years, microcurrent facials have skyrocketed in popularity, largely thanks to celebrity endorsements and social media buzz.

 According to Dr Sonali Kohli, consultant dermatologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, “In recent years, microcurrent facial treatments have gained significant popularity amongst skincare enthusiasts and celebrities alike, promising a non-invasive 'natural facelift' effect.” This trend further expanded with the advent of at-home microcurrent devices, like the viral microcurrent wand, used by all celebrities. 'It's like a gym workout for your face' Microcurrent facials rely on low-level electrical currents, typically between 100 and 400 microamps, to stimulate facial muscles and skin cells. “It’s like a gym workout for your face,” says Dr Aparna Santhanam, a Mumbai-based dermatologist. The primary mechanism is boosting ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production, which is crucial for cellular energy. This uptick in ATP triggers several benefits, according to Dr Santhanam. 
Enhanced muscle tone and facial contours
Stimulated collagen and elastin production
Improved circulation and lymphatic drainage
Accelerated cellular repair
 Now, this leads to various ‘potential benefits’, according to Dr Kohli, like: Immediate effects
Lifted and firmer facial features
Reduced puffiness
Enhanced skin radiance
Long-term benefits
Gradual improvement in muscle tone
Better skin texture and firmness
Delay in the appearance of fine lines
Improved absorption of skincare products
 Dr Sidharth Sonthalia, dermatologist at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Gurugram, adds, “Microcurrent facials help by stimulating the tone of facial muscles and promoting production of collagen and elastin proteins in deeper layers. Additionally, the device boosts blood circulation and enhances penetration of skincare products. The overall impact includes improved skin tone, reduction in fine lines, and a lifted or sculpted youthful appearance.”Is it worth the hype? India Today spoke to various experts, and even though experts agreed there can be some benefits that we have mentioned above, they are short-lived.  For instance, Dr Santhanam says, “Microcurrent facials are not a gimmick, but their efficacy depends on realistic expectations and proper technique.” She mentions that it works well as a preventative or maintenance tool for light wrinkles. Dr Saurabh Shah, senior clinical and cosmetic dermatologist and dermatosurgeon, however, doesn’t agree. He says that although quite sought after, these facials are not an absolutely established and reliable treatment to address skin aging.

 “It's effects are uncertain, inconsistent, unreliable, and, most importantly, short-lived compared to its other counterparts like - RF (Radiofrequency) and HIFU (High intensity focused ultrasound), which are more consistent and definitive modes of treatments,” Dr Shah adds.  Dr Shah, however, says that microcurrent facials offer to be a relatively cheaper, safer and non-invasive option.At-home vs professional treatments Dr Santhanam highlights key differences:
Professional treatments: Use medical-grade devices for deeper penetration and visible results.
At-home devices: Great for maintenance but less effective due to lower intensity.
 Dr Sonthalia adds, “At-home devices can complement professional treatments, offering maintenance between sessions. However, professional facials use advanced equipment with precise settings tailored to individual needs, often delivering superior results compared to consumer-grade devices.” Now, if you’re going for professional treatment, experts suggest getting these facials in three phases: 
Initial phase: 1-2 sessions per week for 6-8 weeks.
Maintenance phase: Once every 4-6 weeks to maintain results.
Combination therapy: Pair with RF skin tightening or hydrafacials for enhanced outcomes.
 According to Dr Sonthalia, “Initially, 6-12 sessions spaced weekly or bi-weekly, conducted by a dermatologist, are recommended for optimal results. Once the desired result is achieved, maintenance sessions can be done every 4–6 weeks, at a clinic or home, depending on individual skin goals and aging concerns.”Side effects While generally safe, microcurrent facials aren’t entirely risk-free. Some potential side effects include:
Mild redness or irritation: Usually temporary and resolves quickly.
Metallic taste: Rare and fleeting, caused by electrical stimulation.
Contraindications: Not suitable for individuals with pacemakers, epilepsy, or certain skin conditions.
 Dr Kohli mentions, “The key to success lies in understanding that this is not a quick fix but rather a long-term investment in skin health and facial muscle tone.” advertisementThe last session Microcurrent facials are the perfect blend of science and skincare, offering a gentle, non-invasive route to a snatched, youthful visage, but their effects are short-lived like any other facials.

 Microcurrent facials are the perfect blend of science and skincare, offering a gentle, non-invasive route to a snatched, youthful visage, but their effects are short-lived like any other facials.

Don’t want to spend a fortune on an assemblage of heavy bridal outfits? You can rent them! Worried about storing a bulky lehenga after the wedding, knowing you’ll rarely wear it again? Renting is the answer! Always wanted to become a Sabyasachi bride but the budget doesn’t allow it? Check out a reputed rental store, and you can get it from there at a fraction of the price. From designer replicas to authentic couture creations, you can rent the bridal outfit of your dreams with the convenience of free delivery and pick-up—especially if you’re in a tier-1 city. There are physical stores and online portals providing wedding rental services all across the country. Players like Flyrobe, Rent a Closet, and Kuro India, along with a plethora of physical rental stores, have given ‘renting’ an acceptance facelift and made it easily accessible. “The wedding clothing rental market in India is growing rapidly, thanks to evolving mindsets and a greater emphasis on sustainability. Brides are increasingly open to renting their wedding outfits, recognising the practicality of wearing exquisite designer lehengas at a fraction of the purchase cost,” Aanchal Saini, CEO of Flyrobe, tells India Today.

Experts say India is adapting well to the wedding rental trend, especially among millennials and Gen Z, who are more open to alternative ownership models. The shift is further normalised by the influence of social media and influencers.While Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru have been early adopters of the rental trend, Jaipur, Ludhiana, and Hyderabad are also quickly catching up. Experts say India is adapting well to the wedding rental trend, especially among millennials and Gen Z, who are more open to alternative ownership models. The shift is further normalised by the influence of social media and influencers. While Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru have been early adopters of the rental trend, Jaipur, Ludhiana, and Hyderabad are also quickly catching up. “Interestingly, smaller cities like Raipur have shown an exceptionally positive response. These cities combine a strong appetite for lavish weddings with a growing awareness of sustainable and cost-effective options, making them ideal markets for rentals,” shares Saini. Celebrity weddings also have a role to play, inspiring many couples to take their celebrations to picturesque locations like Udaipur, Goa, and Kerala. These cities also see high demand for rentals. “Renting allows couples to recreate similar grandeur (at destination weddings) while maintaining financial and environmental sustainability,” says Saini. Celebrity fashion stylist and costume designer Divyak D’Souza thinks of renting as an excellent money-saving option. “Couture, particularly bridal couture, is notoriously expensive, so opting to rent instead of purchase can significantly cut costs. Beyond the financial savings, renting can be seen as a sustainable choice, especially for garments typically worn only once. It also eliminates the need for long-term maintenance, storage, and regular dry cleaning that comes with owning such attire,” Divyak D’Souza tells India Today.

What's stop Indian brides Practical, sustainable, and hassle-free, renting a wedding lehenga seems perfect in theory. Yet, it remains far from becoming a mainstream choice among Indian brides. For instance, when Bhavya Arora, a Delhi-based marketing professional, suggested renting a designer lehenga for her wedding celebrations, she was met with raised eyebrows from both her family and in-laws. The recent years have witnessed a rise in pre-loved luxury fashion in India, yet renting is still looked down upon by many—especially when it is for a sacred event like a wedding.

 Daisy (name changed on request), on the other hand, found it challenging to come across good designs. Additionally, no scope for personalisation—a huge wedding fashion trend—was another turn-off for her. Delhi-based journalist Tiasa, however, could not find any decent options in her hometown, Siliguri. The hassle of carrying a rented lehenga from Delhi to her hometown and then eventually returning it within a limited time period meant significant logistical challenges. “Somewhere along the line, the thought of people talking behind my back about my decision to rent instead of buy also crossed my mind. People my age and those who are digitally literate might understand, but elders often don’t,” she says. An Indian bride’s wedding outfit carries not only the weight of craftsmanship but also deep emotions. The ‘suhaag ka joda’ holds immense emotional significance, another reason why brides refrain from renting the wedding lehenga. “For our brides, spending on wedding clothes is an investment of their feelings and emotions, like the wedding itself. There is no way a bride is going to compromise on the vision she has for herself. What a bride wears on her wedding day is extremely important and is of high sentimental value to the bride,” says Nisha Kundnani of Bridelan, a luxury wedding stylist and personal shopper. “Just until five years ago, not even 1 per cent of the customers of Indian designers would spend on a 10 or 15 lakh lehenga. That range is now an average and very well-accepted range of Indian designers. The average spend on a wedding lehenga has also become this high because of the desirability and aspirational value, simply because the demand is so high that it is also creating counter parallels such as rentals and other ways of acquisition,” explains Nisha Kundnani, who closely works with Indian brides all over the world to curate their wedding looks.advertisementRenting - A popular choice among wedding guestsCurrently, outfit rentals are a big hit among wedding guests, including bridesmaids, the groom's sisters, and the bride's mother. For many, buying a new outfit or getting one stitched for every family or friend’s wedding is not feasible. Those with a strong penchant for fashion often rush to designer rental stores to find outfits that make them look stunning without burning a hole in their pockets. Additionally, novelty is also maintained in the Instagram grids—for those who still detest repeating outfits.“Renting wedding outfits doesn't yet appear to be a major choice among brides and grooms, especially in India, where weddings are deeply emotional and culturally significant events. However, rental fashion is gaining traction among wedding guests and family members who may attend multiple events and prefer a cost-effective and practical wardrobe solution,” says Divyak.advertisementPioneers in the rental business believe it will take time for brides to embrace outfit rentals for their big day.“Think of international travel—it used to be a big deal a decade ago, and now it’s just another getaway.

We love everything extra. From the way we travel to what we eat, there’s an extra layer of luxury and novelty that we have started enjoying, and the viral kunafa chocolates straight from Dubai speak to our penchant for all things luxe. Kunafa chocolates, inspired by the beloved Middle Eastern dessert, have become the unexpected culinary star of 2024. Combining the gooey richness of pistachio praline with the crisp texture of kataifi pastry, these indulgent treats have captivated taste buds and Instagram feeds worldwide.

 What started as a niche product in Dubai has transformed into a global phenomenon, with international brands jumping on the bandwagon and crafting their own versions.The curious journey of kunafa chocolates While kunafa is a traditional dessert of the Middle East, its journey in the form of chocolate began in Dubai, where a luxury chocolate brand combined the textures of crispy kunafa and creamy fillings to create something entirely new. In 2021, Sarah Hamouda founded Fix Dessert Chocolatier, offering a selection of chocolate treats and pastries that instantly struck a chord with buyers. Today, it has become what you could call a global phenomenon. While her brand boasts numerous flavours, like Fudge Brownies with Crunchy Cereal, Crunchy Lotus Cheesecake, and many more, it is the kunafa chocolate bar that has gained popularity across dimensions.

The contrast between the crunchy kunafa strands and the creamy pistachio filling added with a bite of chocolate created a texture and flavour combination that quickly became irresistible to food enthusiasts and influencers alike. The contrast between the crunchy kunafa strands and the creamy pistachio filling added with a bite of chocolate created a texture and flavour combination that quickly became irresistible to food enthusiasts and influencers alike. Social media played a pivotal role in amplifying the buzz. Food bloggers and dessert lovers from around the world were drawn to their novelty, fuelling demand far beyond Dubai’s borders. According to Vikas Temani, founder of Paul and Mike Chocolates, the visual storytelling on social media was key. “People couldn’t resist sharing videos of them enjoying a concoction of product that looked as good as it tasted.”

 Chef Varun Inamdar agrees. “The speed and scale at which it exploded on social media were surprising. It’s a testament to how powerful visual storytelling and digital platforms are in shaping food trends today: good, bad, ugly all debatable in the same breath.” But, there was a catch. While the chocolate drew a lot of attention worldwide, getting your hands on one was a challenge. Initially, Fix Dessert Chocolatier was available only in Dubai, with limited slots to place an order. People with access to Dubai purchased the chocolates themselves or relied on relatives or friends visiting the Middle Eastern city to bring them back. Yet, the demand surpassed the supply. That’s when people came up with the idea of creating their own versions of the viral chocolate, eager to taste or replicate something close to the original bar. That’s how quickly it caught on - so much so that many saw it as a brilliant business opportunity and have been milking the trend brilliantly.

Global reinterpretations and brand innovations A post shared by @nehadeepakshah

 It is very rare that Lindt, a royalty in the world of chocolate making, would want to replicate or go out of the way from traditional chocolate making to just milk a trend. But they did, most probably because they saw potential. A spokesperson of Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprungli tells India Today, “Our Lindt Maitre Chocolatiers always keep a close eye on current trends and accordingly became aware of the Dubai chocolate recipe trend on social media. The Lindt Maitres Chocolatiers then picked up on this taste trend and developed their own recipe.”

 



Lindt launched its Dubai chocolates last month. (Photo: Facebook)
 Lindt launched its limited-edition Dubai-inspired pistachio chocolate bar on November 9, 2024. The chocolate bar was released in select shops in Germany, with only 1,000 bars available. The launch was treated like a luxury product launch, with numbered tickets, taste-testing samples, and limited access. Regarding Lindt’s this strategic move, Vikas Temani says, “Lindt, and other brands, are likely doing this to expand into non-traditional markets. Europe, the US, Japan, and Australia have been strongholds for premium chocolates, but they’re now looking to tap into markets like India, where there’s a rich dessert culture. By reinterpreting global desserts into chocolate form, they’re making their products more relatable and accessible to these new audiences. We’ll likely see more of this trend in the future.” In India, Temani’s Paul and Mike has taken the onus of introducing all Indians to the taste of this viral Turkish dessert. “We are trying to ensure it’s a high-quality product with properly roasted pistachios and a great balance of flavours. The combination of a crispy, crunchy texture with melting chocolate creates an unforgettable mouthfeel that people crave after just one bite. That addictive experience definitely plays a part in the trend’s popularity. Also, the social media frenzy creates a sense of FOMO, which only drives the demand further,” says Temani.

 And then, there are other Indian craft chocolatiers who are reinterpreting this dessert with an Indian twist, Chitram Craft Chocolates being one of them. For Dr Arun Viswanathan of Chitram Craft Chocolates, kunafa is reminiscent of an Indian dessert, and he is working on a localised version called “Dubai Return Chocolate,” which will include South Indian textures and Middle Eastern flavours too. “We’re reinterpreting kunafa with a base made of nool peni, a traditional vermicelli dessert, and incorporating saffron and rose for a unique Indian identity,” Viswanathan shares. They might launch their ""Dubai Return Chocolate"" sometime in January. Ashmeet Singh Dua, founder of Xocolatl in Hyderabad, recalls how he was inspired by the growing popularity of kunafa in India. “Kunafa had already become a hit here, almost rivalling traditional favourites like khubani ka meetha,” Dua shares. Recognising an opportunity, he crafted a version of kunafa chocolate that incorporated pistachio paste and kataifi pastry sourced directly from abroad. “When we launched in September, our social media reel went viral,” Dua explains. “The combination of textures was unlike anything people had tasted before. Bloggers shared it, and we were flooded with inquiries. That’s when we knew we had a winner.”

 He mentions that since its launch in September, Xocolatl has sold several thousand kunafa chocolate bars. Smoor, a Bengaluru-based chocolate brand, is also set to launch its chocolate bar inspired by the viral dessert during Valentine’s Day.The future The success of this Middle Eastern-inspired treat has opened doors for more cross-cultural dessert innovations but Chef Varun Inamdar, is somewhat skeptical about the trend’s longevity. “It’s the Dalgona coffee of 2024,” he quips. “While it’s visually stunning and delicious, I don’t see it becoming a permanent fixture in the culinary world.” However, Vikas Temani predicts, “While it might not stay at its current high, it will still find takers in the long run. People may not have it frequently, but they’ll seek it out occasionally. This isn’t just a flash-in-the-pan trend; it’s becoming a category of its own. Look at brands like Lindt—they’ve started investing heavily in this space. That kind of commitment shows they see potential in this trend for the long term.”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 28, 2024

Instead, it’s an accurate description of the latest talking point in the Indian alco-beverage industry: non-alcoholic spirits. Also known as zero-proof spirits, non-alcoholic alcohol is crafted to replicate the taste of traditional spirits but without the alcohol. These zero-proof drinks are not like your other non-alcoholic beverages such as ginger ale, soda, or mocktails. “Unlike mixers or soft drinks like ginger ale or soda, they are made using advanced techniques like distillation, infusion of botanicals, and careful layering of flavours to offer a sophisticated drinking experience,” Ruchi Nagrecha of non-alcoholic cocktail brand Sobriety Sips tells India Today.The growing trend of non-alcoholic spirits Non-alcoholic beers have been around for a long time, with several offerings from Indian brands as well. However, the trend has now expanded to include non-alcoholic gins, vodkas, rums, and cocktails. Several homegrown brands like Sober, Sobriety Sips, and Catwalk Botanics are at the forefront of this new trend in India. These drinks not only taste like traditional spirits but are also super-low on calories and, of course, don’t come with the notorious health side-effects and hangovers that alcohol is associated with.Gen Z and the 'sober curious' movement At the core of this trend is the rise of wellness-oriented thinking and the subsequent shift towards mindful drinking. Gen Z’s ‘sober curious’ movement—a trend encouraging people to explore their relationship with alcohol and reduce or avoid it—has also created space for zero-proof spirits.

 



Non-alcoholic gin and pink gin by Sober.
 According to Statista, Gen Z is significantly spending less on alcoholic beverages than previous generations. While Boomers, Gen X, and Millennials spent between USD 23 to USD 25 billion on alcohol in 2022, Gen Z’s spending amounted to just USD 3 billion.Filling in a lot of blanks Non-alcoholic spirits are emerging as a niche product category that can fill many gaps. For example, many bars and restaurants often neglect to make their mocktail menus exciting, limiting them to sugary mojitos, juices, blue lagoons, or lemon sodas. Zero-proof cocktails, however, provide non-drinkers with more interesting options. Popular hangout spots like The Pit and Monkey Bar in Delhi now have zero-proof cocktails on their menu. “This is a relatively new trend in India, gaining momentum over the past few years as post-Covid health consciousness and wellness trends have grown. Globally, the zero-proof movement started earlier, and now Indian consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, are embracing it. Factors such as health awareness, the need for inclusivity in social settings, and a cultural shift towards mindful alcohol consumption are driving the rise of non-alcoholic cocktails,” says Ruchi Nagrecha. For Ishan Arora, founder of Catwalk Botanics, launched in 2024, his brand was a result of seeking sobriety for himself.

 



Zero-proof spirit offerings by Catwalk Botanics.
 “Our customers are not chasing a high. They are already convinced that they want to quit, want to cut down,” Arora tells India Today. He further believes that these non-alcoholic spirits and even Gen Z’s sober curious movement come from a place of wellness and self-care. “Gen Zs are a generation who have grown up in alcohol-friendly families. According to the people of this age I have spoken to, they don’t want to replicate what happens thereafter (alcohol consumption),” he says. For Vansh Pahuja, founder of Sober, it was these small gaps that inspired him to introduce Sober—a house of non-alcoholic spirits. “It was a series of events in my life. After Covid, my father was advised to quit drinking, but he missed his regular ritual of coming home from work and sipping whisky while watching television. He didn’t want to replace it with coffee or lemon water, and there weren’t many alternatives. Similarly, when a close friend got pregnant, I realised she wouldn’t be drinking alcohol for a while, and I saw a huge potential market,” Vansh Pahuja tells us. He says his target market isn’t teetotalers but people who drink and are looking to reduce their alcohol consumption—such as those who are driving, parenting, observing religious practices, drinking moderately, or focused on fitness. Each brand has its recommended ways of consuming these non-alcoholic spirits, depending on the product. Mixing them with tonic water is one of the most common methods. Alternatively, zero-proof cocktails are also available, which don’t require adding mixers in specific quantities to enjoy these drinks. They are available in cans as well as bottles. Some brands, like Catwalk Botanics, are already on quick e-commerce platforms like BlinkIt.advertisementPricing and consumer curiosityThe pricing varies by brand, but a 750ml bottle of a non-alcoholic spirit typically costs around Rs 1,200. Industry insiders acknowledge that selling alcohol-free spirits at prices comparable to entry-level alcoholic beverages is not the easiest job, but there is curiosity among consumers. As a result, several brands have introduced cans and are planning to launch miniatures.These brands typically have their own online presence and sales platforms along with e-commerce platform tie-ups, but they also collaborate at events and pop-ups to boost awareness.“Our primary business comes from events, weddings, corporate parties, and pop-ups, which contribute about 70% of our sales,” shares Nagrecha.

As the name suggests, they promise to give your hair gorgeous curls—whether beachy, wavy, or highly defined—without the need for heat or harmful chemicals like hair-setting sprays. But which method is the best? And which one should you choose to achieve well-defined curls that last all day without relying on setting spray? TWe tried them out, tested them out, and documented the entire process. Before diving into the journey, here are a few things to know:
No heat was used in any of the techniques.
Almost all (except one) were overnight heatless curling methods. We recorded the process in three stages: while setting the curls, the next morning, and then again 8–9 hours later after going about our day.
This helped us assess how well the curls held up over time and determine which method offered the longest-lasting results.
We have fast-forwarded all the time-consuming bits. 
Day 1: Braiding  For the first day, we chose the simplest and most time-tested technique, (the OG) braiding. Process:
After dampening your hair, braid it as tightly as possible. Leave the braids in overnight and open them the next morning to reveal the results. Have a look at the video to see the results, and the rest of the process:
 
 Our final thoughts:
Braids work best if you don’t have a layered haircut.
While they don’t give you defined curls, the waves last almost the entire day without needing any setting spray.
Ideal for a casual, beachy, wavy look but not for high-end, well-defined curls (especially if you have a lot of layers).
Day 2: Heatless curler headband This technique has been at the centre of the heatless curls trend, dominating social media. The heatless curler headband is one of the easiest and most accessible tools, available on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. Process:
Place the headband on your head and secure it with a pin.
Damp your hair and divide it into two sections.
Braid each section tightly around the headband and secure the ends with a hairband (or else you will have to do some sections again, like us).
Leave it overnight.
 Here’s how it went:
 
 Our final thoughts:
Surprisingly easy to use, even if it looks complicated at first.
Creates neat, wavy curls with good volume.
Results last longer with a hair setting spray.
Comfortable to sleep in despite appearances.

Day 3: Foam rolling curlers Foam rolling curlers are one of the most affordable and popular options, especially among Indian influencers. Process:
Damp your hair and divide it into as many sections as possible.
Roll each section around a foam curler and bend it to lock.
Make sure you roll all your hair 
Leave it in overnight.

 Our final thoughts:

Slightly uncomfortable to sleep in.
Delivers highly defined curls that last a long time, even without heat or spray.

Process:
Start with freshly washed, damp hair.
Take small sections, roll each up with a velcro roller, and secure it with a pin.
Keep the rollers in for at least 3-4 hours.
Here’s how it went:
 
Our final thoughts:
Adds some volume but doesn’t create strong curls.
The longer you keep the rollers in, the better the volume and curl definition.
Takes some time to put it on. 
Day 5: The sock curlThis viral technique uses socks to curl hair. With so many variations online, we tried the most popular method.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/why-is-it-a-good-idea-to-skip-the-mountains-this-new-years-2657548-2024-12-31,"How do you plan to welcome the new year when the clock strikes midnight on December 31? Will you escape to the mountains to toast to New Year with a spectacular view, or perhaps enjoy a cosy evening at home or in a chic café? (And yes, spending it solo is absolutely fine too!)  But if you’re one of those adventurous ones who is planning a getaway to mark the start of 2024 and have destinations like Manali, Mussoorie, or Jammu on your mind, and live your ‘Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani’ moment, it’s worth taking a moment to rethink your plans. ‘We were stuck for 24 hours’ Payal Porwal, a 25-year-old engineer, from Delhi NCR, planned to spend a quiet week in Manali before the New Year to avoid the notorious ‘New Year rush’. However, her carefully-laid plans went awry when she found herself stuck for 24 hours during a visit to one of Manali’s iconic hotspots, Solang Valley. “We thought we’d visit Solang for just 2–3 hours and then head back, but we ended up getting stuck in the same spot,” Payal shared with India Today. While stranded, Payal considered herself fortunate to find a kind local family who offered help and allowed her group to use their washroom. “It was a relief,” she recalls. However, things took a turn for the worse when, two hours later, the traffic started to move, but chaos ensued as impatient drivers began overtaking each other in a bid to get ahead. “This caused yet another traffic jam, and we were stuck in the same area for the entire night,” she adds. Eventually, Payal and her friends decided to book a hotel in Solang Valley after the police advised against continuing their journey. The icy roads had become treacherous, with several cars stuck and unable to move further.

 



An automobile is stuck in the mountains.
 Payal’s story is far from an isolated incident. Recently, a viral video by a travel vlogger, @chluckytyagi, stuck in the snowstorm of Manali sparked widespread concern. The clip, shot in the picturesque Solang Valley, shows a grim reality: over 1,500 vehicles trapped in the snow, including the Himachal SDM’s official car, according to him.

 “People planning to visit Solang Valley, please reconsider. Over 1,500 vehicles are stuck due to heavy snow. It’s chaos here—please don’t come,” the vlogger warned, pointing to an endless line of immobilised vehicles.Stranded in the snow Payal was one of the nearly 10,000 tourists stranded in Solang Valley last Friday (December 27), when a severe snowstorm paralysed the area. Around 2,000 vehicles were trapped, with only 100 cars able to leave as many drivers were missing from the scene. The event made headlines, painting a chilling picture of the chaos.  Such harsh weather conditions often lead to tragic accidents, particularly in popular hill stations, where roads become treacherous with snow and ice.

History repeating itself India’s love for New Year getaways is a growing trend, but it’s not without its pitfalls. Last year, Himachal Pradesh witnessed massive traffic jams during the festive season, with over 55,000 tourists stranded across various regions. This year seems poised to follow the same script, perhaps even on a larger scale, with travel on the rise.Skidding and slipping The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued warnings of extreme cold and dense fog across North-West and Central India, including Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu & Kashmir. With conditions worsening by the day, foggy highways and snow-laden hill stations have already seen an uptick in accidents. Social media is flooded with videos showing vehicles skidding dangerously on icy roads. In one particularly alarming clip, even a 4x4 (passenger car) nearly succumbed to the slippery conditions.

 Meanwhile, Uttarakhand faces additional challenges, with an orange alert for avalanches recently issued by the Defence Geoinformatics Research Establishment (DGRE), a DRDO laboratory. Heavy snowfall has also blanketed high-altitude regions like Chamoli, Badrinath, Hemkund Sahib, Auli, and Gorson, with similar reports coming from Jammu. Such conditions often accelerate the chances of accidents. High prices in frosty paradise Another challenge for winter travellers is the steep rise in accommodation prices. As New Year approaches, hotel rates skyrocket, and options become limited as most major properties get fully booked. This situation worsens if you’re planning an impromptu getaway during the New Year.Tips to avoid the New Year rush in the Indian mountains Now, if you’re still planning to travel this New Year, here are some tips, shared by Panki Sood, who operates eco-friendly boutiques in from Manali: 
Remember to park ethically, as not following this might cause traffic jams. 
Avoid overcrowded places if you’re going with kids and older people. 
Stay with your own group, and not interact with other groups, as it might create a ‘nuisance’. 
Expect steep hikes in hotel rates and transportation costs during the New Year period. To avoid exorbitant charges, book your stays months in advance or opt for budget-friendly alternatives like homestays or guesthouses.
Always pack snacks and keep ready-to-eat foods in your vehicle while travelling. 
Panki also reminds us not to litter while travelling! 
 Finally, if possible, avoid the dream of spending the New Year’s in the mountains. Go ahead a day or a day later. The mountains are not calling this New Year!Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Trending Reel

Living Apart Together (LAT), a growing trend among committed and married couples in the West, refers to couples intentionally avoiding cohabitation in order to keep the spark alive. No more fights over putting the toilet seat down, leaving the towel on the bed, adjusting the AC temperature, or dealing with mismatched sleeping patterns! It’s about two individuals leading their own lives, chasing their goals, and focusing on themselves while remaining committed to each other. The decision to live in separate homes, despite being married, is not solely driven by these daily issues. Sometimes, the reasons are broader. It may stem from the need to maintain individuality or a strong belief in the importance of personal space - an idea mentioned by Lebanese-American writer Kahlil Gibran in his poem On Marriage: “But let there be spaces in your togetherness,
And let the winds of the heavens dance
between you.” In LAT couples, physical distance is a reality, but they remain romantically and emotionally committed to each other. But is that even possible? According to relationship experts and LAT couples themselves, the answer is a resounding yes. LAT certainly challenges the traditional norm which dictates that couples need to live together, but for some, it is a saviour of their bond.

 



Couples choose to live apart for a variety of reasons. Some value their solitude and personal space, finding that maintaining independence enhances their overall happiness. (Photo: Getty)
Such couples can live in the same building, the same housing society, or even in different cities—it just isn’t the same home. They mutually agree on this arrangement while keeping their time together flexible, such as setting specific days or weekends to meet at one partner’s place, go on outings, or take vacations. Unlike in a separation, these couples maintain intentional communication and stay committed.Why LAT works for some couples“This trend allows couples to maintain their bond while avoiding the conflicts that often arise from cohabitation. It can be genuinely helpful for a few people who want to preserve their individuality, reducing daily conflicts and keeping the romance alive,” says Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship expert.Couples choose to live apart for a variety of reasons. Some value their solitude and personal space, finding that maintaining independence enhances their overall happiness. For many, living apart allows them to strengthen their bond by reducing daily pressures.“Modern couples who value personal space, independence, and privacy benefit from this arrangement. It allows each person to maintain their own lifestyle while preserving their individuality,” adds Dr Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based psychologist and marriage counsellor.The idea that distance can make a heart grow fonder is a key reason why LAT works for some couples.advertisement“Being apart can help couples appreciate each other more, deepening their connection. They may realise the importance of their partner more acutely and feel a strong desire to meet and spend time together, making those moments even more special,” explains Dr Khanna.So, there is a mix of both ‘me time’ and ‘couple time’. The couple can enjoy personal space and pursue individual interests while also looking forward to spending quality time together. This way, LAT couples stay refreshed and feel eager to connect as well.

The regular bickering over daily household work and chores also takes a backseat and doesn’t hamper the relationship. It is among the major pros of Living Apart Together.“One significant advantage is that when partners don’t share a living space, the need for constant adjustments and negotiations about responsibilities, chores, or the division of labour is minimised. This reduces potential sources of conflict and relationship-related frustration. Without these daily pressures, the couple can focus on maintaining harmony and avoid unnecessary disputes,” says Dr Khanna, a marriage counsellor with over 22 years of experience.advertisementReduced daily conflicts, increased quality time, and a better work-life balance can help prevent some marriages or relationships from deteriorating. However, it is not a universal solution.Living Apart Together works well for certain types of couples, although it may not suit everyone. The suitability of an LAT arrangement largely depends on the personalities and specific needs of the individuals involved.“It suits couples who love each other but struggle with shared living dynamics,” says Ruchi Ruuh.Additionally, LAT is also beneficial for:
Couples who have jobs in different cities or demanding schedules
Couples with drastically different routines or lifestyle preferences
Couples who want to care for ageing parents or maintain the life they lived prior to marriage
People who want to avoid overstimulation due to mental health issues
Living apart together can be extremely trickyLiving Apart Together is not without its set of cons, though. Firstly, it is only relevant for the affluent. Running two households is expensive. Secondly, it can be tricky to maintain, especially when the individuals are not on the same page.advertisement“Prolonged physical separation can lead to emotional distancing too. These sporadic interactions can really affect the intimacy as a couple,” says Ruchi.“The lack of regular face-to-face interactions can result in feelings of disconnection or emotional detachment. This is especially true if one partner is introverted or relies heavily on the other for emotional support,” adds Dr Khanna.It can intensify feelings of loneliness or isolation, particularly if the individual is in an unfamiliar location without a strong social circle. Experts also say that being apart makes providing support in times of crises harder, as they might find it difficult to understand each other’s communication nuances.So, a healthy balance to maintain proximity is important as it helps keep intimacy alive and strengthens the bond. Most essentially, open communication should not take a backseat.How to be a successful LAT coupleTrust is the cornerstone of a successful LAT relationship. Without trust, living apart can lead to misunderstandings, insecurity, and instability.Prioritise spending time together, even if the quantity of time is limited.“Dedicating 45 minutes to an hour a day or 5–7 hours a week can be sufficient to maintain a healthy relationship, provided both partners are aligned on this approach,” suggests Dr Khanna.advertisementSetting boundaries while planning to live apart together is essential. Have the difficult conversations about finances, non-negotiable aspects, expectations, and how you will balance personal space and shared time.

“Both partners must have clear expectations. Deciding how often you’ll meet, what responsibilities you want to share, and maintaining communication should be an ongoing discussion so both partners stay aligned and their needs are met,” says Ruchi.Additionally, being expressive and maintaining communication is of utmost importance. Openly expressing needs, expectations, and concerns can help prevent misunderstandings and conflict. Experts say a lack of communication can trigger isolation, depression, and even temptations like infidelity.Being emotionally invested and staying connected through video calls or by regularly checking in on each other also helps.“Most importantly, don’t treat it like a free pass to avoid emotional intimacy. Regularly communicate and share meaningful moments to stay bonded,” suggests Ruchi.Ultimately, an LAT setup requires maturity, mutual understanding, and the ability to handle independence responsibly.Can the trend be a hit in India too?An increasingly popular trend in the West, Living Apart Together (LAT) is not entirely unfamiliar in India.“Historically, many couples lived apart due to work, such as men migrating to cities for jobs while women stayed back in villages,” highlights Dr Khanna, while adding that many modern couples already embrace it owing to professional or family obligations.“Many couples, especially in metro cities, already live apart due to demanding jobs, long commutes, or the necessity to support families in different locations. For instance, professionals commuting between Noida and Gurgaon often choose to live apart during the week, meeting only on weekends to save time and energy,” she says.Relationship expert Ruchi also sees progressive couples in metro cities who value individuality or face career-related separations embracing LAT.One cannot, however, rule out society’s reaction and expectations. Couples who adopt this lifestyle may face stigma in traditional settings. Cultural and societal expectations often emphasise shared living spaces, which can make LAT less socially acceptable.LAT or not, remember what Kahlil Gibran said in his poem:“Love one another, but make not a bond

What will define their journey?Children of younger millennials and older Gen Z, Gen Beta will be born into a world dominated by technology and AI.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/gen-beta-has-arrived-what-can-we-expect-from-them-2657962-2025-01-01,"When the clock struck midnight, we all welcomed the New Year with cheers and anticipation. A new year brings along fresh beginnings—be it a new look, renewed resolutions (yes, the same old ones with a sprinkle of extra hope), or new aspirations. But 2025 is particularly special because it marks the arrival of a brand-new cohort: Generation Beta, some of whom will live long enough to witness the dawn of the 22nd century. Before you scratch your head to do the maths, let us tell you, that Generation Beta includes those born between 2025 and 2039. By 2035, they are projected to make up 16 per cent of the global population, positioning themselves as a crucial demographic shaping the world’s future. But what will their traits look like, and how will they be any different from the previous generations - Gen Alpha (2013–2024), Gen Z (1997–2012), Millennials (1981–1996), Gen X (1965–1980) and Baby Boomers (1946–1964)? Let us dig into it. What traits are expected of Gen Beta? Children of younger millennials and older Gen Z, Gen Beta will be born into a world dominated by technology and AI. Experts suggest this generation will start life differently from their predecessors. Dr Arvind Otta, a senior psychologist and mental health activist, explains that Gen Beta will grow up during significant advancements in technology. They might even have AI applications powerful enough to personalise their learning and entertainment experiences. These differences may enable Gen Beta to navigate complex digital environments from a young age. Additionally, with societal perspectives on technology evolving, there could be greater emphasis on privacy and mental health concerns for this generation.

Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, agrees. She adds that learning, entertainment, and social interactions for Gen Beta will shift even further online. Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, agrees. She adds that learning, entertainment, and social interactions for Gen Beta will shift even further online. According to demographer and futurist Mark McCrindle's blog post, another defining trait of Gen Beta will be their adaptation to a world grappling with significant societal challenges. With climate change, global population shifts, and rapid urbanisation at the forefront, sustainability will not just be a preference but an expectation. Environmental challenges will shape societal values during their formative years. In essence, Gen Beta might be seen as a 2.0 version of iPad or “Shephora kids,” complete with a sprinkle of sass. However, like every generation, they’ll face their own unique set of challenges.‘Indian six-year-old thinks blue eyes and fair skin are beautiful’ Suriti Chakrabarti, a mum of a three-year-old and expecting her second child next month, reflects on how parenting has evolved. Despite enjoying a “blessed childhood” with an open relationship with her parents, she admits her approach will differ due to changing times. She anticipates a “generation gap” between her children, even though they’ll only be three years apart. One concern she expects to remain consistent is the struggle to build interpersonal relationships in an era of rapid technological evolution. “As kids, we weren’t as tech-savvy, but at least we could form meaningful relationships. That’s something I feel is developing slowly in today’s generations,” Suriti says. Dr Otta concurs, adding that while automation and AI might make life easier for Gen Beta, skills like creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence will require deliberate nurturing. These skills may not develop naturally in an AI-saturated environment.

 Riddhi also points out that Gen Beta’s reliance on AI could hinder their decision-making abilities. Virtual reality and the metaverse, which are just emerging now, will likely become commonplace for them. However, frequent immersion in virtual environments could blur the boundaries between real and virtual life, affecting their mental and emotional well-being. She recalls a troubling incident with a six-year-old patient who believed being “beautiful” meant having blue eyes and fair skin—a perception shaped by societal and technological influences. Such skewed ideals, if not addressed, could become more prevalent among Gen Beta.Kids of younger millennials and older Gen Z Growing up, many of us discreetly used landlines or mobile phones, careful not to let our parents find out. However, the dynamics of parenting are shifting, even in the Indian context, as younger generations take on this role. Sushmita Marik, a 30-year-old learning and development specialist and soon-to-be mum, shares her thoughts on parenting in this tech-driven era. She plans to embrace her child’s curiosity by addressing their questions openly and fostering communication. While her child will grow up in an age dominated by technology and social media, she intends to maintain a healthy balance and prevent over-dependence on it.

 Like Sushmita, experts like Riddhi suggest that millennial and Gen Z parents may adopt parenting styles that are radically different from their predecessors. Unlike previous generations, they value flexibility, inclusivity, and mental health awareness. Modern parents are less embarrassed to discuss emotions and mental well-being with their children. This openness fosters vulnerability and communication. These new approaches, combined with the challenges of raising tech-savvy children, will likely define parenting in the Gen Beta era.Tips for parents to raise Gen Beta kids We asked the experts to share some tips that can be followed by the soon-to-be parents. Have a look: 
Foster self-love and acceptance
With AI and social media creating unrealistic beauty and lifestyle standards, parents must instil a strong sense of self-worth in their children. Encourage them to embrace their unique qualities and prioritise inner happiness over external validation.
Balance technology and offline experiences
Gen Beta will be surrounded by AI and tech from birth, making it crucial to create a balance between screen time and real-world activities. Introduce hobbies like sports, arts, and outdoor play to nurture creativity and social interaction beyond digital spaces.
Teach digital literacy and critical thinking
Prepare children to navigate the digital world responsibly. Teach them to question online content, recognise AI biases, and differentiate between fact and fiction. Equip them with tools to handle misinformation and make informed choices.
Emphasise emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills
In a world where social interactions are increasingly virtual, parents should focus on developing their child’s emotional intelligence. Encourage open conversations, empathy, and collaboration to build meaningful human connections.
Encourage creativity and adaptability
As automation transforms jobs and lifestyles, creativity and adaptability will become vital skills. Provide opportunities for exploratory learning, problem-solving, and experimenting with new ideas to help Gen Beta thrive in a fast-changing world.
Set realistic expectations
Avoid imposing unattainable standards influenced by social media or AI-driven content. Focus on your child’s strengths and encourage gradual progress rather than perfection, helping them grow without undue pressure.
Promote family connections
Amidst the dominance of digital interactions, ensure that family bonds remain strong. Spend quality time together, involve children in family traditions, and create a support system that values human connections over virtual ones.

Focused on education and career growth, they leaned into the IT boom and startup culture. Their love for travel, gadgets, yet building interpersonal relationships (in real life, not online) and experiences reflects the optimism of growing up in a liberalised economy.

5956d457-4fd8-476f-a5b5-985d726a4800,The expensive reality of social media's never-ending trendsThe need to stay on top of every new social media trend is not just exhaustive but also draining your bank account. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/the-expensive-reality-of-instagram-facebook-tiktoks-never-ending-trends-and-reels-2658413-2025-01-02,"If there’s one thing we have understood about social media trends is that they come and go at lightning speed. While social media offers us creative inspiration and a space to connect, the relentless chase to stay relevant can take a toll on mental health. Beneath the surface of these fleeting moments lies an increasingly common sentiment: exhaustion.The pace of trends Social media trends are designed to be fast-moving. Algorithms prioritise fresh, engaging content, which means creators are constantly under pressure to churn out new material. A dance trend might dominate TikTok for a week before being replaced by a cooking hack or a quirky meme. The result? An overwhelming cycle of consumption where even the most dedicated users struggle to keep up. Dr Arvind Otta, senior psychologist and mental health activist, points out that the rapid evolution of social media trends can leave people feeling overwhelmed. “The fear of not being able to keep up steals the joy of using social media,” he says. This drive to fit into online communities often results in exhaustion and frustration. Similarly, Sumalatha Vasudeva, psychologist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, notes that the constant need to stay current creates fatigue, ultimately leading to burnout. Sanjina Bose, clinical psychologist at Lissun (an online mental health counselling therapy platform), describes this as the “algorithm versus real-life race”. “People spend endless hours doom scrolling, isolating themselves from real-world connections, and measuring self-worth through likes and followers. It’s a draining process that often leads to anxiety, depression, and imposter syndrome,” she explains.

 



Doomscrolling is the compulsive urge to scroll through negative news and social media content. (Photo: Unsplash)
The FOMO factor Fear of missing out (FOMO) has long been associated with social media, but it has intensified by the relentless pace of trends. Users not only want to be informed but also feel compelled to participate - whether it’s recreating a trending video or posting about the latest viral topic. For some, this pressure to stay relevant can lead to burnout. Not too long ago, the internet was obsessed with the viral Dubai kunafa chocolate. Everyone wanted a bite of it. Since getting your hands on one was a challenge, people came up with the idea of creating their own versions of the viral chocolate, eager to taste or replicate something close to the original kunafa chocolate bar from Dubai. That is exactly how impactful social media is today – so much so that brands saw it as a brilliant business opportunity and have been milking the trend brilliantly. Gayathri G, a freelance consultant, says, “It’s so jarring—one moment it’s touted as a miracle, the next, it’s a potential danger. This is just one of countless examples of opposing sides, each trying to scare you. It’s mentally draining, and it makes me wonder how anyone can navigate all this without feeling overwhelmed.” “For example, lately, there’s been a lot of talk about the benefits of castor oil for digestion, detoxing, and skin health, with people insisting on using cold-pressed, hexane-free oil. But then today, I came across a reel warning that castor oil contains ricin, a deadly toxin, and explaining how the seeds must be cooked to make the oil safe,” she adds.

 It is not just exhaustive, it is expensive too. Every day, influencers introduce a new line of makeup, accessories, bags, or jewellery to their followers. Now, imagine millions of influencers urging you to buy something new, follow a trend, or even travel to a new destination daily. You’re tempted, and you might even give in to the temptation, but how long can you keep doing this? It eventually becomes a significant drain on your bank account. Meneka Subramaniyam, an IT professional, shares, ""I love buying new makeup products to add to my vast collection. Initially, it was easy when options were limited, but now it’s a struggle to keep up. Imagine having products from not just India but options were limited, but now it’s a struggle to keep up. Imagine having products from not just India but also South Korea, Japan, France, the US, and Germany, all vying for your attention. We often forget to exercise restraint and fail to realise what this is doing to our minds.""Social media burnout: A growing concern Hence, the phenomenon of social media burnout is becoming increasingly common. Dr Otta explains that burnout manifests in various ways - from stress and disinterest to resentment toward social media platforms. Physical symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and disrupted sleep cycles are also prevalent. Emotionally, individuals may feel detached, inadequate, or overly conscious about their online presence.

 Vasudeva agrees, stating that burnout often stems from constant engagement and comparison. “People feel drained and inadequate, sacrificing personal well-being to maintain an ideal online image,” she says. According to Bose, signs of burnout include:
Constant self-comparison
Agitation or emotional distress related to social media
Increased screen time and poor sleep schedules
Feelings of disconnection from real-life relationships
The impact on daily life and self-esteem Social media’s impact extends beyond the digital realm, affecting daily routines, productivity, and personal relationships. “The pressure to stay relevant can disrupt daily life,” says Dr Otta. “People spend excessive time online, which erodes confidence when comparing themselves to others.” Vasudeva adds that this constant comparison lowers self-esteem and creates self-doubt, leaving people feeling they must always be ‘on’ to maintain their online persona.Gen Z: The most vulnerable generation? Younger generations, especially Gen Z, are particularly affected by trend-chasing culture. “For Gen Z, their online presence is tied to their identity,” says Dr Otta. “The pressure to keep up with what’s popular impacts their self-esteem.” Bose adds, “Being raised in the digital era makes them more vulnerable to the fear of missing out (FOMO), leading to significant mental strain.” However, Millennials are no different.Practical steps to break free from trend-chasing Experts agree that breaking the cycle of trend-chasing requires mindful changes in social media habits. Here’s their advice: Set boundaries: Limit screen time or schedule specific periods to check social media. Apps that track usage can help. Curate your feed: Follow accounts that inspire and align with your values. Unfollow those that induce stress or comparison. Focus on authenticity: Post content that reflects your genuine interests rather than chasing trends. Engage in offline activities: Rediscover hobbies, nurture personal relationships, and spend time in nature to regain balance. Practice mindfulness: Reflect on your motives for posting and consider whether it’s for self-expression or external validation. Try a gradual detox: Begin with short social media breaks and extend them gradually to ease the transition. Ask yourself a few questions: When tempted to make an impulsive purchase after seeing a viral trend, pause and reflect: Do I really need this?
How often will I use it?
Can I repurpose it in 3–4 different ways?
If you can confidently answer ""yes"" to all these questions, go ahead and buy it! Otherwise, it’s best to let it pass.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 2, 2025

“Now we will have 100 people in flight screaming on WhatsApp calls. Congratulations.” These were some of the reactions on the social media platform X following Air India's announcement of in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity on domestic routes. 2025 began with exciting news for travel enthusiasts as Air India introduced complimentary internet access for passengers on select aircraft, including the Airbus A350, Boeing 787-9, and certain Airbus A321neo models. With this move, Air India became the first carrier in the country to offer in-flight Wi-Fi on domestic routes. “Connectivity is now an integral part of modern travel. For some, it is about the convenience and comfort of real-time sharing, while for others, it is about greater productivity and efficiency,” says Rajesh Dogra, Chief Customer Experience Officer, Air India.

 



On January 1, Air India introduced complimentary internet access for passengers on select aircraft.
 Accessible on Wi-Fi-enabled devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones with iOS or Android operating systems, the in-flight Wi-Fi will also allow passengers to connect multiple devices simultaneously while cruising above 10,000 feet. So, basically, you can stay active on social media, stay connected with loved ones, continue texting, take WhatsApp calls, browse the internet, or even attend live online masterclasses—all while on the flight. It will also be a great help for anxious flyers by enabling connectivity. Quite the mile-high luxury? Perhaps. But it's undeniable that the unavailability of internet on flights came with its own perks—like being blissfully away from work emails and free from the boss's calls. With access to in-flight Wi-Fi on some Air India flights now, here are a few things you might miss doing:Being away from work “I will be unavailable for a few hours since I am on a flight” will no longer be a valid excuse to step away from work. Your laptop and mobile will keep buzzing with emails, texts, and work-related calls—and with in-flight Wi-Fi now available, you may feel obligated to respond to them. On the contrary, some working professionals may find this beneficial, as those hours will no longer be wasted due to the inability to work while on a flight.Gazing out of the window Eyes can stay glued to the screen even in the air! After all, you will have so much to do on your Wi-Fi enabled gadgets. Who is going to have time to peek out of the window and gaze at the vast ocean of clouds or the breathtaking landscapes below?Reading Picking up a book for a flight has long been a ritual for many regular flyers. Reading on the go is one of the best ways to stay occupied during a flight, after all! But now, books may take a backseat. When given the choice between reading a book and doomscrolling, we all know which one most people would choose (or, end up doing).Enjoying ‘me’ time With no connection to the outside world or social media, those hours on a flight became the perfect opportunity to introspect and reflect on various aspects of life. To sit with your thoughts and not indulge in any distraction can be therapeutic (not on a long-haul flight, though).   Napping without notifications Flights used to be ideal for catching up on sleep without interruptions. Now, notifications are bound to disrupt that peace! Additionally, there will likely be passengers speaking loudly on WhatsApp calls, making it even harder to enjoy a restful nap.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Tune InALSO READ |  Wi-Fi access on flights no longer linked to altitude, now subject to permissionMust Watch

Many people find it convenient to save and reuse these containers over and over again. Recently, however, a debate has sparked online about whether these containers are safe to use at all. The concern stems from the fact that these containers are made from ‘black plastic’, a material that is more prevalent in our daily lives than you might realise. The conversation gained traction after a viral Instagram video, where an influencer advised against using or reusing black plastic containers for storing or reheating food in a microwave. Have a look at the video:

What is actually black plastic?
Black plastic is a type of plastic used to make everyday items like food trays, containers, and utensils. It’s often made from recycled materials, including old electronics, and contains chemicals to make it flame-resistant. 
These chemicals, like decaBDE, are not locked into the plastic and can sneak into your food, especially if it’s hot, fatty, or acidic. 
Imagine reheating leftovers in a black plastic container—the heat could trigger these chemicals to leach out, posing risks to your health. 
That’s why experts recommend being cautious when using black plastic in your kitchen. ButCan black plastic give you cancer? In a recent study published in the scientific journal of Chemosphere 203 black plastic consumer products were analysed. It found toxic flame-retardant chemicals in 85 per cent of these products.

 That’s why experts recommend being cautious when using black plastic in your kitchen. ButCan black plastic give you cancer?  In a recent study published in the scientific journal of Chemosphere 203 black plastic consumer products were analysed. It found toxic flame-retardant chemicals in 85 per cent of these products. Experts also cautioned against the use of black plastic as much as possible. For instance, according to Dr Aravind Badiger, technical director at BDR Pharmaceuticals, black plastic utensils and containers are associated with cancer risks due to their content of toxic flame retardants. These chemicals are known to migrate into food, causing harm over time. “DecaBDE and similar compounds are ‘suspected carcinogens and endocrine disruptors’, which can interfere with hormonal systems and potentially lead to cancer,” he says.

 Dr Sachin Trivedi, the director of medical oncology at HCG Cancer Center, agrees and adds that black plastic often contains substances like bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which are linked to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and reproductive issues. Prof Chintamani, chairman of the Department of Surgical Oncology, Sir Gangaram Hospital, further points out that microplastics from the black plastic often ingested through everyday items like tea bags and bottled water, add to the cumulative toxic load in the body.  However, all three experts that India Today spoke to shared that while there is no conclusive evidence linking black plastic to cancer, but they suggest that hormonal disruptions caused by plastic chemicals could contribute to cancer risks.   “While there isn’t definitive evidence directly linking black plastic to cancer, its chemical composition poses enough risks to warrant caution,” Dr Trivedi says.Other side effects of black plastics  Endocrine disruption Studies have shown that chemicals in black plastic, such as BPA and phthalates, disrupt the endocrine system, leading to potential reproductive health issues, obesity, and diabetes. Developmental and neurological effects Research indicates that exposure to certain additives in black plastic can result in developmental delays and reduced IQ in children, along with other neurological disorders.

 Environmental impact Dr Trivedi emphasises the environmental consequences of black plastic. It is difficult to recycle and often ends up in landfills or incinerators, releasing toxic substances like dioxins and furans into the air. These are known carcinogens and can harm human health when inhaled over time. Microplastic contamination Microplastics from black plastic find their way into food, water, and air, causing inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular damage in the human body. Their long-term health impacts are still under study but are a growing concern.Should you not use black plastic? Experts unanimously recommend avoiding black plastic for food storage and preparation. Dr Badiger advises using safer, free-from-harmful-chemicals materials like glass or stainless steel. Similarly, replacing black kitchen utensils with wooden or stainless-steel options can significantly reduce exposure to toxic substances. Moreover, heating food in black plastic, whether in a microwave or otherwise, should be avoided. As Chintamani explains, heating can cause toxic chemicals to leach into food, posing health risks. If you’re just using it repeatedly for storing food, it could lead to long-term exposure to harmful substances, contributing to health risks over time. So, always opt for microwave-safe containers made from safer materials, as mentioned above. Bottomline While the direct link between black plastics and cancer is still under research, the potential risks associated with their chemical composition and environmental impact are substantial. Opting for safer alternatives and avoiding heating food in black plastic are prudent steps to protect your health.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

Not biscuits, rusks for sureHealth experts warn that many popular tea-time snack choices in Indian households are unhealthy and should be avoided for daily consumption. If your morning tea ritual also feels incomplete without dipping biscuits or rusks, it might be time to rethink your snack choices.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/food/story/healthy-tea-snacks-not-biscuits-rusks-2659861-2025-01-05,"Chai, in India, is an emotion. During winters, this emotion only intensifies, becoming the perfect antidote to the biting cold. For many, it is the first thing they relish in the morning. For others, it is also an essential breakfast companion, a post-lunch indulgence, an evening beverage, and even a post-dinner treat. As soul-soothing as the daily chai sessions feel, they often come with a hefty calorie load. But the chai is not to be solely blamed here—the real culprits are the snacks we tend to indulge in alongside those cups of tea. Health experts, however, warn that many popular tea-time snack choices in Indian households are unhealthy and should be avoided for daily consumption. If your morning tea ritual also feels incomplete without dipping biscuits or rusks, it might be time to rethink your snack choices.

 Moreover, a new survey suggests that Indians have been spending more on processed foods, refreshments, and beverages than on fruits and vegetables every month. This increased consumption of processed foods and sugary beverages is linked to a rise in diseases like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular issues in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in May 2024, also stated that 56.4 per cent of India's total disease burden is linked to unhealthy diets. A lot of the common tea snacks are high in calories and contain fewer essential nutrients, leading to health issues. “Chai is often paired with snacks in Indian culture, but the usual snacks such as biscuits, rusks, aloo bhujia, samosas, and kachoris are not healthy. They are high in refined flour, sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which may cause weight gain, high cholesterol, and diabetes if taken daily,” says Dr Neeti Sharma, Head, Nutritionist and Dietetics, Marengo Asia Hospitals Gurugram. “Nankhatai, biscuits, and rusks should be avoided as they are made with refined flour and unreliable oil quality. Similarly, fried snacks like aloo bhujia, namkeen, samosas, kachoris, and pakoras are harmful. They raise bad cholesterol, increase triglycerides, and pose a risk of coronary heart disease. These snacks lack nutritional value, providing only saturated fats and carbohydrates,” adds Reena Poptani, Clinical Dietitian and Diabetes Educator. Some of the tea snacks you should avoid on a regular basis include:

 Fried foods

Samosas and pakoras due to high calories, fat, and sodium content.



 Refined sugar treats

Store-bought cookies, biscuits, and rusks made with added sugar, unhealthy fats, and empty calories.



 Processed snacks

Chips and other processed foods high in unhealthy fats, sodium, and added sugars.

 “Deep-fried snacks can be enjoyed in moderation, limited to 1-2 times a week in small quantities, but they should not be consumed regularly. Biscuits and rusks made with whole wheat should also be restricted to 1-2 pieces per day,” suggests Dr Sharma. Many packaged products now come with enticing labels like ""50% less oil,"" ""healthier,"" or ""made with the goodness of oats."" However, it’s important to read the ingredients and labels carefully to understand what you're actually consuming.What to have instead? There are ample healthier options to replace your regular stack of biscuits, chips, packaged namkeen, and dry cakes. Health experts recommend roasted makhanas, seed mixes, and roasted black chana as healthy tea-time snack options. “Healthy alternatives also include baked or air-popped snacks, roasted chickpeas, popcorn, or makhanas. You can also opt for whole wheat crackers, biscuits, or cookies made at home with ingredients like quinoa or ragi,” says Simrat Kathuria, CEO and head dietitian at The Diet Xperts, Ludhiana. Experts also suggest khakra, bajra puff, jowar puff, puffed rice bhel with chutney and veggies, roasted peas, sprouts chaat, boiled corn chaat, chickpea salad, methi thepla, roasted sweet potato, baked samosa with vegetable filling, poha, murmura chivda, multigrain crackers, homemade dhokla, and whole-grain crackers to go with your cup of chai. However, moderation is key when it comes to snacking, even with nutritious foods. Overconsumption of any food, no matter how healthy, can disrupt the balance of your diet and lead to issues such as excessive calorie intake, weight gain, or nutrient imbalances.Love chai? A few things to remember
Limit tea intake to 1–2 cups per day if sugar and cream are added. Without sugar, 2–3 cups are acceptable.
 “Tea is acidic and contains caffeine, which can be harsh on an empty stomach,” says Simrat Kathuria. So, pair it with nutrient-dense snacks, especially in the morning. Avoid using tea as a hunger suppressant. Instead, enjoy it as a mindful addition to your diet. Having your chai without a healthy snack, by the way, is not a good idea. “Milk tea should not be consumed alone, as it is more likely to cause acidity or bloating due to its caffeine and tannins, which can lead to discomfort. To avoid this, a small and healthy snack can be served alongside,” says Dr Sharma.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 5, 2025ALSO READ |  The Problem in Your Plate: Why an Indian home-cooked meal is not always healthyTrending Reel

But of course, this isn’t something anyone would want to boast about in public because, agree with us or not, it is kind of unhygienic, to say the least. However, there might be some good news for those who detest the idea of a shower during winter months. You might even want to share it with your friends without them looking down on you. At least, that’s what a viral Instagram video claims.A viral video’s startling claim A video shared by Dr Rebecca Pinto suggests that not having a bath in winter is not that bad after all because, apparently, it increases your life expectancy by 34 per cent.

 The video, while seemingly too good to be true, has racked up an impressive 6.6 million views on Instagram. However, not everyone was on board with its claims. Many social media users were quick to express their skepticism. “Is there any research article on this? If yes, you should have shared it before making such a bold claim,” one user remarked in the comments section.
 



 


While the claim is astounding, the expert cites no journal or research paper in her video which talks about the claim.So, it was only right to do what we do best: dig deeper to find out if there’s any truth to these claims.What other experts say While the claim is astounding, the expert cites no journal or research paper in her video which talks about the claim. So, it was only right to do what we do best: dig deeper to find out if there’s any truth to these claims.What other experts say While experts agree that bathing frequently can do your skin microbiome some harm, but skipping bath altogether in winter could be detrimental. Dr Balakrishna G K, HOD and senior consultant internal medicine, Gleneagles BGS Hospital Kengeri, Bengaluru, says, “The claim that skipping baths can increase life expectancy by 34 per cent seems exaggerated and lacks strong scientific backing. While frequent baths can disrupt the skin's microbiome and natural defences, entirely skipping baths may lead to hygiene concerns and infections.” Yes, temperature and exposure to cold significantly impact the body, and this holds true for various species. Research indicates that colder temperatures can reduce metabolic rates in some species, but to say that it actually happens for humans doesn’t hold any strong proof.

 Dr H Guru Prasad, associate clinical director and HOD, department of general medicine, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, adds, “Though the claim is alluring, but scrutinising research methodology and context before conclusions is key (if there's one at all). Bathing habits may indirectly connect to skin health preservation or hot water damage reduction but longevity relies on an intricate interplay of genes, lifestyle, and surroundings, making bathing alone unlikely to significantly impact longevity.”In fact, bathing is important, even in winters While we’re conditioned to think daily bathing is essential, hygiene standards vary widely across cultures. In colder climates, it’s not uncommon for people to bathe just a few times a week. However, you should be able to strike a balance as bathing has its benefits too.
Warm baths can improve blood flow and relaxation, indirectly aiding digestion.
 “Skipping bath occasionally likely causes minimal digestive effects, but consistent lack of bathing risks stress negatively impacting digestion,” says Dr Prasad.

Well, obviously, there’s truth to these claims, but does that mean hot shower enthusiasts are unknowingly harming their bodies?“Both cold and hot baths have their benefits and drawbacks. Cold baths can improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and boost energy levels, while hot baths are relaxing and can soothe muscle aches. However, in winter, lukewarm water is ideal as it helps clean the skin without stripping away too much of its natural moisture, unlike excessively hot water, which can exacerbate dryness,” explains Dr Balakrishna G K.The hygiene concernsWhile indulging in a bit of winter laziness is totally fine, you can’t ignore hygiene.

Held in Beverly Hills, California, on January 5, the Golden Globes set the fashion tone for the year as a parade of stars sashayed down the red carpet in their sartorial best. Among the celebrities in attendance were Zendaya, Demi Moore, Selena Gomez, Angelina Jolie, Mindy Kaling, Emma Stone, and Nicole Kidman, turning the 2025 Globes into a truly fashion-forward event. 2025 is going to be the year of unabashed maximalism – that’s what the red carpet scenario suggested. The trend emerges after ‘quiet luxury’ and ‘minimal fabulousness’ ruled the fashion game in the past few years. Billowing silhouettes, opera gloves, ogle-worthy jewellery pieces, sequin galore, voluminous hairstyles  and roaring red were the top trends at the Golden Globes. India also witnessed noteworthy fashion moments with Lilly Singh rocking a Gaurav Gupta creation, and Best Director nominee Payal Kapadia slaying it in a crisp black silk jumpsuit with brocade accents. Designer Manish Malhotra also made his debut in a self-designed monochrome tuxedo with a bejewelled lapel.

Several celebrities took inspiration from the event’s name, with a dazzling array of golden gowns dominating the red carpet on this glamorous night. Subtle, blingtastic, shimmering satin or swathed in sequin, all sorts golden creations were flaunted at The Globes. Mindy Kaling embraced maximalism in an Ashi Studio strapless golden gown adorned with sparkling silver stones. Kristen Bell’s pick for the night was also an Ashi Studio creation in rose gold – a sequinned bustier and skirt set.

 Demi Moore won big at The Globes this year – not only by bagging an award for her performance in ‘The Substance’ but also with her fashion choice. She looked gorgeous in a sculptural gleaming gown in champagne gold by Armani Prive. The crystal embellishments, must we add, further upped the glam quotient!

Sequin is still very much in Say what you will, but sequins are not going anywhere anytime soon! Year after year, sequin supremacy continues to reign. From Lilly Singh’s electrifying blue Gaurav Gupta gown to Nicole Kidman’s blingtastic (and backless) silver number, these show-stopping looks were among the scene-stealers at The Globes 2025.

Opera gloves If there was a fashion element as prominent as the presence of gold at The Globes 2025, it was opera gloves. The fashion world’s favorite accessory to add a hint of drama was embraced by a bevy of celebrities, including the star of the night, Ariana Grande, as well as Pamela Anderson and Ali Wong.

e2ef4435-dd40-41d5-84e1-1f71f423ad01,"What's the real story of tourism in Goa right now?Is tourism in Goa really declining, or are we missing an undercurrent, a positive one that can reposition the state's identity as the ""party capital of India""?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/whats-the-real-story-of-tourism-in-goa-right-now-2661259-2025-01-08,"It’s the 1970s, and Goa is pulsating with the rhythm of full-moon parties. The air is electric with trance beats and psychedelic vibes, drawing in a crowd of free-spirited wanderers. This sun-soaked paradise, with its relaxed atmosphere, stunning landscapes, and culturally tolerant ethos, became a haven for the countercultural movement. For the hippies of that era, Goa was more than just a destination - it was a refuge where freedom, self-expression, and unconventional living thrived. Perhaps, it was with their arrival that Goa’s nascent tourism industry got an unintended boost. Fast forward to 2025, and the narrative has taken a sharp turn. Amid claims that Goa's tourism has lost the spark that once made it a symbol of escapism and allure, a question looms large: has Goa’s magic truly faded, or is this simply a reflection of changing times and evolving expectations?The social media debate The discourse around Goa's tourism on social media is anything but unanimous. On one side, some share videos of deserted streets, empty beaches, and quiet marketplaces, raising alarms with statements like, “Is it game over for Goa?” On the other, a contrasting narrative emerges, with bustling streets and thriving beach shacks showcasing a seemingly vibrant tourist season. So, who do you believe? For instance, X user Madhur posted a video of a Goan local shouting at tourists for parking at the wrong spot and stating this is one of the reasons for the decline in tourism in Goa. ""This kinda harassment is a major reason behind the decline of tourism in Goa. Yes, the guy shouldn’t have parked there but maybe he saw other cars and thought he also could,"" he writes in his tweet. See the tweet here:

— Madhur (@ThePlacardGuy) January 2, 2025 Adding fuel to the debate, entrepreneur Ramanuj Mukherjee shared data on Goa’s declining tourism numbers over recent years, boldly declaring that it has “gone to the dumps.”

Tourism in Goa is down in dumps

Foreign tourists have abandoned the state already. Look at 2019 v 2023 numbers. Russians and Brits who used to visit annually have opted for Sri Lanka instead.

— Ramanuj Mukherjee (@law_ninja) November 5, 2024 This didn’t sit well with Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte, who filed a complaint against Mukherjee last month. The minister, visibly frustrated with what he called “paid influencers,” addressed the controversy during a press conference: “I am not justifying the issues, but at the same time, we need to ensure that a wrong message is not created by someone. Let us amplify the right issues. Let us not disturb Goa with smaller issues when it is a tourism destination.” Amidst accusations and counter-accusations, the root causes of Goa’s challenges remain elusive. It goes beyond just tourist numbers, “expensive hotel tariffs,” or the “taxi mafia” narrative circulating online. The real reasons shaping Goa’s current reality are far more complex, natural, and nuanced than these oversimplified claims suggest.“Empty or comparatively empty” When addressing the narrative of Goa being “empty,” isn’t it subjective? A North Goa resident of three years, who wished to remain anonymous, shares, “In the South, we still see a consistent influx of foreign tourists, especially during the winters. However, these are usually long-term visitors who come for the season.” His sister chimes in, “First, we need to address the benchmark of ‘empty.’ I was at Martin’s Corner (South Goa eatery) the other day and had to wait for about 30 minutes to find a spot. Now, if that’s what you call empty! We all know that the state has been grappling with overtourism and if this is how things are balancing out, so be it.” The former further notes, “Tourism in Goa has diversified. Earlier, foreign backpackers dominated the scene. Now, we see a mix of budget domestic tourists and affluent Indian families. Budget tourism—like the so-called ‘minibus tourists’—brings people who often cook their own food or drink on the beaches, contributing less to the economy. On the other hand, affluent tourists spend significantly more and drive up prices, making it harder for locals to enjoy the same spaces. Whether that’s good or bad depends on whom you ask—it’s very subjective.” Lyndon Alves, a tourism stakeholder, highlights that overtourism is a global issue, but in Goa, it manifests differently. “This is the crowd that spends time complaining and crying, and honestly, that might be a good thing for Goa. Yes, we’ve taken a hit, but maybe it’s for the better. Overtourism of that quality is something we don’t want. Goa's brand has been spoilt by the lower-level Indian tourists,” Alves tells a media outlet. He adds, “Upmarket tourism hasn’t recovered well since Covid-19. The reality is that hotels don’t have enough rooms for upmarket tourists because many have prioritised conferences and weddings. The rates that wealthy Indian clients are paying for these events make it unviable for hotels to allocate rooms to charter tourists.”“It feels like Goa again” In recent months, Goa has made headlines—but not always for the right reasons. Overtourism has brought with it a host of challenges, from the notorious “taxi mafia” to strained garbage management systems. While efforts are underway to address these issues, a lower tourist influx might actually be a blessing in disguise for the state. Actor and travel vlogger Shenaz Treasury, currently spending time in Goa, has observed a noticeable difference this season. Having visited the state numerous times for both work and leisure, she shares, “The past few years, Goa was bursting at the seams, and it was not fun. Wrappers on the beach, plastic bottles everywhere, trash piling up, traffic jams galore, and construction ruining the vibe. This year? It feels different. The rubbish tourists—the ones who litter and don’t respect nature—seem to be missing. It feels like old Goa again. Blissful, peaceful, and oh-so-lovely.” Treasury also notes the shift in the type of visitors this year. “I love Goa this year. The Tourism Board should be thrilled. The trashy tourists have packed their bags, and what’s left is a more refined crowd (well, mostly). It’s giving me the Goa vibes I come back for every single year. I don’t mind paying the extra price if it means keeping trashy tourists who disrespect nature away!”advertisementIs Goa really expensive?Unlike in the past, travelling to far-off destinations like Thailand, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka has become remarkably easy. For this reason, Goa is now often compared to these destinations in terms of accommodation and food prices, as people are traveling in large numbers. This comparison might seem justified.The narrative that Goa is expensive—and therefore losing visitors—could hold some truth. So, could this also be an intentional move to restore Goa to its former glory, limiting access to only a select few and cutting out the ""trouble-causing lot""? Maybe.Alves raises a compelling question: “How can a place go down and be expensive at the same time?”From an economic perspective, there’s a point here. A place being perceived as ""not doing well"" while costs like hotel accommodations, airfares, and dining soar can be explained by a combination of factors, such as:Selective demand: Catering to a niche, high-spending crowd instead of the masses.Cost-push inflation: Rising operational costs driving up prices.Market positioning: Rebranding as a premium destination, intentionally excluding budget travellers.Economic paradox: A destination can face declining visitor satisfaction while prices remain high.Speculative pricing: Businesses' pricing is based on expected demand, not current realities.Shehnaz Treasury also offers insight: “Yes, Goa is ridiculously expensive now. A room on the beach for Rs 29,000—and it’s not even a 3-star?! No wonder people are flocking to Southeast Asia, Oman, or Baku instead. Makes sense. The NRIs are still here—they can afford it—but the 'classy foreigners' Goa was once known for? Barely seen. Instead, there’s a steady stream of Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish tourists.”The perception of Goa being “cheap” is changing, and this could signal a positive repositioning.Goa needs to evolve, transform, and how!When Indian tourists set foot in Goa, a sense of liberation washes over them, and for many, that’s part of the charm. However, some tourists seem to misuse this sense of freedom, engaging in behaviour that can only be described as ridiculous, thinking “yahaan sab chalta hai.” Manish Bhattacharya (name changed), a waiter at a popular Goa restaurant, recounts how groups of young boys often crowd the place—and how he caught them sneaking photos of foreigners.“I’ve been working here for the last 13 years and have seen all kinds of people. Recently, though, something that I often see—and have objected to several times—is a group of boys secretly photographing foreigners. When I noticed, I took their phone and warned them. They eventually left. But you know what? I think this is one of the reasons foreigners are leaving. They don’t feel safe or protected anymore.”And there are many more reasons why Goa needs to transform.Alves argues that smart management, involving all stakeholders, and a clearer understanding of how to reposition Goa’s tourism market—something that should have been done during the Covid-19 pandemic—can still be achieved. The market needs reinvention, with a focus on attracting more family tourism to shift the trend of young people visiting just to drink cheaply.“What we really need is family entertainment.

For many, this new beginning is an opportunity to reflect on personal goals, career ambitions, and overall lifestyle. Among these, fitness often takes centre stage, with many vowing to get in shape, embarking on a transformation journey, and hitting the gym with newfound enthusiasm. But remember, it's the little things that matter most. This common saying applies to many situations, but it is especially true when it comes to our health. From increasing water intake and making small dietary changes to ditching phone usage while eating, these simple lifestyle adjustments can make a significant impact on your well-being. Chances are, you already know what’s good and what’s not for your health, but hear it from health experts who want you to stick to the minor lifestyle changes that can truly transform your health for the better.Hello, hydration Staying hydrated is important for a bevy of bodily functions like carrying nutrients and oxygen to cells, regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, and protecting the organs and tissues. It also helps with digestion, maintaining energy, and even skin health. So, you know how important it is!

 



Aim to drink 8 glasses of water each day (Photo: Pexels)
“Start your day with a glass of water and aim to drink at least 8 glasses daily. Staying hydrated boosts metabolism, supports organ function, and improves skin health,” suggests Dr Balakrishna G K, HOD and senior consultant, Internal Medicine, Gleneagles BGS Hospital Kengeri, Bengaluru.To ensure you don’t miss out on regularly drinking water, carry a reusable water bottle and set reminders on your phone. You can also flavour it with your favourite fruits or herbs if you find drinking plain water unappealing.Plate your meals properly (focus on protein) “Start your day with a glass of water and aim to drink at least 8 glasses daily.

To ensure you don’t miss out on regularly drinking water, carry a reusable water bottle and set reminders on your phone. You can also flavour it with your favourite fruits or herbs if you find drinking plain water unappealing.Plate your meals properly (focus on protein) According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), as of May 2024, 56.4% of India's total disease burden is linked to unhealthy diets. While it is crucial to avoid regularly consuming processed and ultra-processed foods, it’s equally important to pay attention to your home-cooked meals. However, this doesn't mean you can eat anything and everything just because it's cooked at home. Contrary to popular belief, home-cooked food isn't always healthy, especially if it's not plated properly or contains excessive oil, sugar, or salt. Approach your meals with a balanced perspective—your daily diet should include fibre, lean protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and essential micronutrients. “Start taking a diversified high-fibre diet. Eat good amounts of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts which feed the best gut bacteria around. Fermentable foods like yoghurt, kefir, kimchi - incorporate probiotics and support a healthy population of microbiomes. Avoid many processed foods that contain refined sugar and unhealthy fat, which also can be fatal to gut bacteria,” suggests Dr Kapil Jamwal, clinical director, department of gastroenterology and hepatology, Marengo Asia Hospital Gurugram. Pay essential focus on protein, as it helps build and repair tissues, supports muscle growth, and plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and satiety. FYI, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has set the daily protein requirement as 0.83 grams per kg per day for adults. So, fill half the plate with vegetables and fruits, a quarter with lean protein, and a quarter with whole grains, complemented by healthy fats and a source of dairy or a dairy alternative. Here’s what a ‘plate for the day’ should look like, according to ICMR:

 



What balanced food for a day looks like for someone who aims to consume 2,000 calories, according to ICMR.
 To incorporate this change in your life, plan meals ahead of time and keep healthy snacks handy.Get moving (and start exercising) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), physical inactivity is a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

a124b665-2bc9-4c5e-a114-4743b4f74e0c,How the Michelangelo Phenomenon can shape or break a relationshipThe Michelangelo Phenomenon is a fascinating psychological concept that likens the dynamic between partners to that of a sculptor and their art.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/how-the-michelangelo-phenomenon-can-shape-or-break-a-relationship-2662344-2025-01-09,"There is no denying that relationships have evolved over a period of time, which means the kind of relationship you share with your partner was exactly not how your grandparents did. But one thing has been persistent – an ideal relationship (not that there is any but you get it, right?) is one where partners help shape each other into their best selves. That’s basically the crux of the Michelangelo Phenomenon. This is a fascinating psychological concept that likens the dynamic between partners to that of a sculptor and their art. Just as the iconic Renaissance artist Michelangelo believed his sculptures were already present within the marble, waiting to be revealed, this phenomenon suggests that in a healthy relationship, partners ""sculpt"" each other by encouraging traits and aspirations that align with their ideal selves. But is this always a harmonious process, or can the chisel sometimes strike too hard?What is the Michelangelo Phenomenon? ""The phenomenon is about partners helping each other grow into their truest versions,"" explains Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai. ""By supporting each other’s values, goals, and virtues, they chip away the unnecessary parts, revealing the best version of themselves.""

The concept aligns with Self-Determination Theory (SDT), where people flourish when their autonomy, competence, and intrinsic goals are supported. In the context of relationships, Delhi-based relationship counsellor Ruchi Ruuh highlights how partners act as sculptors. ""They affirm traits and behaviours that align with their partner’s ideal self-concept, fostering trust, shared goals, and emotional intimacy,"" she says.Why it worksThe Michelangelo Phenomenon thrives on mutual encouragement, building emotional intimacy and resilience. When both partners feel supported, they’re more likely to achieve personal growth. ""This emotional safety allows them to explore aspirations without fear of judgment or abandonment,"" adds Ruuh.

When both partners feel supported, they’re more likely to achieve personal growth. ""This emotional safety allows them to explore aspirations without fear of judgment or abandonment,"" adds Ruuh. Even in long-distance relationships, the phenomenon’s principles apply. As Sam puts it, ""Strong communication is key to keeping the effect alive. It’s a reminder that growth and connection transcend physical boundaries."" Additionally, research on relational dynamics highlights that when couples invest in each other’s personal development, they experience higher levels of satisfaction and stability. Supporting a partner’s growth fosters a cycle of positivity that reinforces the emotional foundation of the relationship. Moreover, the shared pursuit of personal goals can strengthen the couple’s bond by creating common narratives and achievements.The cultural lens In India, the phenomenon intersects with cultural expectations and familial roles. ""India’s plurality comes with societal norms that can be challenging,"" explains Sam. ""When you’re talking about the Indian aspect, or let’s say the cultural aspect, in India, this can work very well. But as India is full of pluralities, we do come with a lot of cultural expectations. No matter where you belong or what kind of families or roles you have, we always have some set of expectations from society,” explains Sam. Ruuh echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the potential for positive applications beyond romance. ""This approach isn’t limited to romantic relationships. It works in friendships, family dynamics, and even professional setups.""When can things go awry However, the sculptor’s chisel can sometimes slip. ""When one partner imposes their vision of the ‘ideal self’ onto the other, it can lead to resentment,"" warns Ruuh. Over time, this dynamic may create role strain or internal conflict. Sam points out another risk: ""There’s a chance one might lose their real self trying to meet their partner’s expectations."" The imbalance can lead to dependency, emotional distance, or unintentional reinforcement of harmful behaviours. To prevent such pitfalls, Ruuh advises boundaries and mutual respect. ""It’s essential that both partners feel like equal contributors in this process. Otherwise, the sculptor might feel overburdened or inadequate.""Takeaway The essence of a relationship, whether it’s marriage or friendship, often hinges on compatibility. While that’s undoubtedly important, interpersonal growth is equally crucial. Stagnancy isn’t something people accept easily—if you don’t grow and your partner or friend doesn’t support that growth, it could strain the relationship. On the flip side, overdoing it by imposing your vision on others can also create problems. So, the key is balance and, most importantly, listening!Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 9, 2025

Many women grapple with its symptoms, from excessive facial hair growth to hair loss (yes, we get the irony), acne, irregular periods and more. To manage these symptoms, women often seek remedies that range from lifestyle changes to wellness teas to even medications.  Among these, supplements, especially for PCOS, are getting a lot of attention online. These supplements promise a way to manage these symptoms, and some also claim that they can help you heal your PCOS. But can supplements really help you or is it a big fat scam?How PCOS impacts women’s body In simple terms, PCOS is a hormonal disorder that commonly affects women of reproductive age. Dr Anjana Singh, director of obstetrics and gynaecology at Fortis Hospital, Noida, explains that PCOS is characterised by enlarged ovaries with small cysts on their outer edges. Symptoms include unexplained weight gain, excessive facial hair, discolouration of skin on the neck, and missed periods. “Patients of PCOS may experience weight gain, especially around the belly, along with fatigue and fertility issues,” adds Dr Rohan Palshetkar, head of unit at Bloom IVF. Women with PCOS are also more prone to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Although the exact cause is unknown, factors like genetics, insulin resistance, and inflammation are believed to play a role.

However, these products often come with hefty price tags, and their effectiveness can vary widely.Supplements offer potential benefits, but they are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Dr Preeti Deedwania, consultant at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida, advises caution, noting that online recommendations can often be misleading.“Supplements are not miracle cures; they are supportive tools that should be used under medical supervision,” reiterates Dr Singh.

Berberine: Long-term use could impact gut bacteria negatively and may interact with certain medications.
Probiotics: Although generally safe, they can occasionally cause bloating or gas.
“It’s crucial to follow prescribed doses and monitor for any adverse reactions,” advises Dr Deedwania. What can be done instead of popping supplements?Supplements alone cannot cure PCOS. Experts recommend a holistic approach that prioritises lifestyle changes over reliance on pills.
Diet: A balanced diet rich in fibre, lean proteins, and healthy fats can improve insulin sensitivity and hormone levels.
Exercise: Regular physical activity helps manage weight and reduce inflammation. Experts suggest even a 10 percent weight loss can significantly improve symptoms.

2e020f36-dcf5-4d4b-8dc5-97e24f4115d5,"The male attitude towards sex toys is changing in IndiaHesitation, social taboo, judgment, and the shame associated with using sex toys often prevents men from exploring sex toys.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/male-sex-toys-attitude-india-2662924-2025-01-10,"“Why do I even need something like this?” has long been the attitude among men when it comes to sex toys. One of the probable reasons why heterosexual men are not among the top users of sex toys in India in a survey published on Lancet. However, the mindset is now changing – that’s what the leading sex toy companies in India say now. Thanks to India’s bedroom revolution, sex toys finally came out of the closet in 2024. This shift was driven by a new wave of brands selling these products online, a rising number of sex educators and sexual wellness influencers, and the normalisation of sex toy usage through their availability on quick delivery apps like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, and Blinkit. According to the 'Laid in India' survey conducted by bedroom essentials brand MuMuse with 10,000 participants, 45 per cent of Indians use sex toys, and 78 per cent openly discuss them with their friends. Industry experts, as well as some research, suggest women are more likely to report owning sex toys compared to men. The same can be attributed to the destigmatisation of female sexual pleasure and wide orgasm gap. 69 per cent of women report better orgasms with sex toys vs. without, says the MyMuse survey. While women have historically been more vocal in embracing pleasure products, men are steadily catching up,” says Arjun Siva, business head at Love Depot.Female pleasure and the barriers it overcame In India, female pleasure coming to the forefront has taken a long time, effort, and a gradual shift in societal attitudes towards sexuality and women's rights. “Relatively speaking, men face fewer barriers to access when purchasing sexual wellness products compared to women, who typically encounter significantly higher levels of stigma and judgement. Women also generally have less privacy and agency within families and society, systemically, thanks to patriarchy. It is thus generally even more challenging for women than for men to openly explore and purchase products for their sexual pleasure,” says Leeza Mangaldas, sex educator and founder of self-care brand Leezu’s. “Therefore, statistically speaking, right now in India—and in fact, even globally—a woman is more likely to own a sex toy if her partner got it for her. However, there is a growing demographic of women taking charge of their own pleasure, which is both empowering and transformative. This shift signals a positive change, one that I am personally most excited about,” she tells India Today.The 'masculine' attitude For men, however, hesitation, social taboo, judgement, and the shame associated with using sex toys often prevent them from exploring these options. “It's probably due to patriarchy, sure—since much of masculinity depends on heteronormativity and sexual success with women, a man who has to ‘resort’ to sex toys is seen as a loser or a pervert,” writes a Reddit user in a post discussing why it is shameful for a man to want a sex toy for himself. “I think the difference is probably that women orgasm way less than men during sex; so when women have sex toys it’s simply to orgasm, whereas when men have sex toys it must be because they’re freaky. That’s the ‘assumption’ made by society,” reads another comment on the post. The stigma is, however, diminishing. “While women have traditionally led this space, the stigma around using male pleasure products is slowly diminishing,” says Anushka Gupta, founder of MyMuse. “Products like Toofaan have emerged as bestsellers, reflecting an eagerness among men to explore their sexual pleasure as well as to become more self-aware about their own sexuality, anatomy, and health. This year, we expect this trend to gain further momentum, driven by increasing awareness and availability of products catering to male sexual wellness,” says Mangaldas. According to her, Indian men are likely to embrace tools that provide an informed and enjoyable understanding of their sexual health and desires, as societal conversations around gender and pleasure are becoming more mainstream. Experts say this change is also fuelled by designs that prioritise discretion and the evolution of men’s pleasure, with men actively exploring sexual wellness as an integral part of broader self-care. “Products like stroker sleeves (both powered and non-powered), vibrating rings, and app-controlled devices are gaining traction, showing that men are becoming more experimental with their choices, contrary to popular opinion,” says Siva.Couple pleasure at the forefront Not just self-pleasure, sex toys are also helping build and maintain intimacy between couples. “Women report experiencing better orgasms with sex toys. For men, the biggest benefit comes in the form of enhanced connection with their partner, with 31 per cent of men saying toys have improved their intimacy with their partners,” says the ‘Laid in India’ survey. The focus on male pleasure has now shifted to mutual pleasure. The leading brands in the realm have a ‘for couple’ category, which usually comprises tools for ‘him’ as well as ‘her’. “Interestingly, men frequently purchase for their partners,” shares Gupta. Love Depot also reports a growing demand for couple-focused products. “We've noticed a growing demand for couple-focused products, now matching the popularity of solo items designed exclusively for him or her,” adds Siva.The revolution continues in 2025 While 2024 was the year when sex toys came out of the closet, this revolution is set to continue into this year. Industry leaders anticipate pleasure products becoming even more accessible and mainstream. “First, we’re likely to see an even greater normalisation of pleasure products, with items like massagers and lubricants becoming as common and accessible as everyday wellness products—think toothbrushes or face wash. Additionally, there will be a growing focus on inclusivity and gender equality in the sexual wellness space,” predicts Mangaldas. She also believes that this year more people will understand that these tools are not just about physical pleasure, but about fostering better intimacy, comfort, and connection with themselves and their partners. Some of the trends, according to Gupta, to watch out for include:
Tech integration: Expect advancements in connected devices with customisable options and features to enhance user experience.
Educational content: Brands will continue to ramp up sex education initiatives to normalise sexual wellness and empower consumers. More creators will follow suit, as will the increased representation of sex in OTT content.
Accessibility: Tier-II and III cities will emerge as significant growth markets as societal taboos continue to erode (PS: There is already a high demand from these areas).

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/what-the-indian-passport-can-learn-from-singapore-the-worlds-most-powerful-2663026-2025-01-11,"Henley Global on Wednesday, January 8, 2025, unveiled its Passport Index, crowning Singapore’s passport as the world’s most powerful once again. While Singapore shared the top spot last year with France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, this year it has reclaimed the throne exclusively, as these countries slipped in the rankings. The title is well-deserved - holders of a Singaporean passport can travel to 195 countries without needing a visa. Over the past eight years, Singapore has consistently ranked in the top two and has remained amongst the top ten for over two decades, solidifying its reputation as a travel powerhouse.

 In comparison, India’s passport is ranked 85th on the latest Henley Passport Index, granting visa-free access to 57 countries. But what gives Singapore’s passport such unrivalled clout, and how has it maintained its dominance over the years? The answer lies in far more than just the colour of its cover. The Passport Index  This year, Singapore has reclaimed its title as the world’s most powerful passport, offering visa-free access to an impressive 195 out of 227 global destinations listed in the Henley Passport Index. This achievement places Singapore firmly ahead of second-ranked Japan, which grants visa-free entry to 193 destinations, including China—a significant milestone since the restoration of travel post-Covid-19 lockdowns. The third spot is shared by a group of EU nations—France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Finland—along with South Korea. Citizens of these countries enjoy visa-free travel to 192 destinations worldwide, underscoring their strong global mobility. Now, if you’re wondering how this agency ranks its countries, let us give you a quick crash course.

 The Henley Passport Index ranks 199 passports by comparing their visa-free access to 227 global destinations. For each destination where no visa is required, the passport earns a score of 1. The same applies if travellers can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) upon entry. If a visa is mandatory, or if travellers must secure a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) or pre-departure authorisation for a visa on arrival, the passport receives a score of 0. In simple terms, a passport’s overall score reflects the total number of destinations it grants access to without requiring a visa, making it a clear measure of global travel freedom. This data, by the way, is exclusively received from International Air Transport Association (IATA). So, when it gives Singapore the ‘strongest passport’ title, it means holding a Singaporean passport can give you the freedom to travel more easily than any other passports. Not only Henley, but organisations and reports that also show the same. For instance, the passport index has also ranked Singapore’s passports in the top 10 for 2025. How is Singapore’s passport the strongest? How does a country make its passport strong and travel easy for its citizens? Well, there are various reasons.  Global mobility
Singapore’s passport is unmatched in global mobility, offering visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 195 out of 227 destinations. This exceptional reach allows Singaporeans to travel with ease, whether for business or leisure, making it a symbol of unparalleled international freedom. As Manoj Dharmani, CEO of DUDigital Global, a company specialising in visa facilitation, tells India Today, “Singapore's passport has emerged as the world's most powerful travel document.” Strategic diplomatic relations
At the heart of Singapore’s passport strength lies its robust diplomatic relations. The country has forged extensive bilateral and multilateral partnerships, ensuring visa waivers and simplified entry procedures with numerous nations. Louis D’Souza, a travel expert and the director of Tamarind Global, explains, “Singapore’s emphasis on diplomatic ties, economic strength, and its status as a global hub for trade and tourism play pivotal roles in sustaining its passport power.” These strong alliances have earned Singapore a high degree of international trust, translating directly into greater travel freedom for its citizens. Consistent economic stability
Singapore’s consistent economic growth and political stability have significantly enhanced its passport’s global standing. A strong and reliable economy reassures other nations, leading to more open visa policies for Singaporean passport holders.

 “Through years of careful diplomacy, economic success, and stable governance, Singapore has transformed its little red passport into a golden ticket for global travel and thus international trust,” says Dharmani. Commitment to security and integrity
The integrity of Singapore’s passport is another cornerstone of its strength. Rigorous issuance processes and state-of-the-art security features make forgery nearly impossible, earning global confidence. This commitment to security ensures smoother immigration processes and fewer travel restrictions for its citizens. This brings us to another next point.  Advanced biometric technology
In 2006, Singapore was one of the first to launch a biometric visa. These e-passports contain embedded microchips storing personal data like digital photographs and fingerprints, making them both secure and efficient.  Biometric passports streamline immigration procedures, especially at e-gates in major airports, ensuring faster and more reliable border clearance. This technological edge further bolsters its passport’s reputation. PS: India first launched biometric passports, in 2008 as a pilot project, initially only issuing them to diplomatic passport holders. How can India do better? Both Singapore and India are Asian countries, but if you’re an Indian and have ever applied for a Schengen or US visa, you know that the struggle is real. Visa rejections often impact a lot of our travel plans. This year's data shows that India’s passport is ranked 85th globally. This marks a slip of 5 positions since the last year.  However, Dharmani notes that India's passport tells a different story – one of gradual change and untapped potential. “Currently ranked 85th globally, India's position on the passport power index reflects both its challenges and opportunities. The Covid-19 pandemic dealt a significant blow, pushing India's ranking down to 90th in 2021 from its previous high of 71st in 2006,” he notes. 

 



A stronger passport means more freedom to travel to various countries. Photo: Unsplash
 But there’s still scope for change, according to experts. Here are some ways that both experts suggest: 
Strengthen diplomatic relations
 Experts suggest that India must expand its network of bilateral agreements, aiming for more visa waiver deals with key countries. By boosting diplomatic ties and fostering mutual trust, Indian travellers can benefit from easier global access.
Promote inbound tourism
 Another step can be simplifying visa regimes for international tourists. This can create reciprocal agreements with other countries. A welcoming policy towards foreign travellers often encourages similar concessions for Indian passport holders.
Enhance infrastructure and governance
 Streamlining bureaucratic processes and ensuring consistent foreign policies are essential. As D’Souza mentions, “Addressing internal challenges like bureaucracy and focusing on key sectors like tourism, technology, and trade can enhance India’s global reputation.”
Focus on economic growth and stability
 Even though India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, experts suggest that economic success and political stability are key drivers of international trust. A stronger economy can reassure other nations, making them more inclined to offer visa-free access to Indian travellers. “A stronger Indian passport will make international travel more accessible for citizens and also elevate India’s standing on the global scale. This path is challenging, but Singapore’s success shows us that the vision and commitment is achievable,” D’Souza concludes.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 11, 2025Must Watch

Hollywood celebrities like Tom Hanks, Bella Hadid, and Emma Watson have openly shared their struggles with something called Impostor Syndrome—the persistent feeling of not truly deserving their achievements, even at the peak of their success. Back here in Bollywood, Shefali Shah revealed in an interview with NDTV last year that she struggles with low self-esteem. “I feel I have Impostor Syndrome, and I genuinely have very low self-esteem,” said the actress. When these words come from someone who has won a National Award and was also nominated for the International Emmys, it really shows how this behavioural pattern can make you feel limited.

 



Imposter Syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as frauds. (Photo: Unsplash)
 Similarly, Manoj Bajpayee told Mid-Day about his battle with Imposter Syndrome, admitting it made him feel “guilty” about his success. He credited fellow actor Akshaye Khanna with helping him overcome these negative thoughts. There could be a plethora of reasons why this feeling of being an “imposter” can creep into someone, but what comes across as very problematic is the feeling of not being good enough, which is increasingly fuelled by social media. But first, let’s understandWhat is Imposter Syndrome? Imposter Syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as frauds. It’s like getting an A+ on a test but still feeling like you cheated your way through. People dealing with it often think of their success as ""just luck"" or that they’ve somehow tricked everyone into believing that they’re capable. And the wild part? An individual struggling with Imposter Syndrome may get more successful with time, but their pessimist thought process could still be challenging their accomplishments. Interestingly, a review article published in the International Journal of Behavioural Science suggests that around 70 per cent of people will experience Imposter Syndrome at some point in their lives. It’s particularly prevalent in competitive environments, like academia, corporate workplaces, or creative industries, where external validation often overshadows personal achievements.How social media acts as a trigger Dr Rahul Chandhok, head consultant of mental health and behavioural science at Artemis Hospital Gurgaon, highlights how social media inflates Imposter syndrome by presenting idealised versions of life. “Social media inflates the effect of Imposter Syndrome by always providing ideal versions of others’ lives and achievements to you. Constant exhibition of these packaged highlights makes any individual feel inappropriately mediocre despite their actual accomplishments,” explains Dr Chandhok. “The pressure to meet the unrealistic standards set by influencers and peers leads to self-doubt and the belief that success is undeserved. The lack of context behind posts also creates a distorted reality, which can heighten feelings of failure. This digital environment fosters perfectionism because individuals fear judgement or rejection, which further fuels Imposter Syndrome. Mindful consumption and limiting comparisons are crucial for maintaining self-esteem in the social media era,” he adds.

The demographics most affected Certain groups are more vulnerable to social media-induced Imposter Syndrome than others. Psychologist Sumalatha Vasudeva from Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, explains, “Teenagers and young adults are particularly susceptible because they are still developing their identities and heavily rely on peer validation.” Child psychologist Riddhi Doshi Patel echoes this sentiment, and tells India Today, “Teenagers constantly compare themselves to the filtered realities on social media, leading to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.” This constant comparison to others’ curated lives - reels filled with achievements, vacations, and picture-perfect moments - warps their sense of reality. Instead of focusing on their own accomplishments, many end up feeling like they’re falling short. Adding to this is the fear of missing out (FOMO). Patel notes, “Constant updates on social media can create a sense of FOMO, making teens believe they’re missing out on exciting experiences.” The obsession with likes, comments, and follower counts only deepens this insecurity. But it’s not just teenagers who are at risk. Women in professional and academic spaces often experience higher levels of Imposter Syndrome due to societal pressures and gender biases. Creative and competitive professionals are also prone, as their industries often tie success to public recognition, Vasudeva points out. Additionally, marginalised groups face unique challenges, as systemic biases and stereotypes are frequently magnified in online spaces, adding another layer to the struggle.Combat mode on While social media can be overwhelming, there are ways to mitigate its negative impact, experts reiterate:
Curate your feed: Follow accounts that promote authenticity and positivity, avoiding those that trigger comparisons.
Limit screen time: Set boundaries to reduce overexposure to curated content.
Practice self-compassion: Remind yourself that social media often highlights the best moments and omits struggles.
Focus on personal goals: Shift your attention from external validation to internal growth and achievements.
Keep a journal: Document your accomplishments to recognise your progress and celebrate milestones.
Open up: Discuss feelings of self-doubt with trusted friends or a therapist for perspective.
Take breaks: Periodic social media detoxes can help recalibrate your self-perception and reconnect with reality.

fed03df4-704d-47b5-b8e7-d77589db87b4,"55% of Indians are left wanting more sex: SurveyA recent survey involving over 10,000 respondents has revealed startling insights into modern relationships and intimacy.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/55-of-indians-are-left-wanting-more-sex-survey-2664085-2025-01-13,"What’s happening behind closed doors in India’s bedrooms? A lot—and yet, not enough. A recent survey, Laid in India 2025 by MyMuse (a bedroom wellness brand), has sparked conversations about the evolving state of intimacy across the country. The survey, which drew insights from over 10,000 respondents, offers a refreshingly honest take on modern relationships, revealing surprising truths about how Indians approach love, desire, and connection.What the findings say The findings are as diverse as the country itself. While 87% of Indians no longer wait until marriage to explore intimacy, the survey says nearly 62% expressed a desire to break out of routine and try something new in the bedroom. The report also highlights a growing openness to sexual wellness products, with nearly half of the respondents either using or wanting to explore them. Emotional connection emerged as a critical factor for 87% of participants, showing that it’s not just about the physical—it’s also about meaningful bonds. Despite these progressive shifts, one data stood out: 55% of Indians are left wanting more sex. This dissatisfaction spans across singles, couples, and even married individuals. The data busts myths about marriage as a fix for intimacy issues, with 59% of married respondents admitting they still feel the lack of a thriving sex life. Interestingly, women reported slightly higher dissatisfaction (60%) compared to men (53%), challenging traditional narratives about who is more vocal about their needs.Why though? According to Srishati Singhal, founder of Evolve Beings (community of healers, therapists and seekers), this intimacy deficit stems from deeply rooted socio-cultural factors.
“I believe the statistics might actually be higher than what is reported. There are several factors contributing to this. Indian couples often marry young, leaving little time for exploration. Children usually follow soon after, disrupting intimacy,” she explains.
Another major issue is the lack of privacy, especially since many Indian couples live in joint families. “Even though this is gradually changing in metropolitan cities, the family dynamic often means couples have to be discreet. This constant involvement with family life leaves little time or space for couples to fully embrace their sexuality or maintain an active and fulfilling sex life,” she adds.
Moreover, Singhal feels there is a collective cultural repression around sexuality in India. People don’t learn about sexual intimacy, lovemaking, or tools to keep things exciting, which leads to a monotonous and routine-driven sexual life. Without education and awareness, couples struggle to rekindle passion or put effort into their intimate lives.
Adding to this is the modern lifestyle—busy schedules and constant exhaustion push intimacy to the bottom of the priority list. Often, intimacy is reduced to a quick stress-relief activity at the end of the day, which doesn’t sustain long-term relationships. While this may work in the honeymoon phase, it becomes increasingly difficult as the relationship matures, particularly after having children.
Content creator and sexual wellness expert Bhavjeet Sehgal identifies communication as the critical missing element in Indian relationships. She states, “Intimacy flourishes when partners are open about their desires and fantasies. Without honest communication, relationships stagnate. Women especially face societal judgment, which makes expressing their needs even harder.” Sehgal urges couples to prioritise transparent, judgment-free conversations to foster deeper emotional and physical connections.
Towards an intimate revolution There's no denying that there are problems, but Indians are increasingly willing to explore new avenues for intimacy. The report also highlights that discussions around sexual wellness are gaining acceptance, with nearly 48% eager to try tools that can enhance their experience. Anushka Gupta, co-founder of MyMuse, says, “The report is more than just a snapshot of the country’s sex lives. It doesn’t just point to the desire for more sex; it reflects the broader challenge of creating spaces for connection, experimentation, and communication in relationships.” **The report covers 500+ cities and towns, from Tier 1 metros to smaller Tier 3 regions, which provides a comprehensive look at intimacy across urban and rural India.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 13, 2025Trending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/how-ozempic-zepbound-and-mounjaro-will-transform-indias-weight-loss-market-2664159-2025-01-14,"The world of weight management is evolving at a rapid pace. In India, where weight loss has traditionally been associated with fad diets and intense workouts, the introduction of  injectables like Ozempic, Zepbound, Mounjaro, Wegovy is set to bring about a transformative shift. While these brands have been making waves in the West, trends suggest they will also significantly impact the weight-loss market in India. As of now, these drugs are set to launch in India after receiving the necessary approvals. Amongst these, three drugs are making headlines time and again: Ozempic (which never really left the spotlight), and the comparatively newer players, Zepbound and Mounjaro. But can these injectables really penetrate the Indian markets, or is there a challenge waiting for them? But before getting into that, here’s a quick crash course on these three drugs. What are Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro? Ozempic: The infamous drug that is promoted by well-known faces like Elon Musk, Ozempic contains semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. It works like a mimicker (like a stunt double) that mimics GLP-1, a hormone that regulates blood sugar, enhances insulin secretion, and makes you feel full. This weekly injectable has gained popularity even in India, as many import it from the West.

Zepbound: Contains tirzepatide, which is a dual agonist targeting both the GLP-1 receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. This drug is specifically approved for weight management in adults with obesity with weight-related health conditions such as high blood pressure or obstructive sleep apnoea.This dual action enhances appetite suppression and improves glucose control more effectively than single agonists like Ozempic.  Zepbound: Contains tirzepatide, which is a dual agonist targeting both the GLP-1 receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. This drug is specifically approved for weight management in adults with obesity with weight-related health conditions such as high blood pressure or obstructive sleep apnoea. This dual action enhances appetite suppression and improves glucose control more effectively than single agonists like Ozempic.  Mounjaro: Also contains tirzepatide and shares the same mechanism of action as Zepbound. It is branded for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes but is essentially the same compound as Zepbound. Primarily used for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. While it can also aid in weight loss, its branding focuses on diabetes management. According to Dr Samrat Shah, an internal medicine expert at Apollo Spectra, Pune, “Ozempic helps lower your hunger levels, whereas injectable treatments like Mounjaro and Zepbound significantly target both the appetite and also the way your body stores fat.”  He further explains that while Ozempic is widely recognised for managing Type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro’s dual-action mechanism offers enhanced benefits for those battling both obesity and diabetes.Side effects  While these medications promise effective weight management, they come with their share of side effects. Dr Tushar Tayal, consultant at CK Birla hospital, Gurugram, says, “Both drugs [semaglutide, tirzepatide] carry warnings about potential thyroid tumours, including cancer, observed in animal studies.”  Other side effects also include gaining weight back once they stop taking the medicine. Moreover, some people have mentioned noticing 'Ozempic face' and 'Ozempic butt and body' as these drugs often result in excessive muscle loss along with weight loss.

 



Ozempic comes with side effects. Photo: Unsplash
 Another shortfall of these drugs is the price tag. For instance, one injection of Ozempic is sold somewhere between Rs 9,000-10,000. The impact on the Indian weight loss market These side effects, even though widely circulated, have not deterred people from taking these injectables. In fact, India is likely to see the launch of these drugs by 2025-26. Eli Lilly, a US-based pharmaceutical company, plans to launch Mounjaro in India in 2025, while Novo Nordisk, the company that produces Ozempic, recently shared its plans to launch Wegovy (Ozempic’s equivalent) by 2026. India Today spoke to experts who noted that India’s weight loss market, which has traditionally leaned towards diet plans, Ayurvedic remedies, and fitness regimes, could be revolutionised by the introduction of these scientifically-backed drugs. Numbers also indicate that there could be a huge demand for such drugs (though more affordable ones) due to the rising obesity rates in India. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of Indians who are either overweight or obese. From 25 per cent in 2013, the figure has risen to 40 per cent in 2023.

 Experts agree. Rahul Kamra, a weight loss expert, keto coach, and the founder of Ketorets, tells India Today that with obesity and diabetes on the rise, they offer a scientifically backed solution that could appeal to many. Dr Tushar Tayal, consultant, internal medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, believes that these injectables may lead to increased demand for such treatments, potentially affecting the sales of traditional weight-loss products and altering dietary habits. However, these injectables may face certain challenges once launched in India, according to these experts. The challenges ahead Experts suggest that the challenges these companies will face can be divided into two halves. The first part is the challenges they’ll face before the launch. These include getting regulatory approvals and deciding a price point.  Rahul mentions that approval processes in India can be stringent, delaying market entry. In India, drug approval is overseen by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The process starts with a New Drug Application (NDA) submission, including data on the drug's safety, efficacy, and quality. Clinical trials in India are required to validate its suitability for the local population, in compliance with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and rules. The drug undergoes animal testing before human trials. Detailed documentation and manufacturing facility inspections ensure quality control. The approval process usually takes 12-18 months. The next challenge for these companies is setting a fair price, as these drugs typically cost around Rs 10,000 - 15,000, which is beyond the reach of most Indians. Dr Tayal points out that it is very important to address the high cost of these medications to make them accessible to a broader population.

  Dr Vaishali Naik, a diabetes and endocrinologist at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, on the other hand, suggests that the launch may take time in India due to people being hesitant about trying weight-loss drugs that easily. “These companies may face challenges in making a strong impact in the market as people may be doubtful about the safety of these drugs,” she says.  Post-launch, experts suggest that educating both doctors and patients on the proper use and side effects is crucial, as Indians may still prefer holistic and natural remedies, which could hinder acceptance.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 14, 2025Trending Reel

However, is it even healthy to chase this specific trend in your dating life, or is it simply a harmless pursuit that demands some caution? But first, let’s decode who even qualifies as a ‘golden retriever’ partner.

Essentially, it is all about the traits.Who is a 'golden retriever type' partner? Essentially, it is all about the traits.Who is a 'golden retriever type' partner? Do you have a partner who is mostly jovial, excited and is always showering you with affection? Chances are he/she fits the bill. Affectionate, loyal, playful, optimistic and energetic are the major traits of a ‘golden retriever’ partner. They are consistently supportive, enjoy spending time with their partner, and bring a sense of joy and positivity to a relationship. Just like the dog breed that they are compared to, these people are easy-going, dependable and boast an upbeat demeanour – and all of it makes them highly desirable in the dating world. But why? Well, “People are naturally drawn to individuals who radiate qualities like positivity, loyalty, affection, and unconditional support. A golden retriever-type partner makes you feel adored, appreciated, and prioritised, bringing lightness to life, especially during challenging times. These relationships feel wholesome, dependable, and optimistic, which are highly desirable qualities,” says Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship expert. “The energy created by such partners fosters a safe space for genuine connection and emotional intimacy. Their playful and happy demeanour adds to the dynamics people aspire to have in their relationships. The consistency and emotional support they offer are qualities that many seek in a partner, making this archetype highly attractive,” she adds.A reality check you shouldn't ignore Sounds like the partner of your dreams? Hold on! Time to put down the rose-tinted glasses! Even the most loving and playful partners are not immune to challenges. And when you are dating a ‘golden retriever type’, there are a lot of things to take care of. Firstly, it is to manage your expectations. ""The 'golden retriever type' is often considered the gold standard in dating, but as a partner, it's important to understand that they can't possibly exude this energy 24/7. Unlike the dogs they are compared to, who have a limited set of human stakeholders, your partner likely interacts with far more people. Therefore, it's essential to remember that these individuals may need downtime and space to recharge and bounce back,” says Radhika Mohta, a matchmaker and relationship coach. “The rise of this trend suggests we are drifting towards valuing emotional warmth, loyalty, positivity, consistency, and the availability of a partner in relationships. These qualities reflect a healthy view of love as a secure and fulfilling feeling, which is something everyone should aspire to. However, it's essential to remember that we shouldn't idealise these traits to the point of ignoring the complexities of relationships. People are complex, and relationships inevitably involve negative emotions, complications, and conflicts. While it's important to cultivate these positive qualities, we must also be realistic and prepared to navigate challenges,” adds Ruchi. Basically, you cannot live in the bubble of your partner’s perfection. Relationships require a balance of fun and seriousness, with lightheartedness paired with the depth needed to move forward. “When we solely focus on golden retriever traits, we risk overlooking the fact that relationships also need resilience and emotional intelligence. The inability to work on conflicts and navigate challenges together can be detrimental,” adds Ruchi. “While these traits are valued, additional qualities like emotional intelligence and conflict management are also necessary for a successful relationship,” she adds.As the partner of a 'golden retriever' type, remember... There might also be some red flags you might be overlooking in your ‘golden energy partner’. For instance, their affection can border on clinginess where they prioritise the relationship and avoid difficult conversations. According to relationship experts, conflicts are important for the growth of a relationship. “Negative feelings are inevitable, and it is unrealistic to always maintain a happy, rainbow-like atmosphere,” says Ruchi. Lack of space: Their constant presence and enthusiasm could make their partner feel confined or limited in their social interactions, leading to a lack of personal space. Avoidance of serious issues: Their lighthearted nature may prevent them from addressing serious or deep issues, which are crucial for managing emotional challenges within the relationship. Lack of depth in conversations: Important deep conversations might be neglected, making it difficult to handle emotional challenges effectively. Every relationship, whether it's with a laid-back, golden retriever-type person or someone with a different personality, requires effort and mutual commitment. To nurture a successful relationship with your easy-going partner, keep these key points in mind: Ruchi Ruuh suggests:

 Encouraging your partner to nurture their individuality and autonomy by pursuing activities, hobbies, and friendships outside the relationship. This will help them grow as a person and alleviate some of the weight on your shoulders, bringing balance to the relationship.


 Addressing conflicts and problems openly, ensuring that your partner takes these discussions seriously.


 Embracing imperfection. Nobody is perfect, and understanding your partner's unique personality is key. Look beyond superficial qualities and consider the deeper traits that contribute to a fulfilling relationship.

d37487b0-bac6-4c8d-b40d-8cda100be260,"Los Angeles Wildfires: Truth behind the bizarre theoriesFrom insurance companies to Sean Diddy, conspiracy theories about LA wildfires are spreading like, well, wildfire. But is there any truth to them?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/los-angeles-wildfires-truth-behind-the-bizarre-theories-2664722-2025-01-14,"Fire crews are working tirelessly to contain the wildfires tearing through Los Angeles, as the world watches the dire situation unfolding in the United States’ most populous city. Stronger wind gusts expected in the coming days could further complicate their efforts. These fires, potentially the costliest in US history, have already claimed at least 24 lives, displaced thousands, destroyed over 12,000 structures, and forced 100,000 people—including top Hollywood celebrities—to evacuate.

 



The fires have already claimed at least 24 lives. (Photo: Reuters)
 While government agencies are yet to release official damage estimates, AccuWeather, a weather data and analysis firm, projects the total damages and economic losses to range between $250 billion and $275 billion, according to The Guardian. Meanwhile, the cause of the fires remains under investigation. This uncertainty has made the crisis fertile ground for conspiracy theories. Despite lacking credible evidence, these theories have gained traction on social media, fuelling widespread misinformation and diverting attention from the ongoing firefighting efforts.Conspiracy theories afloat Social media is flooded with conspiracy theories suggesting that there’s more to the story. Videos and supposed “proof” suggest it was more of an orchestrated move than being a by-product of climate change, but is it? President-elect Donald Trump blamed the Democratic Party, while Elon Musk, attributed it to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. The claims are too many, but are the reasons good enough? Let’s find out: Insurance cancellation months ahead of ‘wildfires’ In the months leading up to the devastating Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025, several major insurance companies, including State Farm (insurance company), cancelled numerous homeowners' policies in high-risk areas such as Pacific Palisades. In July 2024, State Farm alone dropped about 1,600 policies in this region. These cancellations left many residents without coverage just before the catastrophic fires erupted, exacerbating the financial and emotional toll on affected homeowners. Besides State Farm, major insurers have reduced their coverage in California, and several others have followed suit. This has caused quite a hullabaloo on social media where they blamed the insurance company behind the fires or at least they knew about it. Watch some of the conspiracy theorists talk about their assumptions on the fire:

 What’s the truth? One of the main reasons why many insurance companies cancelled their policies or failed to renew them is because of the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires, leading to unsustainable losses. Companies like Allstate and Farmers Insurance Group have also reduced their presence in the state, citing rising risks and regulatory challenges. Data from the California Department of Insurance shows that between 2020 and 2022, 2.8 million homeowner policies were not renewed statewide, with over 500,000 affected in Los Angeles County alone. The Los Angeles wildfires are a recurring natural disaster fuelled by a combination of factors, including dry weather, strong Santa Ana winds, and dense vegetation that acts as tinder. Over the years, these fires have caused widespread devastation, displacing thousands of residents, destroying homes, and threatening iconic neighbourhoods. State Farm told Euronews Green that it is handling claims for over 5,700 homes and vehicles related to the LA fires. “California’s insurance market is uniquely complex, but we remain engaged with state officials to improve the availability of insurance for residents,” says a spokesperson. Fires deliberately set for ‘Agenda 2030’ and smart cities In recent years, Los Angeles has pursued the SmartLA 2028 initiative, aiming to enhance urban living through advanced technologies. This strategy focuses on improving infrastructure, transportation, and public services to create a more efficient and sustainable city. However, a conspiracy theory claims that California fires were deliberately set to clear land for smart city development under the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Some social media posts suggest that Los Angeles is part of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) smart city list. These claims draw comparisons to the wildfires in Lahaina, Maui, implying a link between wildfires and smart city initiatives in these areas. Another claim suggests that the fires were started intentionally as a part of a ""criminal land grab"" to build the smart city.

— The Patriot Voice (@TPV_John) January 8, 2025 What’s the truth? PolitiFact debunked these claims, confirming Los Angeles is not on the WEF's list, and smart city development focuses on enhancing infrastructure, not destruction. The fires are attributed to dry conditions and strong winds, with no evidence supporting a deliberate land-grab theory. As a part of the SmartLA 2028 initiative, it doesn’t propose rebuilding the entire city but rather adding technology to improve the lives of its residents. To cover-up Sean Diddy’s horrific crimes One particularly outlandish theory ties the Los Angeles wildfires to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. The speculation claims that the fires may have been orchestrated to erase evidence of alleged misconduct linked to Diddy’s infamous gatherings. Adding fuel to the conspiracy is the fact that Diddy’s Holmby Hills mansion reportedly remained unscathed, even as neighbouring properties suffered significant damage. Diddy facing numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Some theorists allege the existence of a so-called “Diddy list,” purportedly naming celebrities who were frequent attendees at his controversial events. There are also rumours that state that underground tunnels allegedly connect Diddy’s mansion to nearby estates, including high-profile properties like the Playboy Mansion and Michael Jackson’s former home. These tunnels are speculated to have been used for illicit activities, though no credible evidence has surfaced to confirm their existence.

24eb3961-e947-4959-8e73-74f0f6117816,Is Northeast India finally getting its due as a travel destination?Both experts and data highlight a growing preference amongst travellers for the Northeast as a travel destination.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/is-northeast-india-finally-getting-its-due-as-a-travel-destination-2664776-2025-01-15,"For decades, Northeast India remained a well-kept secret, tucked away in the farthest corner of the country. As someone from this region, it was no surprise when people would ask me where exactly is that after I mentioned Assam. In fact, sarcastic comments like “Assam is not a part of India” were unfortunately not uncommon.To the changing times The Northeast is home to mesmerising landscapes, a vibrant food scene, and rich traditions. Yet, the seven sisters and a brother (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim) often took a backseat in India’s tourism narrative. But times are changing. Travellers are finally discovering the charm of this region—and for all the right reasons. In a recent report by The New York Times, Assam has been named the 4th must-visit destination in the world. The report highlights Assam as a crowd-free region that is gaining international recognition and witnessing improved accessibility. Another report, the 'Travel Trends Report 2025' released by the travel platform Skyscanner, identified Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya, as the most popular destination for Indian travellers this year. This trend suggests that not only are Indians exploring the Northeast, but the region is also becoming a favourite amongst foreign visitors. Post-pandemic, there has been significant growth in interest and demand for travel to the northeastern states. In fact, data shows that the region has not only recovered to pre-pandemic travel levels but has also surpassed them.  According to provisional data from the Ministry of Tourism, the Government of India, 118.45 lakh domestic visitors travelled to the northeastern states in 2022, compared to 95 lakh in 2019. For foreign tourists, the numbers stood at 1.04 lakh in 2022, compared to 3.6 lakh in 2019. This upward trend appears to be continuing, with further increases expected.

Experts seem to agree.Vaibhav Kala, a travel expert, founder of Aquaterra Adventures, and senior VP, of the Adventure Tour Operators Association of India shares with India Today that northeast tourism is set to arrive in the coming decade. According to him, every tourism effort progresses through the stages of discovery of USP, awareness, connectivity challenges, lack of infrastructure, capacity building, etc and these stages are en route to completion, which will herald a new era for tourism in the Northeast.Sanjar Imam, the co-founder at Panache World, a luxury trip curator, tells us that travel to the Northeastern region is increasing and has made a recovery from the pandemic, as people are opting to visit more off beat places than the regular famous ones.  But what caused this change? Let’s have a look at some of the reasons. Better connectivity All the experts that we spoke to credited better connectivity to the Northeastern region as one of the major reasons why the region is seeing a hike in tourism. Rikant Pittie, CEO and Co-Founder of EaseMyTrip tells India Today that this surge is attributed to improved infrastructure, enhanced connectivity, and government initiatives like the Swadesh Darshan and PRASHAD schemes, which have developed holistic tourism destinations based on sustainable and responsible tourism principles. advertisementSchemes like UDAN (UdeDesh ka Aam Nagrik), increased connectivity in the region via air. For other modes of transportation, the Ministry of Northeastern Development has to be credited for better road and railway connectivity. The Ministry of Railways in March 2023 press release said that during the year 2021-22, 14 new line projects covering a total length of 1,181 kms have been planned/sanctioned/executed out of which, 361 kms have been commissioned, all in the Northeastern Region (NER).

Experts decode the better pick for your skinThere's a growing buzz online about ravinage, a plant-based alternative to retinol, being better for your skin. But is there any truth to the claims? We turned to experts to help dissect the facts.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/ravinage-over-retinol-experts-decode-the-better-pick-for-your-skin-2665447-2025-01-16,"The world of skincare is ever-evolving - or at least it feels that way. You hop onto a skincare trend, and poof, it vanishes, replaced by a new one, creating a never-ending loop. One such skincare staple that has stood the test of time, particularly in Millennials (and increasingly some Gen Zs) routines, is retinol. This ultimate skincare ingredient is celebrated for its ability to combat ageing, acne, and skin pigmentation. If you are into skincare - or even just dipping your toes into it - you have likely heard of retinol. But now, bakuchiol, popularly referred to as ""ravinage,"" is creating a buzz as a gentler, plant-based alternative. While there is plenty of excitement surrounding this new ingredient, the big question remains: should you swap your trusty retinol for ravinage just yet?The basics: Retinol vs. Ravinage Retinol and ravinage are powerhouse skincare ingredients, but they cater to different needs and skin types. Retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, has long been celebrated as the gold standard for addressing wrinkles, fine lines, acne, and uneven skin texture. Ravinage, by contrast, is a gentler, plant-based alternative often likened to bakuchiol or other natural actives. It offers similar anti-ageing and brightening benefits but without the irritation that retinol can sometimes cause.   Retinols potency in treating severe acne and advanced signs of ageing. (Photo: Unsplash)Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant aesthetic physician at Gleneagles Hospital Bengaluru, explains that while retinol and ravinage improve skin texture, boost collagen production, and target wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, their mechanisms differ. ""Retinol binds to retinoid receptors to accelerate cell turnover and stimulate collagen synthesis,"" she notes.Meanwhile, ravinage achieves comparable results through alternative pathways, offering a gentler approach without the dryness or irritation often linked to retinol. Dr Garima Tyagi, a dermatologist at SENS Clinic, highlights that ravinage, derived from the Psoralea corylifolia plant, is rich in antioxidants. ""This makes it not only effective against signs of ageing but also helpful in combating pollution-induced skin damage, all while being safe for sensitive skin,"" she adds.Targeted skin concerns Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant aesthetic physician at Gleneagles Hospital Bengaluru, explains that while retinol and ravinage improve skin texture, boost collagen production, and target wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, their mechanisms differ. ""Retinol binds to retinoid receptors to accelerate cell turnover and stimulate collagen synthesis,"" she notes. Meanwhile, ravinage achieves comparable results through alternative pathways, offering a gentler approach without the dryness or irritation often linked to retinol. Dr Garima Tyagi, a dermatologist at SENS Clinic, highlights that ravinage, derived from the Psoralea corylifolia plant, is rich in antioxidants. ""This makes it not only effective against signs of ageing but also helpful in combating pollution-induced skin damage, all while being safe for sensitive skin,"" she adds.Targeted skin concerns Each ingredient caters to specific skin issues:Retinol: Best for fine lines, deep wrinkles, acne, and pronounced hyperpigmentation.Ravinage: Ideal for mild pigmentation, early signs of ageing, and individuals with sensitive or reactive skin. Dr Shitij Goel, HOD of dermatology at Shardacare-Health City, highlights retinols potency in treating severe acne and advanced signs of ageing. On the other hand, ravinage, with its anti-inflammatory properties, is ideal for sensitive or reactive skin. However, retinols strength often comes with side effects, including dryness, peeling, and redness, which can be challenging for those with sensitive skin. Ravinage provides a gentler alternative. ""Ravinage doesnt cause the dryness or irritation often seen with retinol,"" explains Dr Ruby Sachdev. Dr Garima Tyagi agrees, recommending ravinage for individuals prone to allergies or skin reactions.Long-term benefits and safety Both ingredients offer significant long-term anti-ageing benefits when used properly. Retinol, backed by decades of research, improves skin texture, reduces wrinkles, and fights acne. However, improper use can lead to irritation, dryness, and increased sun sensitivity, especially without proper sun protection. Ravinage, on the other hand, provides similar anti-ageing and brightening effects but with a gentler touch. ""Studies show its safety and effectiveness for sensitive skin,"" notes Dr Goel, though he adds that more rigorous testing is still needed to match retinol's extensive research history. While retinol may deliver faster and more dramatic results, particularly for severe concerns, ravinage stands out as a reliable, soothing alternative for those seeking long-term benefits without potential side effects. However, irrespective of what you choose, consistency and proper application are important to reaping lasting results.Trend or game-changer? Ravinages rise as a natural alternative aligns with the clean beauty movement. ""Its gentle nature and plant-based origin make it appealing,"" says Dr Tyagi. Dr Goel, on the other hand, believes its more than a trend, describing it as a game-changer ingredient for inclusive skincare. While ravinage is unlikely to replace retinol, its carving its niche. ""As both ingredients address distinct needs,"" says Dr. Sachdev. Retinol remains unmatched for serious conditions, while ravinage shines for sensitive skin and for those who want to take the natural route for flawless skin.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 16, 2025",lifestyle,2025-01-16T08:16:00,22.1,5.3

In 2016, the band performed in India for the first time at the Global Citizen Festival in Mumbai. But that was part of a larger initiative with a strong focus on global causes like poverty eradication, gender equality, and education.

 Fast forward to 2025, and Coldplay is set to return to India with their Music of the Spheres World Tour - a performance that is galaxies apart from their previous visit, in more ways than one. While their 2016 performance at the Global Citizen Festival was part of a multi-artist charity event, Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres tour is a full-circle moment, entirely centred around them. This time, fans can expect an unparalleled and immersive experience dedicated solely to their music and vision. The band’s setlist, production, and captivating themes draw directly from their ninth studio album, and it promises an unforgettable journey through sound and emotion. Social media has already ignited excitement, with viral Instagram Reels giving fans a glimpse into what’s in store - a concert experience like no other, filled with mesmerising visuals, heart-stirring performances, and unforgettable moments. A spectacle of sound, light, and technology Besides their vast playlist that boasts songs about love, loss, hope and joy, Coldplay concerts are often touted as “an experience of a lifetime” for their spectacular sound and light theatrics, not to mention their mind-blowing cutting-edge technology.

 With their Music of the Spheres tour, the band has taken live performances to a new level with interactive wristbands, stunning augmented reality visuals (the moon glasses have all our hearts), and larger-than-life stage designs. Each concert feels like stepping into a cosmic wonderland, with vibrant lights synchronised to the music and planetary-themed visuals enhancing the narrative of their album.

 This level of immersive production was absent in their 2016 performance, where the focus was more on their music and their role in the Global Citizen campaign. With Music of the Spheres, Coldplay is delivering a deeply curated concert experience that brings their celestial vision to life across the world (and we are assuming the magic to happen in India too). Sustainability at its core If your carbon footprint concerns you, you will be happy to know Music of the Spheres tour has sustainability at its core. Coldplay has taken significant steps to reduce the carbon footprint of their tour, including the use of renewable energy, solar-powered stages, and biodegradable confetti. The tour also encourages fans to travel sustainably, which is especially relevant in a densely populated country like India. India’s love for concerts is on the rise Over the past decade, global stars like Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, and U2 have performed in India, marking the nation’s emergence as a hotspot for international music events. In 2023, India also welcomed the iconic Lollapalooza music festival, drawing massive crowds and cementing its place on the global concert map. With Coldplay returning to the country for their Music of the Spheres World Tour this year, the love for concerts is reaching a crescendo (the calender will vouch for it). This could also mean bigger international stars making their way to India, which wasn't the case even two-three years ago. So, if you have a ticket to Coldplay’s Mumbai (or Ahmedabad) concert, consider yourself lucky—your journey to A Sky Full of Stars is officially beginning soon.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 16, 2025Trending Reel

Imagine chopped tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños, and seasoned chicken, topped with dressings like guacamole, salsa, sour cream, or mayonnaise. Drooling already? Thanks to its tantalising appeal, this trend has made its way from the West and has gone viral in India as well. Think of it like a chaat, but with chips instead of the regular murmura or papdi. Or, loaded nachos...but on the go (and with crisps of your choice). This BYOC (Bring Your Own Chips) trend is sweeping across several Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, and Surat. Premium restaurants as well as street food vendors are embracing it. Even Lay’s India jumped on the fad and recently launched their first food truck in Delhi to highlight creative and delicious ways to enjoy their range of chips.

 Ever made Kurkure Chaat at home? If you have, you know it’s an explosion of flavours that’s simply irresistible! “This trend is known as ‘walking tacos.’ People love it because it combines convenience, customisation, and bold flavours. The ability to personalise their tacos with a variety of toppings and sauces makes it a fun and interactive dining experience,” says Karan Wasan, owner of Grapi, a Delhi eatery specialising in coffee and Italian cuisine.

 His restaurant is one of the pioneers of the BYOC trend in India, going viral across social media platforms for making this unique concept widely accessible. Wasan introduced the concept in November at his restaurant, with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian toppings for Rs 200 and Rs 230 respectively. “Customers can choose from classic options like salsa, guacamole, sour cream, and shredded cheese, as well as unique toppings like pickled jalapeños, corn relish, and chipotle crema. For those looking for healthier options, we provide low-fat Greek yoghurt, fresh veggies, and a variety of greens. Our menu also includes gluten-free and vegan-friendly toppings to accommodate dietary preferences,” Wasan shares.

 



BYOC customisation at Grapi, New Delhi.
Does it make your packet of chips healthier? Since a lot of fresh vegetables and chicken are added to chips, many think it is a healthier way to eat your chips. Priya Paliwal, Chief Dietician, Dietetics, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Delhi, explains: “On the positive side, you are adding lean proteins, fibre-rich vegetables, and healthy fats that can enhance the nutritional value of chips. Instead of just having a packet full of calories, you're getting some amount of vitamins, protein and fibre.” However, experts also have a word of caution. Many tend to go overboard with sauces and mayonnaise while getting their chips customised.  “It may seem like a healthier option, but it's not. It's important to remember that the base is still a packet of chips, which are high in calories, salt, and unhealthy fats. Adding chicken might boost the protein content, but if it's cooked in unhealthy oils, it can negate any potential benefits,” adds Simrat Kathuria, CEO and Head Dietitian at The Diet Xperts. “It would be wiser to add lots of vegetables as a damage controller, which brings the goodness of fibre. Then eggs and chicken can be added to up the trend game with lean proteins. The loophole, however, is the addition of sauces, creams, and mayonnaise,” adds Karishmma Chawla, Functional Medicine Nutritionist and Lifestyle Educator. Experts warn that loading up on sauces like mayonnaise can significantly increase the calorie, sugar, and unhealthy fat content, leading to weight gain and a higher risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. The high levels of unhealthy fats, salt, and sugar can also negatively impact gut health, potentially causing digestive issues and other health problems.What to keep in mind Even if you are adding veggies and protein to your chips, “keep it only as a cheat meal,” suggests Chawla. Moreover, balance it by eating healthier food throughout the day. Furthermore, the addition of a heavy amount of unhealthy and processed sauces is definitely a bad idea. Consider replacing those with healthier alternatives like hummus, guacamole or dips prepared with yoghurt. “Your dips can be made from hung curd with herbs and spring onions or sesame tahini. The key is to avoid high-sugar and high-fat sauces or dips that may not be well-tolerated by your gut,” says Chawla. For a healthier twist, Paliwal suggests opting for baked and whole grain chips, makhana or homemade vegetable chips. “Now you can pair these with fresh toppings like grilled chicken & veggies and yoghurt-based sauces,” she says. Remember, moderation is your best friend when it comes to enjoying chips – with or without healthy toppings.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 17, 2025ALSO READ |  Virat Kohli's chhole bhature next to a wrap cart in Delhi, Indian street food is getting a health upgradeTrending Reel

For many, as the golden years approach, it could mean spending their retirement in serene overseas locations, basking in the sun, and enjoying a slower pace of life. But what if we told you that this aspiration can be achieved through retirement visas - specialised permits designed for retirees who wish to reside in foreign countries?  These visas not only allow people to live abroad but often come with additional benefits that enhance the retirement experience.‘The chill visa’ The retirement visa is not a new concept. In fact, it has been around for quite a while but has gained popularity recently, as more people gravitate towards slow living and retirement abroad. Interestingly, the first country to introduce a formal retirement visa programme was Costa Rica. This Central American nation established its retirement visa, known as the Pensionado Visa, in the early 1980s. The Pensionado Visa allows retirees with a stable pension income to reside in Costa Rica, making it a pioneer in offering such a dedicated visa for retirees.

However, just two years before he died, this ""hypothetical"" acid was first prepared in 1851 by German chemist Adolph Strecker and Russian chemist Nikolai Nikolaevich Sokolov in the lab. Over the years, glycolic acid was used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent. In nature, glycolic acid comes from sugarcane and can be found in some fruits like grapes and vegetables like beets. But it was only in 1992 that this acid entered the cosmetic industry when Avon launched the ANEW skincare line containing glycolic acid. The viral acid  If there’s one active ingredient that has made its way into every beauty enthusiast’s social media feed (guilty), it has to be glycolic acid. Not only for the face, but this skincare ingredient is going viral for its multi-purpose usage. This AHA, which is more useful than your BFF’s advice, is known to have various benefits like:
Lightening dark underarms, knees, and elbows
Helping with dandruff removal
Getting rid of strawberry legs
Acting as a deodorant
Boosting collagen
Brightening your skin
Acne 
 Another reason why it went viral, is that it’s recommended not only by influencers but also by dermatologists on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Recently, it has gained hype in India as well.

 Today, you can find glycolic acid everywhere. From big brands to pharmacy brands, it’s now available all around India.But how does glycolic acid work? Glycolic acid is a potent alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) known for its exfoliating and collagen-boosting properties. Dr Ruben Bhasin Passi, consultant, dermatology, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, explains, ""It works by dissolving the glue that binds dead skin cells together, allowing them to slough off.""  Dr Trupti Agarwal, a consultant of dermatology at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital tells India Today that this process promotes cell turnover, which helps with skin renewal. By removing the outer layer of dead skin, glycolic acid uncovers a brighter, more even skin tone and encourages collagen production, which is crucial for youthful skin.

 But can glycolic acid really solve all your skincare and body care woes? We broke down each benefit of the acid with expert inputs:What do experts have to say? Exfoliation and texture improvement ""Glycolic acid penetrates deeply to exfoliate and promote smoother skin,"" says Dr Agarwal. Its ability to break the bonds between dead skin cells enhances cell turnover, leading to a renewed, brighter complexion. A 2013 scientific review also shows that the effectiveness of glycolic acid as a chemical peel can help to deal with acne, due to its exploitation properties. However, according to the study, stronger concentration usage (than what we get in our serums) should be done under expert supervision. A May 2020 study also says the same.  Collagen stimulation  Dr Aparna Santhanam, a Mumbai-based dermatologist, shares, ""Glycolic acid stimulates fibroblast activity (it is a kind of cell that produces collagen), increasing collagen production. This not only improves firmness but also reduces fine lines over time."" Brightening and evening skin tone  Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist, and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics, Mumbai, says, ""It helps even out skin tone, and tackles signs of ageing such as dark spots and wrinkles by deeply penetrating the skin."" Hyperpigmentation and dark spots  Dr Agarwal explains, ""glycolic acid inhibits the tyrosinase enzyme (It is an enzyme that controls the production of melanin, the pigment that gives colour to skin, hair, and eyes), reducing melanin production. This makes it effective for treating hyperpigmentation, melasma, and post-inflammatory marks.""

 Deodorant use  Dr Santhanam explains, ""Glycolic acid lowers skin pH, preventing odour-causing bacteria from thriving."" The above-mentioned May 2020 study further shows that this bacteria-killing feature can help prevent odour.  Strawberry legs The dark spots or bumps on the legs, often caused by ingrown hair, can benefit from glycolic acid’s exfoliating properties. It helps to clear clogged pores and smooth out the skin’s appearance. Dark neck, knees, and elbows  Dr Agarwal says these areas tend to have thicker skin that can darken over time due to friction or build-up of dead skin cells. Applying glycolic acid can help fade hyperpigmentation and create a more even skin tone. Side effects While glycolic acid is effective, it is not without potential drawbacks. Some of the potential side effects include: 
Redness   
Burning   
Dryness   
Peeling   
Increased sun sensitivity 
How to add it to your skincare routine For choosing the right product, Dr Rinky Kapoor suggests, ""Start with a glycolic acid toner, serum, or cream at a lower concentration, such as 5-10%. Gradually increase usage as your skin tolerates it."" Application steps
Cleanse: Begin with a clean, dry face.
Apply: Use a thin layer of glycolic acid product, avoiding the eye area.
Moisturise: Follow with a hydrating product to balance the effects.
Protect: Always use sunscreen during the day to guard against UV damage.
 PS: This glycolic acid is also used in the chemical peel facials (20-70 per cent) that you can avail at clinics. Don't forget to: 
Start with a patch test to rule out irritation.
Combine glycolic acid with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid to balance its effects.
Remember...
Avoid combining it with other potent actives like retinoids, vitamin C, or benzoyl peroxide in the same routine to prevent irritation.
Limit use during pregnancy unless advised by a dermatologist.
Bottomline Glycolic acid is a game-changer in skincare due to its exfoliative, hydrating, and rejuvenating properties. Whether you’re addressing body concerns like dark knees or strawberry legs or facial issues like acne or pigmentation, this powerhouse ingredient delivers excellent results when used correctly. But, experts suggest that you should always balance its use with proper hydration and sun protection to maximise benefits and minimise risks.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 18, 2025

It can be some vague posts about not being loved, a selfie from a hospital, targeted quotes, or just a string of sad songs. While it is normal for people to express their pain on social media, when they present an exaggerated picture through their posts with the mere intention of seeking attention or gaining sympathy, it is called ‘sadfishing’.

Those with low self-esteem or an inadequate offline support system are also more prone to practising this trend. “Gaining attention or sympathy is the major reason why people do it. Sometimes, however, teenagers may also do it to boast to their friends that they can fool society or that many people are concerned about them,” shares Dr Rajiv Mehta, Vice-Chairperson (Psychiatry), Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi. The increased dependence on digital platforms to build social media connections is also a reason why people indulge in sadfishing.

 “Humans are social animals, and they always expect society to be around. But as we are progressing more into the 21st century, they are becoming lonelier. The virtual world has become the real world; to beat that loneliness and to ventilate their feelings, people share such posts on the Internet,” adds Dr Mehta. According to him, individuals with borderline personality traits or those with fewer social friends than virtual friends, and people mostly glued to the digital world, are more likely to sadfish on social media. Such people are also more prone to anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Do you know sadfishing has also been used by several celebrities as a marketing move? In 2019, Kendall Jenner posted about her struggle with acne, and it eventually turned out to be part of a marketing campaign. It was then that the term sadfishing was coined as a journalist with Metro used it in her piece covering the marketing stunt. Sadfishing is also common in relationships. It is mostly present when direct communication is weak between partners, indicating a lack of emotional safety or trust.

 “It could look like posting exaggerated emotional struggles online instead of communicating directly with a partner,” says Ruchi Ruuh. Turning to social media for sympathy can create unnecessary misunderstandings within the relationship. In some cases, sadfishing can actually be beneficial as it helps find support and can help mental health when the person is also actively working towards finding a solution to their issue. It can also provide an outlet or temporary relief to genuinely distressed people. “In other cases, it could become a mechanism to bypass the real issues and seek real solutions through professional help. It can make individuals dependent on vague external validation. Regular sadfishing can lead to backlash, scepticism, or bullying. This can worsen the feelings of rejection and isolation,” says Ruuh.Is there a way to identify sadfishing, though? A series of emotional posts can at times be a cry for help as well. In case you are really confused and concerned, it is better to talk to the person. “The idea is not to shame someone who's struggling but also not to get manipulated by it. Genuine cries for help often lead to actionable steps like seeking support, while attention-seeking posts may lack follow-through,” says Ruuh. Meanwhile, she also shares some ways you can identify if someone is sadfishing on social media:

 Posts often lack clear details or context about the issue and look empty and vague.


 Regular dramatic or overly emotional posts without any actionable solutions. The posts seem unauthentic and lack substance.


 Posts seem designed to attract comments or reactions rather than genuinely seeking help.


 The issues seem unserious when they are followed by happy posts or them partying or chilling with friends.

Dealing with sadfishing Dealing with sadfishers, especially when you are unsure of their intent, can be tricky. You don’t want to hurt someone but at the same time don’t want to be manipulated. The first attempt, experts say, should be to talk to the person and understand the intensity of the incident/situation. “Counsel the person accordingly. If their intent was just to gather attention, ask them to face reality and make them understand that it is not a matter of boasting or fooling others. Otherwise, when they genuinely need help, no one will come forward, just like the classic fable of the boy who cried wolf,” says Dr Mehta. You can also suggest therapy or counselling if the struggles seem genuine and recurring. Lastly, remember Ruchi Ruuh’s suggestion: “Sometimes if it all seems recurring and manipulative, it's best to establish boundaries; empathy is good, but attention-seeking behaviour shouldn't be enabled.”Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 19, 2025

Can Indian schools face a similar problem?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/as-sweden-shifts-back-to-books-is-india-next-in-the-digital-learning-struggle-2667181-2025-01-20,"Digital learning was once touted as the way forward. However, 15 years after replacing books with computers, Sweden is now investing €104 million to bring back printed textbooks. The reason? Officials believe the digital-first approach has failed to develop fundamental skills like reading and writing. Once again, computers are being set aside to make room for traditional textbooks in the curriculum. In a country like India, where we often look to the West for inspiration, this decision raises important questions. What impact might Sweden’s shift have on India? Moreover, how prevalent is digital learning here, and has it penetrated deeply enough to affect students in the same way?The Swedish perspective After Sweden introduced its digital learning in schools, schools in Ireland followed suit. However, the Swedish government, after experimenting with digital-first education for over a decade, recognised a worrying trend: students' reading and writing skills were slipping. Minister for Schools Lotta Edholm emphasised the value of analogue environments for developing foundational skills, announcing a significant investment in reintroducing textbooks and traditional teaching methods. This doesn’t mean Sweden is abandoning technology altogether—it’s about striking a balance. UNESCO has similarly cautioned against over-reliance on digital tools, advocating teacher-led, in-person learning.India: A digital paradox in education India, with its socio-economic diversity and vast student population, faces unique challenges in integrating digital learning. According to Praneet Mungali, Trustee of Sanskriti Group Schools, while initiatives like the Right to Education and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan have improved access to education, reading habits remain largely confined to textbooks. For millions of students, particularly in rural areas, digital education remains a distant dream due to limited resources. Meanwhile, urban schools are increasingly adopting digital tools, creating a stark divide. Anu Singh (name changed), a teacher at a reputed Delhi school and a mother of two, shares, “In India, we are still in the blackboard teaching era, and textbooks are an integral part of most students’ curriculum. Unless it’s an IB school, where digital learning is fully integrated, access to such resources is limited. Yes, many students have access to phones at home, but that’s where the problem arises. While some use them for better understanding of topics, parental discretion is crucial in this regard.” She agrees with Mungali’s views, adding that for many students, owning a textbook itself is a luxury, making the idea of relying on digital learning seem almost unreal.Are we reading less? In India, the problem is not with digital learning, but the dominance of visual media. According to a report by the National Literacy Trust (NLT) organisation in 2024, which included over 76,000 responses, shows that only 34.6% of children aged 8 to 18 enjoy reading in their free time. Last year’s annual streaming trends report by Amazon Fire TV revealed that Indians now spend an average of over four hours per day binge-watching content on their Fire TV devices. With the number of smartphone users in India crossing the 1 billion mark, 90% of them prefer consuming video content online. The increased screen time among students isn’t a result of schools adopting digital learning; rather, it stems from excessive exposure to content on OTT platforms. As digital content consumption rises, traditional reading appears to be declining—a pattern mirrored globally. Arzoo Wadhawan, Clinical Psychologist at Artemis Hospitals, highlights several factors:
Instant gratification: Platforms like Netflix offer quick, visual entertainment requiring less cognitive effort.
Attention spans: Social media and multitasking culture reduce deep, focused engagement with texts.
Shift to shorter formats: Blogs, tweets, and audiobooks cater to modern lifestyles, but compromise critical thinking and concentration.
The role of libraries, policies and book fairs However, Swagat Sengupta, CEO of Oxford Bookstores, offers a more optimistic view, observing that readership is not declining uniformly. “We see dynamic footfalls from children, Gen Z, and beyond,” he says, crediting initiatives like book fairs and literary workshops for cultivating lifelong reading habits. India’s libraries, both public and school-based, are critical in bridging the gap. Yet, many lack adequate funding or modern management. Mungali advocates for investments in schools and public libraries to make books accessible to all socio-economic groups. Government schemes like the National Mission on Libraries provide a starting point, but much more needs to be done.Screen time and learning Sweden’s return to textbook policy stems from growing evidence that screen time may hinder foundational learning. Wadhawan explains, “Frequent multitasking rewires the brain, reducing focus and deep reading abilities.” India, too, sees rising concerns over excessive screen exposure among children, making a balanced approach to technology essential.The way forward India’s challenge isn’t digital learning itself, yet numbers reveal a decline in readership. A mother of a Class VIII student, soon to be promoted to Class IX, shares her experience: “Every Friday, my daughter receives a book from the school library as part of their curriculum. But when she comes home, the book ends up in her drawer, untouched. Instead, she uses her phone—whether for homework, gaming, or watching videos. The library book eventually goes back unread. I believe, we need stronger incentives and creative strategies to cultivate a reading habit, which is becoming increasingly difficult with each passing day.” Experts suggest:
Strengthening school libraries: As hubs for analogue learning, these can nurture reading beyond exams.
Promoting family reading: Making reading a social activity can counteract OTT-driven habits.
Gamifying the reading experience: Apps that combine books with interactive elements can engage tech-savvy students.

60fb5b63-9bff-44b2-a773-32fbd9d8698b,Can two spoons of rum at night cure your winter cough?Many believe drinking rum or brandy with warm water can help deal with coughing during winter. But what do doctors say?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-two-spoons-of-rum-at-night-cure-your-winter-cough-2667458-2025-01-20,"“When my father brought home a bottle of rum this winter, I was a bit surprised because he doesn’t drink. When I asked him about it, he said it was to keep his cough under control,” says Vansh, a 27-year-old businessman from Delhi, to India Today. “This incident also took me back to my childhood, as my father would give me a teaspoon of brandy at night during peak winter whenever I had a cough or cold,” he adds. Vansh’s father is not alone in believing that a bit of rum or brandy can help cure a winter cough. It, in fact, is a popular home remedy in India as well as in the West. Remember when Shah Rukh Khan offered cognac (a type of brand) to a shivering Kajol in the film 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'? So did Rishi Kapoor to Sridevi in 'Chandni'.

 



A still from the film 'Chandni'.
 The most common way to drink rum for a cough involves making a sort of Hot Toddy (a cocktail). Boil water with spices like cinnamon, cloves, and star anise, add a bit of rum (30 ml), and sip it slowly.What doctors say It is believed that drinking rum or brandy can soothe a sore throat and clear cold-induced congestion. Regardless of what age-old remedies suggest, doctors do not recommend consuming any kind of alcohol as a treatment at all. Drinking rum with hot water, doctors say, only provides symptomatic relief. The consumption risks outweigh any benefits. “It gives you a little warmth which provides symptomatic relief. It is not used for treating any viral infections like a cold and cough. Using rum on a regular basis can lower the immunity,” Dr Atul Kakar, Chairperson of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi. Dr Mriganka Bohra, General Physician, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Jaipur, explains that alcohol found in rum dilates the blood vessels, resulting in a sensation of warmth. “It may have a mild numbing effect on a sore throat. When combined with ingredients such as honey, lemon, or spices, it could provide some comforting benefits. Nonetheless, these benefits are only surface-level and do not offer a genuine remedy,” adds Dr Bohra.Impact on health  The impact of consuming alcohol, even in small quantities, is significant. “Alcohol, including rum, puts a considerable strain on the liver, which is tasked with processing it. Even minimal consumption can lead to inflammation, particularly in those who already have liver issues like fatty liver disease. Consistent use, even in what seems to be harmless amounts for 'therapeutic purposes,' can result in liver damage over time,” Dr Saad Anwar, Senior Consultant Gastro, Gastro Surgery, GI Onco Surgery and Advance Laparoscopic Surgery, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Kanpur. Since alcohol can impair the immune system, it increases the risk of infections rather than offering protective benefits.

 Health experts also highlight more risks of consuming alcohol to treat winter cough and cold; it can disrupt sleep, irritate the stomach lining, and lead to dehydration. “These conditions can further aggravate cold symptoms. Alcohol can also negatively interact with medications often used to treat colds, such as antihistamines or pain relievers, which can result in adverse side effects,” adds Dr Bohra.What to do instead? On the contrary, drinking herbal tea, doctors say, can provide similar comfort. Research also suggests this. In a study conducted in 2008, participants reported immediate relief from symptoms of cough, runny nose, and sneezing upon consuming a hot beverage. “Relying on alcohol as a 'solution' for winter illnesses is not only ineffective but may also lead to addiction and long-term health complications. Instead, prioritise proven remedies and seek guidance from a medical professional for ongoing symptoms,” suggests Dr Anwar. Keep yourself hydrated, take proper rest, drink warm fluids and try steam inhalation when you are down with a common cold or cough during winter, for doctors say these are far more effective than drinking rum or brandy.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 20, 2025Must Watch

— Oli London (@OliLondonTV) January 20, 2025 But whether Melania's daytime inaugural attire will become part of the Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection remains uncertain. She had previously contributed to the collection in 2017. The Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection is one of the most popular and enduring exhibits at the National Museum of American History in Washington DC. Not just inaugural outfits, the collection gives people an insight into the personal style and influence of America’s first ladies. Now, to the inaugural ceremony. Donald Trump arrived at the US Capitol on Monday and has been sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, marking a stunning political comeback after his felony convictions. Traditionally, the ceremony is held outdoors at the Capitol, but this time, due to dangerously cold temperatures, it was held indoors. The inauguration was attended by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama, and outgoing President Joe Biden.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 20, 2025Must Watch

Usha Vance, Jill Biden and Ivanka Trump championed monochromatic looks with their elegant sartorial picks. Usha Vance made a stylish appearance on Inauguration Day, where her husband, JD Vance, was sworn in as the Vice President of the United States. Usha Vance, the Second Lady of the US, kept it warm yet stylish in a pink Oscar de la Renta ensemble – a custom cashmere coat with a matching scarf. She completed her look with statement floral earrings and blush-toned suede boots that complemented her outfit’s subtle palette. She also wore matching gloves and carried a small clutch in a neutral shade.

 She tied her tresses in a sleek bun and rocked minimal makeup. Usha, who traces her origins to Andhra Pradesh, was born in California. She attended Yale Law School, where she met JD Vance in 2013. The couple got married in 2014 after graduating from Yale Law School and have three children together. An accomplished trial lawyer who has worked at Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP in San Francisco and Washington, DC, Usha has been instrumental in her husband's political journey. Ahead of Inauguration Day, Usha made a fashion statement in a stunning strapless gown as she hosted a special dinner at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, along with her husband, JD Vance.

 She wowed in a custom-made Oscar de la Renta gown featuring a sweetheart neckline and dazzling floral accents. Inauguration Day witnessed several fashionable moments, including First Lady Melania Trump’s sharp and edgy look in a tailored coat, skirt, and blouse set with a statement hat. Her ensemble was an American amalgam, as it hailed from New York-based designers Adam Lippes (outfit) and Eric Javits (hat). She, however, ditched the complete monotone appeal by adding a subtle pop of white to her ensemble.

In stark contrast to her former fashion model days, Melania put forth a poised and graceful presence with her sartorial picks during Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day ceremonies. Her sharp selection of silhouettes this time made it clear: she is no longer the first-time FLOTUS whose style once stirred quite a few controversies. Though, a hint of drama is still an imperative part of her personal style. Yes, we are talking about her Inauguration Day hat that not only hid her eyes (half of her face, actually) but also got in the way when Trump tried to kiss Melania at the oath ceremony.

 She cut a crisp image and coordinated Donald Trump's outfit in a navy blue ensemble for Inauguration Day. What she wore was a double-breasted mid-length coat over a contrasting white blouse. She styled it with opera gloves, blue heels and the statement hat. Her ensemble was an American amalgam, as it hailed from independent New York-based designers Adam Lippes (outfit) and Eric Javits (hat). The FLOTUS then switched into a glamorous strapless gown designed by her stylist Herve Pierre for the Commander-in-Chief Inaugural Ball. She wowed in a strapless off-white dress which was accentuated with striking black straps and a side slit. To complete the look, she opted for a Harry Winston diamond brooch and wore it as a choker.

I saw a comment on Instagram about using lube as a primer for acne-prone skin because it is water-based,"" says Arnakshi Patgiri (@arnakshi_kashyap on Instagram), a beauty content creator and influencer. Over the last few years, the beauty industry has seen a slew of crazy hacks and tricks for both skincare and makeup (as a lifestyle writer, I’ve come across plenty). Last year, we saw an influencer using their own poop as skincare. Now, within just the first month of this year, we are witnessing a bizarre trend: using lube (yes, that) on the face as a facial primer. The concept of using a facial primer—the first step in applying makeup to ensure pores are minimised and makeup goes on smoothly—isn’t new. In fact, in the West, people have been using lube as a primer for quite some time. However, for many Indians, it became a crazy new idea when Arnakshi posted about it on Instagram. In her video, she explains how it has worked for her acne-prone skin and doesn't cause irritation since it is designed for the most intimate areas of the body. The video soon went viral. While some were confused, others ‘sexualised’ the content and cracked jokes about it. However, there were those who agreed that lube could indeed double as a primer. Have a look at the video:

A trend from the West As we told you, the concept of applying lube on your face as a primer is not new. In fact, makeup artist and TikToker Lukas Kohutek first used lube as a primer in February 2019. By 2021, #lubeprimer had millions of views on TikTok. But it took some time to catch up, even in the West. Now, it seems like the trend has finally arrived in India, with a lot of people becoming curious about the trend.  What are experts saying?Even though the idea of using lube might be appealing, as it’s cheaper (no pink tax), it seems like experts are not happy with the idea of using it on our faces. advertisementDr Trupti Agarwal, consultant, dermatology, Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, explains that while lubricants, particularly those with silicone or water-based formulas, might mimic the texture of some commercial primers, they are not formulated for this purpose. “Silicone-based lubes create a smooth, slippery texture, resembling primers used for makeup or skin smoothing. However, their effectiveness depends on the type of lube and skin type. They may offer a temporary solution, but they are neither reliable nor designed for long-term use,” she says.Dr Sarita Sanke, senior consultant, dermatology department, Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital, tells India Today, “Makeup primers are formulated to be non-comedogenic and safe for prolonged facial application. Lubricants are intended for intimate use and may contain ingredients that irritate or compromise the skin barrier.”Dr Mikki Singh, medical director and founder of Bodycraft Clinics, further adds that while lubricants may temporarily create a smooth base for makeup, they lack the benefits of true primers. “Ingredients like glycerin and hydroxyethylcellulose might create a smoother surface, but lubes are not designed for facial skin and can trigger adverse reactions,” she says. advertisementThe potential side effects according to expertsUsing lubricants as makeup primers may seem harmless, but experts point out several risks. According to Dr Manjot Marwah, dermatologist, director of LHR clinics and founder of EnagenBio: Water-based lubes: These contain gels and humectants that may leave a crinkly, sticky feel on the skin once they dry, especially if applied heavily. They might accentuate fine lines or texture, particularly around delicate areas like the eyes.  Oil-based lubes: While these can provide a smoother application, they have a higher chance of clogging pores and causing breakouts (comedones), especially if you’re prone to acne.Other side effects include: 
Clogged pores and breakouts: Dr Agarwal explains that lubes can aggravate skin issues, especially in individuals with oily or acne-prone skin.
Irritation and allergic reactions: Dr Sarita Sanke warns that certain lubricants contain fragrances or preservatives that can irritate facial skin. “Prolonged use can also disrupt the skin’s natural barrier,” she adds.
Potential sensitivity: Its prolonged use, may cause irritation or sensitivity, particularly in individuals with pre-existing skin conditions.
Residue and removal challenges: Lubes may leave behind an oily or greasy residue, requiring more effort to cleanse thoroughly.

Smooth texture for makeup application: Temporarily blurs fine lines and creates a smooth finish, especially beneficial for individuals with dry skin.
Inexpensive alternative in a pinch: Serves as a quick, affordable fix when you're out of primer and need a smooth base.
Hydration (water-based lubes): Works as a moisturiser and enhances makeup adherence due to its hydrating properties.
Minimal shine control (silicone-based lubes): Provides a smooth, oil-free look for a few hours, particularly in the T-zone or areas prone to shine.
How to pick a primer (which is not a lube): If you're looking for a skin primer for makeup application, it's always best to choose a product specifically designed for this purpose, according to Dr Agarwal. He suggested to look for: 
Hydrating primers if you have dry skin.
Pore-filling primers if you have large pores.
Mattifying primers for oily or combination skin.
These products are formulated to provide specific benefits without the side effects associated with lubricants.

Draped in an exquisite jamewar (Kashmiri fabric) saree by ace designer Tarun Tahiliani, she embraced traditional roots with complete flair. The saree, crafted over 1,900 meticulous hours, features intricate aari work and delicate French knots, creating a stunning interplay of texture and detail. She paired it with a modern tapered collared blouse, accented at the neckline with a chunky diamond brooch. The ensemble showcased Tahiliani's signature style - a seamless amalgamation of tradition and contemporary elegance.

 To achieve its flawless drape, heritage jamewar shawls were embroidered by skilled craftsmen, hand-painted, printed, and further enhanced with intricate embroidery. Her saree was a modern interpretation of the traditional jamewar, adorned with the finest kashidakari, a traditional Kashmiri embroidery technique that uses thread and beads to create intricate patterns and designs. Her look was completed with a pair of pearl-and-diamond-studded chandbalis. Simple and effortless, yet undeniably striking.

 Earlier, ahead of the Inauguration Day, Nita and Mukesh Ambani attended a private reception hosted in honour of President Trump. For the reception too, Nita Ambani chose the traditional route. She wore a custom-designed Kanchipuram silk saree by Swadesh. Woven by National Award-winning master artisan B Krishnamoorthy, it features intricate and meticulously chosen motifs like the Iruthalaipakshi (double-headed eagle symbolising Lord Vishnu), Mayil (representing immortality and divinity), and the mythical Sorgavasal animal trails (embodying the charm of India’s rich folklore).

 To give it a more contemporary look, she styled the saree with a Manish Malhotra velvet blouse which featured a built-up neckline and intricate beadwork along the sleeve. Her accessories were a statement in themselves, with the necklace being a standout piece. It featured a rare parrot-shaped pendant crafted in Southern India in the 18th century. Adorned with emeralds, rubies, diamonds, and pearls, the pendant was set using the traditional gold Kundan technique, enhanced with vibrant red and green enamel, perfectly complementing her look. Mukesh and Nita Ambani were invited to Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony as the 47th President of the United States, which took place at the Capitol in Washington DC, on Monday. The guest list also included Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Tesla's Elon Musk, Apple's Tim Cook, and Google's Sundar Pichai.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 22, 2025Must Watch

8bd47660-61a4-418d-b308-1f109e304123,What should an Indian teenager's skincare routine look like?Not giving a damn about skincare at all or overwhelming your skin with every possible viral skincare product - indulging in either route - is not ideal for teenagers.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/what-should-an-indian-teenager-skincare-actually-look-like-2668610-2025-01-22,"If you are somebody who grew up in the 90s, you might remember how television ads dominated your skincare choices. That was the time when products like fairness creams, so-called game-changing peel-off masks, and ‘miraculous’ acne-clearing face washes gained popularity. Did those products do more harm than good to your teenage skin? Many dermatologists would agree. Cut to now, a similar story is unfolding but with a twist. TV ads have been replaced by social media influencers, who promote new products almost daily. For instance, Kabeer Kanojia, a 14-year-old student from Delhi, learnt about salicylic acid on Instagram rather than in a Chemistry class. He is keen on buying salicylic acid and a viral charcoal mask to manage his acne, but his pocket money doesn’t allow him to buy it yet. Gargy, an 18-year-old, has her beauty shelf replete with several viral products like snail mucin and retinol serum. Research suggests Gen Z and Gen Alpha are immensely splurging on beauty and skincare.Skincare and new-age teens Teens and tweens are flocking to Sephora stores; they are already concerned about issues like “anti-aging” and “collagen-boosting.” Meanwhile, dermatologists warn that following elaborate skincare routines, overusing products, and mindlessly following influencers can be harmful to the skin, especially for teenagers.

 



Teenagers should avoid using harsh scrubs and strong skincare ingredients. (Photo: Pexels)
“Social media plays a huge role in teens today as influencers and trailers promote serums and active chemicals as the need of the hour in skincare. Having knowledge is empowering, but it usually lacks context on skin types, possible side effects, and usage,” says Dr. Chandani Jain Gupta, Dermatologist and Aesthetic Physician, Elantis Healthcare, New Delhi.She suggests teenagers focus on a simple skincare routine that works for them instead of following any social media trend and making impulsive purchases.Owing to the increased craze in skincare among growing children, dedicated teenage skincare brands have also cropped up across the world. The trend is also catching up in India.“Teenagers often face specific concerns like acne, oily skin, and dandruff. Our focus was to develop products that are not only clinically proven to be effective but also completely safe for this age group. We prioritised gentle yet potent ingredients to address these concerns without compromising their skin health,” says Vidya Madhavan, founder and CEO, Y Play Z.For teenagers, the focus should be on establishing good habits and tackling common issues like acne and oiliness.“Due to puberty, teenagers, of course, go through hormonal imbalances. However, what has contributed to the increased rate of acne in teenagers today is their lifestyle and food habits. Fifteen to twenty years ago, cases of acne and hormonal imbalances were not as prevalent as they are now,” says Dr. Rishne Gupte.advertisement“The main reason remains hormonal imbalance, which has become more common in teenagers. Additionally, physical activity, which was much more common 20 years ago, has also declined. Junk food consumption has increased dramatically, and so have rates of obesity and conditions like PCOD,” Dr. Gupte adds.Doctors want teenagers to understand that skin is an organ, and it gets affected by hormonal imbalances or poor nutrition. Experimenting too much with the skin will only make it more sensitive and lead to breakouts.So, what is an ideal skincare routine for teenagers?First things first, do things that you can control – food habits, sleep routine, and exercise.As for products, all that a teenager essentially need is:
Cleanser
Moisturiser
Sunscreen
The products you buy should be ideal for your skin type and be non-comedogenic (a product contains ingredients that won't clog or block the pores on your skin). Products usually have it mentioned on the packaging.“A skincare routine of an Indian teen should be concentrated on cleansing, hydration, and protection from the sun. Begin by using a face wash that would gently remove the dirt and oils from the surface of the face. Then moisturise with light, non-comedogenic moisture to keep hydrated throughout. Use sunscreen, even at home, and avoid harsh scrubs; use exfoliants once a week,” says Dr. Gupta.advertisementSocial media videos are convincing enough for teenagers to start investing in active ingredients. But do they even need any? Well, those dealing with acne may benefit from salicylic acid and adapalene – that’s what doctors say.“Adapalene is particularly suitable for teenagers. Additionally, salicylic acid works well when paired with a moisturiser and sunscreen. Teenagers don’t need a lot of things. Simple lifestyle modifications, healthy eating habits, and the use of one or two active ingredients alongside a moisturiser and sunscreen can effectively manage acne,” says Dr. Gupte.As they grow older, teenagers can focus on solutions targeted at specific concerns (if any), like dryness or uneven skin tone.PS: Bonus (but basic) skincare tips for teenagers:
Do not touch or squeeze the pimple
Wash your face twice a day
Drink plenty of water
Use non-comedogenic products
Manage stress and exercise regularly
Eat a healthy diet
Clean your makeup properly before sleeping
If you use makeup regularly, allow your skin to have makeup-free day
Consult a doctor for medications if your acne does not disappear.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 22, 2025Trending Reel 
 “Social media plays a huge role in teens today as influencers and trailers promote serums and active chemicals as the need of the hour in skincare. Having knowledge is empowering, but it usually lacks context on skin types, possible side effects, and usage,” says Dr. Chandani Jain Gupta, Dermatologist and Aesthetic Physician, Elantis Healthcare, New Delhi. She suggests teenagers focus on a simple skincare routine that works for them instead of following any social media trend and making impulsive purchases. Owing to the increased craze in skincare among growing children, dedicated teenage skincare brands have also cropped up across the world. The trend is also catching up in India. “Teenagers often face specific concerns like acne, oily skin, and dandruff. Our focus was to develop products that are not only clinically proven to be effective but also completely safe for this age group. We prioritised gentle yet potent ingredients to address these concerns without compromising their skin health,” says Vidya Madhavan, founder and CEO, Y Play Z. For teenagers, the focus should be on establishing good habits and tackling common issues like acne and oiliness. “Due to puberty, teenagers, of course, go through hormonal imbalances. However, what has contributed to the increased rate of acne in teenagers today is their lifestyle and food habits. Fifteen to twenty years ago, cases of acne and hormonal imbalances were not as prevalent as they are now,” says Dr. Rishne Gupte. “The main reason remains hormonal imbalance, which has become more common in teenagers. Additionally, physical activity, which was much more common 20 years ago, has also declined. Junk food consumption has increased dramatically, and so have rates of obesity and conditions like PCOD,” Dr. Gupte adds. Doctors want teenagers to understand that skin is an organ, and it gets affected by hormonal imbalances or poor nutrition. Experimenting too much with the skin will only make it more sensitive and lead to breakouts.So, what is an ideal skincare routine for teenagers? First things first, do things that you can control – food habits, sleep routine, and exercise. As for products, all that a teenager essentially need is:
Cleanser
Moisturiser
Sunscreen
 The products you buy should be ideal for your skin type and be non-comedogenic (a product contains ingredients that won't clog or block the pores on your skin). Products usually have it mentioned on the packaging. “A skincare routine of an Indian teen should be concentrated on cleansing, hydration, and protection from the sun. Begin by using a face wash that would gently remove the dirt and oils from the surface of the face. Then moisturise with light, non-comedogenic moisture to keep hydrated throughout. Use sunscreen, even at home, and avoid harsh scrubs; use exfoliants once a week,” says Dr. Gupta. Social media videos are convincing enough for teenagers to start investing in active ingredients. But do they even need any? Well, those dealing with acne may benefit from salicylic acid and adapalene – that’s what doctors say. “Adapalene is particularly suitable for teenagers. Additionally, salicylic acid works well when paired with a moisturiser and sunscreen. Teenagers don’t need a lot of things.

The answer to this question can vary for different people. For some, it might be calling their favourite person. For others, it could be indulging in self-care or cleaning, while some may prefer complete isolation with their chosen piece of content. This content can be anything, and it generally depends on the type of person you are. For some, it could be watching a mystery thriller, while for others, it might be enjoying a comedy. Such is the case with Muskan Gupta, a 25-year-old from Assam, who, when she’s sad, her mind craves something light-hearted that can create a ‘distraction’ from the ‘real world’. For many youngsters, particularly Gen Z, like Muskan, this is where Samay Raina, the Kashmiri stand-up comedian who has been the talk of the town, comes in. For some, like Muskan, Samay is the solution when they are feeling low. Meanwhile, others, like Shambhavi Jha, a fashion designer from Delhi NCR, who prefers Arijit Singh’s music when she’s sad, tells us she watches Samay and his show India’s Got Latent while having her dinner or lunch, or as a pastime with friends. India’s Got Latent, a spin-off of India’s Got Talent (both shows have the same IMDb rating of 5.4), is a reality show that is consumed massively by young Indians, who have a preference for dark comedy.

Samay initially carved a niche following, especially during Covid-19, due to his chess videos on YouTube. He made the game, which was considered ‘a gentleman’s game’, into a 'non-serious' one due to his funny commentary. But he received mass validation after winning Comicstaan Season 2, and his name grew exponentially when he started his own reality show in 2024. But what was different?

 Samay initially carved a niche following, especially during Covid-19, due to his chess videos on YouTube. He made the game, which was considered ‘a gentleman’s game’, into a 'non-serious' one due to his funny commentary. But he received mass validation after winning Comicstaan Season 2, and his name grew exponentially when he started his own reality show in 2024. But what was different? Well, unlike the other Indian reality shows which are often called out for being scripted, Samay’s show started taking credit for being 'unscripted, unfiltered and raw'. “He talks like how we talk to our friends, so it’s relatable on the ground level,” says Reejak, a 20-year-old student and content writer from Delhi. Reejak says that he rediscovered Samay during the pandemic when he started streaming YouTube videos with Tanmay Bhatt but initially found him ‘annoying’. But now, Samay's content has become Reejak’s ‘comfort space’.What is the reason? India Today spoke to various youngsters who have a paid subscription to India’s Got Latent, and we asked them what makes Samay and his style of comedy so likeable, and the word ‘relatable’ popped out the most. Like Reejak mentioned, since Samay talks to everyone, even celebs and contestants, as his friends, on his show, it makes him more relatable. “I like Samay because of his unique sense of humour, relatable content which actually resonates with many people. His comic timing is also very good and his ability to address social issues with a light-hearted approach is brilliant,” says Shambhavi. Today, Samay has millions of followers online. But how did he and his show become so relatable and gain such a huge following online in a short time? The answer lies in the dark...humour. The hype around dark humour Dark humour and roasts are not new concepts in India. In fact, All India Bakchod (AIB) was known for a similar format, but we all know how it ended. But now it seems like audiences are loving this similar format (times have changed). We also spoke to various experts and tried to decode the sudden love of ‘dark humour’. Now, even though in a recent podcast with Prakhar Gupta, Samay mentions that he would not refer to himself as someone who only does dark  humour- characterised by grim or satiric - the internet and his fans do refer to him as someone who is known for the same, due to his viral clips online.     Shreya Kaul, a counselling psychologist, explains that what makes him so relatable is his comic style, which is undeniably quick, sharp, and witty, particularly in live, improvisational formats. She says he excels in turning situations around and delivering retorts that leave audiences in splits. For many, this quick wit is both impressive and aspirational. Watching someone handle banter so effortlessly can be both entertaining and inspiring, offering a sense of connectedness. “Comedy, especially dark comedy, has always been a powerful tool for connection and catharsis. It can make taboo topics more approachable and help people confront their fears. In the controlled environment of a comedy show, audiences often feel safe to laugh at things they wouldn’t in other contexts,” she explains. Shreya further explains that Samay’s show allows for greater creative freedom than traditional, heavily curated television comedies like The Great Indian Laughter Challenge. “Platforms like YouTube provide more room for experimentation and risk-taking, which Samay has leveraged well,” she says. Dipra Agarwal, a counselling psychologist at Allen Career Institute, Bangalore, who is also a paid member of Samay’s India’s Got Latent, explains that audiences find him relatable because of the way he has presented himself. “I saw his podcast with Prakhar and realised that Samay was bullied a lot as a kid. That explains a lot, and why he is this way,” she says. Dipra mentions that if you look closely, you will find that it is Samay’s journey that is so appealing to people- a young boy, who was bullied so much and now has turned his life and  is achieving dreams not only for himself but for his parents as well. Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist, says roast culture and dark humour have gained prominence recently, partly because they tap into frustrations and societal stereotypes that many suppress. By bringing these issues to the surface in a relatable way, such humour, resonates with audiences.

 Another reason which makes Samay more likeable, according to audiences and experts, is his ability to crack jokes on himself. “Samay’s skill in engaging with his co-performers and handling their jabs as well as his own, creates a sense of camaraderie for the audience,” says Shreya.advertisementThe dark side of dark humourDark humour and shows like India’s Got Latent are not for everyone which is why it is also very easy for some people to get offended.“Disrespecting people with disabilities is not dark humour,” says Tinkesh Kaushik to India Today, the world’s first triple amputee to trek Everest Base Camp. Tinkesh has previously called Samay Raina out for a particular joke when one of the contestants made fun of people with disabilities and everyone—the judges including Raina—was seen laughing.“If I am making fun of myself and my insecurities, that is okay. Someone who is not disabled and has privilege can’t be disrespecting people and our community, especially now when we have worked so hard for raising awareness and sensitivity amongst people,” says Tinkesh.For others, the problem lies in the crass language that is being used.Here are two such examples (which made headlines):
The first one is Samay Raina and Kusha Kapila’s controversy, which arose from a roast segment on the show 'Pretty Good Roast' last year, where Raina made jokes about Kapila’s recent divorce from Zorawar Ahluwalia. The jokes were deemed ‘dehumanising’ by Kapila, leading to significant backlash against both comedians. Following the episode, which included insensitive remarks about her personal life, Kusha blocked Samay on Instagram, indicating ongoing tension between them. In response to the controversy, Kusha expressed that she did not approve of the jokes beforehand and sat through the roast as a show of resilience, although she later regretted it. This incident has strained their friendship, with Samay acknowledging that it will take time before they can move past it and laugh about the situation again.
In a separate controversy, Samay Raina faced criticism after a contestant on his show, India’s Got Latent, made a joke about Deepika Padukone’s struggles with depression in November 2024. The joke sparked outrage amongst viewers and mental health advocates, leading Raina to address the backlash publicly. But Samay being Samay, he posted a story saying, “To everyone who is outraging on Twitter, one request: Could you please outrage in my YouTube comment section so I get some ad revenue from the traction, at least.”

The lines are blurryHow do you define what is problematic and what is not? The line is thin and a blurry one. Experts also find it confusing. “The idea is to be funny and express oneself, and what one is as a person generally shows through jokes. Being hurt and offended are by-products that I don’t deliberately seek nor try to avoid beyond a certain sensibility,” explains Navin Kumar, a stand-up comic.Even though Samay's fan following often say that dark humour is all about taking things lightly, often at times people have called him and his show out for crossing a line.Absy says, “As a neurodivergent and disability-affirmative therapist, I often find that certain types of humour, like that showcased in Samay Raina’s performances, bring up complex emotions for me. His jokes—and sometimes the overall tone of his shows—tend to reinforce systemic ableism. This, in turn, can contribute to feelings of exclusion or the normalisation of pro-exclusion humour.”Shreya, on the other hand says, that while some find solace in dark humour, especially as a coping mechanism for mental health struggles, others take offence. For viewers, dark comedy can offer a voyeuristic thrill, as it pushes boundaries many wouldn’t dare to cross themselves.“This duality is intrinsic to the genre—what is empowering and liberating for one can feel offensive or insensitive to another,” concludes Shreya.Where do you draw the line?

Contrary to popular belief, what you wear and how you carry yourself are not limited to displaying your penchant for style. These seemingly small choices could lead to health issues over time. For instance, have you ever thought about how carrying a heavy handbag on one shoulder could be putting excessive pressure on a single arm and damaging your nerves? There is a term for it – heavy-purse syndrome. But without even realising your daily purse’s impact on your health, you carry it every day to work or college. This is not the only way health and fashion collide. Read on to learn about more fashion mistakes that can negatively affect your health: Heels You probably already know that wearing high heels is not a great idea. It can lead to long-term issues like lower back pain, neck strain, knee pain, and can also affect posture. Women, especially those in their thirties or those going through menopause or perimenopause, should avoid wearing heels regularly because they experience changes in bone density during that time.

 



Pointy high heels for everyday wear? Doctors say no. (Photo: Pexels)
 Wearing heels causes the calf muscles to contract and shorten while stretching the muscles along the shin bone. This imbalance can put significant stress on the knees, leading to severe knee pain. Furthermore, wearing pointy heels and shoes can also cause problems like bunions, corns, ingrown toenails, and arthritis. No matter how stylish they look, keep heels for occasional purposes. “In terms of usage on a daily basis, one should opt for footwear that provides comfort, support, and strict alignment. Pick shoes with cushioned soles to absorb shock, adequate arch support to prevent strain, and a roomy toe box to allow natural movement of your toes. Look for lightweight, flexible materials and a slightly elevated heel (about 1–2 cm) for optimal posture,” suggests Dr Yogesh Kumar, director, orthopedics, joint replacement, and sports injury, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, New Delhi. Heavy bags A lot of us tend to blend practicality with style and put our entire world in our bags. And it is mostly one arm or shoulder that bears the brunt. This improper handling of a heavy bag every day can lead to a bevy of health issues. “Lifting a bag with heavy weight leads to a long-lasting ill impact on muscle and bone health. Bags that are heavy in weight put a lot of strain on body parts such as the shoulders, neck, and spine, leading to muscle imbalances, poor posture, and chronic pain over time,” says Dr Mihir Thanvi, consultant, orthopedic, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Jaipur.

 



Lifting Heavy handbags and shoulder bags can lead to a long-lasting ill impact on muscle and bone health. (Photo: Pexels)
 He further explains that carrying a bag in the forearm increases stress on the elbow and wrist, potentially causing joint inflammation or nerve compression. To prevent these health issues from developing, consider carrying only essential items in your bag to make it lighter, or switch sides every day. You can also switch to a backpack with padded straps to distribute the weight evenly. Stretching on a regular basis can also be helpful in such cases. Tight clothing (think skinny jeans, corsets) Ever heard of petticoat cancer? It is linked to tying the petticoat or dhoti too tightly and subsequent inflammation in the waistline. This happens only when tight-fitted clothing, especially around the waist, is worn repeatedly. It is just one example of how tight clothing can be fatal. Health experts also warn against wearing garments like tight skinny jeans and corsets to keep numerous health problems at bay. “Frequent or prolonged use of such clothes (like tight skinny jeans) could constrict the flow of blood to certain body parts and create numbness or tingling in the legs, medically referred to as meralgia paresthetica. Compressing the stomach will also result in acid reflux, bloating, or indigestion. Tight jeans can also produce a warm and moist environment around the vaginal region, predisposing it to infections by yeast or causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women,” warns Dr Ashu Yadav, senior consultant and head-radiation oncology, Andromeda Cancer Hospital, Sonipat. You can, however, wear tight, sultry clothes like corsets occasionally. “During occasional use, tight clothing is non-hazardous, but one must look for loose, comfortable wear to ensure ease and avoid any long-term harm through proper breathing and good circulation for overall health,” adds Dr Yadav. Ill-fitted and synthetic undergarments When it comes to undergarments, the fabric and fit matter significantly. Synthetic and non-breathable materials are a strict no, as they can trap moisture and lead to skin irritation, fungal infections, or urinary tract infections. Additionally, poor-fitting bras strain the shoulder and neck areas. You surely don’t want to experience that discomfort and pain. Contact lenses without proper care Don’t we all love how coloured lenses instantly add a touch of oomph to our look? Even clear lenses (non-coloured ones), for that matter, allow eyes to take center stage instead of being overshadowed by bulky frames.

 



When not used properly, contact lenses can be harmful to the cornea. (Photo: Pexels)
 However, if one doesn’t maintain proper hygiene or follow the basic lens-wearing norms, it can be disastrous. Wearing contact lenses for too long, not cleaning them properly, or taking a shower with lenses on can lead to eye infections, dryness, and even damage to the cornea.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 24, 2025Must Watch

Through the open doors The harmless phantoms on their errands glide, With feet that make no sound upon the floors.                                 - - Haunted Houses by HW Longfellow Imagine this: you’re locked in a room with your cousins, catching up after ages. Suddenly, one of them starts narrating eerie incidents or the plot of a spine-chilling horror film they recently watched. The room’s energy shifts - curiosity builds, adrenaline kicks in. You’re scared but glued to every word. By the end of the night, you’re too spooked to walk back to your room, yet you’d do it all over again for the thrill. Paranormal tourism taps into this same human craving for fear, curiosity, and adventure. For those still scratching their heads over this one-of-a-kind travelling trend, dim the lights, and lean in close as we tell you more aboutParanormal tourism (and its hype abroad) As its name suggests, it’s visiting a “haunted” or mysterious location to explore the unknown. It blends thrill, education, and cultural curiosity, and it involves guided tours to places believed to have a supernatural significance. These tours focus on removing superstitions and understanding paranormal activities scientifically. For instance, TravelChannel.com defines this as “the niche within the travel industry where tourists attend paranormal-themed conventions and festivals, investigate famously haunted locations, and join ghost tours or haunted pub crawls through cities”. Others have referred to it as visiting places that embody belief systems beyond normal views. It is a well-established niche in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, where there are provisions for proper guided tours, overnight stays, and events at these so-called “haunted” locations that cater to those intrigued by the supernatural. An iconic ""haunted"" destination in the US is the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which was also the inspiration behind Stephen King’s cult classic The Shining. The place is known for ""ghost"" sightings and eerie occurrences. The hotel, interestingly, offers guided ghost tours that have become a key part of its charm. In the UK, it has to be Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. The location is infamous as 'Britain's most haunted historic castle'. Chillingham Castle boasts some of the highest levels of paranormal activity in the country, according to the castle's official website. Ghost tours and ghost hunts here run all year round.

 In a study published in 2016, researchers found that 38% of people incorporated paranormal activities, such as ghost tours or haunted houses, into their vacations. Even more surprisingly, 44% of travellers chose supernatural sites as their primary holiday destinations.The appeal of paranormal tourism in India We all love indulging in thrilling experiences, though the meaning of thrill and adventure can be very subjective. While some get their adrenaline rush from adventure sports like paragliding, zip-lining, or bungee jumping, for others, the eerie excitement of visiting a location steeped in scary, spine-chilling stories is the ultimate thrill. Just like you might have a long-pending Goa trip on your bucket list to take with friends, there are people—believe it or not—who dream of visiting a “haunted” location with their group. For instance, many paranormal thrill-seekers in India have Rajasthan’s Bhangarh Fort, Kuldhara village or Kurseong’s Dow Hill on their bucket list, drawn by the absolutely spooky stories woven around these places over the years.

 Mrinalini Sengupta, an engineering graduate from Kolkata, is a believer who loves exploring places wrapped in an enigma. She says, “I love reading about these places online, in books, and of course, the stories woven around these ‘haunted’ locations give you goosebumps. However, I can’t go there alone, and my friends aren’t really interested in seeking this kind of thrill. I try to look for groups or communities that host these kinds of heritage walks or guided tours to such locations. It’s nice to see how places abroad have mainstream tourism built around this.”

 Dushyant Singh Panwar, a heritage explorer and cultural revivalist who became a walk leader for Delhi Tourism’s ‘haunted’ heritage walk, shares, “People are getting tired of the mundane and the banal nowadays. It has everything to do with the plethora of options available. So-called ‘haunted’ heritage walks or guided tours to ‘haunted’ locations offer them a novel experience that stays with them for its sheer unconventionality. Therefore, I see a rise in demand for these niche experiences. ”

advertisementIndian travellers' interestSo, where does paranormal tourism in India stand? Dushyant Singh believes, it is still at a nascent stage vis a vis the West, and this perspective primarily comes from an urban context.“In rural India, however, local legends and myths have thrived for centuries. North Kerala and South Coastal Karnataka (Tulunadu) boast a rich tradition of Theyyam and Bhoota Kola. These Hindu traditional dance forms are deeply spiritual, with performers embodying a divine aura and sometimes becoming possessed by ‘spirits.’ These spirits not only bless the rural community gathered but also indulge in fortune-telling, creating a deeply immersive cultural experience,” he adds.

 



Bhoota Kola also known as the worship of Daivas or Bhootas or Demi-Gods, is an ancient ritual prevalent among the Tulu-speaking community in the Dakshina Kannada districts in Karnataka. (Photo: travel_karnataka)
advertisementAn interesting example of this cultural heritage is the Kannada superhit movie Kantara, which brought the hypnotic power and mystery of Bhoota Kola to the attention of the entire country and even the world. Similarly, the traditions surrounding many peer/fakir sufis who inhabit holy graves (dargah) and tombs also hold a paranormal essence, blending spiritual and mystical practices that have existed for ages.However, he mentions, “Despite the deep cultural and paranormal significance of these practices, tourism hasn’t been actively built around them. However, with rising awareness, these beautiful traditions are slowly being discovered by a wider audience. People are now increasingly planning trips to witness and experience the allure of Theyyam, Bhoota Kola, and other age-old traditions that blend spirituality, mysticism, and cultural heritage.”Things are changingWhile India is still warming up to the concept, there are pioneers like the Parapsychology and Investigation Research Society (registered under the Government of India), which, since 2016, has been working to fill this void and provide thrilling, curated experiences to people seeking them, says Sarbajeet Mohanty, co-founder, paranormal investigator, and demonologist, who also featured as a paranormal expert on MTV’s reality show Dark Scroll.Scare Events Private Limited, the company co-founded by Mohanty and his partner Puja, launched Ghost Encounters Tours (GET) in 2022 under the parent organisation PAIR. “With a focus on removing superstition and spreading awareness, these tours we curate blend adventure, education, and scientific exploration to offer a unique experience. We’ve been doing this for years now and know the world of the paranormal inside out. Our aim has always been to remove fear rooted in ignorance and provide authentic, safe encounters for those genuinely interested,” says Mohanty.Unlike regular tours, Ghost Encounters Tours are exclusive, accommodating only 10-15 participants at a time. Participants must complete a form and undergo a brief screening process to ensure only those genuinely curious and prepared for the experience join. Safety, respect for the unknown, and an authentic paranormal experience are the pillars of these tours conducted by Mohanty and his team.

Before setting off on the guided tour, participants are required to attend a workshop that equips them with tools to distinguish between natural and supernatural phenomena. Using scientific equipment and psychic insights, these workshops aim to demystify paranormal activities and debunk myths.

 So, where does paranormal tourism in India stand? Dushyant Singh believes, it is still at a nascent stage vis a vis the West, and this perspective primarily comes from an urban context. “In rural India, however, local legends and myths have thrived for centuries. North Kerala and South Coastal Karnataka (Tulunadu) boast a rich tradition of Theyyam and Bhoota Kola. These Hindu traditional dance forms are deeply spiritual, with performers embodying a divine aura and sometimes becoming possessed by ‘spirits.’ These spirits not only bless the rural community gathered but also indulge in fortune-telling, creating a deeply immersive cultural experience,” he adds.

 



Bhoota Kola also known as the worship of Daivas or Bhootas or Demi-Gods, is an ancient ritual prevalent among the Tulu-speaking community in the Dakshina Kannada districts in Karnataka. (Photo: travel_karnataka)
 An interesting example of this cultural heritage is the Kannada superhit movie Kantara, which brought the hypnotic power and mystery of Bhoota Kola to the attention of the entire country and even the world. Similarly, the traditions surrounding many peer/fakir sufis who inhabit holy graves (dargah) and tombs also hold a paranormal essence, blending spiritual and mystical practices that have existed for ages. However, he mentions, “Despite the deep cultural and paranormal significance of these practices, tourism hasn’t been actively built around them. However, with rising awareness, these beautiful traditions are slowly being discovered by a wider audience. People are now increasingly planning trips to witness and experience the allure of Theyyam, Bhoota Kola, and other age-old traditions that blend spirituality, mysticism, and cultural heritage.”Things are changing While India is still warming up to the concept, there are pioneers like the Parapsychology and Investigation Research Society (registered under the Government of India), which, since 2016, has been working to fill this void and provide thrilling, curated experiences to people seeking them, says Sarbajeet Mohanty, co-founder, paranormal investigator, and demonologist, who also featured as a paranormal expert on MTV’s reality show Dark Scroll. Scare Events Private Limited, the company co-founded by Mohanty and his partner Puja, launched Ghost Encounters Tours (GET) in 2022 under the parent organisation PAIR. “With a focus on removing superstition and spreading awareness, these tours we curate blend adventure, education, and scientific exploration to offer a unique experience. We’ve been doing this for years now and know the world of the paranormal inside out. Our aim has always been to remove fear rooted in ignorance and provide authentic, safe encounters for those genuinely interested,” says Mohanty. Unlike regular tours, Ghost Encounters Tours are exclusive, accommodating only 10-15 participants at a time. Participants must complete a form and undergo a brief screening process to ensure only those genuinely curious and prepared for the experience join. Safety, respect for the unknown, and an authentic paranormal experience are the pillars of these tours conducted by Mohanty and his team.

One way to achieve this is by doing something out of the ordinary while travelling. This can include activities that provide an adrenaline rush, such as river rafting or paragliding. But behind the thrill lies a sobering truth – the risks involved, especially when safety measures are overlooked. Take, for instance, the tragic story of Shivani Dable, a 27-year-old from Pune. She visited Goa to explore and create memories, but her trip ended in disaster. On 19 January, Shivani and her instructor, 26-year-old Sumal Nepali, lost their lives when their paraglider plunged into a ravine shortly after taking off from a cliff in Keri village, North Goa. A video of the incident has also gone viral.  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. On 7 January, a similar tragedy struck near Manali. Tadi Mahesh Reddy, a 32-year-old, was attempting to take off at Raison when a sudden gust of wind caused his glider to descend instead of ascend, leading to his death.advertisement

— @Rationalviews (@pramod_writes) January 21, 2025 What’s common in these accidents? Both establishments offering these adventure sports were operating illegally. This alarming fact highlights a larger issue plaguing adventure tourism in India.The rise in adventure sports and tourism With more Indians embracing travel, the demand for thrilling, adrenaline-packed activities has surged. Adventure sports such as paragliding, skydiving, rafting, and trekking have gained immense popularity. These activities cater to those seeking excitement, whether on land, in the air, or on water. From mountaineering to hot-air ballooning, the options are endless. The adventure tourism market in India was valued at approximately Rs 15,000 crore (USD 2 billion) in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 17 per cent to reach Rs 35,000 crore (USD 4.6 billion) by 2028.But... This growing enthusiasm has been accompanied by a significant rise in accidents at tourist hotspots. January alone witnessed several incidents, many of which resulted in severe injuries or loss of life. The majority of paragliding mishaps share two key factors: inexperienced pilots and illegal operators. Travellers often face difficulty distinguishing between legitimate and unregulated operators. Without clear guidelines or visible certifications, they inadvertently put their lives at risk. The risks are not limited to paragliding. On 20 May 2024, Ranjini N, a 35-year-old nurse, fell approximately 30 feet when the zipline cable snapped during an activity at Jungle Trailz Resort near Harohalli, Bengaluru. She was part of a group outing with colleagues. Investigations revealed that the resort lacked basic safety measures, such as helmets and first-aid facilities. A police complaint was subsequently filed against the resort management. River rafting, another popular adventure sport, has also seen its share of tragic incidents. Earlier this month in Rishikesh, a hub for adventure enthusiasts, a 33-year-old woman from Delhi drowned after her raft overturned at the ""Golf Course"" rapid. Trapped in the strong currents of the Ganga, she could not be rescued in time, though three others on the raft were saved.

 These incidents underline the urgent need for stricter regulations and better enforcement in the adventure tourism sector. While the thrill of adventure sports is undeniable, ensuring proper safety protocols and certification is crucial to preventing such tragedies. Travellers, too, must stay vigilant and prioritise safety over cost or convenience when choosing operators. Only by addressing these issues can we strike a balance between excitement and safety in the world of adventure tourism.The rules and regulations: The current scenario In 2023, the Indian government introduced new ‘Guidelines for Adventure Tourism’, a 170-page document detailing everything from age limits for various sports to insurance requirements. Operators found violating these safety guidelines can face fines ranging from Rs 5,000 for minor offences to Rs 25,000 for serious violations. Repeat offenders may face harsher penalties or additional sanctions. In addition to these central guidelines, some states have implemented their own regulatory measures to improve safety in adventure sports. This includes judicial directives to enforce safety protocols. However, according to Vaibhav Kala, founder of Aquaterra Adventures and senior VP of the Adventure Tour Operators Association of India (ATOAI) many operators fail to adhere to these policies or find loopholes, often leading to such tragic incidents. Rakesh, the owner of a similar adventure sports establishment in Manali, who has been in this business for almost 10 years, tells India Today that in Himachal Pradesh, many individuals (inexperienced ones) are entering the adventure sports business as obtaining a licence is ‘pretty easy’. He added that officials conduct quality checks on equipment used in these activities only twice a year. “When recognised and registered operators follow the rules, most adventure tourism activities are safe and prioritise safety and responsible tourism. However, when these measures are not implemented, the consequences can be dire, just as they are anywhere else in the world,” says Vaibhav.‘It’s just bad luck’ Rakesh shares that, despite taking all precautions, such incidents sometimes occur because no one can overpower ‘mother nature’. Referring to these accidents as ‘bad luck’, Rakesh stated that such incidents could happen anywhere. However, experts seem to disagree. The CEO of Zoho, Sridhar Vembu, who recently lost his friend’s son in a paragliding accident in Himachal Pradesh’s Kullu, expressed concerns about paragliding in the region, calling it ‘risky’ and ‘accident-prone’. He emphasised the need for regulators to take a closer look at such incidents.

Yesterday I had the very sad duty to attend the funeral of Jeyesh Ram, 27 year old son of my dear friend Cibi Anand and Priya. He lost his life in a para-gliding accident in Kulu, Himachal Pradesh last Friday.

— Sridhar Vembu (@svembu) January 19, 2025 Vaibhav also pointed out that “increasing accidents due to lack of knowledge, experience, and proper registration mechanisms, guidelines, and protocols” can be resolved with effective management. He urged that we need to implement sweeping regulations aligned with Central guidelines to ensure safety and protect the country's reputation as a premier adventure tourism destination. He further emphasised the need for a unified management regime for these activities in India. This includes mandatory registration of companies, guides, and operators under a comprehensive safety management plan. ""India must act immediately to make sweeping regulations in line with central guidelines and advice. The recent accidents in paragliding are yet another sterling example of why we must protect India's reputation as a great adventure tourism destination,"" concludes Vaibhav.

 As for her glam, she kept it simple with a dewy base and nude lipstick. Her kohl-rimmed eyes, a dainty black bindi, and a side-parted hair bun with soft curls added a hint of drama to the look. Several Bollywood stars, including Sonam Kapoor, Bipasha Basu, Ananya Panday, Rani Mukerji, and Aditi Rao Hydari, turned up at the venue wearing stunning black ensembles to celebrate 25 years of Sabyasachi.

 The accessories weren’t any less dramatic. The oversized cross pendant layered with other bold necklaces screamed gothic opulence, and the chunky earrings and bold glasses added a quirky, intellectual edge to the look. (PS: We loved the stacked bangles!) Now, to that marvellous job with the hairdo! It was swept into a voluminous updo, one that would vividly remind you of Frida Kahlo.

 At the much-anticipated event, Bollywood’s who’s who arrived looking every bit gorgeous (that would be an understatement, seriously). Sonam Kapoor, Aditi Rao Hydari, Alia Bhatt, Ananya Panday, Bipasha Basu, and several other celebrities showed up to celebrate 25 years of Sabyasachi. Now, if you were to talk about how the show was, it was larger-than-life, regal, and opulent (just like Sabyasachi’s brides and stores, tell me if I’m wrong). The show’s setup was inspired by dalan bari (verandah house), which was a bow to his roots, his hometown – ‘Calcutta.’ The brand Sabyasachi is synonymous with brides, weddings, and marriages, not just in India but across countries. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Bollywood is a fan of his couture because he has dressed these divas not just on screen but for their real-life special days as well (he designed wedding outfits for Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, and Katrina Kaif).Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 26, 2025Must Watch

Following the Covid-19 pandemic, last year saw people, including Indians, travelling more than ever before. As we step into 2025, the travel landscape for Indians is poised for even greater transformation, shaped by shifting preferences and emerging trends. Here are five key travel trends that could define how Indians explore destinations, both domestically and internationally, this year. PS: This information has been gathered after speaking with travel experts and reviewing trend reports from travel agencies like Skyscanner, Booking.com, and Pickyourtrail. 1. Very mindful, very demure travel With 2024 planting the seed of mindful travel, this year is likely to witness it in full bloom. Mindful travel emphasises being aware of your surroundings, appreciating local culture, and making sustainable choices to reduce environmental impact. Both data and experts echo this sentiment. Hari Ganapathy, co-founder of Pickyourtrail, an online travel company, tells India Today, “2025 is shaping up to be ‘The Year of Mindful Wanderlust’, where travel is no longer just about destinations but about deeper connections, purpose, and personalisation.” According to Hari, this shift is driven by travellers prioritising eco-conscious escapes, milestone celebrations, and immersive experiences, fundamentally changing how journeys are planned and experienced.

 



Indians are travellers prioritising eco-conscious escapes. Photo: Unsplash
advertisementThis trend aligns with a recent Skyscanner survey of Indian travellers, where 70 per cent of respondents expressed a desire to be more mindful of their health and well-being (not just the environment) while travelling. Additionally, the survey reveals that Indians are moving beyond the traditional “treat yourself” holiday mentality, with over half (57 per cent) prioritising wellness even while on vacation.With travellers searching for the elixir of life, vacations are no longer just about unwinding. Driven by the desire for better lifestyle choices, 60 per cent of travellers are interested in longevity retreats – supercharged versions of traditional wellness itineraries that aim for long-term benefits instead of temporary fixes.2. AI = automatic itineraryAs technology advances, AI is becoming an indispensable travel companion. Skyscanner’s data reveals that 84 per cent of Indian travellers feel confident using AI tools for planning and booking, with 52 per cent using them for destination research, 50 per cent for flight bookings, 48 per cent for comparing options, and 46 per cent for inspiration.3. Layovers? Not so lay low anymoreThe days of boring layovers are over. In 2025, stopovers are becoming mini-holidays. Cities like Istanbul, Doha, and Dubai now offer free stays and discounted cultural tours, turning transit time into bonus travel.advertisementEven airports are gaining prominence. Data shows over a third (34 per cent) of travellers express interest in visiting destinations based on their airports, while 60 per cent are curious about airports offering unique experiences or facilities. From sleep pods and spas to Michelin-star restaurants and Pilates sessions, airports are evolving into destinations in their own right.

Off-beat travelOff-beat travel, a trend gaining momentum last year, is set to flourish in 2025. Data suggests Indians are increasingly exploring unique, lesser-known destinations. According to Pickyourtrail, this trend is especially prevalent among DINK (Dual Income, No Kids) couples and remote workers, who are avoiding crowds by travelling during off-peak seasons.For example, Europe in autumn or tropical paradises before the monsoon are becoming popular choices. Travellers are favouring quieter months for a more relaxed experience and cost savings.Indian tourists are also veering away from traditional hotspots like Goa, opting instead for places like Gokarna and Karwar that offer authentic experiences.

If not, here’s the answer: each of them, at some point in the last decade, visited India to rejuvenate at some of the country’s most renowned wellness retreats. While we often look to the West for inspiration, wellness tourism in India is witnessing a significant boom, in a way, actually leading the way for the world to look up to and follow. The reasons are many, but the primary driver is the increasing mindfulness around health and lifestyle. More than ever, people are focusing on holistic wellbeing, embracing practices like meditation, yoga, and traditional healing techniques. Many are also turning toward veganism, vegetarianism, or a sativic lifestyle to achieve a balance of body, mind, and soul. India, with its deep-rooted wellness heritage and diverse offerings, is perfectly poised to cater to this growing demand. So, it was but natural to experience one up close to understand what makes these retreats so life-changing and why they attract people from across the globe.At Swastik Wellbeing Sanctuary – back to the roots It’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with life’s demands these days. Our hectic schedules leave little to no room to reconnect with ourselves, our surroundings, or even to appreciate the small joys of life. Perhaps, that’s the first thing we realised on Day 1 at the wellness sanctuary – the importance of appreciating the little things. It was a small little ritual before the meals that brought back fond memories (more about that later).

 



Swastik Wellbeing is located in Peacock Valley, Khed, Pune, surrounded by the Sahyadri Hills and the serene Khadakwasla backwaters.
advertisementDr Rajesh Srinivas, general manager at Swastik Wellbeing, says, “Indians have understood the importance of wellbeing - not just physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual. With growing affluence and an increasingly young workforce wellbeing holidays are the way to go. These provide a quick reboot and return to work with more engagement and productivity.” Dr Rajesh Srinivas, general manager at Swastik Wellbeing, says, “Indians have understood the importance of wellbeing - not just physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual. With growing affluence and an increasingly young workforce wellbeing holidays are the way to go. These provide a quick reboot and return to work with more engagement and productivity.” Now, Swastik Wellbeing is located in Peacock Valley, Khed, Pune, surrounded by the Sahyadri Hills and the serene Khadakwasla backwaters, far removed from the maddening city crowds. Spanning across 51 acres, the property is a haven of lush greenery, exuding peace and tranquillity – a stark contrast to chaotic city life. At Swastik, a range of personalised experiences are on offer, each rooted in the core values of Health, Wealth, Love, Bliss, and Spirituality. Even greetings here are not a casual “hello” or “hi.” They are imbued with a deep sense of spirituality. As a gesture of respect and connection, people greet one another with atma naman (my soul acknowledges your soul).A day in the wellness ‘sanctuary’ For someone aiming to bring a change in their life, mentally or physically, Swastik provides the much-needed awakening your body and soul require. Your days will be spent in the retreat as per your dincharya (daily routine), which will be prescribed to you once you have consulted with the experts.

 



The day starts here with an early morning fun workout session under the guidance of the experts.
 Your consultation with the Ayurvedic practitioner will be the deciding factor for many things, including your diet and the therapies you undergo there. Now, that could range from halotherapy (salt therapy) to resonance therapy (sound healing), arogyam massages, or meditation. However, everything depends on how long you plan to stay at the retreat; they offer tailored plans starting from 1 to 14 nights. From IBS to fertility, from PCOS to menopause, they have programs to accommodate seekers willing to transform themselves both physically and spiritually.

 



A room perfect for resonance therapy, no?
 You will find yourself engaging with sounds of different frequencies in a dark room that has been designed to look like ‘space’ and witness your healing process. In another instance, you might be meditating in a large room surrounded by candles, experiencing pin-drop silence while chanting Vedic mantras. A day at Swastik Wellbeing typically starts at 7 in the morning and wraps up by 9 at night.

 



A day spent at Swastik Wellbeing will be replete with different activities.
The food – Nothing less than a gourmet affair If someone mentions that your meals for the next few days are going to be unprocessed, unrefined, and naturally sourced, with no white sugar, no fried foods and white salt, the thought might excite you about eating clean. However, the constant worry of what if the food is bland might also cross your mind. Nonetheless, you are going to enjoy your meals at Swastik’s in-house restaurant, Rasa, because not only is the presentation impeccable, but the flavours could give any Michelin-star restaurant a run for their money. There is no use of wheat in the cooking, and almost everything is made using millet and fresh, farm-to-table vegetables. There is no concept of a fridge in their kitchen, as everything sourced for the day is finished well in advance, with preparations beginning afresh the next day.

 I initially thought that checking into a wellness retreat would mean meals devoid of flavour, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. The food is delicious and far exceeded my expectations. Chocolate mousse cake, gnocchi, cabbage rolls, dim sum - who on earth imagines a wellness retreat’s menu to be this promising and full of taste? The three days I spent there, I don’t recall them repeating any dish at any mealtime. Each meal, each dish, was crafted to perfection, with the menu specifying its carb, protein, and calorie content. If you’re someone who worries about controlled portion sizes (core tenets), fret not—they are more than happy to serve you a second or even a third helping based on your appetite. While Swastik aims to take charge of your wellbeing, starving you to achieve that is definitely not their approach.advertisementArchitectureOne of the highlights of the retreat is the villas, or guhas, designed for guest accommodation. Currently, 64 villas are functional, and the setup feels straight out of The Shire—a fictional region in JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, home to the hobbits.

What does that mean for the booming concert culture in India?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/coldplay-live-streamed-a-turning-point-for-concert-culture-in-india-2671463-2025-01-28,"Just a few months ago, we were talking about the seismic shift in India’s concert culture. More and more people are now willing to invest time, effort, and money to watch global music sensations perform live. The past year—and the start of this one—has been nothing short of extraordinary for India’s live music scene. In 2024 alone, we witnessed 11 global stars headlining concerts in India. The buzz-worthy ones included Dua Lipa’s Feeding India concert with Zomato, Maroon 5’s debut Mumbai show, Bryan Adams’ five-city So Happy It Hurts tour, and Alan Walker’s Walkerworld India tour. Though Rihanna and Justin Bieber didn’t perform for the public, their private performances at the Ambani wedding were enough to turn heads and add to the hype. Of course, any conversation about live music in India would be incomplete without mentioning Coldplay, at least that’s the case now. Coldplay concerts aren’t just events—they’re pilgrimages for fans who fight for tickets, scramble for hotel rooms, and book flights just to witness their magic live. Their Music of the Spheres World Tour this year in Ahmedabad was no different. The demand was sky-high, but what made it truly unique was the live-streaming element. For those who couldn’t make it to the stadium, the team’s decision to stream the concert gave fans across the country the chance to experience the magic. And it wasn’t a small crowd—an estimated 8.3 million people tuned in!

 This brings us to an interesting question: Are Indian audiences ready to go the extra mile to be part of live shows, or are they content enjoying the spectacle from the comfort of their homes?'Beginning of an era' Kiran Mani, CEO-digital at JioStar, reflected on the experience, saying, “This is just the beginning of an era where technology and storytelling come together to unlock endless possibilities in live entertainment.” His optimism is echoed by VG Jaishankar, co-founder and managing director of Hyperlink Brand Solutions, which handled the marketing for the Coldplay concert in India. According to him, this event has opened up new avenues for concert experiences. “India has been a key player in live experiential events, especially since the resumption of in-person gatherings post-pandemic. Live streaming has become a natural extension to enhance the reach of concerts beyond physical venue limits.” Jaishankar also highlights the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead: “While the challenges of streaming rights and copyright laws still exist, advancements in technology and network capabilities have positioned India as a leader in delivering high-quality live content. I believe we’ve already crossed the transformative moment—what lies ahead is continuous innovation and refining execution to elevate audience experiences further.”Opportunities live streaming creates The digital age ushered in a new era for live music broadcasts. In the 1990s, the internet enabled the first instances of live streaming. Over time, as internet speeds increased and streaming technologies advanced, live streaming became more popular and accessible. Platforms like YouTube and social media networks started hosting live performances, giving artists the ability to reach fans directly without relying on traditional broadcasting channels. In India, while concerts are being celebrated as a boost to the economy--Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself vouched for their positive impact--live streaming emerges as a powerful add-on to the ongoing concert culture boom. The essence of a live concert lies in its immersive experience: buying tickets, soaking in the crowd's energy, and creating unforgettable memories. However, live streaming offers a new dimension, ensuring that fans who can’t attend due to ticket shortages, travel costs, or other constraints can still enjoy the magic. Jaishankar highlights this shift, noting, “This model also creates opportunities to enhance virtual experiences using AR (Augmented Reality) triggers, allowing remote audiences to interact and feel connected to the event in new and innovative ways. While the revenue potential of live streaming is still evolving, its ability to democratise and enrich the concert experience is undeniable.”Artists’ perspective How do the artists stand to gain or lose from all of this? Well, a small data will help you understand better. According to 2024’s year-end data from BookMyShow, India's live event industry has witnessed remarkable growth, this was before Coldplay performed in India. In 2022, the country hosted approximately 19,000 live events/gigs, and live concerts were only a small part of it. The number went up significantly in 2023, with a total of 26,359 events -- a 39 per cent increase from the previous year. Additionally, audience participation in live entertainment grew by 82 per cent year-over-year in 2023. This data should put the discussion to rest. “Artists, promoters, and producers now work cohesively to expand their audience beyond the venue. While the audience for live-streamed concerts in India is still growing, it offers a chance to experiment and learn. It can help overcome geographic and economic barriers, but the success depends on seamless execution, including reliable network infrastructure and production setups. With AR-enabled experiences, organisers have the opportunity to further engage virtual attendees by adding interactive and immersive elements to the live stream,” Jaishankar explains.advertisementWhat the target audience saysSurajit Dasgupta, a product manager and passionate concert-goer, has attended live performances by U2, Joe Satriani, Kodaline, The Lumineers, Parikrama, Pentagram, and Alan Walker. He was amongst the lucky few who managed to secure tickets for Coldplay's Music of the Spheres concert in India. Interestingly, he also watched the Ahmedabad show via live stream from the comfort of his home. Sharing his thoughts, he says:""You can never, ever compare the live experience to streaming the show. If I got tickets to my favourite concert, I would never ditch them for an experience at home, no matter how comfortable it is. That said, live streaming does help bridge the gap, especially for those who want to attend but can't due to reasons galore.""He further emphasises the irreplaceable magic of attending a concert in person: ""The vibe on the ground is everything compared to sitting at home and watching. Absolutely mesmerising! People who truly want to see their favourite band live will still go, regardless of whether the concert is live-streamed or not.""However, the concept of live streaming did stir up some debate on social media. Some fans expressed frustration that after struggling to secure tickets and meting with other expenses, the concert was made available for free to a wider audience. Addressing this, Jaishankar clarifies:advertisement""Live events are constantly evolving, and streaming isn’t new—it has been successful globally for decades. However, in India, it has the potential to complement and elevate the exclusivity of live experiences by creating hybrid formats. Streaming doesn’t dilute the magic of attending in person; instead, it allows producers to expand their reach while maintaining the core essence of live events.""Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 28, 2025

The actress, who is the brand ambassador of the luxury fashion brand, arrived in an ensemble from their Spring/Summer 2025 collection, which was nothing short of a sartorial statement. Her look was an amalgamation of regal and opulent elements. Sonam opted for a monochromatic look featuring a fluid sheer dress and paired it with a faux fur coat from the house’s Resort 2025 collection. Of course, don’t forget those long black gloves for an edgier finish. The look does feel like she channelled vintage Hollywood elegance (somewhat reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn’s iconic Breakfast at Tiffany’s look).

 As far as her makeup is concerned, it was put together by makeup artist Arti Nayar. Sonam opted for a dewy base, sculpted cheekbones, and softly defined eyes to enhance her striking features. She finished it off with a pink-toned lipstick. And that gorgeous bun—did you spot the gajra though? What a way to bring together contrasting elements. While you might feel a necklace could have elevated the look, those pearl earrings, reminiscent of a kanauti, did their job brilliantly, and of course, those earcuffs!

 The look was curated by Rhea Kapoor, Abhilasha Tiwari, and Chandni Modha.

Having attended Dior’s shows in the past as an admirer, stepping into this role as their first South Asian ambassador feels truly surreal.” “Dior has always been more than just a brand to me—it has been an integral part of my personal style journey and a creative partner in many of my films. Becoming a part of this storied legacy is both an honour and a responsibility, one that I embrace with great pride. I look forward to deepening my association with Dior and shining a spotlight on the incredible artistry of Indian and South Asian craftsmen, bringing their talent to the global stage,” she adds.

d856b5ab-54ac-4a70-857d-02c320724a02,"Male infertility on the rise: Why sperm freezing is gaining popularity in IndiaSperm freezing is a simple, life-altering option that ensures men can overcome challenges and secure their path to parenthood. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/male-infertility-on-the-rise-why-sperm-freezing-is-gaining-popularity-in-india-2671587-2025-01-29,"In the 1960s, India had a fertility rate of 5.92. This means that, on average, a woman would bear almost six children if she lived through her childbearing years. This figure was significantly higher than the ‘replacement level’ needed to maintain a stable population. Fast-forward to today, and there has been a significant decline in the fertility rate. According to the latest data, the fertility rate has dropped to 2, in 2023, which is just 0.1 point below the required replacement level (the average number of children a woman needs to have to replace herself and her generation). However, experts warn that even this small difference could eventually lead to a population decline.Why the drop? This drop in fertility rate can be because of various reasons, apart from the sheer rise in couples who don’t want to have kids. Apart from this, both data and experts suggest that there has been a clear increase in infertility amongst Indians.  For men, this means, if we go by the definition provided by The World Health Organization (WHO), “the inability to make a fertile female pregnant after one year of unprotected intercourse”. In India, male infertility has become a significant concern, contributing to 40-50 per cent of infertility cases amongst young couples. This number is 15 per cent world wide. We asked various experts regarding the reason for this stark difference between India and various other nations, and the answers simply seem to come down to one thing: the changing lifestyle.

advertisementDr Durga G. Rao, co-founder and medical director of Oasis Fertility, explains, ""The quality of life we lead is significantly affected by environmental factors: pollution, pesticides, food adulteration, and the air we breathe, all of which contribute to infertility. Lifestyle factors like stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, and pollution also play a role in male fertility issues, making preservation more relevant now than ever."" Dr Durga G. Rao, co-founder and medical director of Oasis Fertility, explains, ""The quality of life we lead is significantly affected by environmental factors: pollution, pesticides, food adulteration, and the air we breathe, all of which contribute to infertility. Lifestyle factors like stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, and pollution also play a role in male fertility issues, making preservation more relevant now than ever."" Dr Sheetal Jindal, senior consultant and medical director medical genetics program Jindal IVF, Chandigarh, further adds that other factors include late marriages, demanding work schedules, obesity, poor diets, and lifestyle habits such as smoking, drinking, and drug use. All these have caused, in many men, particularly in their late 20s to early 40s, a dip in sperm quality and count, leading to the growing need for fertility preservation options. This is where sperm freezing comes in. Enter: Sperm freezing  With the increasing awareness of male infertility, sperm freezing has emerged as a viable option for preserving male fertility. Sperm freezing, or sperm cryopreservation, offers a solution to preserve sperm for later use. This is relevant in cases where men have a low sperm count right now and may face infertility in the future and also particularly in cases where men are undergoing medical treatments.  Dr Nishi Singh, head of fertility at Prime IVF, says, ""For men who are facing medical treatments that could affect their fertility, sperm freezing provides a crucial lifeline. Whether it’s cancer treatments, high-risk professions, or a desire to keep their options open, men are increasingly turning to this method."" The procedure typically begins with a semen sample, which can be obtained through natural ejaculation or, in specific cases, surgical methods.

 Dr Rao, says, ""The sperm sample is processed to remove impurities and mixed with a cryoprotectant before being frozen."" This ensures that the sperm remains functional even after thawing, preserving its ability to fertilise an egg when needed. These selected sperm cells are then treated with a cryoprotectant solution, which safeguards them from damage during the freezing process. The sperm is then stored at ultra-low temperatures in liquid nitrogen, where it can remain viable for years (20 years to be precise). In India, sperm freezing has become an affordable and accessible option, with rates ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per year for storage.  For men, there are no specific challenges that they face while undergoing sperm freezing (unlike women), but there’s a stigma attached to it (more about it later). But before that, is there a rise in sperm freezing?Is there a rise in sperm freezing? The trend of sperm freezing is on the rise, even in India. While the exact statistics are harder to come by, India Today spoke to various experts, and they all seem to agree that the trend is gaining momentum.  According to Dr Singh, this trend is mostly observed in men between their late 20s and 40s. ""The rising demand is linked to lifestyle choices, medical conditions, and the increased awareness of fertility preservation options,"" says Dr Singh.

 Moreover, men who may be exposed to high-risk environments, such as in certain professions that involve long working hours or hazardous conditions, are also turning to sperm freezing, according to the experts. The option gives them the flexibility to pursue careers without the pressure of immediate family planning.advertisementThe taboosDespite the increasing awareness around fertility preservation, sperm freezing continues to face societal stigma, especially in India. The concept of male infertility is often seen as a 'blow to masculinity', making it harder for men to seek out fertility treatments or sperm preservation. Experts seem to agree too. ""In India, sperm freezing continues to face deep-rooted stigma, stemming from societal expectations that equate masculinity with unyielding fertility. The idea that a man should always be capable of fathering children without medical assistance perpetuates this taboo, discouraging many from considering sperm preservation,"" says Dr Jindal.However, just like women have claimed reproductive agency through egg freezing, challenging these stigmas is essential for creating a space where men can exercise their reproductive rights and options without fear of judgment.Rise in egg freezing tooRiya*, a 28-year-old woman with endometriosis, was advised to freeze her eggs early due to the progressive nature of her condition. advertisementAnother, a 38-year-old, Sheetal*, sought egg freezing to extend her fertility window while still searching for a partner.

97f089cb-f541-4a42-8c38-8c4161400192,"Why Indian singles are choosing concerts over coffee datesAs time passes, the way we do everything evolves—including the way we date, a survey is proof!",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/why-indian-singles-are-choosing-concerts-coldplay-over-coffee-dates-2671976-2025-01-29,"Dating is longer about just swiping right because, for Indian Gen Z (also a few Millennials), the new-age romance formula is a mix of music, shared vibes, and real-world connections. According to happn’s (dating app) latest survey*, 74 per cent of Indian Singles consider concerts their dream first date, while 67 per cent have mentioned that live music events make dating easier. As India is going big on concert culture of late (and PM Narendra Modi promoting it too), it’s clear that concerts aren’t just about the beats, fandom, or dressing up cool - they’re becoming the ultimate matchmaking hotspots.Why concerts are the new dating ground You have realised by now that dating in 2025 is way different from what it used to be, let’s say five years back. Dating today means creating memories, and experiencing things together, which could mean going to a puppy yoga session or maybe a painting session with your date. And guess what, the rise of activity-based dating is reshaping how singles connect, and music events are playing a crucial role. Whether it means vibing to Coldplay’s A Sky Full of Stars or singing along at an Ed Sheeran gig, or maybe discovering indie talent at Lollapalooza, concerts are proving to be the ideal setting for romantic sparks.

advertisement Karima Ben Abdelmalek, CEO and president of happn, says, “Gen Z is reshaping the dating landscape, and our research shows that music is at the forefront of their social lives. Indian Singles are keen on activity-based dates and looking for new icebreakers. With India's music festival season in full swing, singles have a unique opportunity to break the ice and form connections in a vibrant, real-world setting.” Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing, says, “When two people share a live music experience, they're not just watching performances; they're participating in a shared emotional journey that bypasses the usual dating hurdles. The concert environment naturally negates the pressure of constant conversation while creating multiple opportunities for genuine interaction.”The power of playlist chemistry So, what are the common traits that you look for when you bond with someone? If taste in music and artists is one of them, well, you are not alone. 48 per cent of Indian Singles admit that seeing a favourite musician in someone’s dating profile can spark an instant attraction. Music is no longer just a means of entertainment – it is a personality trait, an emotional trigger and, of course, a love language that can make or break things. The survey also highlights:
74 per cent of Indian Singles use music as an icebreaker when meeting someone new.
79 per cent believe that music sets the mood for romance, proving that your playlist choices can make or break first impressions.
76 per cent love discovering new music with someone special, turning shared gigs into potential love stories.
Why music sets the tone Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai, believes that live concerts create an unspoken language of intimacy. “Concerts are basically the new dating thing because they foster a collective emotion—whether it's sadness, happiness, euphoria, or nostalgia. The rhythm, the beat, and the shared energy create an unstructured space where people connect without words.” She further explains that the sense of synchrony in live music creates a deep sense of connection. “When you’re experiencing music with someone, you’re not just finding a date—you’re finding someone who feels like home.”Wait a minute! There is scientific reasoning too Did you know live music triggers the release of oxytocin and dopamine? Yes, that’s true. “The release of these hormones creates a natural high that people often associate with their companion. This biological response, combined with the shared appreciation for music, creates an instant connection that's difficult to replicate in traditional dating settings,” says Dr Tugnait.Final note You will probably believe it now if we say that concerts are becoming an unexpected but ideal setting for romance. You can assume this from the very craze and enthusiasm people have around concerts in India as a whole (otherwise how do explain people flying to Abu Dhabi for Coldplay concert after not securing a ticket in India?). So, if that the new trend we are looking at... so be it! **Please note: The survey was done on 2000 people from Tier 1 metro cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad)Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 29, 2025

But is it worth the hype?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/asian-influencers-are-embracing-diy-skincare-again-but-there-is-a-catch-2672055-2025-01-30,"""Run to your kitchen!""
""All you need are these kitchen staples""
""Whip up these DIY face masks with simple ingredients from your kitchen"" If beauty and skincare are your thing, your feed (like mine) is probably flooded with DIY videos of beauty influencers flaunting spotless, glass skin with nearly invisible pores, swearing that one ‘face mask’ changed their life. No, that’s not an exaggeration. Apparently, glowing skin and life-changing moments go hand in hand. These videos tend to have two things in common: first, the influencers mostly live in the West, and second, their ‘miracle remedy’ has been a ‘grandmother’s secret’ for centuries. Rice, honey, chickpea flour, and turmeric - according to these influencers- are (some of) the golden tickets to glowing skin. And for better gut health (which, of course, leads to glowing skin), the magic ingredients include garlic, ginger, turmeric, and more. These influencers spark curiosity by revealing their ‘holy grail’ skincare hacks. The videos go viral, and suddenly, everyone is raving about them. And since these magical ingredients are already sitting in most kitchens, people start slathering them on their faces or mixing them into drinks, often without any real research. Notably, these influencers often have their own brands, are going to launch one, or have an affiliation with one of the brands. Let's look at some examples. 'Okra for glowing skin' Zafeera, an influencer who goes by @byzareefa, has racked up over 4 lakh followers with just 48 posts. She’s best known for sharing face mask and drink recipes that promise glowing skin and a healthy gut, some featuring her brand. She shot to fame when one of her videos went viral, revealing the ‘secret’ behind her ‘perfect’ hair and skin. The magic ingredient? Okra. Yes, bhindi.

  In her clip, Zafeera declared, “I’ve been drinking okra water for six months, and here’s how it has absolutely changed my life [umm]. My bloating has reduced significantly because when okra is soaked in water, it releases soluble and insoluble fibre, which helps with bloating and digestion in general.” She also recommends drinking it 3-4 times a week. However, scientific evidence on okra’s benefits is pretty slim. Experts warn that overconsumption can lead to gas, bloating, electrolyte imbalances, and even kidney stones—so maybe don’t start chugging bhindi water just yet. Read more about it here. ‘The bird spit’ Another crazy trend, that also promised a glowing skin was a little bizarre, and it involves bird spit. Yes, you read that right. While some influencers swear by honey and turmeric, others have taken skincare to the skies—literally. This trend revolves around bird’s nest extract, derived from the saliva of swiftlets. Beauty influencers claim it’s packed with proteins, amino acids, and minerals that promise glass skin, deep hydration, and an otherworldly glow. This trend actually came from the kitchens of China, according to influencers.  One such advocate is Wendy Cung Ly, who went viral after crediting her flawless complexion to bird spit-infused serums and drinks.

 But before you start chasing birds with a collection jar, here’s the catch—while bird’s nest has been a prized ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, scientific evidence on its skincare benefits is limited at best. Experts also warn that mass production raises ethical and sustainability concerns. So, is bird spit the ultimate beauty elixir? Maybe, maybe not. But we have better options.  Here’s the link to know more. Horsetail for hair Israa Abdullah is a Pakistani influencer who lives in the UK. With just 800+ posts, she has managed to gather more than 8 lakh followers on Instagram. Her content? You guessed it right, DIY for hair and face masks.  One such product that she was seen promoting is her own brand of natural hair oil and toner made from horsehair, a perennial plant.  However, studies show something else. Even though, a 2010 study hinted that the horsetail could be a natural source of antioxidants and beneficial phytochemicals. But a 2019 research review concluded that there’s simply not enough evidence to rate horsetail as an effective solution for hair loss.

 So, while horsetail might pack some antioxidant power, don’t start brewing it for hair growth just yet, as its ability to regrow hair is still unsure.  Until more solid research emerges, your best bet might still be tried-and-tested hair care routines—minus the herbal guesswork. Such examples are never ending. The problem with DIY remedies DIY skincare and haircare trends might seem like the ultimate beauty hack—easy, affordable, and all-natural. But the truth is, what works for one person might not work for another. We know that the influencers promoting it have the flawless dream skin that you want to achieve, but remember:  Every skin type is different with unique sensitivities, concerns, and reactions. A remedy that gives someone glowing, clear skin might leave another with irritation, dryness, or breakouts. The same applies to hair—factors like scalp health, hair texture, and underlying conditions all influence how an ingredient will react. This also goes for what you put in your body.  Moreover, time is also changing.  Dr Deepali Bhardwaj, a Delhi-based dermatologist, says our environment and food habits have changed significantly, so our skin now needs advanced care to achieve the desired texture. “Things have drastically changed since our parents' time. The biggest difference is that we've become more exposed to chemicals than ever before. Compared to them, we face higher pollution levels, less nutritious food, and, in many cases, even unhealthy water. And we’re dealing with increased stress, free radicals in the air, smoke, and pollution,” she explains. So, remember, without proper research or professional guidance, blindly following viral DIY trends can do more harm than good. Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s safe for everyone.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 30, 2025Trending Reel

0f575fab-64ff-4c1c-af77-9b918c6ab33b,Swastika Mukherjee calls out Uber: When 'pet-friendly' isn't enoughSwastika Mukherjee called out Uber after an incident highlighted the gaps in their newly launched 'pet-friendly' feature on their app.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/swastika-mukherjee-calls-out-uber-when-pet-friendly-isnt-enough-2672512-2025-01-30,"Among the many challenges pet parents face, finding a reliable cab service to take their furry friends to and fro remains a major hurdle. On Thursday, actress Swastika Mukherjee called out ride-hailing giant Uber after an incident highlighted the gaps in their newly launched ‘pet-friendly’ cab service.What actually happened Rakshita Singh, who runs the Dulaar Amanat Foundation, an NGO in Delhi, called out Uber for its ‘lack of compassion’ towards pet animals. She was frustrated with Uber’s newly launched ‘Uber Pet’ feature, which allows pets to accompany their owners but at a significantly higher price. For a regular five-kilometre ride to her mentioned destination, Uber quoted a price of Rs 150, whereas the same trip under ‘Uber Pet’ shot up to Rs 487—almost three times the original fare.

 



The puppies in question.
 Rakshita had booked an Uber Go from Chhawla, New Delhi, to Dwarka to take six rescued puppies to a pet clinic for a check-up, one of whom was in critical condition. When the cab arrived, she placed the baskets with the pups inside, but after entering the OTP, the driver asked what she was carrying. Upon learning they were puppies, he immediately refused the ride, insisting she cancel and book a ‘pet taxi’ instead. Until that moment, Rakshita hadn’t been aware of the pet taxi feature.

 “I pleaded with him, explaining that it was a medical emergency and we needed help immediately. He said that if he had known we were taking dogs to the hospital, he wouldn’t have accepted the ride and insisted we remove the pups from the cab,” Rakshita told India Today. With no other option, she tried booking the Uber Pet service but was shocked by its steep pricing. Following her experience, she demanded answers, particularly regarding the lack of detailed information about the size and layout of the pet-friendly taxis.

 



Screenshot shared by Rakshita Singh.
 Swastika Mukherjee, who closely works with Rakshita’s NGO, later shared her post on Instagram, which sparked a discussion online. India Today tried to find out if there's any truth to these claims. We checked the pricing for both the features - 'Uber Sedan' and 'Uber Pet' - for a distance of about 4km, and this is what we found:

 



We found a whopping difference of Rs 388.
What the policy says Uber’s official website states that service animals are allowed at all times, while non-service animals are permitted at the driver’s discretion. Under the ‘Uber Pet’ feature, which was introduced in Bengaluru last year, riders can travel with pets, but only one is allowed per ride. When India Today reached out to Uber this is what a spokesperson said, “We introduced ‘Uber Pet’ to meet the growing demand from pet owners who want an easy way to travel using Uber with their furry companions. It ensures that there is a safe and convenient ride available when you are travelling with your pets while providing additional earning opportunities for drivers.” “The surcharge for ‘Uber Pet’ covers the costs associated with vehicle cleaning and maintenance to ensure that the car is ready and comfortable for subsequent riders,” he added.The problem with ‘pet-friendly’ Rakshita Singh’s experience is not an isolated one - pet parents across India frequently struggle with transportation, accommodations, and public spaces that claim to be pet-friendly but fall short in practice. Ayush Das, a 20-year-old engineering student with five dogs, shares his frustration: ""Travelling with pets is a nightmare. Cabs, hotels, and even cafes often don’t allow them. You need to keep searching and enquiring before your needs and theirs (pets) align. Limited carriers like Air India permit pet travel, but securing train bookings is another hassle. We've stopped taking our pets out - not by choice, but due to a lack of options."" Rashi Narang, founder of pet-care brand Heads Up For Tails, emphasises the need for change: “Travelling with pets should be a positive experience, not a struggle. I hope for a future where all pets can travel safely and comfortably with their families.""The cost factor Beyond accessibility, affordability is another major hurdle for pet parents. ""Raising a pet today is like raising a child,"" Das adds. ""A 1kg pack of quality dog food costs around Rs 1,000 and lasts barely a week for an adult dog. Add grooming, vet visits, and other expenses - especially for specific breeds - and it becomes a significant financial commitment. While it may seem otherwise, having a pet is not a luxury for some, they do it out of sheer love and compassion,” he says.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 30, 2025Must Watch

Gym memberships, healthy snacks, organic groceries, protein supplements, and more can quickly burn a hole in our pockets. As a result, some people feel guilty about spending so much yet continue doing so, while others opt for cheaper but often ‘unhealthier’ alternatives. If you also feel that the healthier you try to eat, the more you have to spend, you’re not alone. If you search for this question on the internet, you’ll find various Reddit users with the same concern, sharing their experiences of how ‘healthy’ items often cost more than regular food (which is already expensive—thanks, inflation). A recent two-year analysis by the Food Foundation found that, for 1,000 calories a day, a basket of healthy food costs more than double that of less healthy options.

 



Healthy is the new expensive. Photo: Getty Images
 That means if you want to get 1,000 calories a day from healthy items like fruit and vegetables, it will cost you more than the same amount of calories from less healthy options, such as ready meals and processed meats. Now, for full disclosure, even though this study compares food prices in the United Kingdom, the situation in India is no different. Let’s take an everyday example. How many times have you gone to a fast-food chain and ordered your favourite burger? Now, if you’re on a health kick like me, chances are you’ve asked them to replace the regular refined flour buns with wheat ones. But of course, making an unhealthy burger slightly healthier comes at a price—you have to pay extra. In the end, you either end up paying more or decide to skip the wheat bun altogether. But why is there a difference in price? We tried figuring it out.The quest for healthy food  India Today spoke to various experts, and they all agreed that eating healthily is important, but such products are often sold at a higher price. To explore this further, we used third-party apps to compare the prices of 'unhealthy' and 'healthy' versions of the readily available items like rice, bread, fruits, and juices on platforms such as Swiggy Instamart and Blinkit. We ensured consistency by selecting food items from the same brand wherever possible. And the results were shocking, to say the least.1. Brown rice vs white rice We started with a staple found in almost every household – rice, and compared the two options available: brown and white. At its core, brown rice and white rice differ in nutritional value, texture, and taste. Brown rice is generally considered healthier as it's less processed and retains more nutrients. However, if you opt for brown rice, 1 kg will cost you around Rs 200, whereas the same amount of white basmati rice will cost you half of that, at Rs 100. This shows a whopping 100 per cent price hike for the two options from the same brand.

2. Brown vs white vs sourdough bread  For the second option, we picked bread, which is also another house staple, especially if you have a busy schedule. When it comes to choosing bread, there are plenty of options, but three of the most common ones are brown bread, white bread, and sourdough bread. Each has its own texture, taste, and nutritional profile. The healthiest one here is sourdough bread, as it goes through a fermentation process, which makes it easier to digest and improves nutrient absorption. Then brown, and then white due to the presence of refined flour and highly processed nature.  Now, let's look at the price difference. 

 



The steep price difference. Photo: Via Swiggy Insá¹­amart
 For the same brand and quantity (350-400 gm), you would have to pay Rs 30 for white bread, Rs 60 for brown, and Rs 150 for sourdough bread. 3. Snack options Out of the food that we consume, the most difficult one to quit seems to be our snacking habits. Rat snacking is not healthy, but today in the market there are various options that can be considered as a healthier snack. For this, we compared Makhana, or fox nuts, which is not only natural but is also gaining popularity due to its high nutritional content of protein, carbohydrates, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc. Let's compare its pricing to other readily available snacking options. 

 



Makana is slowly gaining popularity in India, but it is quite expensive. Photo: Via SwiggyInstamart
 For this, a 200 gm packet of makhana will cost you around Rs 500 (Rs 2,500 per kilogram), whereas bhujia, a popular Indian snack that is far from healthy, is sold at just Rs 330 per kilogram (smart snacking? uh, expensive snacking?). 4. Protein/Greek yogurt vs curd  Curd is a staple in many Indian households, known for its creamy texture and probiotic benefits. It is made by fermenting milk with natural bacteria, which helps improve digestion and gut health. But if you want more protein and nutrient value from your curd, protein or Greek yogurt should be your go-to. But how much more expensive is it than your regular curd? Have a look: 

 



Photo: Via Swiggy Instamart.
 A 400-450 gm pack of protein-rich curd will cost you around Rs 325, whereas regular curd is much more affordable, retailing at just Rs 35 (crazy much?)!advertisement4. Fruit juices vs real fruit After seeing these steep price differences, if you’re sweating and considering quenching your thirst with a healthier option, be prepared—your bank balance won’t be too happy. For fruit juices, we found a contrasting difference between the ones with high sugar content and the so-called healthier ones. Moreover, the fruit, it seems, is much more expensive! Take pomegranate, for example. On food delivery apps, 1 kg of the fruit costs around Rs 448 (without discounts). In contrast, 1 litre of ‘pure’ pomegranate juice costs Rs 450, while the processed, sugary version is just Rs 130!

Why so much difference?The examples can go on and on. Today in the market, the healthier options seem to be more expensive, but technically, it should not. Dietician Kanikka Malhotra tells India Today that ""nutritious foods can cost up to three times more than unhealthy options like processed foods and fast food."" The cost disparity is influenced by supply chain issues, climate change, and the marketing of convenience foods over healthier alternatives. ""Those in lower-income brackets often face barriers to accessing healthy foods and healthcare services, leading to a reliance on cheaper, less nutritious options that ultimately increases health risks and associated costs,"" she says. However, experts seem to believe prioritising health can result in long-term financial benefits. Debjani Gupta, a nutritionist and wellness expert from Mumbai, says that while staying healthy does incur expenses, it is a worthwhile investment compared to the cost of medical treatments and hospitalisations resulting from poor health. ""The sugar-laden processed food falls cheaper on the pocket than sourcing fresh fruits, vegetables, and unprocessed food—thanks to the food industry that has successfully been able to seep into our lives, palate, and more,"" she adds.Dietician Karuna Chaturvedi from Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida, further highlights how fitness and wellness expenses, including gym memberships, medical check-ups, and ergonomic furniture, add to the financial burden. She explains, ""Preventive healthcare, although cost-effective in the long run, does have a front-end financial cost. However, in the long run, prioritising health will decrease the chances of chronic diseases, saving money on medical treatments and improving the quality of life in general.""Are there actual practical solutions and alternatives?The good news? Eating healthy on a budget is possible—it just takes a little planning. Gupta strongly believes in utilising locally grown, affordable produce. ""Here comes our traditionally grown millets, variety of rice, lentils, and pulses into play. One does not have to buy quinoa, sourdough bread, etc., which comparatively costs much more,"" she suggests.Chaturvedi also encourages budget-friendly fitness options. ""Running, squatting, and push-up exercises are free, and one doesn't need a membership to a gym since working out outdoors in parks is free,"" she points out. However, she warns that while there are free alternatives to staying fit, they require more time and consistency.Malhotra provides some practical tips for an affordable, healthy diet:
Affordable protein sources: Lentils, chickpeas, beans, eggs, tofu, paneer, yoghurt, and peanuts offer essential nutrients and are comparably cheaper.
Complex carbohydrates: Whole wheat roti, oats, sweet potatoes, and fibre-rich millets provide long-lasting energy.
Healthy fats: Oils such as mustard or groundnut oil ensure good heart and skin health.
Seasonal fruits and vegetables: Go for buying produce in season, which significantly lowers costs while maximising nutritional benefits.
Additionally, Gupta emphasises the importance of hydration and gut health. ""Adequate hydration helps in optimal digestion, absorption, assimilation, and elimination,"" she says.Do you think healthy is the new expensive?  Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 31, 2025Must Watch

The collection was unveiled at Paris Fashion Week earlier this week, only it wasn’t just couture, it was a cathartic retelling of a life-altering event. At the heart of it all was Gaurav’s muse, his life partner - Navkirat Sodhi – who survived the accident which happened about eight months ago.A story born out of the ashes Eight months ago, a seemingly ordinary evening turned into a nightmare. A candle flame spiralled out of control, engulfing Navkirat in fire. As Gaurav rushed to extinguish the flames with his bare hands, he suffered burns himself, but Navkirat bore the brunt of it—55 per cent of her body was burnt. She was in the ICU for the next two and a half months fighting for her life as the doctors gave her a 50 per cent chance of survival.

 But Navkirat fought back. “She is a fighter and a survivor... she is a goddess,” Gaurav said in an emotional video shared on his official page. In the following months, as Navkirat treaded on a long road to recovery, the journey not just transformed their lives, but it left Gaurav with a creative vision, one that needs to be talked about (and is very much being done already).

 For Gaurav, Across the Flame is more than just a collection— it tells a story of “resilience, transformation, and the infinite light within all of us”. The collection draws from astral projection, a mystical out-of-body experience that Gaurav and Navkirat embraced during their recovery. Navkirat didn’t just inspire the collection; she embodied it. She opened the show, walking down the runway in a cream-hued draped corset gown - her scars visible, her presence powerful. All eyes watched Navkirat as she walked the runway, adding her poetic excellence to it all – an empowering moment for the world to witness, a moment of defiance, of reclaiming her story on the grandest stage of all.

About the collection A post shared by Gaurav Gupta (@gauravguptaofficial)
 The runway transformed into a powerful retelling of their journey - where each ensemble wasn’t just couture for the world to see, but a deeply personal and emotional expression of survival, resilience, and rebirth. The beauty of the collection was amplified by intricate details—20,000 Preciosa crystals catching the light like embers, ghungroo embellishments raffia and micro pearls, and celestial makeup that paid homage to their otherworldly journey. This season also introduced new colours like ochre, twilight purple, and space blue, symbolising transformation, alongside the brand’s signature shades of black, ivory, and metallics. Fire, the force that tested them, became an indomitable motif woven into the collection through form, drapery, and symbolism. The Twin Flame ensemble—an ochre masterpiece—embodies both the destruction and the strength that emerged from it.

 The entire collection offers a glimpse into their experience, with colours playing a crucial role in storytelling. Shades of black, dark purple, and blue point out the bruises and burns, while white represents healing and transcendence. The midnight blue metal breastplates resemble armour, signifying strength amid vulnerability, while traditional Banarasi brocades, woven with sacred chants, become wearable mantras of survival.

 For the first time, denim enters Gaurav Gupta’s couture universe—manifesting in the Bucket Corset and Distressed Bucket Jacket. Raw, rebellious, and defiant, these pieces mirror the journey of endurance and reinvention.More than fashion The collection reminds us of a quote by Alexander McQueen: “I think there is beauty in everything. What 'normal' people perceive as ugly, I can usually see something of beauty in it.” Much like McQueen’s philosophy, Across the Flame challenges conventional ideas of beauty. It finds grace in resilience, strength in scars, and poetry in survival.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 31, 2025Trending Reel

So, some couples indulge in maintenance sex to keep their relationship strong. But is it a relationship lifeline or just another duty?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/story/maintenance-sex-couples-love-bedroom-chore-2672803-2025-01-31,"Have you had sex with your partner when you are not in the mood? Or is it just another chore for you? Or are you pretending to be asleep before your partner gets into bed? Perhaps, you'll find comfort in knowing that dwindling sex drive is pretty common in couples.  According to a study by Johns Hopkins, sexual intimacy has a pattern. The first stage is - Couples, newly in love, are more excited, experience closeness and have regular sex. The second stage is - Once the couple has been in a relationship for more than three to four years, the freshness of the relationship wears off, and sex becomes routine. The third stage is - Once the couple starts a family, the couple's sex life takes a toll, mostly due to exhaustion and lack of private time. Many don't recover from this even after their child has grown up.  The study revealed that approximately one woman in 10 experiences a decrease in their sex drive at some point in life. This can happen due to several factors, such as career and family pressures, feeling overwhelmed, resentful, loss of connection, shift in priorities, juggling responsibilities, hormonal changes, depression, body image concerns and physical changes.  Men also experience a decrease in sex drive, commonly due to one of these reasons - physical changes, societal stigmas, erectile dysfunction or underlying health conditions. It is rare for two people to have matching sex drives. So, some couples make a silent pact (or a verbal one) to engage in sex in order to maintain their relationship, even if one or both partners aren't particularly in the mood. Though often unspoken, maintenance sex happens. But is it a relationship lifeline or just another duty?

advertisementBasically, maintenance sex is a couple keeping the sex up to ensure both people in the relationship are sexually satisfied. It is like maintaining a relationship with the help of sex just like we maintain the walls of our house with paint or the furniture with nuts and bolts.  Basically, maintenance sex is a couple keeping the sex up to ensure both people in the relationship are sexually satisfied. It is like maintaining a relationship with the help of sex just like we maintain the walls of our house with paint or the furniture with nuts and bolts.  ""It's a way to keep the connection alive and ensure intimacy remains a part of the relationship,"" said Dr Pallavi Abhilasha, associate professor at Christian Medical College & Hospital's department of Psychiatry in Ludhiana, Punjab. She said that some couples find that it can boost their relationship by keeping the physical bond strong and preventing feelings of neglect or distance, adding, ""people do it for various reasons, including maintaining intimacy, fulfilling each other's needs, or simply keeping the relationship healthy."" Even though it is hard to put a number to how common it is as it's a private matter and varies from couple to couple, but several sex experts say that maintenance sex should definitely be a part of the menu. A 2017 study revealed that couples that have sex once a week are the happiest. Another study in the US said couples who had sex more than once a week didn't report being any happier, and those who had sex less than once a week reported feeling less fulfilled. Mrudula*, a resident of Delhi, said, ""Yes, I have had sex with my partner when not in the mood and so has he. All's fair in love and sex, as long as it's mutual.""

 Sex is a way to remind your partner how much you mean to each other. But is it non-consensual or unwanted sex? Dr Pallavi Abhilasha said, ""While it might be termed as unwanted sex, it's still consensual if both partners agree to it. The key difference is that one or both partners might not be particularly enthusiastic about it at that moment."" To expect that your partner will always want the exact amount of sex as you do is not particularly practical. For some, sex is like hitting the gym - you don't want to do it initially but once you are done, you are satisfied. While there are others who think it is better to hit the gym once and then eat junk guilt-free the entire week.  Sharanya*, a homemaker, said that her bond with her husband is very strong but they just don't have matching sex drives. In order to avoid this one thing ruin their relationship, she said 'I just go along with it'.  ""For me, it's more about getting over with it. It is too time consuming and just seems like too much of a process. Sex once a week is an unsaid rule between my husband and me. We love each other and I am good at faking it, so, it is a win-win. It does not matter to me and I don't want it to affect my relationship,"" she said.

IS IT SEXIST? Some argue that maintenance sex is sexist and that one should only have sex when they are 'in the mood'. But what happens when one partner isn't 'in the mood' and the other, with the higher libido, wants sex? This leaves one partner feeling hounded for sex all the time and the other pathetic for wanting it, leading to an unhealthy, sexless, and unfulfilled marriage. Sex plays an important role in a healthy and happy relationship.  Dr Pallavi Abhilasha explained this further, ""Whether it's sexist depends on the dynamics of the relationship. If one partner feels pressured or obligated to engage in maintenance sex, it can be problematic. However, if both partners agree and see it as a way to maintain their connection, it can be a healthy practice."" Couples might need or want to have maintenance sex to keep their relationship strong, maintain intimacy, or fulfill each other's needs. ""The drawbacks can include feelings of resentment or obligation if one partner feels pressured. It's essential for both partners to communicate openly and ensure that they're both comfortable with the arrangement,"" she said.

 A Reddit thread asking men on how much maintenance sex is enough in an otherwise healthy marriage, a user posted, ""There is a bigger underlying problem if sex is just duty or maintenance. I'd prefer no sex to duty sex and I'm a dude. Sex should be exciting and enthusiastic."" Another user posted, ""If it's just lay there expressionless and saying get it over with then no thanks. If it's active engagement with some play acting then I'm all for it."" Many echoed the thought that they would rather not have sex than go for maintenance sex. WHEN TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP? If you feel pressured into sex, speak to your partner. If force is involved, seek professional help. One must see a therapist or health-care provider if one feels fully sexually unsatisfied or is experiencing an unusually prolonged dip in libido.Published By: Anupriya ThakurPublished On: Jan 31, 2025

Among these innovations, if there is one name that is gaining a lot of attention recently in the medical field, it is precision medicine.  Precision medicine at its core stands out as a revolutionary approach that tailors treatment to people based on their genes. But can it help in transforming how we treat diseases, particularly cancer?  In an exclusive interview with India Today, Dr Shitij Kapur, Vice-Chancellor & President of King's College London, talked about precision medicine and its applications. What is precision medicine exactly? ""For a very long time, we’ve always been making a diagnosis and offering a treatment that was just medicine as usual,"" says Dr Shitij Kapur.  Traditional medicine relies on a broad approach where patients with the same illness receive similar treatments. However, precision medicine allows doctors to identify subtypes of diseases, tailoring treatments accordingly.   ""A diagnosis like breast cancer gets broken into smaller entities. When you do the genetics of it, you realise there are, let’s say, four types of breast cancer,"" he explains.  By identifying these genetic differences, doctors can prescribe targeted treatments that improve patient outcomes.How can it help with cancer? Precision medicine has made significant strides in oncology. Cancer, once classified as a single disease, is now understood to have multiple variations based on genetic mutations. This understanding allows doctors to select therapies that specifically target these mutations.

 “At one level, someone has breast cancer, but then when you do the section of it and when you do the genetics of it, you realise that there are, let's say, 4 types of breast cancer. They look the same, the symptoms may be the same, but you realise that either the person's genetics or the cancer's genetics are different, and then the treatment is targeted based on that,” says Dr Kapur.Can you afford it? Even though precision medicine leads to better outcomes, affordability remains a concern. “The latest new medicine has come for a brain disease called metachromatic leukodystrophy. A single treatment [through precision medicine] for one person for that disease costs 4.5 million US dollars. No person can afford it even in the United States where it is being offered; it is only offered in the context of insurance,” Dr Kapur points out.  The economic model of precision medicine, where treatments apply to smaller patient groups, means drug prices remain high. Despite this, experts like him are hoping that as technology advances, the cost-effectiveness of these treatments will improve.How can AI help here? Unlike other fields like travel, fashion, food, and more, artificial intelligence here, too, is playing a crucial role in enhancing precision medicine by improving predictive healthcare. AI analyses vast datasets, identifying patterns in genetic and lifestyle factors that can predict disease risks.  ""If I just ask someone about their family history of diabetes, I can predict their risk. Now, AI enhances this by analysing detailed genetic and lifestyle data,"" Dr Kapur explains. However, apart from its steep pricing, precision medicine is not yet widely available for Indians, like high blood pressure and diabetes medicines are.  “The hope is that this principle of using your genetics to guide your treatment across a big diagnostic category like blood pressure or heart disease will lead to better treatments, and we hope that they'll keep coming,” Dr Kapur concludes.

In short, the quest for longevity has become the talk of the town, with people hoping to live as long as they can (more than 100). This means eating clean, working out, getting red light therapies, taking supplements, and making frequent doctor visits are just part of it. At the forefront of this movement is Bryan Johnson, a millionaire entrepreneur and founder of Blueprint, a website where he showcases his lifestyle and encourages others to follow suit. He is often credited with coining and popularising the phrase on social media. Netflix also recently released a documentary on his lifestyle, 'Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever'.  One term that has emerged alongside Johnson’s longevity journey is biohacking—the practice of optimising the body and mind through science, technology, and lifestyle changes. But is it true, or just a fad? Let's delve into it. What is biohacking exactly? The logic behind biohacking is simple: to make yourself live a healthier life, by taking matters into your own hands. It includes various methods aimed at enhancing human health, performance, and overall well-being through self-experimentation and biological modifications. It is often referred to as ""do-it-yourself biology,"" as to biohack your way through life, one needs to make gradual adjustments to your lifestyle, diet, and even their biology to boost their physical and mental abilities. But biohacking comes with a price - quite literally.  With healthy food being already expensive, there are costs of biohacking which include a hefty medical bill for treatments and supplements and more. Bryan's obsession with Biohacking In 2013, after selling his company to eBay’s PayPal for $800 million, Bryan had plenty of options on how to spend his fortune. He could have travelled the world, bought a mansion, and lived a life of luxury. But instead, he decided to dedicate his life to chasing immortality through biohacking (yes, we are not joking).

 His way of 'biohacking' involves Bryan starting his day at 4:30 am, and, by 11:30 am, he’s done with dinner. His daily routine includes light therapy, and taking 111 supplements. Experts and various people call it 'extreme' for obvious reasons. But the real question is - can you actually bio hack in real life?'Biohacking is a Sci-fi concept'In an exclusive interview with India Today, Dr Shitij Kapur, Vice-Chancellor & President of King's College London, says, ""At the moment, biohacking remains a sci-fi concept. It needs much better evidence before being considered a legitimate approach to longevity.""

Well, anecdotal evidence suggests that younger generations are grappling with issues like brain fog and declining mental clarity. So, does that mean early onset dementia is becoming more and more common? In an exclusive interview with India Today, Dr Shitij Kapur, Vice-Chancellor and President of King's College London, addressed this concern.   ""Yes, early onset dementia is a reality,"" he confirmed. ""People who get dementia, things like Alzheimer's disease, the onset would be around 70+ and after 70, with every extra year you live, the risk that you might get Alzheimer's disease increases. Some data suggest that by age 90, the number could be as high as one in four. There is also a much smaller subset of people who develop dementia in their 50s and 60s, known as early onset dementia."" However, Dr Kapur was quick to clarify a common misconception. ""If the question is whether dementia itself is appearing earlier in life, the answer is no. What is happening is that our detection systems have improved. Previously, many people with early onset dementia might have remained undiagnosed for years. Now, better tests, increased MRI availability, and improved diagnostic tools are leading to earlier identification."" Dementia rates aren't necessarily rising among the younger generation, but you can't overlook the prevalence of cognitive complaints such as brain fog. Gen Z, in particular, reports experiencing these symptoms, and several Reddit confessions reflect the trend. The issue even resonates on platforms like TikTok, where terms like ""Brain Rot"" have gone viral, with the phrase being named Oxford's Word of the Year in 2024.
 


 Experts suggest that while brain fog and attention issues may feel alarming, they are not synonymous with dementia. Factors such as chronic stress, sleep deprivation, poor diet, and constant exposure to digital stimuli often contribute to these symptoms. Unlike dementia, which involves irreversible neurodegenerative changes, brain fog is usually reversible with lifestyle adjustments.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 2, 2025Trending Reel

eb812f61-0050-48b6-9355-8b2a025c6443,Top Indian chefs share the biggest food trends for 2025What will this year look like when it comes to the food scene? Top chefs and restaurateurs decode.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/food/story/whats-driving-the-big-food-trends-in-india-in-2025-2674405-2025-02-04,"The way we eat is about to get a major shake-up or let’s just say that 2025 is going to witness a lot of firsts when it comes to food and dining. From high-protein innovations to seaweed cocktails, this is shaping up to be a year of bold culinary experimentation and mindful dining. As chefs push boundaries and diners crave authenticity, the food scene is evolving like never before.Protein and sustainability will rule the charts Most people who prefer taking the healthy route in their food habits look for just one important ingredient in food labels – protein. So, how can it not make it to this year’s top trend prediction? ""Protein is no longer just about powders and shakes,"" says Chef Shantanu Gupte. ""We’re seeing a shift towards whole food sources-plant-based proteins and naturally high-protein ingredients."" Menus are adapting to this demand, with high-protein items taking centre stage, and packaged goods proudly highlighting their protein content. This growing awareness around protein intake is set to rise even further.

 



Protein is no longer just about powders and shakes. (Photo: Unsplash)
advertisement Chef Ishijyot Surri, executive chef and founder of Mulk, Miniyaturk and SJI Gourmet, agrees. He also mentions that elevated plant-based cuisines which celebrate vegetables, legumes, and grains over simple meat substitutes, will be embraced. Sustainability will continue to be a key factor in shaping food trends in 2025. Chef and author Varun Inamdar talks about the importance of eco-conscious choices such as plant-based fine dining. ""I tried plant-based seafood in its beta stage in Thailand, and it most certainly has the potential to burst onto the culinary scene,"" he shares. As more chefs experiment with sustainable ingredients, plant-based options are set to become an integral part of fine dining experiences. ""Sustainability is no longer optional—it’s a necessity,"" Chef Surri reiterates. Expect to see plant-based seafood like lab-grown tuna and prawn alternatives take off, alongside functional mushrooms like Lion’s Mane and Reishi making their way into wellness foods and meat substitutes.Regional cuisine representation When it comes to cooking philosophy, authenticity is taking over aesthetics. ""We’re moving beyond just making food look good; it’s about using indigenous ingredients and telling a story,"" Chef Gupte emphasises. From the Himalayas to the Northeast, regional flavours are making their way onto mainstream menus. ""For years, Indian cuisine in restaurants was synonymous with Punjabi food (think chicken tikka, butter chicken), but now, we’re seeing more from Kerala, Karnataka, the Northeast, and Himachal Pradesh. This diversity is redefining Indian dining,"" he states.

 



Himachal Pradesh's Siddu is slowly but steadily entering the national food scene. (Photo: Unsplash)
 ""Indian cuisine is also embracing neo-regional inspirations,"" says Chef Inamdar. ""Expect dishes like Crabs Thecha Thermidor, Dahi 'Pie Tee' Chaat, and Lucknowi Iconic Liquid Kebab to make waves.""Massive transformation in the beverage scene We all know how much Gen Z have an impact on almost all social and economic spheres and of course, the food and beverage scene wasn’t going to escape, was it? Gen Z is reshaping the beverage scene too. ""Gen Z is driving a shift towards lighter spirits and curated cocktails. The era of heavy spirits is giving way to ingredient-driven cocktails with unique, refreshing profiles. Menus featuring innovative cocktail combinations are on the rise,” says Chef Gupte.

 



Zero-proof alcohol not only taste like traditional spirits but are also super-low on calories.
 There is no denying that people have been taking their health more seriously and making some wise decisions when it comes to their well-being. Hence, alcohol is going to take a backseat in the coming days. ""There’s a growing demand for lighter spirits and ingredient-driven cocktails,"" says Chef Gupte. ""The era of heavy liquor is making way for mindful drinking—think herbal, fruit-forward, and refreshing cocktails.""The sweet but spicy revolution Sweet and spicy combinations are expected to take the food world by storm in 2025. Shivani Sharma, Chefpreneur and founder of Gourmestan, believes the Swicy trend (sweet + spicy) will define the year. ""This innovation ranges from swicy sauces to even snacks and desserts,"" she explains. ""Imagine swicy cayenne dark chocolate bars or jalapeno mango fruit salsas."" Swiccy caters to the ever-growing appetite for global fusion tastes: South American, Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine, and so many more.Coffee as a culinary ingredient Coffee as a beverage is too mainstream, and this year, it will make it to your dining table too, at least that’s what Chef Gupte predicts. There is a growing trend of coffee-infused dishes, and chefs experimenting with unique flavour profiles. ""Coffee is evolving beyond the cup. In 2025, expect to see coffee-flavoured avocado dishes and coffee-baked sausages,"" he reveals. The versatility of coffee as a flavouring ingredient will make its way into a wide range of foods, from savoury to sweet.Fresh ingredients Health and well-being is going to define numerous trends and farm-to-table is one of them. Chef Shiva Shanmugam, executive chef at IBNII, Coorg, explains, “One of the biggest food trends of 2025 is the shift towards farm-to-table dining, where ingredients are sourced as fresh and local as possible. People are willing to eat fresh and invest in health, therefore seasonal, organic produce, fresh from the farm, will take centre stage and restaurants will cater to it.”

 “This not only enhances the taste of the food but also minimises the carbon footprint associated with industrial food production, transportation, and processing,” he adds.advertisementAI transforming the food sceneYes, we are aware the buzz began in 2024, but the trend will not just stay in 2025 but it will expand and reach new heights.""Technology's role in the food industry is expanding rapidly. From AI-driven consumer data collection to personalised dining experiences, tech is reshaping how we eat. Expect to see more digital menus, robotic kitchen assistants, and AI-powered tools enhancing restaurant operations,” predicts Chef Gupte.

""Cloud kitchens are becoming more efficient with the help of AI, while software solutions offer hyper-customised dining experiences. The integration of technology isn't just a trend; it's becoming an essential part of the culinary landscape,” he adds.Pistachio superpowerIf you are to believe Shivani Sharma, pistachios have their sights set on the spotlight for 2025. “These nuts have long been recognised for their vivid green colour and creamy taste, what sets them apart though is their powerful nutritional profile. It is for this reason that pistachios seem to be gaining immense popularity as a multipurpose garnish for both sweet and savoury dishes. Pistachio butter and pistachio milk are already in the works for high gourmet pastries and dominating the plant-based dairy aisle,” she says.

Furthermore, pistachios will continue to have a broad range of culinary applications. “They serve as an ideal oil for drizzling on salads and even soups, while the nuts' earthy flavour serves as an inspiration for new takes on pesto, desserts, cocktails, and so much more. Not only are pistachios delightful to taste, but they are also eco-friendly option due to the minimal water requirement compared to other nuts.”Final bitesThe way we used to think about food, let’s say, five years ago, has changed massively now.

Elaborate 10-step skincare routines, an obsession with multi-step skincare, sheet masks, rice water, and snail mucin are all courtesy of the K-beauty trend in India.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/is-k-beauty-craze-trend-in-india-overhyped-2674922-2025-02-05,"All things Korean—be it food, movies, shows, music, fashion, or beauty—have taken the world by storm and become a global phenomenon in recent years. In India, this K-craze is no exception and can easily be deemed unstoppable. One particular sector that has witnessed significant growth in the Indian landscape is Korean beauty. Whether a skincare enthusiast or not, K-beauty is a term well-known among young Indians. Elaborate 10-step skincare routines, an obsession with multi-step skincare, sheet masks, rice water, and snail mucin are all courtesy of the K-beauty trend in India. Statista’s revenue report on Korean beauty products in India makes this craze quite evident: in 2022, the market reached approximately 531 million USD, up from 389 million USD in 2018. It is further forecast to grow to over 1.3 billion USD by 2032. K-beauty stands out for its emphasis on a multi-step routine that focuses on deep hydration, natural ingredients, and lightweight, innovative formulations, all aimed at achieving and maintaining dewy, youthful, and supple skin.

 For many K-beauty enthusiasts in India, the craze began with the search for a sunscreen that leaves no white cast while providing effective protection. For others, it was the game-changing preventive lip care and deeply hydrating serums that drew them in. Snail mucin, a cult favourite, has gained immense popularity among those striving for glass skin. With the use of gentle yet effective ingredients like Centella Asiatica, Mugwort, and Green Tea Extract, Korean beauty has also become a go-to for those with sensitive skin. The growing craze is not without criticism, though. Dermatologists often criticise that it promotes ‘glass skin’ as the ultimate skincare goal, setting beauty standards. Additionally, Korean Beauty, a trend that has thrived on social media popularity, has also led to people using anything and everything on their skin just because they saw influencers doing it in viral videos.

 



Some popular K-beauty products in India.
 “The world of social media and Instagram influencers often promotes products that may not work for everyone and can even make skin more sensitive. While Korean skincare products are undoubtedly innovative and effective, they need to be used thoughtfully and scientifically—not applied blindly,” says Dr Deepali Bhardwaj, a Delhi-based dermatologist and founder of Elska Skin and Aesthetics clinic. SIs the K-beauty craze in India overhyped? Have you ever admired a Korean actor’s gleaming, glass-like skin while watching a K-drama and felt the urge to stock your skincare shelf with K-beauty products? The current Indian beauty market makes that quite easy, as K-beauty products are now readily accessible in India. In fact, several Indian brands also now promise the coveted ‘Korean glow’ and have ingredients that are typical of K-beauty game. Additionally, dedicated Korean beauty platforms like Purplle, Beauty Barn, and Kindlife.in offer a wide range of products from various brands.

 However, simply buying those products may not fulfil your dream of achieving that glass skin. “We (Indians) have some of the best skin in the world—not out of bias, but as a fact. Our skin tones typically fall under Type 4 and Type 5 on the Fitzpatrick scale, and our melanin-rich skin is incredibly diverse and unique. There's a phenomenon called ‘Merioski’, which explains how melanin reacts to sunlight. This reaction is crucial for dermatologists and skincare experts when formulating products to help us achieve our best skin. However, social media influencers often promote skincare products that may not be suitable for all skin types, ultimately leading to sensitivity and damage,” explains Dr Bhardwaj. Dermatologists stress that skincare products should be chosen based on factors such as skin type, concerns, and texture.

 



Dermats warn against overconsumption fuelled by the K-beauty craze. (Photo: Freepik)
 “Korean skincare promises to help with hydration, gentle exfoliation, and nourishing ingredients that can help give the skin a glowing, smooth look. Using products like cleansers, toners, serums, and moisturisers that suit your skin type can make a noticeable difference. However, one shouldn’t get carried away by any trend that goes viral on social media,” says Dr Rinky Kapoor. “If someone tries Korean products, the results may not be 100 percent effective and can vary from person to person. For some, they may work, while for others, there may be no visible change. It is imperative to understand your skin type, texture, and concerns, as well as your skin’s specific needs, and consult a doctor,” she adds. Meanwhile, Dr Rishi Parashar, chairperson, dermatology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, highlights another major issue related to the K-beauty craze in India: “The way people buy these products (often from Instagram, malls, or unverified sources) without scientific proof of their effectiveness is a major concern.” Dr Bhardwaj agrees and adds that Korean beauty products are innovative and effective, but they must be used scientifically, with an understanding of what works for your skin, rather than applying them blindly. However, many dermatologists praise certain Korean skincare ingredients, such as green tea, tiger grass, rice water, ginseng, and eggshell extract. “These products are more natural and genuine. They contain more antioxidants, offer greater benefits, and have fewer side effects,” adds Dr Bhardwaj. She also highlights how something as common as rice water can actually increase pigmentation for some people if overused. Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics, Mumbai, warns against overconsumption fuelled by the K-beauty craze. “People buying too many products without understanding their skin’s true needs can end up with skin woes that can steal their peace of mind. Don’t fall prey to any trends like this without weighing the pros and cons. It is a good idea to consult an expert before using any product,” she says.What’s happening in the K-beauty x India world? Korean brands continue to eye India as a major market, with many new players entering the scene. For instance, BTS sensation J-Hope’s sister, Ji-Woo, recently flew to India to promote her skincare brand, Neaf Neaf. She launched it in Delhi in December 2024 at Kosmos—a Korean culture fest. Mizon, a prominent Korean brand, also recently entered India through online platforms such as Amazon and Tira (Reliance Retail’s beauty platform).

 



Mizon products are not now available in India through Amazon and Tira.
 The offline availability of K-beauty products is also growing, with a presence at Nykaa and Tira stores. Moreover, dedicated K-beauty stores are now being opened in areas such as Humayunpur in Delhi - a popular hub for Northeast cuisine, Korean fashion, and beauty. Younger generations like Gen Z and Gen Alpha are at the forefront of this trend. “It is the rising population of Generation Zillennial and Generation Alpha who are driving its growth in India. Their strong affinity for global trends, social media influence, and global ambitions demanding the best beauty products from across the world have positioned them as the primary consumers of K-beauty,” says Manasa Garemella, co-founder of kindlife.in—a multi-brand Korean and Japanese beauty platform. Industry experts believe that the future of Korean beauty in India is set to shine even brighter in the coming years. This is already evident—not just in the growing number of products and brands but also with the arrival of Korean clinics (like KorinMi) and beauty treatments in the Indian skincare landscape. From viral Korean hair spas to snail mucin facials, one no longer needs to fly to South Korea to stock up on beauty essentials or experience a Korean skin analysis. “Trends like lightweight sunscreens and hybrid formulas are revolutionising beauty routines, captivating skincare enthusiasts across the country. K-beauty's cutting-edge technology and focus on high-quality, effective formulations ensure its enduring appeal, with numerous new launches expected to hit the Indian market,” shares Garemella. While the efficacy of K-beauty products is both praised and cautioned by Indian dermatologists, consulting a skincare specialist before using any product - Korean or otherwise - is always advisable. As for the hype, it has not lasted for over a decade without reason.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Must Watch

82710871-f74e-42da-9550-384112b4fab8,"How social media made investing 'cool' for young IndiansA recent report shows that 93 per cent of young adults actively save money, with a significant portion allocating 20–30 per cent of their monthly earnings towards future financial goals. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/how-social-media-made-investing-cool-for-young-indians-2674618-2025-02-05,"For Raghav Sharma*, a 25-year-old software developer from Delhi NCR, his work is his life. Not because he loves his job wholeheartedly, but because his job takes up a major chunk of his day, requiring him to be available almost all the time for his bosses. He says the company returns the ‘favour’ by giving him a salary that places him amongst the top 2 per cent of earners in India. This has often encouraged him to spend (uh, sorry, invest) a significant portion of his income in various assets. However, his investment preferences are not limited to the usual SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) and stocks; they also include options like US stocks and cryptocurrencies. Initially reluctant about investing, Raghav now spends most of his ‘free time’ exploring investment opportunities. When asked where he gets information about which stocks or crypto to buy or avoid, he admits he relies heavily on social media, particularly X (formerly Twitter).  “After finding promising recommendations on X, I do a bit of research online or consult friends who are into investing before putting my money in,” he says. The story is little different for Riddhi Agarwal*. The 24-year-old student, who earns money through side gigs and internships, tells India Today, she first learnt about investing through Instagram, which was a year ago. Now, she is not only investing herself, but has also taught her mother to do so. 

 



Increased awareness is prompting young Indians to explore diverse income streams. Photo: Unsplash
advertisementLike Riddhi and Raghav, a majority of young Indians want to or are investing their money. And for some, these options go far beyond the usual ways of investing.  Like Riddhi and Raghav, a majority of young Indians want to or are investing their money. And for some, these options go far beyond the usual ways of investing.  Fin One, a digital-first initiative by Angel One Limited, unveiled its 'Fin One: Young Indians’ Saving Habits Outlook 2024'. The data shows that 93 per cent of young adults actively save money, with a significant portion allocating 20-30 per cent of their monthly earnings towards future financial goals. The study also shows, for 62 per cent, YouTube is a primary source of education for savings and financial planning.‘Beyond SIPs and stocks’ A lot of young Indians are investing. However, for them, investment goes beyond stocks and SIPs. A December 2024 report by CoinSwitch revealed that India today has around 2 crore people investing in crypto. This majorly involves people from the age group of 18-35, including even smaller cities like Botad, Barbaka, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Patna, Kanchipuram, and Dehradun. This comes despite the Indian government not recognising cryptos as legal tender and imposing a 30 per cent tax on crypto income. Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred, which builds consumer tech for financial infrastructures, explains the boom amongst young audiences and their need for portfolio diversification. “For decades, stocks and Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) were the go-to investment avenues for young Indians. However, a new generation is emerging, armed with financial literacy and a hunger for diversification across multiple investment platforms, both traditional and non-traditional,” Tarun says. According to him, a major push has come from mobile apps that now enable Indian investors to invest in US stocks, crypto, and alternative assets, boosting the investor base. Other options include real estate crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, and digital gold, which offer avenues beyond traditional markets, appealing to tech-savvy millennials and Gen Z.

 



Various apps like Zebpay, coinswtich, Kucoin and more have enabled Indian investors to invest in US stocks, crypto, and alternative assets, boosting the investor base. Photo: Unsplash
 Another reason, according to Tarun, is the desire for quicker returns, pushing investors towards higher-risk, higher-reward options. “While stocks offer long-term growth, alternatives like cryptocurrencies and NFTs promise rapid gains, attracting a segment of younger investors,” says Tarun. Furthermore, the limitations of traditional investments have become apparent for the young crowd. ""Fixed deposits offer low returns in an inflationary environment, while stock market volatility can be unsettling. Diversification mitigates these risks by spreading investments across various asset classes. Finally, increased awareness of personal finance and a growing entrepreneurial spirit are prompting young Indians to explore diverse income streams and investment opportunities,"" he adds.  Apart from these, Harsh Gahlaut, the co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, says that the sudden increase in investing is also due to the rise of social media, which has gamified investing, glorifying high-stakes bets with promises of overnight riches.The gamification of investing ft. social media All the financial experts we spoke to seem to agree that social media and finfluencers play a major role in making investment 'cool'. Nitin Joshi, who once started his own business and is now a business content creator, is a name that often comes up when discussing finfluencers. Within just 94 days, he achieved an impressive 1M followers on Instagram. Finfluencer, he believes, can play a significant role in empowering people to invest smarter, especially through their content. He explains that by breaking down complex financial concepts into simple, digestible insights, finfluencers make investing more approachable for everyone, particularly beginners. “They [finfluencers] not only share valuable strategies but also help demystify key aspects of personal finance like budgeting, saving, and investing. This creates a pathway for new investors to build financial literacy, gain confidence, and make informed decisions, ultimately improving their financial well-being,” says Nitin. Sakchi Jain, a CA and finance educator on social media, who “simplifies finance from a Gen Z perspective” is another finfluencer who has gained a massive following in a short period of time. She points out that earlier, people mostly learnt about financial news through traditional media, which focused on market updates, stock movements, and economic events. But if someone wanted to understand the basics of investing - like how mutual funds work, what SIPs are, or how to build a portfolio - they had very few accessible resources. That’s where finfluencers have made a real difference. Instead of just sharing what’s happening in the markets, they explain the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of investing.

  “Through short, easy-to-understand content, we help bridge the knowledge gap, making finance approachable for beginners,” she says. Harsh further explains that often though, social media amplifies sensational content, fostering a herd mentality amongst investors. This results in a fear of missing out (FOMO) among young investors, drawing them to unconventional assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other unregulated products. But experts warn that this desire for quick gains often overshadows a key aspect of investing - risk management.‘How to become a millionaire by 20’ If you search online for methods to get rich faster, you’ll find yourself in a bubble of finfluencers offering all kinds of advice – ranging from how to build wealth quickly to how to become a millionaire or retire at a very young age and spend the rest of your life travelling 'like them'. Harsh warns that influencers [some, not all] often do more harm than good for investors, as their advice typically “overlooks the unique needs, goals, and risk tolerance of individuals.” “Their focus on creating engaging content, rather than offering responsible guidance, means they bear no accountability for the financial outcomes of those they influence. Only a qualified financial expert, aligned with your specific requirements, can provide truly valuable and personalised advice,” he says.   While finfluencers have contributed to greater awareness about investing, they’ve also amplified the ""greed factor,"" setting unrealistic expectations and encouraging risky behaviour, according to Harsh. “Many promote biased, promotional, or purely return-focused advice, neglecting the critical personalised aspects of investing. This has resulted in impulsive, thrill-driven decisions rather than disciplined, goal-based financial planning,” he adds. Tarun adds that such quick-rich schemes are rarely, if ever, sustainable. While the allure of rapid wealth is strong, true financial growth requires patience and a disciplined approach, he says.  



Building wealth is a marathon, not a sprint, and requires a steady hand and realistic expectations.

 “Chasing quick returns often leads to high-risk investments, which can result in substantial losses.  A sound financial strategy focuses on long-term goals, diversification, and consistent investing, even if it appears less exciting than promises of overnight riches,” Tarun says.  To tackle this, India’s market watchdog SEBI has often cracked down on influencers. The latest move came in January 2025, when it issued a draft circular restricting finfluencers from using the latest share price data when providing ‘educational content’. In August 2024, SEBI also asked finfluencers to register with them and adhere to specific guidelines - rules that even some finfluencers seem to agree with. For instance, Sakchi says SEBI’s intention behind the regulations is clear: to protect retail investors from misleading financial advice and ensure transparency in the financial content space. However, she points out that the challenge arises when all financial content creators are viewed through the same lens. ""There is a difference between those who provide educational content based on facts and research and those who promote risky or misleading investments. The current discourse sometimes paints all finfluencers in a negative light, which isn’t fair to those who genuinely focus on financial literacy and responsible investing,” she says. But how do you identify what is credible and what is not? Experts tell us.How to identify credible financial advice online? Tarun says to identify credible financial advice online, start by verifying the advisor’s credentials. Look for certifications such as SEBI Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) or qualifications from respected financial institutions.  Be cautious of individuals promoting specific products without disclosing any affiliations—transparency is crucial. Here are a few key filters to help identify credible investment advice on social media, according to Harsh:
Emphasis on goal-based investing: Trustworthy financial advice centres around tailored investment planning that aligns with individual goals rather than hype-driven strategies.
Avoid sensationalism: If the content prioritises excitement over solid financial principles, it’s a clear red flag.
Verify credentials: Ensure that the person offering advice has relevant financial expertise or certifications to back their claims.
Cross-check with credible sources: Reliable financial guidance is rooted in thorough research and data, not just personal anecdotes or opinions.
Customisation is key: Genuine advice recognises that every investor’s financial journey is unique. Be wary of generic, one-size-fits-all recommendations.
 Remember, investing isn’t about chasing thrills or following fleeting trends - it’s about building a disciplined, sustainable wealth creation plan. Social media can be a great learning tool, but blindly acting on trends without understanding the associated risks often leads to losses. Approach with caution and prioritise informed decision-making. (*names changed as per request)Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 5, 2025Must Watch

Experts share thoughtsThere have been numerous reports on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram where women have shared experiences of becoming pregnant after starting Ozempic. Many of these women had previously faced challenges with infertility, IVF, PCOS, and endometriosis.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/is-the-ozempic-baby-phenomenon-real-experts-share-thoughts-2675541-2025-02-06,"Ozempic helps with weight loss, but can it boost fertility too? Well, that’s what a bunch of videos on TikTok and Instagram claim. ‘Ozempic babies’—the term has started gaining precedence online after several women shared stories of their unexpected pregnancies after using Ozempic which is generally administered for weight loss and Type 2 diabetes. Now, most of you might wonder, so why it is even a big deal, right? Wrong! Here’s where it gets interesting. Most of these women who claimed they got pregnant after they started using ozempic had been struggling with infertility, IVF, PCOS, and endometriosis. So, does that mean that Ozempic boosts fertility too? In a video posted on Instagram last month, Demi Walker shared her experience with Ozempic. She recounted that, after encountering a TikTok trend about ""Ozempic babies""—stories of women who had been struggling with infertility, IVF, PCOS, and endometriosis falling pregnant while using Ozempic—she decided to conduct her own research. Despite years of trying various methods without success, she chose to privately purchase Ozempic as a final effort, fully aware of the need for caution and informed decision-making. After four months of consistent use, she administered her final injection and, within four weeks, discovered she was pregnant.

So, India Today decided to speak to experts who shed some light on the “Ozempic baby’ buzz.What exactly is an ‘Ozempic baby’?The term 'Ozempic baby' isn't a medical one. It's a phrase used by some people to talk about unplanned pregnancies that happen after taking Ozempic (a GLP-1 receptor agonist), a medication primarily prescribed for Type 2 diabetes and sometimes for weight management.Dr Sowmya K N, consultant – obstetrician and gynaecologist, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Kengeri, Bengaluru, explains, “Ozempic has been shown to help improve metabolic health, regulate sugar levels, and support weight management in women with conditions like obesity or PCOS. With weight loss, menstrual cycles often become more regular, improving the chances of conception. As a result, some women may find their fertility improved after using Ozempic for weight management.Any credible evidence?While there's no concrete scientific evidence directly linking Ozempic to increased fertility, there are some plausible explanations.“Weight loss due to Ozempic can improve ovarian health and hormonal balance, which in turn can enhance fertility in women, especially those with conditions like PCOS. It's well-documented that even a modest weight loss of 4-5 kg can increase conception rates by 40-50%. So, while it might not be a ""side effect"" in the traditional sense, weight loss achieved through Ozempic can certainly contribute to better fertility outcomes, but again there is no credible research to support this,” says Dr Sowmya.Have doctors seen this happen?Yes, some healthcare professionals have observed cases where women experienced improved fertility after losing weight with the help of Ozempic.For instance, Dr Manjula Anagani, clinical director, robotic gynaecologist and HOD, Care Vatsalya, Women and Child Institute, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, noted that weight loss and metabolic improvements through medications like Ozempic have enabled conception for women who previously faced infertility. “In practice, I've encountered narratives where weight loss and metabolic improvements through remedies like Ozempic enabled conception for women formerly facing “barrenness”. That said, births shouldn't be attributed to the prescription itself but rather to addressing underlying conditions,” she says.

However, according to medical literature, there have been a few reported cases of women conceiving while on this medication. So far, no major birth defects have been confirmed. However, as a precaution, it is strongly advised to discontinue Ozempic immediately upon confirming pregnancy, as there is a potential risk of birth defects,” she says.“Since this is a newer drug, more studies are needed to fully understand its effects on pregnancy and fetal development. If you are planning to conceive or suspect you are pregnant while using Ozempic, it is best to consult a healthcare provider for guidance,” she adds.Studies to support?At a stage where Ozempic is still being tested for its effectiveness on weight loss, it is very difficult to ascertain if it has a role to play in improving pregnancies.

There are just anecdotal reports at the moment claiming its efficiency.However, one thing that most experts claim is the fact that losing weight can improve fertility in many cases. A University Health blog suggests, “As a woman loses weight, there are fewer fat cells producing estrogen. This can cause the body to recognize that it isn’t already pregnant—and prepare itself to become pregnant.

Hold on, no need to give up just because of the title of this viral challenge.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/how-to-stick-to-phone-free-february-challenge-and-reduce-screen-time-2675803-2025-02-06,"A new trend on the block challenges you to reduce your screen time and go 'Phone-Free' this February. But hold on, no need to give up just because of the title of this viral challenge! In today’s digital world, it is nearly impossible for people to ditch their mobile phones for an entire month. That’s why this challenge - a non-profit campaign co-created by the Global Solidarity Foundation - offers two levels to choose from: Phone-Free and Phone-Flex. Phone-Free is the radical level, requiring you to give up your phone entirely for a month. However, there is also the more achievable Phone-Flex level, which focuses on reducing your phone usage and overall screen time. According to Statista, the average mobile screen time in India was around 4.77 hours per day.

 



Excessive phone usage is linked with increased risk of several health issues. (Photo: Pexels)
 It’s not uncommon for people to take their phones to the toilet and unknowingly spend 30 to 60 minutes scrolling. Similarly, they may pick up their phone to send a text or make a call but end up getting lost in mindless social media browsing. If you’re someone who struggles to put your phone down, you may want to take up this challenge - your health will thank you for it. Excessive phone usage is linked to several physical and mental health conditions, including eye strain, neck pain, back pain, loneliness, mood disorders, and sleep disturbances. Several studies also suggest that it is associated with difficulties in cognitive-emotional regulation, impulsivity, social media addiction, shyness, and low self-esteem. Unhealthy eating habits, migraines, reduced physical fitness, and changes in the brain’s grey matter volume have also been linked to excessive phone usage. On the contrary, cutting back your phone use by even one hour a day can have significant health benefits. Phones and social media apps are designed to be addictive. Cutting down your screen time will require you to challenge your dopamine boost loop. Why? Because your brain becomes accustomed to the constant dopamine hits you experience while using your phone - whether it’s from receiving a new message, watching a Reel, or getting a new notification. This cycle of instant gratification makes it harder to stay away from screens. If you want to rethink your relationship with your phone and cut down your daily screen time, here are a few tips to follow:Disable push notifications for unnecessary apps Begin by disabling push notifications from unnecessary apps like beauty stores, food delivery services, and even Instagram if possible. Many of us pick up our phones every time a notification pops up on the screen. You should also consider deleting unwanted apps.Start with mini breaks Challenge your brain smartly by taking several short screen-free breaks. Start with 10 minutes, then gradually extend them to 30 minutes and one hour. If you manage well, try a completely phone-free day once a week. However, if you experience heightened anxiety or panic attacks when taking phone breaks, it is advisable to consult a mental health expert.Have an ‘offline’ plan To avoid picking up your phone out of boredom, keep yourself occupied with other activities such as reading, exercising, colouring, doodling, walking, cooking, meal-prepping, or solving puzzles. Choose activities you enjoy. If you find yourself feeling bored, remind yourself that it is actually beneficial for your health.Don’t take your phone to the loo or bedroom This step can help in multiple ways. Taking your phone to the washroom is a recipe for disaster (it exposes you to various germs, increases the risk of infections, and can even lead to painful haemorrhoids). Similarly, using your phone before bedtime can negatively affect your sleep quality, leading to a host of health issues.

 



Beyond the obvious germ factor, taking phone to the loo invites a whole list of other health issues. (Photo: Getty)
 By avoiding phone use in bed and the bathroom, you not only reduce screen time but also protect your health.Let your friends and family know Inform your social circle that you’re trying to reduce your phone usage so you don’t feel pressured to reply instantly, making it easier to stay off your mobile.Remind yourself It’s all about training your brain. Keep reminding yourself why you are on this quest to reduce phone usage -find your ‘why’. Before picking up your phone, take a moment to decide what you want to do and for how long.

For some, it was tax relief; for others, it was the focus on science and development. However, it was also significant for Bihar, as the state received several key initiatives. One such announcement that caught people’s attention was the focus on makhana - yes, those fox nuts that have been a staple in Indian pantries for years. During the budget, Nirmala Sitharaman declared that a ""Makhana Board"" would be set up in Bihar. This initiative aims to enhance production, processing, value addition, and marketing of Makhana. Bihar is the largest producer of these nuts in India, contributing 80 per cent of the country’s supply, yet it has struggled to capitalise on the growing global demand for this superfood. “The board will provide hand-holding and training support to makhana farmers and will also work to ensure they receive the benefits of all relevant government schemes,” the finance minister said.‘The black diamond’ Makhana has gained popularity only in recent years. This rise can be credited to various factors (which we’ll discuss shortly), but its prominence isn’t just limited to India - it has also caught attention in the West. Industry players selling makhana both in India and abroad share the same story of increasing demand. Let’s look at the numbers. Data shows that India is the largest exporter of makhana worldwide. In the fiscal year 2023-2024, India exported approximately 25,130 metric tons of makhana. The top importers? The US, Canada, and Australia, with the US being the largest consumer.

advertisementIndia Today spoke to various snack business owners, and they all agreed that demand for this superfood is surging. India Today spoke to various snack business owners, and they all agreed that demand for this superfood is surging. But how did makhana become a global superfood? The superfood factor One major reason for makhana’s growing reputation is its nutritional value. Often referred to as a superfood, makhana is packed with essential nutrients, making it a must-have on a balanced diet. According to Rajeev Pabreja, secretary of the Nuts and Dry Fruits Council of India (NDFCI), makhana is an excellent choice for those aiming for weight loss due to its high protein and low-calorie content. “With high antioxidant and flavonoid levels, it helps combat inflammation and ageing,” he adds. Beyond weight management and heart health, makhana also aids digestion. “Its high fibre content helps regulate blood sugar and improves insulin sensitivity,” says Karishmma Chawla, functional medicine nutritionist and lifestyle educator. Deepti Khatuja, head clinical nutritionist at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, highlights that foxnuts are loaded with proteins, healthy fats (omega-3), vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. “They are rich in folates, fibres, and essential minerals such as magnesium, phosphorus, copper, iron, zinc, and vitamins B1, B2, B3, and selenium—many of which play a crucial role in strengthening the immune system and improving cardiac health,” she explains. With these health benefits and a rising trend of healthy snacking, makhana’s popularity has skyrocketed. Another reason behind its global appeal is the efforts of Indian entrepreneurs and brands promoting it as a healthier alternative to traditional snacks. Aashutosh Aggarwal, chief commercial officer of Snackpure, a brand selling makhana and other nuts, tells India Today, “Various health and lifestyle influencers have advocated the nutritional benefits of makhana. Recently, makhana gained considerable media attention after Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha, emphasised its potential as a superfood.”

— Nikhil Kamath (@nikhilkamathcio) January 17, 2025 Aditya Sameer Kaji and Aarti Kaji, Harvard graduates, founded Taali Foods in 2018 in the US as a healthy snacking brand. Today, Taali offers various snack options, with makhana being one of its top sellers abroad. The idea for the business stemmed from their own experiences - packing large quantities of makhana whenever they travelled from India to university. Taali was born as a way to introduce a healthy snack option to Western consumers. “We introduced makhana in flavours like Sriracha and Cheddar Cheese so that people would be encouraged to try it. Instead of just targeting Indian stores in the US, we placed our products in mainstream supermarkets like Whole Foods. We also rebranded it as ‘water lily pops’ instead of makhana,” Aarti told India Today, explaining their marketing strategy.

 Today, Taali exports to various countries, helping to push makhana beyond the NRI market and into the mainstream Western snack industry. When asked why they think the West is suddenly obsessed with makhana, Aditya smiled and said, “We’d like to think we [Indian snack brands in the west] played a small role in it.” He’s not wrong. Several brands like Taali, Farmley, and others are capitalising on the healthy snacking movement, marketing makhana in flavours suited to Western palates. This has encouraged not just NRIs but also Western consumers to try it. Aman Gupta, head of marketing at Farmley, a dry fruits and nuts business selling both in India and abroad, describes fox nuts as a nutritional powerhouse. “As India embraces a healthy snacking revolution, makhana stands out as a wholesome, home-grown superfood that aligns with modern dietary needs,” Aman says. PS: Bohana is another brand that sells popped water lily seeds and even made it to the US Shark Tank in 2020!

The Ayurveda in the West A post shared by Startups Global (@startupsglobal)
 When we talk about Ayurveda, most people think of medicine. However, did you know that at its essence, Ayurveda is a holistic system that also includes an ‘Ayurvedic diet’, a way of eating that focuses on fresh, seasonal, and nourishing foods using natural ingredients. With India being the birthplace of Ayurveda, many people in the West are embracing Ayurvedic dietary principles by consuming natural Indian foods. Ingredients like moringa, ashwagandha, and shilajit have gained popularity, thanks in part to social media influencers who highlight their benefits. Makhana has also benefitted from this trend.The GI tag In 2022, the Indian government awarded the prestigious Geographical Indication (GI) tag to Mithila Makhana, recognising its deep-rooted heritage in Bihar’s Mithila region. This certification is more than just a title - it helps protect the name “Mithila Makhana” from misuse, boosts its market value, and ensures fair earnings for farmers while also paving the way for increased exports. What makes Mithila Makhana so special? It’s not just where it’s grown but how. The flood-prone lands of Mithila and parts of Nepal provide the perfect mix of soil, water, and climate, nurtured by farming traditions passed down through generations. Packed with protein, magnesium, calcium, and iron, makhana is both nutrient-rich and culturally significant, playing an essential role in rituals like Kojagara Puja. With this recognition, over 500,000 farmers in Bihar stand to gain better incomes and improved livelihoods. Makhana now joins the ranks of other GI-tagged Indian treasures like Darjeeling Tea and Basmati Rice, carving its place on the global stage as a premium superfood.What can the budget do for makhana? Nearly 80 per cent of India’s makhana cultivation comes from Bihar’s Mithila region. To understand why a Makhana Board is essential, we must first understand how makhana is grown. Farmers in Bihar have turned a challenge into an opportunity by cultivating makhana in flood-prone areas. The process begins in March-April when seeds are scattered in still water bodies. As plants grow, their leaves float on the surface while seeds develop below. By monsoon, the water is drained, revealing thousands of black, marble-like seeds, hence the nickname ‘black diamond.’ However, harvesting is labour-intensive, with farmers manually collecting seeds from muddy waters. After harvesting, the seeds must be sun-dried, roasted in clay ovens, and hand-popped to create the crunchy, white makhana pearls. Despite this effort, makhana farmers face challenges. The supply chain involves multiple middlemen, inflating prices while leaving farmers underpaid. Makhana is also highly seasonal, leading to fluctuating prices, sometimes as high as Rs 5,000.

 Experts believe that with the formation of the Makhana Board and government support, production can be streamlined, ensuring fairer prices and better livelihoods for farmers. With the global makhana market projected to reach USD 177.7 million by 2025, this initiative could significantly boost India’s food industry. While business owners dream of replacing popcorn with makhana, there’s still a long way to go. However, there’s no denying that people are going nuts over it, and makhana is on its way to becoming a global superstar—sorry, superfood.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 7, 2025Trending Reel

But social media has turned the search into a paradox.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/indian-travellers-are-craving-offbeat-escapes-but-heres-the-irony-2676448-2025-02-07,"In the past, let’s say 15-20 years back, travelling used to be an annual or biannual affair. It would mostly mean family vacations covering places within India. However, the way we travel has undergone a massive change in the last couple of years, and a few factors are responsible for this—#1 being the influencer culture. After the pandemic, revenge travel gained the spotlight, and from what it seems, it never went down. Post-pandemic, people started travelling to different destinations as an act of revenge for missing out on two years spent in lockdown due to the pandemic. Travel influencers and vloggers also popped up around this time, telling people when, where, and how to travel. Now, when overcrowding has become a problem in the most-hyped destinations, people have started looking for alternatives - offbeat destinations in India and abroad - because, after all, vacations are taken for relaxation, and these underrated destinations offer that. India Today spoke to experts from the travel industry to weigh in on this evolving trend and what’s driving it.The rise of offbeat travel “This destination, just 3 hours from Delhi, has a view like the Maldives. I bet you did not know about this gem.”  - That’s it. That is enough of a hook phrase to get you glued to a Reel, and the next thing you know, you’re telling your partner, friends, or family about it, and voila, a plan is almost on. Everyone wants to travel to offbeat and lesser-known destinations because visiting one is a flex in itself, apart from everything else. According to Anil Lohia, COO of TripXL, Indian travellers are now seeking authentic, cultural, and unique experiences over traditional tourist hotspots. And this is the reason why there is a surge in offbeat tourism. Easy access to e-visas and visa-on-arrival facilities for Indian citizens has made things more convenient. ""Owing to the rising influence of social media, digital exposure, and the increasing growth in per capita income, Indians are travelling more than ever before,"" he notes. Similarly, Santosh Kumar, country manager for India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Indonesia at Booking.com, tells India Today that travellers are venturing beyond traditional tourist hotspots, driven by a desire for deeper cultural immersion, exploration of heritage and culinary delights, and meaningful connections with local communities. He highlights a surge in searches for lesser-known locations, with Shahdag (Azerbaijan) emerging as the top searched international destination in 2024.

 “With Indian travellers seeking new experiences, unexplored international destinations like Stepantsminda (212%), Baku (203%), and Troms¸ (185%) also emerged as popular choices. Domestically, travellers sought authentic experiences with destinations such as Perumbakkam (Chennai), Pangala (Karnataka), and Tekkumuri (Kerala) gaining popularity,” he says.Emerging destinations on the Indian traveller’s map As mentioned above, the post-pandemic period has seen an uptick in travel to more tranquil but breathtaking places. “Over the past few years and especially in the post-Covid era, travellers are increasingly exploring lesser-known yet pleasantly tranquil destinations like Turtuk in Ladakh, Chitkul, Tawang, and Chikmagalur in India. When it comes to international escapes, Vietnam, Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan make it to the top of the list as they offer an extraordinary mix of culture, adventure, and solitude.” Vaibhav Kala, founder of Aquaterra Adventures Ltd., further expands on this, pointing to a global wishlist that includes Georgia, Japan, the Dolomites in Italy, Wales, Panama, Morocco, Costa Rica, Mendoza in Argentina, Almaty, Bolivia, Chamonix, Gilgit.

 “Indians are travelling to these and more... Last summer, our Trek around Mont Blanc sold out in a fortnight on a hike across France, Italy, and Switzerland. Aconcagua near Mendoza saw Indians summit on Republic Day this year, and a summer Dolomites trek in Italy runs full,” he mentions.What’s driving this trend? As mentioned earlier, several factors contribute to these changing demands among Indian travellers. Vaibhav Kala explains that the increased spending power of young Indians, who are eager to explore new terrains, is one of them. Actor and travel blogger Shenaz Treasury agrees. She says, “With higher disposable incomes and greater travel awareness than before, young Indians are now exploring international destinations more frequently. When I was in my early twenties, most people couldn’t afford to travel abroad unless they were relocating for work or college.”

 Speaking about young people travelling more, Kala further explains, “The higher spending power among the youth of the country gets them exploring new territories and new grounds. With the recent tax breaks for people earning Rs 12 lakh, we will see a lot of that budget moving to travel. The youth are intrigued by the world, and travel has become easier in recent times with trade treaties that our government has signed with various countries. Getting visas and visa-on-arrival is changing the game for Indians looking to travel globally.” He adds that in the Instagram generation, everyone wants to have something to show and tell on their handles and create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) amongst those who haven’t discovered the world yet. This trend leads to people wanting to top the other in their discovery of destinations, food, fashion, etc. Moreover, Lohia adds, ""Affordable luxury, budget-friendly and tailor-made service options, and a shift towards cultural immersion have been pivotal in driving the trend of exploring unexplored places. Travellers are actively seeking traditional and rejuvenating experiences to escape monotony.""Does ‘offbeat’ even exist in the age of influencers? Shenaz Treasury breaks down the ‘offbeat’ paradox brilliantly. “Because of Instagram, all the hidden gems are coming out. People are looking for places that are not overcrowded. Goa, Manali, and Bali are flooded with tourists. Even Bali is full of Indian tourists now, along with Western tourists. It’s hard to enjoy peace because everyone is taking selfies everywhere, and it’s actually very annoying. I love to travel, but I start dreading going to places like this because I don’t want to deal with the crowds,” she explains. “There’s also the rise of remote work, which allows people to work from wherever they are. I’ve seen people working in Bali, Manali, and, of course, Goa. With flexible schedules, many are looking to spend more time in nature—but finding untouched nature in this country is becoming increasingly difficult due to overpopulation,” she adds.Conclusion As Shenaz Treasury puts it, “The trend of travelling to offbeat destinations is real, but I don’t know if people are finding what they are looking for because, in India, every place—whether it’s the Andamans or Meghalaya—is already very crowded.” While offbeat travel may pique our interest, at the end of the day, whether a destination is actually offbeat, in the true sense of the word, is doubtful.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 7, 2025

3264d262-6a63-4c30-9881-b781a5da93b0,Only 3% of Indians have a healthy relationship with technology: SurveyThe State of Emotional Wellbeing Report 2024 reveals the many emotional wellbeing issues affecting Indians and the efforts that are needed to tackle them.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/only-3-indians-have-a-healthy-relationship-with-technology-survey-2677262-2025-02-09,"Brain Rot, Doomscrolling, Digital Dementia, Internet-Induced ADHD, Phantom Vibration Syndrome—these are some of the buzzwords people frequently throw around when discussing how technology is affecting everyone’s mental wellbeing. The State of Emotional Wellbeing Report 2024 reveals the many emotional wellbeing issues affecting Indians and the efforts that is needed to tackle them. The findings are based on over 83,000 counselling sessions, 12,000 screenings, and 42,000 assessments. The digital life imbalance Only 3 out of 100 individuals have a healthy digital-life balance. A staggering 50% of individuals fell into the ‘poor’ category, struggling to disconnect from their devices, while another 10% had an ‘inadequate’ digital life balance.The rise in mental health awareness One of the standout findings is the 15% rise in mental health-related counselling. The report suggests that anxiety, depression, and workplace stress have been the main reasons why people continue to seek professional help. Surprisingly (a pleasant one), 23% of employees who are seeking support for work-related issues, struggled with difficult workplace relationships. This emphasises the need for healthier communication and psychologically safe workplaces.More men seeking counselling Traditionally, women have been more open to seeking therapy and emotional support. When it comes to men, they shy away from seeking help as most believe it is “not too manly” to do so, say experts. However, the latest trends show that there has been a 7% increase in men availing counselling. This signals a positive and much-welcome change. 70% of financial consultations were taken by men, while women attended 60% of relationship counselling sessions.Mental health issues are more common among the young Mental health concerns are disproportionately affecting younger age groups, with anxiety and depression peaking among those under 30. The survey found that stressors such as job transitions and relationship management contribute to elevated anxiety and depression levels, with 92% of individuals under 25 showing symptoms of anxiety and 91% exhibiting signs of depression.Suicide risks are on the rise While there are some positives in the report, this one might not be a pleasant finding. According to the survey, there has been a 22% rise in suicide risk cases and a 17% rise in distress cases compared to last year (2023). Nearly half of those seeking counselling faced serious emotional challenges. The report stresses the urgent need for accessible, high-quality mental health resources and proactive intervention. The report, State of Emotional Wellbeing Report 2024, shows a clear picture - while mental health awareness is growing, so are the challenges. Now, it rests on us how we tackle it.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 9, 2025Tune InTrending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/the-west-is-obsessing-over-shilajit-which-has-been-a-secret-for-indians-for-ages-2677319-2025-02-10,"A few months ago, during my trip to the mountains, I came across an interesting vendor. Wearing an old jacket and wrapping a shawl around himself, he was probably the first or maybe the second vendor who was hiding what he was selling. As we got closer, he reached into his pocket and showed us a black, tar-like substance that he claimed was the solution to everything—from poor libido to weakness. ""This is shilajit from the Himalayas,"" he claimed, along with an inappropriate jingle that made us laugh dismissing both the product and him out of embarrassment. Now, here we are. If you’ve ever been to the mountains, especially in the Himalayas, you might have seen many vendors casually selling shilajit. But, little did we know that this mineral is making waves not only in India but also across the globe.

 



Shilajit is predominantly found in the Himalayan region. Photo: Freepik
 Data shows that India is the largest exporter of shilajit, with the US being its biggest buyer. But how did shilajit become so popular, and what can it actually do to your body, especially for women? We tried to find out. But first things first.Where can you find shilajit? Shilajit has various names. The Persians called it ""mummy"" or ""mumiay"" and believed that this organic mineral could cure all diseases and even heal broken bones. It is also referred to as ""salajeet"" in Pakistan, and the Russians call it ""mumiyo"" or ""mumie."" For us Indians, shilajit has mentions in ancient Ayurvedic texts and is a key ingredient in Siddha and Unani medicine, as well as in folk remedies, particularly in mountainous regions. The use of shilajit dates back thousands of years, with mentions in Sanskrit texts and later inclusion in Ayurvedic texts like Charaka (125-150 AD), Sushruta (200-500 AD), and Vagbhatta (600 AD). Some believe that shilajit was introduced to India by Arabian traders under the name ""Momian,"" later recognised and adopted by Ayurvedic physicians for its medicinal uses.

 



Shilajit is a powerful adaptogen. Photo: Freepik
 Today, you can find shilajit predominantly in the Himalayan region, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. It is typically extracted from elevations between 16,000 to 19,000 feet. Although traditionally produced in India, shilajit is also found in other mountainous regions, such as the Caucasus Mountains, Altai Mountains, and Gilgit-Baltistan.What happens when women take shilajit? Though often marketed for men, shilajit offers significant benefits for women. Dr Mickey Mehta, a holistic health coach, explains, ""Shilajit is a gift from the Himalayas, deeply rooted in Ayurveda as a powerful rejuvenator for women. It purifies the body by flushing out toxins, strengthens digestion, and supports liver health."" Dubai and Delhi-based culinary nutritionist and holistic wellness coach Eshanka Wahi adds, ""Shilajit helps balance hormones (regulating estrogen and progesterone levels), boosts energy, reduces fatigue, enhances mood, supports joint health, and improves skin health and bone strength. It’s a natural powerhouse supplement that supports overall wellness when taken consistently."" Shilajit helps regulate hormones, easing PMS, irregular periods, and supporting fertility and PCOS by strengthening the reproductive system. It also has a calming effect, reducing stress and sharpening focus, allowing women to maintain balance and vitality. Rich in minerals and fulvic acid, it fights fatigue and nourishes skin, hair, and bones - especially important after menopause. Additionally, it may help increase iron levels in anaemic women.What does it do for men? Today, various products on the market (in India and abroad) promote shilajit as the ""IT supplement"" for men. From influencers to Bollywood celebrities, everyone seems to endorse it. But is it as effective as advertisements claim? ""Shilajit is a powerful adaptogen, helping the body cope with physical and emotional stress. Studies show it increases sperm count, boosts testosterone, stamina, and improves reproductive health,"" says Dr Mehta. Shilajit supports cognitive function, sharpening focus, memory, and mental clarity while fighting fatigue. ""Research shows that shilajit helps reduce bad cholesterol (LDL), improves blood flow, and lowers oxidative stress,"" Dr Mehta adds. However, he emphasises that for optimal benefits, ""It must be purified (Shuddha) and taken in the right Ayurvedic dosage and method."" Eshanka Wahi points to scientific studies supporting these claims, citing a 2016 study published in Andrologia, which found that men who consumed purified shilajit for 90 days experienced a 23.5 per cent increase in testosterone levels. However, more extensive studies are needed to prove its effectiveness.Why is the West suddenly obsessed with it? In August 2024, shilajit made headlines when an Australian company, Himalayanpowdershilajit, started selling it for as much as Rs 3,700 per 15 grams. Like Himalayanpowdershilajit, many brands today (both Western and Indian catering to Western audiences) are cashing in on the trend. In fact, India is the largest exporter of shilajit to the West. The West has shown a pattern of adopting Ayurvedic herbs - first Ashwagandha, then Brahmi, Neem, and Tulsi. Now, shilajit is their new obsession. Dr Mehta says, ""As Ayurvedic wisdom gains traction, it has also caught the fancy of the modern world. People are turning to natural adaptogens like shilajit over pharmaceuticals.""

 Many wellness influencers and fitness enthusiasts now promote shilajit as a natural testosterone booster and muscle-building supplement. The presence of fulvic acid has also made it popular in the anti-ageing market. ""Western biohackers see shilajit as a natural way to optimise health. It’s now seen as part of the biohacking trend alongside fitness, longevity, and anti-ageing,"" says Eshanka Wahi. With a growing preference for holistic health, many Westerners are looking for natural ways to enhance brain function, energy, and overall well-being-exactly what shilajit has offered in Ayurveda for centuries.Who should not take shilajit? “After I had this herb, I had to change my pad every 15 minutes,” shares Dr Mitali, who goes by @dr.uterus on Instagram. She recounts a story from her eighth standard when a vendor in Himachal sold her mother an herb, claiming it was good for her children. Long story short, after consuming shilajit, she experienced uncontrollable bleeding. Have a look at the video:

 Despite its many benefits, shilajit is not suitable for everyone and should be taken with caution. Dr Mickey Mehta warns against its use in certain cases:
Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid it.
People with iron overload (hemochromatosis) should steer clear, as shilajit is rich in iron.
Those with high uric acid levels or gout may experience flare-ups.
It may lower blood pressure, so those with hypotension should avoid it.
Shilajit can stimulate the immune system, which may be harmful to individuals with autoimmune disorders like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.
Those with compromised liver or kidney function should avoid it.
It may interact with anticoagulants, diabetes medications, and blood pressure medications.
 Low-quality shilajit can cause severe side effects, as seen in Dr Mitali’s case. Possible side effects of excessive or low-quality shilajit include:
Digestive discomfort (nausea, diarrhoea)
Increased uric acid levels
Allergic reactions (rash, dizziness)
 Always remember to consult a professional before taking shilajit, based on your bloodwork.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 10, 2025

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/ranveer-allahbadia-samay-raina-indias-got-latent-controversy-vulgar-joke-gone-too-far-2677721-2025-02-10,"On Monday, February 10, YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia, aka BeerBiceps, was under fire on social media and landed in legal trouble for making 'inappropriate' jokes and remarks during his appearance on Samay Raina's show India’s Got Latent. ""Shame on you, Ranveer bhai... you lost my respect,"" commented a user on Allahbadia’s latest Instagram post. The comment received 700 likes. Such is the state of his comment section right now. A content creator and podcaster with millions of followers online, now Ranveer, is facing a wave of anger from the 'disappointed’ masses. According to his Instagram bio, Ranveer is an ""entrepreneur"" and a promoter of ""peace & growth"". He is often seen sharing content on spirituality, politics, relationships, etc and has taken interviews of various Bollywood celebrities and politicians, but things took a drastic turn overnight for him and a few others after a clip from Samay Raina’s show India’s Got Latent went viral.  Now, his comment section is flooded with criticism over his remarks, with many believing he took things too far.
 


 The clip that sparked the outrage was a video that landed him in trouble - both legally and online. In the video, during the show, Ranveer, who was a panelist, asks a question to the contestant, one that might haunt him for a long time: ""Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once to make it stop forever?"" At that moment, Ranveer appeared somewhat proud of himself for making the ‘joke’ while the audience and panel laughed along in the video, but as the episode went up, not everyone seemed to be laughing about it. The apology and the FIRs Soon the backlash intensified, and a complaint was filed against Ranveer Allahbadia for ""promoting obscenity"" and using offensive language. The complaint was submitted to the Mumbai Police Commissioner and the National Commission for Women, following which the Mumbai Police initiated an inquiry and registered an FIR - not just against Ranveer but also against social media influencer Apoorva Makhija (who was also part of the show) and comedian Samay Raina himself. Furthermore, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis commented on Monday that while freedom of speech exists in the country, it ends when it “encroaches upon the freedom of others”. ""I have come to know about it. I haven’t seen it yet. Things have been said and presented in the wrong way. Everyone has freedom of speech, but our freedom ends when we encroach upon the freedom of others... In our society, we have certain rules, and if someone violates them, it is absolutely wrong, and action should be taken against them,"" Fadnavis told reporters.

A quick look at the comment section reveals a common sentiment: his content doesn’t align with the ‘joke’ he made. Have a look at some of the (decent) comments we picked:
 



 



 


 As of now, the investigation is still ongoing. However, this isn’t the first time Samay Raina’s show has landed in trouble. In fact, India’s Got Latent often faces criticism online, and sometimes, the consequences go beyond just social media outrage. The most recent one was on February 5. An FIR was filed against Jessy Nabam, a contestant on India’s Got Latent, for making controversial remarks about eating dog meat. Nabam claimed that people from Arunachal Pradesh commonly consume dog meat and sometimes even eat their pets. Tinkesh Kaushik, the world’s first triple amputee to trek Everest Base Camp, also criticised the show for its content. ""Disrespecting people with disabilities is not dark humour,"" Kaushik told India Today. He had previously called out Samay Raina when one of the contestants made fun of people with disabilities, and the judges—including Raina—were seen laughing.advertisement‘Not everyone gets dark humour’Now, while one section of the audience is outraged over the ‘inappropriate’ and ‘vulgar’ jokes made on the show—often calling for a ban—another section argues that Samay and his show represent dark humour. But where do you draw the line? Is everything fair in the name of humour? There are two sides to this—some believe that making harsh jokes about someone’s appearance or disability is just dark humour, while others worry about the moral values these shows promote. Even experts often find these ‘lines’ blurred and confusing.In fact, after the incident, a lot of people took to Reddit to support Ranveer, and India's Got latent.

If you grew up in the 80s or 90s, the return of bangs might bring back memories (some fond, some harrowing) of the infamous ‘Sadhana cut.’ Named after the legendary actress Sadhana, this iconic hairstyle was the go-to choice for a style refresh without sacrificing long tresses. In the 90s, parents were particularly obsessed with it. Fringes then became associated with life’s upheavals. Cut to 2025, and they are back as a raging trend that you can’t ignore. Closer to home, Shraddha Kapoor got a bang-on makeover. She shared photos on Instagram flaunting her long wispy fringes.

 Amy Johnson, Dyson’s global director of haircare artistry, also considers bangs (fringes) a major hairstyle trend. “Bangs are the ultimate way to refresh your look. Whether you go for soft curtain bangs, playful choppy fringes, or edgy blunt cuts, bangs add a youthful and chic touch to any hairstyle. They’re versatile enough to complement sleek updos, textured waves, or even a simple, loose blowout. Not only do they enhance your overall style, but they also bring attention to your eyes and cheekbones, giving you that irresistible, flirty vibe perfect for any occasion,” she says. At the 2025 Grammys, Miley Cyrus flaunted her slightly curled bangs, perfectly complementing her smokey eye glam and nude lips.

 Lady Gaga, on the other hand, put forth a sharper look. She exuded goth glam in a black ensemble comprising a corset and a voluminous skirt, teamed with a black manicure and sharp winged eyeliner. However, her micro bangs – cut sharply – stole the show.

 Taylor Swift also took her bangs to the red carpet, turning up in a stunning Vivienne Westwood red corset dress. Sabrina Carpenter, the OG poster girl for bangs, gave her fringes a dramatic twist with soft curls.

 Several other stars, including Clairo, Julia Michaels, and GloRilla, brought the bangs to the Grammys. Basically, bangs have shed that stereotypical ‘trauma bangs’ image. In case you are also convinced to go for a bang-in makeover, we bring you some expert tips. “Someone with a round face should opt for softer bangs/fringe, whereas someone with a heart-shaped face can opt for more solid bangs/fringe. Oval and diamond face shapes can also opt for curtain bangs, while square and rectangular face shapes can go for side bangs,” suggests Shaheen Jumani, creative director at Looks Salon. However, if you have curly, frizzy hair, avoid cutting bangs – especially if you don’t want to spend an extra five minutes in the morning styling them. “Curly and frizzy hair tends to jump up after cutting, so styling is required,” says Jumani. Otherwise, even someone with curly hair can have beautifully done bangs.

Sugar. From our birthday cakes to breakup chocolates, sugar and sugary treats are deeply embedded in our culture and daily lives. That one bite we think is harmless, but experts worry that it is a silent threat lurking in our pantries. Today, even though there is a certain level of awareness amongst Indians, especially Gen Z, it is almost impossible for an average person (not a celebrity) to follow a sugar-free diet. However, it is the need of the hour to seriously consider the hazardous impact of sugar. India is one of the few countries where deaths due to excessive sugar consumption (diabetes, obesity, heart disease) are alarmingly high. Now, remember, while sugar is a carbohydrate that provides the body with energy, and natural sugars are found in many healthy foods, the problem lies in the overconsumption of refined and added sugars.  So, we have asked six experts to share their insights on how they think sugar is bad for you. 1. Leads to weight gain ""Sugar is nothing but empty calories that have no benefit on your health, and instead it can be deadly as a drug,"" says Madhura Paroolkar Behki, head nutritionist and dietician at Cult Transform.

advertisementShe explains that sugar ""doesn't keep you full for longer. It has no nutrients and just adds excess calories, which can lead to an increase in fat storage, especially around the belly area.""2. Causes blood sugar spikes and insulin resistanceDr Aishwarya Tandle, deputy manager of Medico Marketing at SAVA Herbals, explains that excessive sugar consumption makes the body less responsive to insulin, leading to insulin resistance. This increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and conditions like PCOS in women.3. Increases risk of heart diseaseDr Archana Batra, a dietician and certified diabetes educator, states that sugar consumption is linked to high blood pressure, fatty liver, and chronic inflammation, all of which are risk factors for heart disease.Multiple studies, including research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association released in 2014, have found that a diet high in added sugars increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Excess sugar contributes to abnormal cholesterol levels, and increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries due to plaque build-up). Chronic inflammation caused by high sugar intake further damages blood vessels, leading to hypertension and heart attacks.4. Negatively affects mental healthEven though we often associate sugar and junk food as a way to lift our spirits and mood, Dr Anjali Nain, senior dietician at Healthians, warns that excess sugar intake can trigger mood swings, anxiety, and even depression. advertisementSugar activates the brain’s reward system in a way similar to addictive drugs, leading to dependence.5. Contributes to premature skin ageingYes, consuming sugar can impact your skin, experts like Vriti Srivastav, holistic dietitian, say. That acne you got after going partying last night? Can be from the sugar you consume. Dr Srivastav explains that sugar speeds up skin ageing. The process of glycation damages collagen and elastin, proteins essential for youthful, hydrated skin. Over time, this can cause wrinkles and sagging.6. Weakens the immune systemSunil Lobo, a fitness expert, notes that sugar weakens immune function by increasing inflammation in the body. This makes it harder to fight off infections and can contribute to autoimmune conditions.7.  A hidden threat Madhura Paroolkar Behki and Dr Anjali Nain both agree that excess sugar has severe long-term consequences, making it a hidden health threat, as it is often overlooked. How to manage sugar cravingsIf you want to control your sugar cravings, here are some expert approved ways that you can manage your sugar cravings. 
Increase fibre intake: Foods like salads, cooked vegetables, and millets keep you full for longer, reducing sugar cravings.
Stay hydrated: Thirst is often mistaken for sugar cravings, so drink enough water throughout the day.
Balance meals: Ensure your diet includes protein, healthy fats, and fibre to keep you satisfied.

Choose healthy alternatives: Opt for natural sweeteners like dates, honey, or monk fruit instead of refined sugar.
Practice stress management: High stress levels and lack of sleep can trigger sugar cravings. Regular exercise and proper sleep can help maintain a hormonal balance.
Worst times to consume sugaradvertisementWhile it’s best to minimise sugar intake overall, all experts agree that certain times are worse than others:
On an empty stomach: This can cause a rapid spike and crash in blood sugar levels, leading to fatigue and mood swings.
Late at night: Sugar before bedtime can disrupt sleep and contribute to weight gain.
Before a workout: While sugar provides quick energy, it fades fast and can lead to exhaustion mid-workout.
During stress or emotional distress: Sugar may provide temporary relief but can create a cycle of emotional eating and increased cravings.
The bitter truth Sugar may be a staple in our diets, from our morning chai to our midnight dessert, but excessive consumption can have serious health consequences. From weight gain and diabetes to heart disease and skin ageing, the risks are undeniable. So, the next time you reach for that sugary treat, think twice!Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Feb 11, 2025Must Watch

Gush over the viral video of the bride in green dancing to Chaudhary. Watch as her partner joins in - cheer for the couple, maybe even shed a happy tear. Scroll to move on. But Instagram’s algorithm shows you the same video, reposted by another page. It’s too wholesome to skip, so you watch it again. A few Reels later, it appears on your feed once again... and it goes on. If you're an active Instagram user, you've probably experienced this exact scenario unfolding on your feed.

 But what if we told you this video might never have gone viral - or even appeared on your feed - if not for a wedding social media manager’s keen eye? It was their decision to carefully extract this standout moment from the bride’s long, elaborate welcome dance that made it explode online. How do we know? Well, the manager who handled social media for this wedding told us.Rising trend of hiring social media managers A wedding social media manager (or wedding publicist) is emerging as a new-age profession, making its mark in India’s massive Rs 10 lakh crore wedding industry. Their job? To capture behind-the-scenes moments, post in real-time, build a social media strategy to make the couple go viral, ideate and execute ‘trending’ Reels, and share the couple’s wedding intangibles (photos and videos) in a visually appealing way on a dedicated wedding page. Though at a nascent stage, the trend of hiring social media managers for weddings is getting popular among Indian couples. The viral bald bride, who chose to ditch a wig on her wedding day as a powerful statement for those battling alopecia, too hired a social media agency to document her wedding.

 Wedding planning platform WedMeGood’s Annual Wedding Industry Report too identified the trend and noted almost 7 per cent Gen Z couples hired a social media manager for their wedding. “A growing number of wedding social media agencies have emerged, and many wedding photographers are now offering it as an add-on service with separate billing,” says Mehak Sagar Shahani, founder of WedMeGood, in an interview with India Today.

 Shaadi BTS, The Wedding Gram, What A Shot and Media Vows are some of the popular names.What exactly do wedding social media managers do? Expect 2-3 people from the wedding social media team to be present at the wedding, shooting content on their respective phones and executing pre-discussed Reel ideas (such as transition Reels or trend-based videos). Their other team members will simultaneously post BTS moments and wedding details strategically on the couple’s dedicated wedding page. Once the events are over, the team will continue managing the couple’s profile and posting wedding content (photos and videos) in an appealing manner for at least the next two weeks. This may also include transition Reels, viral-worthy moments, and heartfelt odes to the families.

 Before the project is finalised, the team meets the couple to understand their story, dynamics, vision, and specific deliverable requests. Only after this do they craft a strategy and generate ideas tailored to the couple. Mostly, the deliverables include the following (as shared by Nikita Kabra of The Wedding Gram):
advertisementShort-form videos that encapsulate raw emotions
Curated Instagram posts and captions that tell the story in the couple’s own voice
Behind-the-scenes moments that often go unnoticed but mean the most
Stories and trend-based Reels
The number of Reels and posts is often pre-discussed as part of the package. Some agencies charge Rs 50k per event day.If you’re someone who is always on social media, has a knack for storytelling (turning even random videos into meaningful content with a relevant song and text), loves weddings (including the chaos that comes with them), and has an eye for viral-worthy wedding content, you might be a great fit as a wedding content creator or wedding social media manager.What’s fuelling this trend?Modern Indian weddings are now heavily influenced by social media. From choosing makeup artists to discovering clothing labels, platforms like Instagram and Pinterest play signifcant. Naturally, couples (especially brides) aspire to be on the other side: dominating social media feeds, inspiring brides-to-be, and getting featured on wedding blogs and news portals.“So many brides book popular makeup artists to get featured on their social media handles, knowing they will be noticed and admired by their lakhs or even millions of followers,” shares Rohit Kadyan, a destination wedding photographer based in Delhi.From planning a viral-worthy wedding entry to creating offbeat moments during the celebrations, many couples now put extra thought into their nuptials to gain social media attention.advertisementThis is where social media managers come in - they take over the process, thereby also allowing couples to enjoy their wedding and be fully present in the moment.Wedding industry experts also agree that virality is one of the main reasons why couples are now roping in social media professionals for their weddings. Unlike the primary photography and videography teams, who prioritise quality and timelessness, social media managers cater to the instant gratification bit. These teams capture content on their phones, edit instantly and put up on social media right away for public consumption. Some of it is also trend-based, so the promptness is vital.Anupriya Khanna, marketing manager with luxury wedding photography team CineLove Productions, tells India Today:  “Almost every third wedding , especially grand-scale celebrations, now have social media team. Why? Because short-form content is on the rise, and its quick, effortless consumption makes it popular. Unlike traditional teasers and long-form videos, these clips are faster to create and watch. It feels like a moment just happened, and it’s already online for everyone to see and admire.”“People are planning their entries, artist performances, and even the entire schedule around it - ensuring they have a team to record and help make it go viral,” Khanna adds.advertisementIs social media fame the only factor? Nope.For many couples, hiring a social media manager isn’t just about going viral. Instead, it’s about capturing raw, intimate moments that the photography team might miss, and showcasing details on social media that might not make it to their personal profiles when sharing wedding snippets.“Mostly, when a couple shares photos on their social media profiles, they don’t go overboard. At the max, someone would post 20-30 posts. But when a social media agency takes over and creates a dedicated wedding page, it becomes a digital diary where you can unabashedly post anything and everything about the wedding without worrying about spamming your followers,” shares Nazneen Saiyed, founder of marketing agency Media Vows, who also handled the viral ‘Chaudhary’ dance couple’s wedding.This way, the key to attention they put while planning the wedding – be it the grand décor, wedding favour stations, quirky signages or little details like personalised napkins, song selection – also gets highlighted.

“While some do hope their content goes viral, most couples just want a well-documented wedding experience to look back on. It’s more about storytelling and capturing emotions rather than just chasing views,” adds Nikita Kabra, co-founder of The Wedding Gram.“Some people want every moment to be captured, while others have specific requests. Photographers often focus on the couple, but we ensure the family's presence and the couple's connection with them are also highlighted. There are countless real, exciting moments that often go unnoticed - we make sure they aren’t missed,” shares Nazneen.Meanwhile, Mehak highlights, how a lot of clips do not make it to the wedding videos and social media managers make such moments accessible.

Dentists agree that one should avoid rinsing with water after brushing their teeth. “Do not rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing. This applies both after you brush and after you use mouthwash. If you rinse, you wash away the fluoride, and it cannot work its magic to prevent cavities or decay. Fluoride is most effective when it stays on your teeth for an extended time,” says Dr Raghavendra B R, dentist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru. Dentists suggest spitting out the excess toothpaste and waiting for 20–30 minutes before drinking water. “Or, if one feels the need to rinse their mouth immediately after brushing their teeth, then using a fluoride mouth rinse can also work,” says Dr Suman Yadav, head of the maxillofacial and dental department at Numed Hospital, Noida. Fluoride, a mineral, protects enamel from the acid produced in the mouth by bacteria, thereby preventing cavities. It essentially reduces tooth decay and also protects against plaque build-up. “When the fluoride in toothpaste comes in contact with enamel, it integrates into the crystal structure and forms a mineral called fluorapatite, providing protection from acid attacks. Not only that, but it also promotes remineralisation by encouraging calcium and phosphate ions, which create a new surface on the teeth, making them acid-resistant,” explains Dr Bhargav K H, consultant paediatric dentist, maxillofacial and dental surgery at SPARSH Hospital, Bengaluru. Dentists hail fluoride as an important toothpaste ingredient. However, children and those diagnosed with dental fluorosis (a condition involving white spots or discolouration of the teeth) should avoid using fluoride-containing toothpastes. Even children, who may accidentally swallow toothpaste while brushing their teeth, are advised to use fluoride-free toothpastes. You do not need to follow the no-rinse rule when using fluoride-free toothpaste. Though gaining prominence, dentists do not recommend using toothpastes that do not contain this mineral. Non-fluoride toothpastes contain ingredients like xylitol (a natural sugar alcohol present in several fruits and vegetables). “The main drawback is that it does not provide the same level of protection against tooth decay as fluoride toothpaste. For general oral health, fluoride toothpaste is often the better option,” says Dr Raghavendra. Dr Bhargav agrees and adds: “Fluoride-free toothpaste does not protect the teeth from plaque and cavities as much as fluoride toothpaste does.” Meanwhile, here are a few basic oral hygiene tips for a healthy smile: - Brush your teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled brush. Brush in a circular motion so that all tooth surfaces are cleaned. - Flossing is a great habit to add to your daily routine. You can use traditional floss or opt for a water flosser to clean between your teeth and remove plaque and food particles from areas that brushing alone cannot reach. - Keep yourself hydrated and limit your consumption of sugar and acidic foods, as they can lead to tooth decay. - Experts suggest using an antibacterial mouthwash to reduce bacteria and freshen your breath. Make sure to choose one that is free of alcohol. - Smoking or using tobacco products is detrimental to overall health, including oral health. It increases the risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and oral cancer. And who wants those nicotine stains on their teeth? So, try to quit smoking.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 13, 2025Must Watch

But with DINK (Dual Income, No Kids) couples at an all-time high, how can you tackle the family pressure with the utmost subtlety?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/what-to-do-when-your-in-laws-pressure-you-about-kids-even-in-2025-2679569-2025-02-13,"The solution to any marital problem? Baccha karlo (make a baby). No problems at all? Phir bhi baccha karlo (nevertheless, make a baby). Because, believe it or not, for some people, a married couple’s solution to all problems (and even when you do not have any) lies in procreating. It is 2025, and while everything has evolved, some things remain unchanged—like the age-old pressure from in-laws to ‘give them grandkids.’The subtle (not-so-subtle) pressure Now, eventually, those stern warnings have mellowed into subtle implications (like we saw in Arati Kadav’s Mrs), but the pressure remains unchanged in most households.

 



Mrs is the remake of the Malayalam film The Great Indian Kitchen (2021).
 It all starts with small hints like: Do you know, Mrs Kapoor’s daughter is due next month” or maybe “Oh look how cute is that baby”. Then, a level up: “We’re not getting any younger, you know.” And finally, the emotional manipulation boss level: “What if something happens to us, and we never get to see our grandchild?” They will leave no stone unturned to convince you - Hum paal lenge (we will bring them up), budhape ka sahara (support in old age), khandaan ka waris (heir to the family lineage). Their reasons haven’t got any better but their implications have. If your in-laws are still treating your uterus (or your partner’s) like a community project, you need to know - your body, your choice and there ways to convey it (you can take the subtle route too).Align as a couple first According to Dr Nisha Khanna, psychologist and marriage counsellor, the first and most crucial step is for the couple to be on the same page. Bringing a third party or a child into the picture should only happen once they have clarity on how they feel about the situation. ""Having kids or choosing not to is a deeply personal decision, whether for a couple or an individual. If even one partner isn’t comfortable, parenthood shouldn’t be forced upon them,"" she says. Without mutual agreement, external pressure can amplify conflicts. Dr Khanna suggests a few things to keep in mind as a couple before conveying the decision to the respective in-laws. Comprehending the situation: Both partners must deeply understand and articulate why they do not want to move forward with the decision to have a child. It’s a significant life decision, and if they choose to delay or opt-out, they should be clear about their reasons. Honesty: If one or both partners are not ready for a child, forcing the decision can impact not only their own mental health, but also the child’s well-being in the future.Set boundaries without straining relationships The choice to have children is deeply personal and should never be influenced by external pressure. Times have changed and while many may want to understand it or not, new-age couples face several unique challenges – from career aspirations and financial considerations to environmental concerns and changing social dynamics, says Dr Chandni Tugnait, psychotherapist and founder-director of Gateway of Healing. The traditional timeline for starting a family has evolved, with many choosing to delay parenthood or remain child-free. Therefore, you should set your boundaries, politely. “Setting healthy boundaries with in-laws is essential. A firm but respectful conversation explaining your personal choices can help manage expectations. Couples can say, ‘We appreciate your care for our future, but we'll make this decision when and if we feel ready,’” she says. For the people pleasers out there: Remember, having children to please others often leads to resentment and can impact both the parents and the child's well-being. “Instead of buckling under pressure, couples should focus on their own readiness, desires, and life goals. The key is maintaining open communication with your partner and presenting a united front when dealing with family pressure. Your reproductive choices remain yours alone – in 2025 and always,” Dr Tugnait.Handling emotional reactions from family Chances are that each member of the family comes from a different school of thought and have deep-seated beliefs about parenting as a natural life milestone. Sometimes, it needs patience to understand that their pressure may stem from their upbringing as well as societal norms. So, the key is to acknowledge their thought as well and not come across as insolent. Dr Khanna advises couples to respond with patience and understanding. “We have to tell them how society is changing, how things are evolving, and what your goals are. If needed, you can have them read documentaries, books, or articles, or even watch something that highlights how this issue is impacting people,” she says. “Boundaries definitely play an important role. However, when setting boundaries, be polite yet firm, and remain respectful. Having a child or not is your personal decision, and if you are not comfortable with it, you have every right to express that. You can also share what specifically makes you uncomfortable about the idea,” Dr Khanna adds. Along with these, avoid getting into confrontations or dismissive replies that could escalate tensions and make them understand how important the family is to you and that you respect them.Each partner’s role in managing family expectations Unless and until you as a couple feel united and convinced, the conversation will fall flat. “The partner whose family is applying pressure should take the lead in conversations, as they have an established rapport and can communicate more effectively,” says Dr Tugnait. In situations like these, couples generally avoid going to get-togethers, afraid that someone might broach the “baby topic” again, but don’t do that. Instead, create new room for discussions that naturally steer conversations away from baby talk. “Both partners must be aligned, presenting a united message that respects family while firmly upholding their right to make personal decisions. This unified stance is more effective than any individual tactic,” she adds.Takeaway At the end of the day, it is your life so the choice should be yours. You want kids or not, no one else gets a vote - especially not the ones who won’t be waking up for your baby's 3 am feeding. When you fall under pressure and take a decision unwillingly, especially as big as having a baby, you might end up messing things up.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Feb 13, 2025Must Watch

63c629b6-a4b9-4aea-a75a-31c786500adb,"Are red aloe vera products a scam?Aloe sanguinalis, also known as Somali red aloe or 'red aloe vera' gel, is gaining attention as a better alternative to aloe vera gel. However, experts seem to disagree.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/are-red-aloe-vera-products-a-scam-stmp-2679571-2025-02-14,"Over the years, if there’s one product that has been a staple in almost every makeup bag (whether you’re a beauty enthusiast or not), it has to be aloe vera gel. Known for its hydrating and anti-inflammatory properties, and approved by both Ayurvedic and allopathic experts, aloe vera has made quite a mark in the beauty industry. In fact, India is one of the largest exporters of aloe vera in the world. But what if we told you there’s a close cousin of aloe vera, found in red hues, that supposedly has ‘22 times’ more ‘healing’ properties and is native to the African deserts? Sounds appealing, right? Well, that’s exactly how many beauty brands are marketing what they call ‘red aloe vera’. However, the information surrounding this ingredient is only half true. Yes, a red aloe species exists, native to Somalia in the Horn of Africa, but it was only discovered in 2019. According to Indian dermatologists, the products being sold under the name ‘red aloe vera’ could potentially be a scam.‘Hiding in plain sight’ To understand why experts believe red aloe products in India might be a scam, we need to look at how they were discovered. Today, various brands are marketing 'red aloe vera’ as a superior version of the commonly available green one.  In fact, several celebrities endorse these brands, and the products are available on platforms like Flipkart and Nykaa. These products range from eye creams to red aloe vera gels.  Now, back to our story of how the red aloe was discovered. Scientific journals state that Aloe sanguinalis, or Somali Red Aloe, has red-coloured leaves and sap (the gooey substance inside aloe vera) was ‘hiding in plain sight’ in an area not typically known for high biological diversity.  Locals had long recognised it as different from other “Dacar” (the Somali name for aloes) and referred to it as “Dacar cas” or “red aloe”. However, it was only classified as a distinct species by an environmentalist and a botanist in 2019, making it unique among the 600+ aloe species. This Somali red aloe has a yellow sap that turns a beautiful red shade. Its rarity makes it highly expensive to import into India, and moreover, there have been no substantial studies on its benefits in India. Let’s discuss this in detail.

Is red aloe vera a scam? Sujit Shanshanwal, dermatologist and medical director of SkinAmour Clinics, Mumbai, states that in his 15 years of experience, he has never come across red aloe vera. “I did some research and realised that red aloe was only recently discovered. The claims that it has better benefits than aloe vera are quite impossible. Since it was only recently identified, there hasn’t been enough time for extensive studies to prove its effectiveness,” he says. Sujit explains that assuming the red aloe vera’ being sold in beauty markets, including India, is superior to regular aloe vera is misleading. There is no scientific study to support these claims. “There are so many species of aloe. Aloe vera (the widely available one) is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. We now have various scientific studies proving its benefits, but there’s no such research on red aloe. Some species of aloe actually have drying properties rather than hydrating ones, so it’s wrong to assume red aloe will be any better or have the same benefits as aloe vera,” he says. Dr Chandani Jain Gupta, dermatologist and aesthetic physician at Elantis Healthcare, New Delhi, somewhat disagrees. She agrees that the red aloe vera products sold in Indian markets are a scam, primarily because they are too expensive to be sold at the rates advertised. However, she believes red aloe vera might have some benefits, attributing this to its red colour. Let’s talk about the cost first. “Red aloe is sold for around Rs 65,000 to Rs 70,000 per kg. If a company is selling 500 grams of ‘red aloe vera’ for Rs 500, it’s impossible that they’re offering the real product,” Dr Gupta says.

 In India, you may come across ‘red aloe vera’, which is just the traditional aloe vera plant turning a copper-reddish hue due to excessive sun exposure. Dr Gupta clarifies that these plants have the same properties as regular aloe vera and nothing ‘extraordinary’. As for potential benefits, Dr Gupta says that red-coloured fruits and vegetables are generally rich in antioxidants like lycopene and Vitamin C, which protect the skin from ageing and UV damage. They also boost collagen production, keeping the skin firm and reducing wrinkles. “These foods have anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce acne, redness, and irritation. Similarly, there’s a good chance that red aloe might offer these benefits due to its colour. But again, more studies are needed to confirm this,” she adds. India Today conducted an analysis of products claiming to contain ‘red aloe vera’ and found two key things: the term ‘red aloe vera extract’ appears at the very end of the ingredient list, suggesting it’s not the primary component, and many of these products contain artificial red colouring. “Nowadays, people will market anything as special,” Dr Gupta says. Stick to the OG one Both the experts suggest sticking to the OG green aloe vera, that has scientific data to prove its benefits, like: 
Burn healing: Clinical research suggests that topical application of aloe vera gel can speed burn healing and reduce pain from burns.
Skin conditions: Research also indicates topical aloe vera may help with herpes simplex, lichen planus, and psoriasis.
Moisturising and anti-wrinkle effects: The same study also showed that oral aloe vera gel increased collagen production and improved skin elasticity in females over 45.
General wound healing: Aloe vera contains acids that promote wound healing for skin tissue and ulcers.
Anti-inflammatory responses: Aloe vera promotes anti-inflammatory responses in the body, reducing swelling from injuries and promoting recovery from infections.
Arthritis and joint pain: A 2010 study also suggests that ingestion of aloe vera daily can help prevent and cause a regression of adjuvant arthritis and might also improve digestive health. 
 If you’ve seen red aloe vera’s supposed benefits and were tempted to try it, hold your horses! Stick to the original one, unless, of course, you’re allergic to it.

0a43a5e1-7daa-4219-ab0e-194ee48aac3c,"Why Valentine's Day makes some Indians 'cringe'A recent survey shows that couples are opting to continue the day like any other, with some of them claiming they don't believe in the concept of Valentine's Day. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/why-valentines-day-makes-some-indians-cringe-2680114-2025-02-14,"What are your plans for Valentine's Day? Are you going out on a date with your partner, or will it be a cosy surprise at home? If you're single, perhaps it's a singles' day event for you? But, If you're reading this, chances are pretty high that you have no V-Day plans. Now, if you fall into this category - the one where you don't want to celebrate what people call the festival of love and consider it ""cringe"" - let us tell you, you're not alone. Valentine's Day is on its way to becoming one of the most hated events around the globe, and India is no exception.  ""My boyfriend doesn’t believe in Valentine’s Week or Valentine’s Day. It’s not that he’s not romantic, he is, but he doesn’t believe in the concept of celebrating a specific day for love,"" says Ruchi Sharma*, a 25-year-old working professional from Delhi NCR. Ruchi shares the same belief. She feels the day has become too commercialised to be meaningful.

 Nivedita, a 31-year-old, echoed a similar sentiment in a recent survey, ""It might come off as pessimistic, but I’m just being a realist. I don’t think these V-Day matches will work out because they are so rushed and desperate. After all, it’s just another day. Why give it so much importance?""‘Too much effort for a day’ Now, we are not saying that people aren't celebrating the day at ALL. But there's a section - even in India - that is opposed to the idea of dressing up in red or spending extravagantly. A recent study by Quack Quack, an online dating app, found that 23 per cent of daters above 26 see it as just another reminder of their relationship status - or the lack of it. The study also found that many couples prefer treating it as any other day, with 9 per cent stating they don’t believe in celebrating Valentine’s Day in a grand manner and would rather focus on making consistent, sustainable efforts throughout the year. The study highlights a stark difference in how Gen Z and Millennials perceive the day. Among 22,000 respondents, 2,560 daters between 20 and 25 expressed their dislike for the commercialisation of the occasion, arguing that ""bigger gifts being equated with bigger love"" has placed unnecessary pressure on people.

 A 22-year-old civil service aspirant, Naren, quips, ""Let’s rename it 'pressure cooker day' because we’re cooked if we plan a bad date and equally cooked in the process of planning the perfect one."" Millennials, on the other hand, have mixed feelings about the day. 13 per cent of female daters reportedly embrace the spirit of love, while 2 in 5 men claim they are 'over it', feeling the weight of all things heart-shaped and the ever-growing expectations.For some, it’s just a Western concept To understand why some people find Valentine's Day cringe-worthy, we need to recognise that some believe the origin of the day is not part of Indian culture and is a foreign concept. There are various theories about how the day came into existence, but the most popular one revolves around a priest named Valentine, who lived during the reign of Emperor Claudius II in the 3rd century. Claudius had banned marriages for young men, believing that single soldiers fought better than married ones. Valentine defied this order and secretly conducted weddings—not so cringe, right? When the emperor found out, he had Valentine arrested and sentenced to death. While in prison, Valentine supposedly fell in love with the jailer’s daughter and sent her a letter signed ""From your Valentine"", a phrase still used today. He was executed on 14th February, which later became a day of remembrance in his honour. Fast-forward to 2025, and St Valentine could never have imagined that the day of his execution would turn into a massive money-making event for brands. Now, coming back to why some singles and couples choose not to celebrate the day—there are a few reasons. For some, the concept feels too Western to accept. For others, it’s not just about commercialisation but over-commercialisation, which has driven many people away from the day. Today, brands jump on the Valentine's Day fever, offering discounts ""in the spirit of love,"" further pressuring people to celebrate and making some feel disassociated.

 Shreya Kaul, a psychologist, shares her thoughts on the overwhelming nature of Valentine's Day. “On Feb 14, suddenly everything turns red, pink, purple, and hot. I think it’s a bit overdone now. It was fine when it was limited to restaurants and gifts—still acceptable—but now it’s blown up so much that it’s almost ridiculous. Everything just gets drenched in pink and red, and suddenly, even brands like Blinkit are giving out Valentine's cards. It’s just a lot after a certain point. When it’s so in your face, it becomes overwhelming. And then, the moment February 14 is over—poof! Love disappears. Everything is gone, as if it never existed,” she says. Riya Shah*, a 21-year-old student from Kolkata, also finds the celebration unnecessary. “It is dumb to celebrate as it has no real meaning. Like, some guy just decided it was going to be lovers’ day, and everyone followed?” Riya tells India Today that she would rather celebrate her anniversary than spend extravagantly on Valentine's Day. Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist, explains that Valentine's Day (especially the week leading up to it) is associated with things like roses, teddy bears, and promises. Even though there are non-materialistic aspects, the focus still remains on how to commercialise love. “As Indians, our culture is quite modest, and open expressions of love aren't as common. So, some people see it as just a marketing gimmick. Many feel that businesses are simply trying to take more money out of our pockets, which is why an entire week has been dedicated to spending,” she says. At the same time, she acknowledges that others believe love can be expressed without spending excessively. For them, calling the day ‘cringe’ and choosing not to celebrate is simply a better option.Social media play a role here too Sherya points out that social media have made things worse by adding this constant pressure to do more. She says people feel like they have to go big, like there’s some unspoken rule that Valentine’s Day has to be extravagant. “It’s almost as if it has to be a thing rather than just a simple, meaningful experience between two people. Instead of just enjoying the day, it’s becoming a forced, tokenistic display,” says Sherya. The over-the-top gifts and grand gestures that couples share on social media, along with brands aggressively promoting their campaigns, have only amplified the sense of spectacle. It has reached a point where even those in relationships find the whole thing, well, too much to take. For couples (especially men), it creates pressure to act a certain way and do something elaborate, even if they don’t need to or want to. The overwhelming presence of advertisements and campaigns makes it super cringe. Some people enjoy the over-the-top sweetness of their partners, but they wouldn’t normally behave that way. Acting outside of one’s usual behaviour adds to the cringe factor.”

 For those who are single, the experience is no better. The relentless romanticising of love can feel suffocating.   “The campaigns leading up to Valentine’s Day last for a week or two, making it feel like an unavoidable spectacle. The elaborate aspects of Kiss Day, Propose Day, Chocolate Day, and Teddy Day make it unnecessarily dramatic,” she adds.  Sherya explains that at its core, cringe is about excess - when things go so far beyond what’s necessary that they feel performative and detached from real emotion. And let’s not forget the dramatic build-up - because apparently, one day isn’t enough to celebrate love. “Cringe is something so extra that it makes you ask, ‘Why are you doing this?’ It’s that acute sense of embarrassment or awkwardness so visceral that your body reacts to it. Over-the-top gestures feel unnecessary and exaggerated, making normal life seem, well, normal,” Sherya concludes.  Do you think Valentine's Day is overhyped? Let us know in the comments!
