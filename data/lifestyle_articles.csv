Celebrities worldwide, from Hollywood A-listers to Indian fitness enthusiasts, are singing its praises, calling it the “magic molecule” for youth, energy, and longevity. But what is NAD+, why are stars obsessed with it, and how is it impacting the Indian wellness market? Dr Anjali Hooda, a renowned MD and Internist, explains, “NAD+ is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It plays a critical role in energy production, DNA repair, and slowing the ageing process. As we age, NAD+ levels decline, leading to fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and visible signs of ageing. Boosting NAD+ levels can help rejuvenate the body at a cellular level.”Why celebrities are hooked From Kendall Jenner to Hailey Beiber, celebrities are reportedly using NAD+ therapies for their anti-ageing and energy-boosting effects. Intravenous (IV) NAD+ drips have become a sought-after treatment among the elite, promising to enhance mental clarity, physical performance, and even recovery from jet lag or rigorous schedules.

 Bollywood has not been left behind. Indian stars, under the guidance of experts like Dr Hooda, are embracing NAD+ to maintain their hectic lifestyles and youthful appearances. “Actors and performers need peak energy levels and radiant skin, which NAD+ helps achieve. It’s no surprise they’re obsessed with it,” she says.How NAD+ works its magic NAD+ supports mitochondrial function - the powerhouse of our cells - helping convert food into energy. It also activates sirtuins, proteins associated with longevity and repair. By replenishing NAD+ levels, individuals may experience improved metabolism, better focus, and resistance to age-related diseases. Dr Hooda points out that while IV treatments are popular among celebrities, oral supplements, NAD+ precursors like NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), and even topical applications are entering the mainstream.Impact on the Indian market India’s wellness industry, already booming with trends like IV therapy bars and biohacking clinics, is rapidly adopting NAD+ treatments. Luxury wellness centers in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru are offering NAD+ IV drips, priced between Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000 per session. “The Indian market is seeing a surge in demand for high-end, evidence-based treatments,” says Dr Hooda. “NAD+ fits perfectly into this space, appealing to health-conscious millennials and the ultra-wealthy alike.” Affordable NAD+ supplements, manufactured by Indian pharmaceutical companies, are also making their way into drugstores and e-commerce platforms. Experts believe this accessibility could make NAD+ the next big thing in India’s burgeoning nutraceutical market.The science vs the hype While NAD+ shows immense promise, skeptics caution against over-reliance on it as a miracle cure. Dr Hooda advises, “It’s important to pair NAD+ therapies with a balanced diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. The molecule is a tool, not a standalone solution.”The verdict As awareness of NAD+ grows, India stands poised to become a major player in this global trend. With celebrities endorsing it and experts advocating its benefits, the “magic molecule” might just be the future of wellness. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast or simply looking to age gracefully, NAD+ offers a compelling promise: a chance to biohack your way to better health.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

Microdosing Ozempic has gained momentum online, with people hoping to use the weight-loss benefits while dodging the side effects. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-microdosing-on-ozempic-help-you-lose-weight-without-any-side-effects-2651165-2024-12-18,"The weight-loss market is evolving more than ever. Crash diets, wellness programmes, injectables, supplements, and more are expected to create a massive global market worth USD 405 billion by 2030. India’s market is also anticipated to reach USD 52.3 billion by 2032. Among all these products and treatments, one that has garnered significant attention, especially after notable personalities like Elon Musk spoke about it, is Ozempic. However, it’s important to note that Ozempic was never originally intended as a weight-loss drug.What is Ozempic? Unless you've been living under a rock, you must have heard of Ozempic, which is actually a brand name for a semaglutide, an injectable medication used primarily to manage Type 2 diabetes. 

 



Microdosing Ozempic is gaining attention online. Photo: Getty Images

It belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which work by mimicking the action of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
This hormone helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes insulin production, and reduces the production of glucose in the liver. One of its notable effects is slowing down stomach emptying, which increases the feeling of fullness.
Although Ozempic was initially developed to manage diabetes, it has gained attention for its potential to aid in weight loss.
Some studies suggest that it can help users shed 5-10 per cent of their body weight when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. This weight loss effect has led to a growing interest in its off-label use for obesity management.
What are the side effects? While Ozempic is effective for managing blood sugar and promoting weight loss, it is not free from side effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Some people may also experience fatigue, dizziness, or mild headaches. These side effects are more common when starting the medication and tend to subside as the body adjusts.

 



Ozempic comes with various side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Photo: Unsplash
 In rare cases, serious side effects such as pancreatitis, gallbladder issues, or allergic reactions may occur. Dr Archana Batra, a dietician and certified diabetes educator, tells India Today, “Some people have experienced side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and fatigue, which create various problems in their daily lives.”  However, if there’s one side effect that almost all people who take Ozempic is losing muscle mass, while losing weight. This has also given rise to terms like “Ozempic face” and “Ozempic body”, which often occur when people lose muscle mass drastically due to taking Ozempic.  To avoid these side effects, and to avoid “Ozempic face and body” and still lose weight, some experts came up with the mircodosing of the drug, and it is now gaining more attention as a better way to take Ozempic. Can microdosing Ozempic actually help?  One of the first people to mention microdosing Ozempic was Dr Craig Koniver, a medical professional with over 1,20,000 followers on Instagram, in October 2024. Craig spoke on the Huberman Lab podcast, where he discussed how he had observed individuals taking Ozempic in much smaller amounts than the conventional doses. According to him, “these people were avoiding the side effects, essentially the loss of muscle mass”.

— Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D. (@hubermanlab) October 8, 2024 For context, microdosing involves administering smaller-than-usual doses of a drug to help the body adapt gradually. For Ozempic, this means starting with a very low dose and slowly increasing it over time.  According to Dr Aprajita Pradhan, senior consultant and unit head of endocrinology at Max Super Speciality Hospital, “Ozempic is usually started with a low weekly dose for 4 weeks, then the dose is up-titrated to reach the desired blood glucose control. This method of starting at a low dose helps in decreasing the side effects of Ozempic.” Dr Bhatra also seems to agree that using this approach, you can reduce the intensity of side effects. However, Niharikka Budhwani, a doctor of medicine and co-founder of Health Hatch, a wellness company, advises caution, stating, “Microdosing of any medication must be done under the supervision of a licenced doctor and is highly subjective, varying on a case-to-case basis. While this method appears promising, it should always be done with medical guidance.”Can other drugs be ‘microdosed’?  Microdosing is the practice of administering subtherapeutic doses of a drug (like Ozempic) to enhance tolerance, minimise side effects, or explore its effects at lower concentrations. The core principle is to allow the body to gradually adjust to the medication, thereby avoiding the ""shock"" that might come with a full dose. Experts suggest that this technique is not unique to Ozempic and is often used for other medications (including other weight-loss drugs), particularly those with strong side effects. Dr Batra says, “By using this approach, you can reduce the intensity of side effects. For example, in the beginning, users should start with low doses and extend to the titration period.” 

 



Experts agree that microdosing can possibly help in avoiding side effects. Photo: Unsplash
 This gradual increase helps users avoid sudden reactions, which can be particularly helpful for drugs with gastrointestinal side effects. Dr Pradhan adds that this could work for other weight-loss drugs too, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro are likely to be launched in India by 2025-26, and can also benefit from microdosing.  He further says, “Most of the recently approved injectable weight loss medications are initially started with a lower dose to improve patient tolerability and reduce side effects.” Experts believe that apart from weight-loss drugs, microdosing can also be applied to other medications as well. For instance, antidepressants are often microdosed to avoid sudden side effects like insomnia or restlessness.  But not all drugs are suitable for microdosing. The feasibility depends on the drug’s mechanism of action, its half-life, and the body’s ability to adapt to it over time.advertisementRememberOzempic’s potential for weight loss has brought it into the spotlight, but its side effects have raised concerns for many users.

67993ec6-c297-42c0-9f64-aa034dd528f2,"You've been misunderstanding Trauma Bonding all along. It's a toxic trapMany may assume trauma bonding is a positive bond shared over a past trauma, but you will be surprised that it is absolutely not what you think.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/youve-been-misunderstanding-trauma-bonding-all-along-its-a-toxic-trap-2651160-2024-12-17,"When we say ""trauma bonding""—what comes to mind? Many might assume it’s a connection formed through shared trauma, but it’s more complex—and far more toxic—than it seems at first instance. Trauma bonding isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a psychological phenomenon that traps individuals in harmful relationships through cycles of abuse and affection.What is trauma bonding? According to Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, trauma bonding occurs when an abuser creates a cycle of manipulation by alternating between abusive behaviour and affectionate gestures. This unpredictable pattern makes the victim emotionally dependent, confusing love with control and harm. “The abuser alternates between harmful behaviour (abuse, manipulation) and positive behaviour (affection, apologies), creating confusion and dependency in the victim. This cycle makes the relationship feel unpredictable yet difficult to leave, as moments of ‘kindness’ can create a 'euphoric recall' of all the good memories,” says Ruuh.

 Relationship expert Shahzeen Shivdasani adds that trauma bonding is not about shared past traumas but staying in a toxic relationship where emotional abuse is followed by periods of kindness. This pattern fosters dependency, keeping victims emotionally hooked. Ekta Khurana, another Delhi-based psychologist and therapist mentions that sometimes victims are absolutely aware that the person showcasing the behaviour is toxic but yet, they cannot break free from the relationship.How does it affect mental health? The psychological toll of trauma bonding is severe. Ruuh explains that the constant highs and lows can lead to anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Victims often internalise blame, suffer from low self-esteem, and mistakenly believe they are responsible for the abuse.

 She also mentions that one of the downsides of forming such a bond is that the abuser’s approval becomes the source of the victim’s worth and safety, creating unhealthy reliance. This creates a unique kind of dependency on the abusers and victims stay too long trying to make sense of this relationship.How does trauma bonding develop? Shivdasani attributes the development of trauma bonding to intermittent reinforcement, where periods of affection follow abusive episodes. Victims try to rationalise their partner’s erratic behaviour, hoping for lasting change, which rarely comes. Additionally, people with insecure attachment styles or unresolved childhood trauma are more prone to falling into such toxic cycles, says Ruuh. “Over time, the tension-abuse-reconciliation cycle becomes normalised, making it harder to recognise the toxicity. Abusers often isolate their victim from their support systems like family and friends, making the abusive relationship the only emotional outlet for the victims,” mentions Ruuh.Breaking free and healing Ekta Khurana outlines the essential steps to break free:
Awareness: Recognise that the relationship is toxic and built on manipulation.
Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, join support groups, or seek therapy.
Document patterns: Keep a journal of abusive incidents to combat gaslighting.
Set boundaries: Establish physical and emotional distance from the abuser.
Rebuild self-worth: Invest in self-care, hobbies, and healthy social connections.
Therapeutic help: Consider therapies like CBT or EMDR for deep-rooted trauma.
Red flags to watch for Shahzeen Shivdasani highlights warning signs of trauma bonding:
The relationship alternates between intense affection and mistreatment.
The abuser justifies harmful behaviour as ‘for your own good’.
You feel isolated from friends and family.
Ending the relationship triggers anxiety or guilt.
Misconceptions about trauma bonding Contrary to popular belief, trauma bonding isn’t mutual or limited to romantic relationships. It can occur in friendships, workplaces, and family dynamics where power imbalances exist. So, watch out!Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 17, 2024

There are several struggles that often go unnoticed despite the ever-growing Indian pet market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/pet-dog-owners-struggles-india-2650652-2024-12-17,"When 20-year-old art student Gargy Sharma from Delhi finally convinced her parents to go on a long-awaited family outing, she was thrilled. More than for herself, she was excited for Cheddar, her 2-year-old poodle, as it was his birthday month. The destination was pre-decided: a high-end, pet-friendly hangout street in Gurugram. However, her excitement quickly turned to disappointment when she discovered that Cheddar wasn’t allowed inside most restaurants there. Pets were restricted to the outdoor street area only. When you bring a pet into your home, it becomes a beloved family member. Your travel plans, daily routines, and overall lifestyle naturally adjust to accommodate their needs and presence. You willingly make compromises in various aspects of your life to prioritise the well-being of your furry companion. Indian pet parents, especially dog owners, however, feel that India is yet to become more accommodating for pets. There are several struggles that often go unnoticed despite the ever-growing Indian pet market. According to the Ken Research report published in July 2024, the Indian pet market was valued at USD 9.85 billion in 2023. This growth is driven by increasing pet ownership, rising disposable incomes, and a shift in consumer attitudes that view pets as family members. Additionally, the rise of DINK (Double Income, No Kids) couples, who often choose pets over having children, has also contributed to this trend. Consequently, there has been a proliferation of pet care products and services, including premium pet food, grooming, and veterinary care.

The overall population of pet dogs in India was over 33 million in 2023, and it is is likely to reach more than 51 million by 2028.Yet, pet dog owners in India often witness challenges at basic levels, such as travelling with their pets or gaining acceptance in housing societies.Healthcare hassles Dogs dominate the pet market in India. The overall population of pet dogs in India was over 33 million in 2023, and it is is likely to reach more than 51 million by 2028. Yet, pet dog owners in India often witness challenges at basic levels, such as travelling with their pets or gaining acceptance in housing societies.Healthcare hassles “Although the pet clinic culture is thriving in India, access to proper pet hospitals remains a significant challenge. There is a dire shortage,” says Koustav Das, a Noida resident and owner of a Labrador. “A friend took his dog to a regular veterinarian, where the pet was misdiagnosed. The dog is still suffering because of it,” he shares. Rashi Narang, founder of the leading pet care brand Heads Up For Tails and owner of two pet dogs, agrees and adds, “Reliable veterinary services and specialised care can still be hard to find in certain parts of India. Many pet parents struggle to access timely medical advice, emergency care, or advanced treatments, especially in smaller towns.”Travel woes Travelling with pets is another significant issue. Whether you wish to take a cab, train, or flight – you are likely to encounter several challenges if you are travelling with your pet. Limited carriers allow pet travel, and in India, Air India is one of them. While smaller pets, such as dogs weighing under 10 kg, are permitted to travel in the cabin, larger dogs must travel in the cargo hold. Rashi recalls having an exceptionally difficult experience while travelling with her pets on a flight. “The process involved a significant amount of paperwork, and I had to drop my dog off at the cargo terminal many hours before the flight. She had to stay in a crate for several hours, which was incredibly stressful for both of us. While there are options for very small dogs to travel in the cabin on select airlines, we need to do much more to accommodate dogs of all sizes. Larger dogs are often restricted to travelling in cargo, where they face altitude changes, loud noises, and unfamiliar surroundings. It’s a scary and isolating experience for them, and as pet parents, it’s heartbreaking to think of our pets enduring such stress,” she tells India Today.

 



Little pets weighing under 10kg can travel in cabin with the passenger but bigger pets travel in cages along in the cargo hold (Photo: Air India)
 Many pet parents enrol their dogs in air travel training programmes to help them remain calm and unaffected during long-haul journeys in a cargo hold. Rashi, meanwhile, suggests introducing innovative solutions such as pet-friendly cabin options, specialised compartments for pets, and enhanced safety and comfort measures in cargo. “Travelling with a pet should be a positive experience, not a daunting one, and I hope we can work towards a future where all pets, regardless of size, can travel safely and comfortably with their families,” she tells India Today. Among cab providers, Ola does not yet offer a pet-friendly option. Uber, on the other hand, has launched a pet travel service, but it is currently available only in Bengaluru. In terms of train travel, the pet parent is supposed to book a two-seater coupe or a four-berth cabin to travel with their fur buddies. So, availability becomes a huge factor. In case you have to travel urgently, it is really difficult to take your pet along. Alternatively, some trains provide dog boxes where pets travel like 'luggage.' They are placed in a designated dog box located in second-class compartments. If you have a kitten or a puppy that can be carried in a basket, they can be carried by owners in any class after payment of the usual booking charges.advertisementPet boarding – Difficult to find good optionsIf travelling is an issue, leaving behind your pet at a boarding centre is no less challenging.“I discovered a pet boarding centre in Chhatarpur through Just Dial when I had to travel with my family to Dubai for a week. However, during a basic inspection visit, we were shocked by the conditions. It was a simple residential setup with barely any outdoor space for the dogs. Beer bottles were scattered around, suggesting a party had taken place the night before. Naturally, we decided not to leave our Golden Retriever there. The most alarming part was that such boarding centres operate without skilled staff,” Divya Arora, a 32-year-old professional in Delhi, tells India Today.Bengaluru-based Shobhit Mohanty, who founded the pet parent community and educational platform ThePack.in after encountering several hurdles and challenges in his pet parenting journey, shares similar thoughts.“India’s pet-friendliness is improving but lags significantly behind countries like the US, Germany, and the UK. Challenges such as limited access to quality veterinary care, behaviour trainers, pet-friendly parks, trustworthy boarding centres, and pet-friendly travel options remain significant,” he says.advertisementShobhit also highlights the need for stronger pet laws and, more importantly, better enforcement in India.“While laws against illegal breeding and animal cruelty exist, their implementation is weak, leading to widespread illegal breeding and frequent animal cruelty cases,” he says.Housing issuesKoustav adds how Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and housing society managements often impose unreasonable rules on pet owners, such as requiring dogs to be muzzled even when walking in parks.Finding pet-friendly housing remains a significant struggle. Many landlords are hesitant about pets, leaving families in tough situations. This is a deeply emotional issue for pet parents.

“There’s still a lack of understanding about pet behaviour in some communities. Pet parents often find themselves defending their decision to bring pets home or navigating situations where pets are misunderstood or even feared,” she adds.Pet attacks cannot be ignored either, with instances of pet dogs biting people in shared public spaces like elevators.

From registering the pet to ensuring it receives annual booster shots, many are unaware of these essential responsibilities,” shares Koustav.He believes that as pet parents become more responsible and better informed, society’s perception of pet dogs will gradually change. “It requires a collective effort from both the government and pet parents,” he adds.“New pet parents need education on basics like toilet training, puppy biting, diet, and health.

Dr Suman S Karanth, senior consultant in medical oncology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, points out that while laboratory studies on animal tissue and cancer cells have demonstrated some anti-cancer activity in prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancer cells, ""these studies are not in humans"".   She warns that without clinical trials, there is no concrete evidence to support soursop’s efficacy in treating cancer in humans. Dr Karanth also raises concerns about the toxic effects of soursop’s acetogenin compounds, which can cause neurotoxicity and immune suppression.

 Dr Pooja Babbar, a consultant in medical oncology at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, further explains that even though soursop contains acetogenins, which may have cytotoxic effects (toxic effects on cell function) on cancer cells by inhibiting specific compounds found in cancer cell membranes.  The consensus among experts is clear: While soursop’s potential as a cancer-fighting agent is supported by preclinical studies (on animals), there is no substantial human evidence to validate its use as a cancer treatment. But does it mean that the fruit has no benefits? Well, no. Does it have any benefits? Soursop offers several potential health benefits due to its rich nutritional content. The fruit is a source of essential vitamins (like Vitamin C, B1, and B2), minerals (like potassium, magnesium, and calcium), antioxidants, and dietary fibre. According to Dr Shilpa M R, a consultant and dietitian at Kshemavana Yoga and Naturopathy Centre, Bengaluru, the fruit: 
Boosts immunity: Soursop can ""boost immunity"" through its high Vitamin C content, which promotes the generation of white blood cells.
Rich in antioxidants: Soursop’s ""antioxidant property prevents cancer"" by combating oxidative stress in the body.
Promotes digestive health: Soursop's high fibre content helps maintain gut health and prevent constipation.
Regulates blood pressure: Dr Shilpa M R notes that its potassium content helps control blood pressure by balancing sodium levels and relaxing blood vessels.

Reduces inflammation: Soursop has anti-inflammatory properties, which may offer relief for joint pain and other inflammatory conditions.
Promotes skin and hair health: The antioxidants and Vitamin C in soursop support collagen production and fight signs of ageing.
May help stabilise blood sugar levels: Dr Babbar notes that soursop may help stabilise blood sugar levels, which could benefit those managing diabetes.
 Experts recommend consuming soursop in its natural form as a fruit, as it is considered safe for most people. However, they urge caution when using soursop supplements and other products as they are yet to be approved officially by the Food and Drug Administration. Potential side effects Despite its numerous health benefits, soursop also carries potential side effects. Experts caution that excessive consumption or unsupervised use of soursop could lead to adverse effects, particularly for those with pre-existing health conditions.
Neurotoxicity: Prof Chintamani warns that soursop ""is not very safe for those on treatment for neurological disorders like Parkinson disease"", as it may worsen symptoms and interfere with neurological treatments.
Toxic effects: Dr Karanth highlights that soursop’s fatty acid derivatives, called acetogenins, are ""toxic"" and linked to neurotoxicity, which can cause hair loss and immune system suppression.
Interference with cardiovascular treatments: Soursop could interfere with cardiovascular treatments and metabolic activities, urging caution and the supervision of a medical expert or nutritionist.
Nausea and vomiting: Dr Babbar mentions that soursop consumption can cause ""nausea, vomiting"" and a drop in blood pressure.
Allergic reactions: Dr Shilpa points out that some individuals may experience allergic responses like rashes or itching after consuming soursop.

However, it is certainly possible to keep the spark alive.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/indian-married-couples-romance-alive-while-living-with-family-2648573-2024-12-15,"The thought of cooking a meal together with your spouse, sneaking in playful cuddles along the way, or sharing an evening of passionate romance while curled up on the couch watching a favourite movie, are a few things many couples dream of. These dreams, however, often remain just that for couples living in joint family setups. Couples living with families find it difficult to cherish romance-filled moments owing to a lack of privacy, constant interruptions, and some unspoken expectations. Sometimes, you don’t even have the bandwidth to think of such things because you are so engrossed in family life, children, and all its demands. Sounds like the reality of your life? But does this mean living with family is a bad idea? No! Does it also mean that you let romance take a backseat due to family obligations? Definitely not! Marriage counsellors say finding privacy and keeping romance alive is a common issue for Indian couples who live under the same roof as their families – as it limits privacy and intimacy and creates obstacles for meaningful couple time. Not just physical intimacy, but emotional intimacy can also take a backseat. “Often, couples fall into routines where romance takes a backseat. This happens because their focus shifts to caregiving, household responsibilities, and managing complex family dynamics,” Dr Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based marriage counsellor, tells India Today.

 



Have a trouble keeping romance alive while living with family? Don't worry, it is possible to navigate this situation. (Photo: Pexels)
“Many clients seek counselling for these concerns. Common issues include the lack of private time, one partner prioritising time with parents over the couple’s relationship, overwhelming household responsibilities, and the pressures of living with in-laws. If children are involved, the added responsibilities can further strain the relationship,” she adds. “Many clients seek counselling for these concerns. Common issues include the lack of private time, one partner prioritising time with parents over the couple’s relationship, overwhelming household responsibilities, and the pressures of living with in-laws. If children are involved, the added responsibilities can further strain the relationship,” she adds. This dynamic can negatively impact your marriage. Such challenges can leave couples feeling overwhelmed, leading to frustration and resentment. But there is a way out, of course! All you need is an intention along with a bit of creativity.Firstly, be intentional You and your partner need to have an intention to keep the romance alive—only then can you create the mental space and find creative solutions. You have to sit together, talk it out, and express your expectations. “When living with family, keeping the romance alive requires creativity and intentional effort. Couples must ensure that intimacy doesn’t take a backseat by prioritising alone time and setting boundaries with family members,” says Shahzeen Shivdasani, a Mumbai-based relationship expert and author. Be intentional about maintaining physical intimacy.

 “It requires both partners to work intentionally and proactively as a team,” adds Dr Khanna.Set boundaries with family members Setting boundaries with family members is essential for maintaining romance after marriage. It’s never too late to make changes for the better. Your parents or in-laws might not have prioritised such moments with their respective partners due to household responsibilities, but you don’t have to take the same route. It is possible to respect family and have your own personal space as a couple while living in the same house. “Designate time after everyone goes to sleep as your private moments or create a dedicated space in the house that’s just for the two of you,” suggests Shahzeen. Communicate your need for quality time with your partner to your family, and explain it respectfully. Be consistent with your efforts, and present this as non-negotiable. To maintain balance, ensure to encourage family activities on separate occasions.Carve out ‘us’ time – staycations, walks, date nights Stealing those flirty, playful moments beyond the four walls of your bedroom or at unexpected times of the day might be your idea of keeping the romance alive, but there is so much more you can do to keep the spark burning. Dr Khanna, a marriage counsellor with over 15 years of experience, recommends scheduling regular date nights or outings. This could include having lunch or dinner together, going to a movie, enjoying a long drive, or simply spending private moments as a couple. These small gestures create meaningful experiences that strengthen the bond. “To break the monotony of being confined to the bedroom, find creative ways to add excitement while living with family. Couples could perhaps plan activities that take them out of the house, such as walks, short drives, or outdoor picnics, to enjoy private moments in a different setting. Setting up a cosy nook in the living room or balcony for intimate conversations or movie nights might create a change of scene,” suggests Delhi-based marriage counsellor Shivani Sadhoo. If space is limited at home, plan monthly staycations to enjoy quality time together.

 



Go on weekly dates or plan monthly staycations with your partner. (Photo: Pexels)
 At least dedicate one hour to just each other, where no third party is there to interrupt. “Couples often face challenges when one partner feels the other is overly involved with their family. To address this, I suggest dedicating at least an hour each day exclusively to each other, during which family matters are not discussed,” says Dr Khanna. This could be your chai time in the morning, a long walk or a badminton date in the evening, or a little time on the terrace.Little gestures matter Give your partner a peck when they least expect it, don’t shy away from holding their hands or hugging them in front of the family. Plan those little surprises. Leave love-filled notes. These little gestures matter and can keep you two connected. Even activities like solving a puzzle or playing board games help. You can also send playful texts, emojis, or memes to stay connected even while at home. “Scheduling time when other family members are out or engaged may also help. Small surprises such as a home-cooked meal, surprise gifts, or planned activities can bring novelty and joy to their relationship,” suggests Shivani Sadhoo. Intimacy is a vital part of any relationship, and living with family might mean working a bit harder to nurture it. But by being creative, working as a team, and being excited and proactive – your connection is sure to remain strong and vibrant.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 15, 2024Tune InALSO READ |  Should newlyweds live on their own for the first few years of marriage?Trending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/how-to-manage-your-childs-anger-and-stubbornness-2649430-2024-12-14,"When you have a child around, it's common to see them get upset or angry when they don't get what they want. A simple wish can quickly turn into a tantrum, with crying and howling when it's unmet. But when their desires are fulfilled, their faces light up with a big grin. Parenting isn’t easy, and parents often find themselves criticised no matter what they do. If they give in to their child’s demands, they're accused of spoiling them. If they refuse, they’re labelled as heartless or uncaring. But the question here is: should parents give in to their child's stubbornness and anger, or is there a better way to navigate these moments?The loud display of anger Dr Sarthak Dave, an Ahmedabad-based psychiatrist, tells India Today that kids become stubborn and express their anger loudly because they absorb behaviours from their surroundings and consider them normal. If they frequently observe their parents displaying anger or reacting loudly, they learn to replicate this behaviour, believing it to be acceptable. He explains, ""At a young age, their id—the instinctual drive to fulfil their desires—is very strong, while their ego (logical reasoning) and superego (moral understanding) are still underdeveloped and grow with age and experience. When children want something, they struggle to think logically or anticipate the consequences of their actions. If they don’t get what they want, they feel distress and express it in ways they’ve learnt from their environment.""

Additionally, if they’ve previously received what they wanted by acting out, this behaviour gets reinforced, encouraging them to repeat it. Additionally, if they’ve previously received what they wanted by acting out, this behaviour gets reinforced, encouraging them to repeat it. Further, Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, tells us that kids can be stubborn or loud because they don’t yet have the words or skills to express their emotions or because they feel ignored or misunderstood by adults. She mentions that these outbursts are their way of coping with emotions they can’t fully control or explain. According to Patel, while kids do learn from their environment and often replicate their parents, stubbornness is also a natural part of development as children learn to assert themselves. It doesn’t always mean parents are at fault.What does this stubbornness say about your kid? A child’s stubbornness, anger, and loud reactions are often ways of acting out due to their limited ability to handle emotions and distress. ""These behaviours indicate that the child may not yet be developing the emotional tools needed to cope effectively. If such reactions are not addressed or discouraged, they can become ingrained as primitive defence mechanisms, suggesting that the child’s emotional growth is not progressing as it should,"" says Dr Dave. Meanwhile, Patel feels that stubbornness and anger are signs that a child:
Is seeking attention, understanding, or control.
May be feeling overwhelmed, insecure, or unsure how to handle a situation.
Is in a stage of development where they’re learning to test limits and establish independence.
Impact on mental health According to the experts, if left unchecked, constant anger and stubbornness can lead to issues such as difficulty managing emotions later in life, strained relationships with peers and family, and increased feelings of frustration or anxiety.

 



Anger and stubbornness can have long-term effects on a child's emotional development (Photo: Getty Images)
What should you do as a parent? Dr Sajeela Maini, senior consultant, department of psychiatry and behavioural sciences, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, states that parents should not give in to their child’s stubbornness and anger, as this will only make the child more stubborn, and their anger levels will increase multifold. Parents should make sure they are not rewarding such behaviour. By rewarding them, you are feeding stubbornness and anger, and this will only increase the tantrums. While Riddhi Doshi Patel agrees, she mentions that this doesn’t mean parents should ignore their child’s feelings. Instead, they should acknowledge their child’s emotions, set clear and consistent boundaries, and stay calm while avoiding engaging in a power struggle. To this, Dr Sarthak Dave adds that parents should prioritise guiding their children toward healthier ways of expressing their needs and help them move from immature defence mechanisms to more mature ones. Teaching effective and constructive communication methods is vital for their emotional development. To manage a difficult situation, you must...
Stay calm: Children often mirror your emotions. Responding with calmness can help de-escalate the situation.
Acknowledge their feelings: Show empathy by saying, ""I see you’re upset. Do you want to talk about it?""
Set clear boundaries: Be consistent with rules and consequences. Children feel safer when they know what to expect.
Offer choices: Giving children small choices helps them feel in control, reducing the need for stubborn behaviour. 
Teach problem-solving skills: Encourage them to use words to express their feelings or brainstorm solutions together.
Model healthy behaviour: Show them how to handle frustration calmly. For example, say, ""I feel frustrated too sometimes, and I take deep breaths to help.""

It’s spicy. It’s warm. It’s comfort in a bowl. For many Indians, Ema Datshi has become the ultimate go-to comfort food. You can enjoy it with rice or stick to tradition by pairing it with tingmo - a soft, steamed bread from Tibetan cuisine. For Sherya, a 26-year-old working professional from Delhi NCR, it’s the dish she “makes in no time” and whenever she’s craving something spicy yet indulgently cheesy.  “I cook it when I don’t have the time to make anything, and when I am feeling lazy. It’s my comfort food now,” she says.  And Shreya is far from alone. Google India’s year-end report, Year in Search 2024: What Sparked Curiosity Across India on Google, revealed that Ema Datshi was one of the top 10 most-searched recipes in the country. Interestingly, while it has captured Indian hearts (and taste buds), Ema Datshi is actually a culinary treasure from Bhutan and is often known as the country's national dish.   But how did this humble Bhutanese classic become one of India’s most searched recipes this year? The answer lies in the magic of social media,  and, of course, Deepika Padukone.  Let’s whip this up from scratch, and tell you a little about this dish first. Bhutan and their love for “Ema” The picturesque Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan boasts a cuisine that varies from region to region. Yet, if there’s one thing that unites the nation’s palate, it’s their deep-rooted love for chillies. Ema Datshi is a hearty, soul-warming stew where chillies take centre stage, paired with a unique local cheese that melts into a luscious, creamy sauce.  The name itself captures its essence - “Ema” means chilli and “Datshi” means cheese in Dzongkha, the national language of Bhutan. But for the Bhutanese, it’s more than just food; it’s a reflection of culture and tradition served on a plate. No meal in Bhutan is complete without Ema Datshi, and it shows the nation’s enduring love affair with chillies. For generations, it has been a household staple, enjoyed with red rice or tingmo.

 Ema Datshi evolved to meet the specific requirements of Bhutan and its people – the dish is extremely high in fats, and the addition of chillies was meant to help improve circulation and offer warmth in the colder winter months. 
You can also try making different kinds of Datshi. Apart from the OG Ema Datshi, there is Kewa Datshi, which offers a milder twist with thinly sliced potatoes simmered in the same rich, cheesy broth, resulting in a hearty, comforting dish. 
Shamu Datshi, on the other hand, uses mushrooms, and combines them with the signature cheese sauce to create a dish that’s savoury and umami-rich. 
Beyond these classics, there are other creative versions like Goong Datshi (made with spinach) and mixed Datshi, which blends multiple vegetables like cabbage, radish, or green beans into the stew. 
How did it gain fame? In India, however, out of all the types, it is the chillies that have gained more attention for various reasons. Let us discuss each one of them. The Viral Deepika’s video  About a year ago, Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone mentioned a Bhutanese dish in an interview with Curly Tales, noting its similarity to Indian pickles - but with cheese instead of spices. “I forget the name of it, but they have this dish almost a national dish, if I’m not mistaken, which is basically chillies and cheese mashed together. And it’s an achaar equivalent, and they eat it with rice,” Deepika shared in the viral interview.

 Although she couldn’t recall the name at that time, it didn’t take long for the internet to figure it out, the dish she was referring to was none other than Ema Datshi. The clip from the interview quickly went viral, sparking a wave of curiosity.  Food vloggers and social media foodies also jumped on the trend, reimagining the dish in their own creative ways. As the dish is made out of simple ingredients, Ema Datshi became a must-try for home cooks (as it also became viral on YouTube) and food enthusiasts alike, ultimately earning its place as one of India’s most-searched recipes.

 Several eateries have benefited from this growing interest in Ema Datshi. Lha Kitchen, is a Delhi-based restaurant known for its authentic Himalayan cuisine. Amongst its most popular offerings is, unsurprisingly, Ema Datshi. Akshay, the restaurant’s manager of over three years, believes Deepika’s video played a key role in driving interest. Speaking to India Today, he shared, “It was a video by Deepika that also somehow sparked interest, even though there was some interest already for the dish to begin with.” Today, Lha Kitchen serves an average of at least 10 plates of Ema Datshi daily, a significant increase since Deepika's mention put the dish on India’s culinary map.‘Modern Indians have an adventurous palate’ Indians are travelling more than ever. This has also impacted their need and desire to explore various cuisines as authentically as possible. Shivani Sharma, a chefpreneur and founder of Gourmestan, says that the modern Indian is well-travelled, has an adventurous palate, and a desire to explore hitherto underexplored cuisines and dishes.

 “This is further amplified by social media, which have made the world smaller and, at the same time, more intriguing than ever before,” she says. With Bhutan opening its doors to tourists only relatively recently (in the mid-70s), there is a lot of curiosity about the culture and people of one of the happiest countries on earth, Shivani says.Increase curiosity amongst Indians about cuisines  Chef Ishijyot Surri, the executive chef and founder of Mulk, Miniyaturk & SJI Gourmet tells India Today that there is a surge in the popularity of Tibetan and Bhutanese food cultures, especially among urban food lovers.  “These cuisines stand out for their soulful and wholesome nature. I also believe the demand for niche food items such as Ema Datshi has increased in accordance with the rising demand for more commonly known Tibetan dishes such as thukpa and momos,” he says.  He also says this likeness to Indian comfort foods such as dal or curry makes it more approachable for Indians.  Shivani also credits this increased demand for such cuisines to a section of Indians who are becoming more exploratory diners. “There is a deeper understanding of and appreciation for how local cuisines are inextricably tied in to the narratives of the place and its people. Dishes such as Ema Datshi are made with local produce and can be found in nearly every home in Bhutan, the simplicity of such foods and their pastoral roots definitely make them immediate favourites,” Shivani says. Make Ema Datshi, the expert way  We asked experts to share their take on how to make Ema Datshi, so if haven’t tried the dish yet, here’s how you can make it, according to Ishijyot.  “Ema Datshi is all about balance—balancing the heat of the chilies with the creaminess of the cheese,” he says. 
Use fresh green and red chilies for authentic flavour and heat.
Traditionally, yak cheese is used; but a mix of feta and mozzarella works well as a substitute in India.
Simmer the chilies with garlic, onions, and tomatoes in a little water to build a robust base.
Once softened, stir in the cheese to create a creamy consistency. Avoid overcooking to maintain the texture of the cheese.
Pair it with red rice for an authentic experience. The beauty of Ema Datshi lies in its rustic, homely preparation - letting the ingredients shine without overcomplicating the dish.
Shivani gives us a healthier way to make the Datshi.“Our take on Ema Datshi replaces the full-fat cheese with heart-healthier vegan alternatives, and also adds mushrooms to amplify the innate umami flavour of the yak cheese (Datshi),” she says. Check out the healthier recipe: 
Melt the butter in a thick-bottomed pan and sauté the onion and peppers.
Add the chillies and garlic and sauté until fragrant.
Add the mushrooms and tomato. Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins over medium heat.
Lower the heat and add the vegan cream cheese. Season, as required, once the cheese has melted. Finally, add the crumbled tofu, stir until well infused. Serve warm with red rice or gluten-free bread.

This buzzword has sparked a wave of obsession, prompting beauty brands to invest heavily in the trend.
How, you ask? By launching a range of collagen-based products - from supplements and protein powders to moisturisers - capturing the attention of beauty influencers everywhere.  However, unlike other trends, which come and go, collagen stayed for all the right reasons, and looks like it is here to stay.But what is collagen?  Debjani Gupta, a nutritionist and wellness expert from Mumbai, tells India Today that collagen is a vital protein that makes up about 30 per cent of the body's total protein. 

 



Collagen supplements are going viral on Instagram. Photo: Getty Images
 It plays a key role in supporting the skin’s elasticity, plumpness, and firmness. In our twenties and thirties, when collagen levels are higher, the skin appears firm, toned, and radiant, especially if diet and lifestyle habits are healthy.  However, as we age into our forties and fifties, collagen production declines, leading to signs of ageing like sagging skin and reduced skin tone. Functions of collagen in the body Collagen serves several vital functions in the body, such as:
Replacing dead cells: It promotes the growth of new cells.
Protecting organs: Collagen serves as a protective layer for vital organs.
Maintaining skin elasticity: It provides the skin with structure, elasticity, suppleness, and strength.
Assisting blood clotting: Collagen plays a key role in blood clotting when injuries occur.
 All these functions (especially skin elasticity) have made collagen quite popular. However, supplements, powders made out of collagen actually is pretty expensive (avg price goes Rs 2,500 for 500 gm), which has made Indians, especially, turned to “juggad” and are opting natural recipes that allegedly help in boosting collagen production in our body. The viral natural collagen  In the quest for youthful, glowing skin, the spotlight has turned to humble kitchen staples- amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple.

 Today, Skinfluencers are calling it the ""OG collagen boosters"" on social media sites like Instagram. But are these everyday fruits and veggies really capable of turning back the clock on ageing skin? We asked the experts. Breaking down the viral ingredients Amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are often known for their antioxidant and Vitamin C content. But Dr Rinky Kapoor, a consultant dermatologist and surgeon at The Esthetic Clinics, Mumbai, says, “Ingredients like amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are called natural collagen boosters because they are rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants. These nutrients help support your body to produce more collagen for better skin health.""

 



Amla is high in antioxidants. Photo: Getty Images
 However, before you start gulping down litres of juice, here’s a reality check. ""While these ingredients are healthy, they may not work as effectively as collagen supplements,"" Dr Kapoor warns.  ""Juicing them can negatively affect their fibre and nutrient properties, so it’s best to consume them raw or cooked,"" she says.  Sujit Shanshanwal, a Mumbai-based dermatologist, highlights the role of Vitamin C in this process.  ""Vitamin C plays a vital role in collagen production, but not directly. It supports the enzyme activity required for collagen synthesis and slows down collagen degradation,"" he adds. Debjani agrees. She adds that the health of the gut is directly linked to skin health and collagen production. Food (like amla, apple and beet) are rich in fibre, antioxidants, and essential vitamins (like vitamin C) promote better gut health. A healthy gut ensures much clearer and firmer skin.  So, are these the ""OG"" collagen boosters? Not quite. But they do support collagen production indirectly by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants that keep your existing collagen healthy.But If you’re picturing a bowl of carrot-beet-apple salad turning into collagen for your skin, hold that thought. Science is a little more complex. Sujit explains, ""To create collagen, your body needs amino acids like proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline, which are primarily found in animal sources like meat, fish, and eggs. For vegetarians, plant-based sources include soy products, mushrooms, cabbage, legumes, spinach, nuts, and seeds.""

 In short, you need more than just amla and beetroot to get that coveted collagen glow. ""Amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple support collagen health by providing antioxidants and Vitamin C, but they alone are not sufficient to create collagen,"" adds Sujit. The star of the collagen world is marine collagen, which comes from fish skin, bones, and scales. ""Marine collagen is considered a rich source of collagen, typically found in the form of collagen peptides or hydrolysed collagen,"" he adds.The side effects  While amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are nutrient powerhouses, experts suggest they’re not without potential side effects if consumed in excess. 
Gastric discomfort: Debjani says, if you’re not used to raw juices or high-fibre fruits, suddenly drinking a large glass of beetroot-carrot-apple juice could leave you feeling bloated. This happens because fibre needs time to adjust in your system.

Digestive sensitivity: People with sensitive digestion may experience bloating, gas, or even diarrhoea if they consume too much of these fruits or their juices. Dr Kapoor recommends starting with small portions and slowly increasing your intake.

Nutrient loss during juicing: According to Shanshanwal, juicing strips away fibre and, if heat is involved, it can also degrade Vitamin C, a key player in collagen production. So, while juice may be trendy, whole fruits and veggies are the better option for overall nutrition.
 Pro tip: If you’re juicing these ingredients, don’t throw away the pulp. Use it to make parathas, tikkis, or even smoothies to retain the fibre.Tips to produce collagen naturally in your body So, if amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple aren’t magic collagen factories, what is? Here's what experts have to say. 
Eat a collagen-friendly diet: Your body needs amino acids like proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline to produce collagen. These amino acids are abundant in animal products like meat, fish, and eggs. Vegetarians can rely on soy products, mushrooms, legumes, spinach, nuts, and seeds.
Amp up your antioxidants: Foods like amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are rich in antioxidants, which protect your existing collagen from damage caused by free radicals (but they can’t produce collagen in your body). Think of them as a shield for your skin’s natural protein.
Get your dose of Vitamin C: No, you don’t have to chug litres of orange juice. Incorporate Vitamin C-rich foods like amla, citrus fruits, guava, and bell peppers into your daily diet. Vitamin C activates the enzymes that support collagen production.
Stay hydrated: Your skin cells are made of water, so staying hydrated keeps your skin plump and supple, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Exercise regularly: Sweat it out! Regular physical activity increases blood circulation, which promotes oxygen and nutrient delivery to the skin, boosting collagen production.
Protect your skin from UV damage: UV rays from the sun break down collagen in your skin, so wearing sunscreen is essential to maintain that youthful glow.
Consider marine collagen: If you’re open to supplements, marine collagen is a strong contender. Derived from fish, it’s often found in hydrolysed form, making it easier for your body to absorb. But, as Dr Kapoor cautions, ""Do not take collagen supplements without consulting a doctor as it may not be suitable for everyone."" Supplements should be your last resort. 
Remember  The hype around amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple as ""OG collagen boosters"" is both right and wrong. These ingredients don’t directly increase collagen production, but they support it by providing essential antioxidants, Vitamin C, and other nutrients that keep existing collagen strong. ""One should understand that no single ingredient or type of juice can help replace the need to adopt a healthy lifestyle,"" Dr Kapoor concludes.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 13, 2024

But can they truly be a game-changer in treating cracked heels and dry feet?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-viral-silicone-moisturising-socks-treat-cracked-heels-and-dry-feet-in-winter-2649006-2024-12-12,"Winter brings a host of skincare challenges, and our feet often bear the brunt of the season's harshness. Dryness and cracked heels are common issues many of us face during the colder months.
While slathering on moisturiser becomes a priority, it’s not always enough—particularly for tackling severely dry feet and cracked heels. So, what to do? The internet, meanwhile, appears to have a solution – using silicone socks. Unlike regular fabric socks, silicone socks function like a snug silicone glove for your feet. To use them, simply wash your feet thoroughly, slip on the socks, and leave them on for 15–30 minutes (or overnight). These reusable socks are easily available on platforms such as Amazon, Meesho, and Nykaa.

 



Silicone socks on sale on Amazon India.
 There is also a single-use moisturising socks variant – also widely available across online platforms. Single-use moisturising socks are infused with nourishing ingredients like shea butter and essential oils. In contrast, reusable silicone socks require you to apply your own moisturiser, balm, or serum before use. Essentially, they are designed to act as an occlusive layer, trapping moisture and enhancing the efficacy of any hydrating products. Both gel and silicone socks are expected to create a spa-like environment, promoting better hydration and healing, ultimately resulting in smoother, softer feet. Sounds great, right? But are these moisturising socks as good as they claim to be? Dermatologists want you to know a few things!Gel socks – a good addition to your winter routine According to experts, moisturising socks can be beneficial for feet during winter, but they are not a magical cure for cracked and dry feet. “Moisturising and gel socks, infused with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, or essential oils, can indeed be a valuable addition to foot care routines, especially during winter. The occlusive nature of these socks helps lock in moisture, promoting better absorption of the active ingredients. They can improve skin hydration, reduce dryness, and even help with cracked heels if used consistently,” says Dr Pratiksha Jain, associate consultant cosmetologist, SPARSH Hospital, Infantry Road, Bengaluru. “Think of them as sheet masks for your feet. These serum-soaked socks promise 20-30 minutes to baby-soft soles. But here’s the tea: they’re more like a band-aid than a cure. The star ingredient, usually butylene glycol, gives temporary hydration but doesn’t fix deep cracks,” adds Dr Geetika Srivastava, dermatologist and founder of Influennz Skin and Hair Clinic, Delhi.

 



Moisturising socks, available for purchase on Nykaa.
 We all love our sheet masks for an instant glow or as a pre-makeup ritual, right? However, the results are often quick but not long-lasting. The same applies to moisturising socks. Alternatively, you can incorporate them into an elaborate at-home pedicure session to give your feet some extra pampering.What about silicone socks? Silicone socks wherein you use your own foot cream or balm before putting these on are also dermat-approved. They can be worn for 15-20 minutes or overnight as well. “These beauties work via occlusion therapy. You slather on your favourite foot cream and wear the socks overnight. This locks in moisture and helps the cream penetrate deeper. It’s like tucking your feet into a spa cocoon while you snooze. We dermatologists love this technique for stubborn dryness,” says Dr Srivastava. For best results, use them with thick, emollient-rich foot creams containing ingredients like urea or hyaluronic acid. The prolonged contact overnight helps in repairing cracked heels and very dry skin.

 However, a few precautions should certainly be taken before using these silicone socks. “Clean and dry silicone socks properly after and before every use to prevent bacterial or fungal growth,” says Dr Jain. It is also very important to clean and dry your feet before using these socks. Wearing them for too long or without proper foot hygiene may create a moist environment, which could promote fungal infections like athlete’s foot. If you have cuts, wounds, or severe skin conditions, consult a dermatologist before using these socks.A good foot care routine Having soft and supple feet even in winter does not essentially require these gel or silicone socks. All you need is a good foot care routine. You can follow the expert-approved tips mentioned below:

Hydrate regularly: Apply a thick, emollient-rich foot cream with ingredients like urea, glycerin, or shea butter twice daily.
Exfoliate weekly: Use a gentle scrub or pumice stone to remove dead skin cells and prevent calluses.
Soak your feet: A warm foot soak with Epsom salts once a week can help soften skin and relieve dryness.
Wear socks: Opt for breathable cotton or wool socks to keep feet warm and protected.
Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from within.
Protect from cold: Avoid walking barefoot on cold floors, and moisturise immediately after bathing or washing your feet to lock in moisture.
So, are these socks a game-changer? For a quick fix, yes! But for long-term care? Stick to the classic winter foot care tips.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Should you wash your feet before going to bed? Doctors have THE answer

b542d9bd-acb5-4169-a110-f1b14bc3d415,Does living together before marriage lower the chance of divorce?Thinking about marriage but unsure if you'll be able to adjust to living together? Why not try a live-in relationship first to see how things go before taking the next step?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/does-living-together-before-marriage-lower-the-chance-of-divorce-2648781-2024-12-12,"Being with someone you love is an amazing feeling, right? But where there's love, there are bound to be disagreements. And during those moments, we sometimes say things we've been holding back, like, ""Had I known this about you, I wouldn't have married you."" The truth is, being in a relationship is different from being married and sharing a life together. With the patience levels many have these days, it's no surprise divorce rates are on the rise. But if couples lived together before marriage, would it help the relationship? Could being in a live-in arrangement first be the secret to avoiding a split later? Let's find out from experts.Giving up easily Aarti Chawla, a Mumbai-based relationship psychotherapist and life coach, tells India Today that people are giving up on marriages for a variety of reasons. Fast-paced lifestyles, lack of patience, and low tolerance are key factors. Gone are the days when lovers waited a year to meet, convinced their parents, and wrote letters to woo someone. Now, it's easier to swipe left and right. If things don't work out, people are more willing to move on. Chawla adds that it's become easier to find another 'option' when things don't work out in a relationship. Financial stress is another contributor. With both partners often working and earning, financial issues can create tension. If couples can't meet the financial goals they had when they got married, it leads to disappointment and conflicts. Meanwhile, Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, feels modern society places a high value on personal growth and happiness, which can lead people to leave relationships that feel stagnant or unfulfilling. ""Divorce is no longer seen as a taboo or social stigma, making it an easier option for people,"" she adds. Many individuals have higher or unrealistic expectations of their partners, love, and relationships, often influenced by media portrayals that clash with reality. Ruuh also mentions that there’s a growing recognition that toxic or unbalanced relationships can affect mental well-being, prompting people to prioritise their mental health.Can live-in be a saviour? ""Research shows mixed results: some studies suggest that couples who live together before marriage report higher satisfaction, understanding, and stability, while others suggest it leads to 'cohabitation inertia,' meaning couples marry out of convenience rather than compatibility,"" says Ruchi Ruuh. For her, the answer is nuanced. While living together before marriage isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, it can help partners understand each other's habits, compatibility, and ability to navigate conflicts. Aarti Chawla agrees that a live-in arrangement helps couples understand each other more deeply.

 



A live-in setup helps you understand your partner better (Photo: Pexels/Cottonbro studio)
 ""It helps them see the nuances of living together—not just as roommates, but as companions for the next 40-50 years. Mental preparedness is key. For a couple to thrive, they need to consider all areas of life, including mental wavelength, physical compatibility, basic values, and financial goals. Live-in gives them time to truly understand each other at all levels,"" she says. Living together allows couples to learn each other’s routines and habits, reducing the chances of surprises down the line. In many cases, this makes divorce less likely, as the basics are in place.The pros of a live-in relationship Living together before marriage can serve as a compatibility check. It lets you observe your partner’s behaviour in real-life situations, including finances, responsibilities, stressful life events, and decision-making. Sharing space can also improve communication and conflict-resolution skills. ""You learn to see your partner as a whole person, beyond the idealised version,"" says Ruuh, adding, ""This is invaluable to understanding their true self."" Being in a live-in relationship also allows couples to break up without the fear of family or societal pressure, which can be a relief for those wanting to make the decision on their own terms.Don't skip the downsides However, a live-in relationship has its downsides. One major con is the lack of commitment. Often, after years of living together, couples part ways because there’s no formal commitment. This arrangement gives both partners the freedom to walk away without consequences. Additionally, live-in relationships can attract judgement, especially in conservative societies and cultures. Sometimes, living together can create a false sense of commitment, even when the relationship isn't solid. If the relationship ends, untangling shared living arrangements can be emotionally and financially taxing—often as painful as a divorce.

Thinking of giving it a try? If you’re considering a live-in arrangement before tying the knot, keep a few things in mind:
Clarify your goals: Discuss what the live-in arrangement means for both of you, including long-term plans like marriage. Clear goals keep things on track.
Split expenses: Agree on how to divide rent, groceries, and utilities.
Divide household tasks: Set expectations for chores and responsibilities to avoid resentment.
Check in regularly: Have regular conversations to ensure you're both satisfied with the arrangement.
Plan for the worst: Be clear about what will happen if the relationship doesn't work out, making any potential transition smoother.
Respect personal space: Living together doesn't mean you have to spend every moment together. Make sure you both have time for personal interests and friends.
Set financial expectations: List out your financial goals and expectations ahead of time.
Discuss non-negotiables: Be upfront about what’s acceptable and what isn’t in the relationship.
 If done thoughtfully, a live-in relationship can give you a better sense of whether marriage is the right step for you and your partner.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Move over grand gestures, micro-mance your way to loveTrending Reel

Here's how to deal with airplane ear If you feel a strange sensation in your ear as soon as your flight takes off, you might be dealing with airplane ear. While it can be uncomfortable, it can be relieved with some simple tricks.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/no-more-ear-ritation-heres-how-to-deal-with-airplane-ear-2648173-2024-12-11,"Does the excitement of your much-awaited trip suddenly fade the moment your flight takes off, thanks to a sharp, annoying pain in your ears? And worse, it doesn't just disappear mid-flight—it lingers even after you land. Even if you haven't experienced this yourself, chances are you know someone who can't stop complaining about the discomfort during their flight. This issue is real, and it can be more than just the constant popping of ears—airplane ear can be downright painful.So, why does it happen? ""Airplane ear, also called barotrauma, occurs when the pressure in the middle ear doesn't equalise with the air pressure outside. This may cause ear pain, uneasiness, and even lead to hearing impairment,"" Dr Girish Anand MS, consultant - ENT surgery, Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, tells India Today. The doctor explains that as an airplane takes off or lands, the air pressure in the cabin changes. He states, ""Normally, the Eustachian tube, a small canal connecting the middle ear to the back of the nasal cavity, equalises the pressure. However, sometimes, this tube can get blocked, preventing pressure equalisation."" To this, Dr Amitabh Malik, chief and HOD, department of ENT, Paras Health, Gurugram, adds that factors like sinus congestion, colds, or allergies can also affect the function of the Eustachian tube, making it more difficult for the ear to adjust to changes in pressure.It's quite common As per Dr Malik, airplane ear is a common phenomenon, particularly during flights. ""Almost everyone experiences some level of ear discomfort when flying, but some are more susceptible. People with sinus issues, colds, nasal congestion, or allergies are at higher risk because these conditions can interfere with the Eustachian tube's function,"" the doctor says. Additionally, infants and young children are more likely to struggle with airplane ear because their Eustachian tubes are smaller and may not work as effectively. Those with a history of ear infections or certain anatomical issues may also experience more severe symptoms.

 



You're not alone in dealing with airplane ear (Photo: Getty Images)
Know the symptoms Dr Manjunath MK, senior consultant - ENT surgeon, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, mentions that the most common symptom of airplane ear is a feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear. One may also experience ringing in the ears or temporary hearing loss. In more severe cases, it can lead to ear pain, and rarely, there may be a perforation of the eardrum.Save your ears
To help prevent or relieve the discomfort of airplane ear, try yawning or swallowing frequently, as this helps open the Eustachian tubes and equalise pressure.
Chewing gum or sucking on candy can encourage swallowing, which also balances pressure in the ear.
If you're dealing with sinus congestion or a cold, using a decongestant or nasal spray before your flight may reduce the risk of discomfort.
Valsalva maneuver, gently blowing your nose with your mouth closed, can also help open the Eustachian tubes.
It's best to avoid flying when you're sick, especially if you have a cold, allergies, or sinus infections, and if possible, delay your trip until you're symptom-free.
During the flight, try not to sleep during take-off or landing, as staying alert can help you manage pressure changes.
Keep chewing gum or munching sugar candies to encourage swallowing. You can also gently pop your ears by blowing your nose while pinching your nostrils closed.
When to seek professional help? According to the experts, in most cases, airplane ear resolves on its own after the flight without the need for medical treatment. However, if the symptoms persist, worsen, or cause significant discomfort, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional. If there is an infection or a ruptured eardrum, medical treatment such as antibiotics, pain relief, or ear drops may be required. In extreme cases, a doctor may recommend a procedure to help equalise the pressure in the ear.

 



Don't shy away from seeking help (Photo: Getty Images)
Now, before you check-in... You can easily avoid airplane ear by keeping a few simple tips in mind. Stay well-hydrated throughout your flight and steer clear of alcohol and caffeine. A helpful trick is sipping hot water during the journey to soothe your ears. And don’t forget to pack some chewing gum in your carry-on, it’s a handy way to help manage pressure changes.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 11, 2024ALSO READ |  Unpacking your bags after a vacation is tough.

Experts weigh inSeasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of 'sadness' more prevalent in specific seasons, typically autumn and winter.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/is-winter-depression-real-experts-weigh-in-2648155-2024-12-11,"You are not alone if the gloomy, cold weather makes you feel extra lazy. In fact, even in India, where winter often marks the season of festivities and weddings, many of us also feel our mental well-being taking a hit. As this season approaches, our couch becomes our best friend, and leaving it - or even our bed - starts to feel like a monumental task. More often than not, all we want to do is lie around with our thoughts. Urban slang even has a name for it - seasonal depression - which hits us as sharply as the cold breeze that accompanies winter. But is “wintertime sadness”, aka ""winter depression"", actually real? Or is it just the weather messing with us? A quick scroll through Reddit or Quora reveals that plenty of people are asking the same thing — why does the mood shift as the sun sets or the seasons change?

 



As sunlight decreases during the short dark days of winter, many individuals struggle with seasonal affective disorder. Photo: Getty Imags
Is mental health related to season change? Jasreen Birgi, counselling psychologist at Lissun, a digital mental health platform Delhi NCR, explains that winters in India are months of several festivities, but they are also filled with gloom and melancholy due to the chilling winds and shorter days.  She highlights that Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of sadness more prevalent in specific seasons, typically autumn and winter. It’s commonly referred to as ""winter depression,"" she says.   Dr Shilpi Saraswat, clinical psychologist at Sakra World Hospital, Bengaluru, agrees and tells India Today that, “SAD, is a recognised mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide.”  She adds that, like most depressive disorders, it ""affects mood, energy levels, sleep patterns, and appetite,"" and its symptoms include persistent feelings of sadness, low energy, and changes in sleep and eating habits.

 



A query on Quora. Photo: Quora
 Dr Arvind Otta, senior psychologist and mental health activist, further points out that it ""follows a seasonal pattern and typically worsens during autumn and winter months when daylight hours are shorter.”  He explains that ""the biological basis of SAD involves disruptions to circadian rhythms and changes in neurotransmitter levels, especially serotonin and melatonin.”Does science also agree? Experts unanimously agree that the link between weather and mood is undeniable. Birgi explains that reduced exposure to sunlight causes changes in brain chemistry, and this reduction ""triggers an increase in anxiety symptoms throughout the winter.”  According to Birgi, the decrease in sunlight affects our circadian rhythm and, in turn, impacts our sleep-wake cycles, increasing feelings of sluggishness and low energy.  “People also avoid going outside due to the cold weather, further limiting their exposure to natural light and physical activity, both of which are vital for mental health,” she says.

— NHS London (@NHSEnglandLDN) December 9, 2024 Dr Otta points to the role of sunlight in regulating serotonin levels, stating that people with SAD have increased serotonin transporter proteins during winter, leading to lower serotonin availability. He also notes the influence of atmospheric pressure changes, stating that gloomy weather characterised by overcast skies is associated with low serotonin levels, leading to feelings of depression or low mood. However, note that there aren't enough studies done on this area, so more studies are required to understand the illness better. How to deal with it? If the cold weather’s got you feeling blue, here’s what experts have to say on how to manage it. Increase exposure to natural light Mehezabin Dordi, a clinical psychologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, recommends spending time outside during daylight hours, even if it’s cloudy. She says natural light exposure can improve symptoms.   You can also keep curtains and blinds open to let in as much natural light as possible. Rearrange furniture to sit near windows.advertisementStay physically active
Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, increases serotonin levels, which help regulate mood.
If the weather permits, outdoor exercise combines physical activity with exposure to sunlight.
Maintain a healthy routine
Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Avoid oversleeping, as it can worsen symptoms.
Dr Otta suggests that healthy eating not only makes for a healthy weight but also balanced moods. “Omega-3 fatty acids, fruits and vegetables are, to some extent, good for the brain and quite very important with respect to one’s overall well-being. Prepare a menu for the winter so as not to get caught up by events,” he says. 
Be socially active 
Spend time with family and friends to avoid isolation, which can worsen depression. Experts like Dr Otta call it “talk therapy”.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT and other counselling therapies can support one in times of despair and provide strategies for coping. 
“Through this, you can learn to identify their negative thought patterns and ways to change the thinking for healthy counterparts, which seems very appropriate in cases of seasonal depression,” he says. 
Remember, sometimes, just discussing your feelings can make a big difference.
Meditate
Mindfulness practices like meditation can help you stay present and reduce feelings of hopelessness.
Try aromatherapy (avoid scented candles, though) with certain essential oils, like citrus and lavender, which may have mood-boosting effects.
However, if symptoms persist or significantly affect daily life, it’s important to seek help from a mental health professional.

It is believed that urinating after sex is not merely a good hygiene practice but also keeps issues like UTI (urinary tract infection) and other infections away, especially among women.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-peeing-after-sex-really-prevent-uti-2647827-2024-12-10,"When Tanya, a 30-year-old writer from Delhi, got married, her mother shared a vital sexual wellness tip: always remember to pee after sex. “It will keep most infections away,” she told her. Sexual health is an essential part of overall well-being, and it comes with the responsibility of maintaining good hygiene to prevent infections. Among the many tips often recommended, one of the simplest (and most popular) is urinating after sexual intercourse. It is believed that doing so is not merely a good hygiene practice but also keeps issues like UTI (urinary tract infection) and other infections away – especially among women. UTIs are a common concern for sexually active women. Why? Well, Dr Vaishali Joshi, senior obstetrician and gynaecologist at Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, points out, ""Women are more prone to UTIs than men due to the proximity of their urinary and genital systems."" “After first intercourse, some women may develop a UTI. This is not uncommon and can occur due to bacteria entering the urinary tract during sexual activity. Common symptoms include burning during urination, frequent urination, or pain in the lower abdomen,” adds Dr Joshi.

But how important is this habit of peeing after intercourse, and does it truly help in preventing infections? We asked experts.Does peeing after sex matter?Dr Geeta Shroff, director of NuBella Centre for Women’s Health, emphasises that urination after intercourse is vital. But how important is this habit of peeing after intercourse, and does it truly help in preventing infections? We asked experts.Does peeing after sex matter? Dr Geeta Shroff, director of NuBella Centre for Women’s Health, emphasises that urination after intercourse is vital. “Peeing after sex can help prevent a urinary tract infection or even other infections, especially in females. During sexual intercourse, bacteria from the genital or anal areas can find their way into the urethra. Urinating after sexual intercourse ensures that these bacteria are expelled before they cause an infection,” Dr Shroff adds. Dr Kanika Jain, vice president of the Association of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Delhi (AOGD), professor and senior consultant, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, further explains, ""Sexual activity can introduce bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), into the urethra. Peeing afterward flushes these out before they ascend to the bladder, lowering the risk of infection."" It is recommended to urinate within 15–30 minutes of intercourse to flush out bacteria. “The first step is to drink plenty of water to help flush out the infection. If symptoms persist, antibiotics may be required to clear it. Prompt treatment is essential, as untreated UTIs can worsen, but they are generally not serious if addressed in time,” adds Dr Joshi.

 



Experts say peeing after sex does not ensure 100 per cent prevention but a reduced risk of getting a UTI. (Photo: Getty)
 Experts, however, add that peeing after sex does not ensure 100 per cent protection but certainly reduces the chances of getting a UTI. While not a foolproof method, it is an effective and simple precautionary measure for urinary health. Hydration also plays a key role here. “Drink enough water to enable you to urinate after sex,” says Dr Shroff. It is important to note while urinating after intercourse can help prevent a urinary infection, it plays no role in preventing STIs or vaginal infection. “Peeing specifically helps prevent UTIs but has no significant impact on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or vaginal infections,” says Dr Jain.Good hygiene tips to follow after intercourse Practising good post-sex hygiene can significantly reduce the risk of UTIs and other infections. It is important to use protection, avoid douching, and maintain overall genital and perineal hygiene. You may feel exhausted or not want to step out of bed and sleep right away, but getting up to pee, changing clothes, and gently cleansing your genitals can go a long way in keeping infections at bay. Here are some more expert-recommended tips:
advertisementGentle cleansing: Dr Shroff advises washing the genital area with warm water. Avoid harsh or scented soaps, which can disrupt the natural pH balance.
Change clothes: Avoid wearing tight clothes or non-breathable fabrics post-sex. Tight or damp clothing can encourage bacterial growth. Opt for loose-fitting, breathable cotton underwear to keep the area dry and fresh.
Wash your hands: Dr Joshi stresses the importance of clean hands before and after intercourse to prevent the transfer of germs.
Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water ensures regular urination, naturally flushing bacteria from the urinary tract.
Practise safe sex: Using condoms helps prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Monitor symptoms: If you notice signs of irritation, pain, or unusual discharge, seek a doctor. ""Ignoring symptoms can worsen infections, requiring more intensive treatment,"" warns Dr Joshi.
Wear breathable underwear: Choose cotton fabrics to prevent moisture build-up, which can encourage bacterial growth.
Clean sex toys: The sex toy culture is rising in India, with these products being just a BlinkIt away. While they are sure to make things exciting for you in the bedroom, cleaning them properly is essential to keep infections at bay.

2d018530-6029-4bf2-aaab-d30c10c07031,"How long can you wear makeup without risking skin damage?Who doesn't love showing off flawless skin? While makeup can definitely help you achieve that perfect look, how long should you actually keep these products on?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/how-long-can-you-wear-makeup-without-risking-skin-damage-2647586-2024-12-10,"You might be the 'just a little blush, and I'm good to go' type, or perhaps you're all about that full-glam look—but one thing is for sure: makeup is a crucial part of our daily routine. And now, with men also embracing cosmetics to enhance their appearance, makeup has become even more universal. But here's the thing: as important as applying makeup is, removing it properly is even more crucial. We all know the cardinal rule—never go to bed with makeup on—but do you know how long you can actually wear makeup before it starts taking a toll on your skin?Bidding adieu is crucial Removing makeup well is important to allow your skin to breathe, repair, and regenerate. Dr Vidushi Jain, dermatologist and medical head at Dermalinks, NCR, tells India Today that if makeup is not removed properly, it clogs pores, disrupts the skin's natural barrier, and increases the risk of breakouts and premature ageing. To this, Dr Shifa Yadav, consultant - dermatology and cosmetology at Artemis Hospitals, Gurugram, adds that makeup residue can irritate the skin, causing redness, dryness, and other skin problems. Not only that, but long-term exposure to makeup residue can lead to skin discolouration and hyperpigmentation. It can also hinder the absorption of skincare products, as clean skin absorbs them more effectively, maximising their benefits.For how long should you wear makeup? According to Dr Jain, ideally, makeup should only be used for 8-12 hours at most. She mentions that wearing makeup for long periods can cause the products to settle into the skin and lead to issues, especially if they are non-comedogenic. On the other hand, Dr Yadav states that there's no definitive answer, as it depends on various factors like skin type, product quality, and individual sensitivity. ""However, it's generally recommended to limit makeup wear to a maximum of 10-12 hours per day,"" she adds. As per Dr Yadav, wearing makeup for too long can have the same impact on the skin as leaving residue—clogging pores, skin irritation, premature ageing, and drying out the skin. While makeup creates a protective layer on the skin, it can also disrupt its natural oil balance.

 Meanwhile, Dr Shireen Furtado, senior consultant - medical and cosmetic dermatology at Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, states that it is advisable to limit the application of makeup to a period that allows the skin to breathe and recover. It is often recommended that one should pay attention to their skin's response to prolonged makeup wear. Dr Furtado further tells us that wearing makeup can also have a positive impact. ""It can enhance the appearance of the skin by providing coverage for imperfections, evening out skin tone, and adding a healthy glow. Many formulations contain beneficial ingredients that can hydrate and protect the skin, contributing to a more polished look,"" she says. However, prolonged wear of products that contain harmful chemicals can compromise skin health.Reversing skin troubles To reverse the skin issues caused by wearing makeup for too long, you must detox your skin with a skincare routine that includes double cleansing, exfoliation, hydration, and nourishing serums that contain antioxidants, niacinamide, or hyaluronic acid for healing and rebalancing the skin. Focusing on makeup removal is very important. Make sure to follow a thorough cleansing routine so that no residue is left behind. Apart from this, you also need to focus on what you put in your body, as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and water can help improve skin health. However, if you have severe skin issues, consult a dermatologist for professional advice.

 



Make sure to thoroughly clean your skin after wearing makeup for an extended period (Photo: Getty Images)
Before long hours of makeup wear... Those who apply makeup for extended periods should make certain changes to their skincare regimen to maintain skin health and prevent potential damage. Remember to always use products that are non-comedogenic and do not strip the skin of its natural oils. Additionally, the inclusion of a broad-spectrum sunscreen is crucial, as it protects the skin from harmful UV rays, especially when makeup is worn throughout the day. The way you prep your skin before putting on makeup makes a big difference. Taking a break is vital. Try to minimise makeup wear, especially on days when you're not going out. Lastly, don't forget to include exfoliation and masking once a week.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 10, 2024ALSO READ |  Essential oils are Shraddha Kapoor's beauty secret.

US tech millionaire Bryan Johnson thinks so.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-you-live-forever-like-bryan-johnson-wants-to-2647404-2024-12-10,"Who doesn’t want to live forever? The idea of living a long, healthy life appeals to almost everyone. The quest for immortality has fascinated humans for centuries, serving as a central theme in numerous Bollywood and Hollywood films. But one man is taking this dream seriously—Bryan Johnson, a millionaire from the US, is actively trying to reverse his biological age and achieve what many fictional characters have only dreamed of: living forever. In fact, he believes it’s possible. Bryan even shares his daily routine on his website, offering people the chance to “subscribe” to his “Blueprint” if they want to follow in his footsteps. But is it really possible to extend your lifespan or, better yet, live forever? What do experts have to say about Bryan's lifestyle? And could you apply his routine to your own life? Before diving into these questions, let’s explore exactly what Bryan Johnson is doing in his pursuit of immortality. Bryan Johnson’s blueprint In 2013, after selling his company to eBay’s PayPal for $800 million, Bryan had plenty of options on how to spend his fortune. He could have travelled the world, bought a mansion, and lived a life of luxury. But instead, he decided to dedicate his life to chasing immortality — a quest that has earned him significant attention, especially after making headlines with his ""Project Blueprint"", a protocol-based lifestyle designed to help people live longer. The Blueprint, which is available for free, outlines Bryan's daily routine and how it has allegedly helped him achieve the biological age of an 18-year-old. For context, biological age refers to how old your cells are, and some experts consider it a more accurate measure of ageing than chronological age.

Recently, Bryan visited India to promote his “Blueprint”, and since it’s starting to create a buzz, we decided to decode his routine.A day in the life of BryanBryan starts his day at 4:30 am, and, by 11:30 am, he’s done with dinner. His daily routine includes light therapy, and taking 111 supplements, including the widely discussed 'Rapamycin' (he paused taking it after a few years). Good sleep and daily workouts are also a few key aspects of Bryan’s lifestyle. He consumes precisely 1,977 calories a day and eats 70 pounds of vegetables per month. His breakfast consists of a standard mix of broccoli, cauliflower, black lentils, mushrooms, garlic, and ginger. His next meal is ""nutty pudding"" with nuts and berries, and his final meal includes vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, 15 grams of 100% dark chocolate, and 30 millilitres of extra virgin olive oil.He also allows himself 'three' ounces of wine to end his day.Managing stress is vital for him, and he claims it plays a key role in living longer.PS: Although Bryan's Blueprint is technically free to access, he also sells products like protein powder and (soon-to-be-released) sunscreen under the guise of promoting health and longevity.What has Bryan achieved so far?advertisementBryan claims his lifestyle has helped him reverse his biological age by over 5 years, and his blood transfusion has helped his father do the same.

His website further claims that his lifestyle has placed him in the top 1% of 46-year-olds and, in some markers, even in the top 1% of 18-year-olds.But can you escape death with his routine?India Today spoke to various experts to evaluate Bryan’s routine. Here's what they had to say about its key components. 1. Working outBryan prioritises workouts, recommending three days of strength training and three days of cardio each week. Dr Aijaaz Ashai, a physiotherapist and celebrity fitness expert, supports this, stating that exercise can delay age-related diseases, preserve mobility, and enhance mental sharpness.On a cellular level, regular exercise helps maintain the length of telomeres—protective caps on DNA—which slow down the ageing process. ""While no one lives forever, a regular exercise routine can certainly add to your lifespan and improve the quality of your remaining years,” says Dr Ashai.2. Mental healthadvertisementAccording to Bryan’s Blueprint, if you buy his products — especially his “Best-selling longevity kit” with 70+ health actives — you’ll be able to manage daily challenges “with ease as stress-reducing ingredients promote calm and balanced emotions”.While managing stress is undoubtedly a priority for Bryan, can it help you live forever? According to mental health expert Shreya Kaul, the answer is a firm no.“Our bodies naturally start to deteriorate after a certain point. Our cells, organs, and genetics all begin to disintegrate. No living being is truly immortal,” she says.However, she does agree that managing stress is essential for leading a better, healthier life. She highlights that mental and physical health are deeply connected, with better mental health leading to improved immunity, energy, and agility.3. Clean diet and supplementsOne of the biggest pillars of Bryan’s Blueprint is his ultra-clean diet and daily consumption of 111 supplements. While research does show that healthy eating can reduce the risk of premature death by nearly 20%, it’s unlikely to guarantee immortality.Dr Nivedita Pandey, a senior gastroenterologist and director of Dr Good Deed Clinic, Patna, agrees. She highlights that free radicals (unstable molecules generated during digestion) damage our organs, leading to ageing. Eating natural, whole foods can help reduce free radicals, promoting longer and healthier lives.

Targeted supplements can support immunity, brain function, and overall health.However, Kumaar Bagrodia, a neuroscientist from Mumbai and founder of various companies like HALE, NeuroLeap, Arkni and PhotoBioLife, tells us, not all supplements have enough scientific evidence as to their benefits. He notes that while calcium, iron, Vitamin D, folic acid, and omega-3 have strong evidence supporting their benefits, supplements alone can never replace a balanced diet.4. Sleep, sleep, sleepBryan treats sleep as a non-negotiable part of his day. Experts agree. Kumaar calls it the ""golden hour"" for mental health, as it helps with memory consolidation, emotional processing, and tissue repair.

The alarm rings, but you're so cosy under your layers of blankets that the snooze button is just too tempting. You give in and drift back into sweet sleep, only to be awakened by the alarm again a few minutes later. You may hit snooze once more, but eventually, you know it's time to muster the courage to face the bone-chilling cold. As you prepare for the day, you begin the usual routine - brushing your teeth, enjoying a hot shower, and finally gearing up to pick your OOTD. You want something that keeps you warm while also checking the style box. Sounds like a daily sartorial conundrum? You're not alone. But here's the good news—we have a suggestion: befriend a few turtlenecks.

 Warm and cosy, turtlenecks are a basic winter staple, but when styled well, they can be the secret to a fabulous winter wardrobe. On mornings when you're running late and don't want to spend hours deciding what to wear, turtlenecks come in handy. Pair one with a pair of jeans, and you're good to go! If it’s too cold, layer up with a faux-leather jacket or an overcoat, and you’re all set. For party nights when you want to slay without freezing, pair your turtleneck with a leather skirt and boots. It’s as simple as that! Stylists highly recommend including turtlenecks, even when building a minimalist winter capsule wardrobe. Think of it as the white T-shirt of your summer wardrobe. From beach outings to workdays and brunch dates, your favourite white T-shirt works for almost any occasion, right? A turtleneck serves the same purpose during winter. And let’s not forget how it keeps your neck warm, protecting it from the winter chill. Its versatility is its biggest strength! It goes well with just about anything. You can wear it on its own or layer it with an open jacket or a cosy cardigan. No surprises here that celebrity winter looks are incomplete without a few iconic turtleneck moments every year!
This winter, it has already begun! Priyanka Chopra recently flaunted an ivory turtleneck that she teamed with matching trousers and a black jacket with faux fur accents. So luxe!

Whenever the temperatures dip in Mumbai, she turns to her trusted turtlenecks – especially for her airport looks.

Turn to vibrant or multi-coloured turtlenecks to make winter fashion look edgy.
Pair an oversized turtleneck with your favourite jeans and sneakers for a relaxed look.
Layer a neutral-coloured turtleneck under a tailored blazer or a coat to ace the ‘office chic’ vibe.
A black or metallic turtleneck paired with a leather skirt and knee-high boots is the ultimate party combo.
To keep it sporty and athleisure, style a loose turtleneck with tights and chunky sneakers.

Does this sound like your story? Then keep reading. You’ve probably heard people say, “It was so much fun when I was single, but things have changed now that I’m married and have kids.”  For many, once a relationship deepens or a family grows, self-care quietly takes a backseat. Prioritising others' needs and happiness often becomes the default - even if it means sacrificing something that once brought you immense joy. Solo travel is often one of the first casualties. Society doesn’t make it any easier. The moment you mention travelling alone post-marriage or post-kids, the raised eyebrows and unsolicited comments begin. “How can you enjoy yourself alone?” or “Won’t you feel guilty leaving your kids behind?” These are just a couple of the judgemental remarks people endure. But pause for a moment and think: Are you holding yourself back because of societal expectations or fear of how your family might cope without you? If so, it’s time you needed some changes. Suppressing your passion - especially something as fulfilling as solo travel - does no good. Neglecting what you love only takes a toll on your mental well-being, and in the long run, this can affect your relationships too.
 


Why is it important to travel solo?An Indian household typical when a girl just randomly asks her parents – can I visit Goa with my college friends, please? Or let’s say she asks – I am going on a solo trip to Himachal Pradesh. Could you lend me some money? The cliché response would be – shaadi ke baad jahaan jana hai jao, not before!And then, after some years, when that girl finally gets married – she has a so-called “permanent travelling partner” for life. So, when is it her time to go and explore the world solo? More than men, it’s women who often have to give up on their aspirations and hobbies. However, irrespective of your relationship status, gender, or profession, everyone should travel solo, and experts highly recommend it.Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai, tells India Today, that travelling solo allows people to explore their preferences, dislikes, goals, and visions for life. It cultivates a sense of autonomy and freedom that is crucial for personal growth.“In the Indian context, where societal norms often emphasise the collective ‘we’ system, marriage or relationships are frequently associated with a sense of responsibility. A solo trip, therefore, becomes a form of self-care, helping you nurture your individuality while still existing as a partner to someone else,” she adds.

Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, says, that in relationships, solo travelling helps maintain a sense of self that is often crucial for a healthy dynamic.“Healthy relationships are built on a concept called differentiation, which simply means that you celebrate being individuals while coming together to be a couple. With solo travel, people can experience and understand their personalities better,” she notes.Boosting mental healthSolo travel can work wonders for mental health.

d715ce35-6565-4b65-80bb-879e96f6fbe9,Pilates vs weight training: Which one helps you lose weight faster?Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century during World War I as a method to rehabilitate injured soldiers and dancers. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/pilates-vs-weight-training-which-one-helps-you-lose-weight-faster-2646112-2024-12-07,"If there’s one thing Bollywood icons like Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, and Janhvi Kapoor all have in common in their fitness routines, it isn’t a magical elixir for their youth and glamour - it’s their dedication to Pilates. In the past few years, Pilates has become quite the buzzword in the fitness industry. Though in India, it is gaining prominence now, Bollywood celebs have been obsessed with pilates for some time now.  But if you’re not aware, let us give you a crash course. What exactly is Pilates? Pilates is a form of low-impact exercise that focusses on strengthening muscles and improving flexibility, balance, and posture.  “The practice emphasises controlled movements, core strength, and proper alignment,” says Dr Vipul Lunawat, a fitness expert and the founder-director of the Institute of Sports Science and Technology of Pune.

 Dr Lunawat says that there are a few core principles of Pilates, like:
1. Concentration: Mindful engagement with each movement.
2. Control: Precision and mastery of your body’s movements.
3. Centering: Focus on your core, often referred to as the ""powerhouse"".
4. Flow: Smooth, continuous movements.
5. Precision: Attention to detail in form and technique.
6. Breathing: Proper breath control to enhance movement and relaxation.From World War I to celeb favorite Meenal Pathak, tells India Today that Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century during World War I as a method to rehabilitate injured soldiers and dancers.

 “Today, it has become particularly relevant because of our sedentary lifestyles, poor posture, and long sitting hours, which often lead to issues like wrist pain, shoulder pain, and joint discomfort,” says Meenal.  According to her, Pilates is highly effective (for both men and women) for addressing these problems as it, focuses on improving mobility and flexibility, alongside other benefits. It works wonders for posture, core strength, and spinal health. Pilates is all about strengthening, lengthening, and protecting your spine, which makes it an excellent choice. Now, there are two ways of doing Pilates: mat Pilates (which is done with very minimal or no equipment) and the more famous and preferred one by celebs is the other type - which uses a machine called reformer.

 This reformer Pilates has not only made quite a buzz on social media, as they are preferred by not only Bollywood celebs but by also influencers.  According to Meenal, “Mat Pilates is a fantastic way to start. It allows you to build strength and learn proper alignment without any tools. Small props like resistance bands can enhance the workout, but they’re not essential.” For those who want more variety, reformer Pilates uses machines with springs and straps to add resistance. Abhishek Bhadauria, Head Coach at MultiFit, notes, “The essence of Pilates lies in core engagement, and that can be achieved with or without equipment.”Weight training and Pilates: which can help you lose weight faster? Now, the question of the hour is, if you are trying to lose weight, which one can help to reach the goal faster, and which one should you prefer? We spoke to experts, and let’s have a look at both of them in depth.   1. Calorie burn
advertisementWeight training: A single high-intensity session burns more calories than Pilates and induces the afterburn effect (EPOC), where the body continues to burn calories post-workout.
Pilates: While it generally burns fewer calories, advanced Pilates sessions incorporating faster transitions or reformer machines can boost calorie expenditure.
2. Muscle building and metabolism
Weight training: Builds lean muscle, increasing resting metabolic rate (RMR) for long-term calorie burn.
Pilates: Tones muscles and enhances functional strength, but its impact on RMR is less significant.
Abhishek says, “Pilates excels in improving flexibility, balance, and core strength, making it an excellent choice for those seeking low-impact exercise or rehabilitation. Weight training, on the other hand, is ideal for building muscle mass and boosting metabolism. Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual goals and preferences.”3. Functional benefits
Pilates: Excels in flexibility, balance, and posture, reducing injury risk. As Dr Lunawat, explains, “Pilates is crucial for mobility and flexibility, which are often overlooked in traditional strength training but are vital for long-term health and injury prevention.”
Weight training: Improves bone density and overall strength, which is essential for physical resilience and metabolism.
Finally, as Jashan Bhumkar, fitness enthusiast, notes, “Both have their merits, but if Pilates motivates you to stay active, it’s just as effective in the long term.”advertisementWhich is faster for weight loss?In simple terms, weight training has the edge for rapid weight loss, largely due to its calorie-burning potential and metabolic benefits. A 2019 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that resistance training significantly improves body composition by reducing fat while preserving lean muscle.Dr Lunawat adds, “A combination of weight training and a calorie-controlled diet is ideal for quicker results. But Pilates can play a complementary role, improving mobility and aiding recovery.”Meenal says, “If your goal is to lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit. Pilates tones and builds functional strength, but adding weight training will help preserve muscle mass.”Why not combine the two?For maximum benefits, a balanced routine combining Pilates and weight training is ideal.

Dr Lunawat advises, “Strength training is crucial for athletes, but ensuring optimal flexibility and mobility is equally important to enhance performance and prevent injuries.”
For example, your weekly routine could include:
advertisement3 sessions of weight training to build muscle and boost metabolism.
2 sessions of Pilates for recovery, flexibility, and functional strength.
Dr Aijaaz Asshai, a physiotherapist and fitness expert, says, one of the most vital things to know about the losing of weight is there's no shortcut for sustaining that result. The body doesn't take it lying down, and the harmful effects of quick fixes harm it in the long term. A systematic, step-by-step approach is necessary for sustainable and healthy weight loss.The final wordChoosing between Pilates and weight training depends on your fitness goals:
For rapid weight loss and muscle gain, weight training is more effective.
For improved posture, flexibility, and a balanced body, Pilates is invaluable.
However, the ultimate solution lies in integration. As Dr Lunawat says, “Fitness is not about choosing one over the other. It’s about finding the balance that works best for you. Both Pilates and weight training have unique benefits, and together they can create a complete fitness regime.”So, whether you’re perfecting your deadlift or nailing a roll-up, remember: consistency and enjoyment are the cornerstones of a sustainable fitness journey!Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 7, 2024Trending Reel

On December 5, the Pantone Color Institute declared Mocha Mousse—a warm, rich brown hue, instantly reminiscent of chocolate, coffee, or a delectable dessert—as the reigning colour for 2025. The colour is an extension of quiet luxury, the global zeitgeist trend that has soared higher and higher over the past three years since its inception. The shade also aligns with game-changing celebrity brands like Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS and Hailey Bieber’s Rhode. Sophisticated elegance is the common theme that shines through.

 With its sophisticated and earthy elegance, Mocha Mousse can stand alone but also serves as a versatile base for both minimalist and richly detailed designs. For the Indian palette, it’s a perfect match! Whether in your wardrobe, home interiors, or makeup, Mocha Mousse effortlessly adds a luxe twist to your style.Mocha Mousse in your fashion game Versatility is Mocha Mousse’s strongest suit. It can easily make its way into your wedding trousseau, a beach holiday, or even a boardroom meeting. Indian celebrities have already rocked this unconventional hue in a plethora of silhouettes. Deepika Padukone styled a mousse-coloured sweater vest over an oversized shirt and brown-hued trousers. Actress Tara Sutaria looked fabulous in an all-brown blazer set with an added retro charm of a scarf. Sultry bodycon dresses have been favourites, especially for holidays, among divas like Janhvi Kapoor, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Ananya Panday.

Mocha Mousse is both a summer and a winter colour and can be styled throughout the year. Mocha Mousse is both a summer and a winter colour and can be styled throughout the year. “In winter, it pairs beautifully with cashmere and richer tones like rust and deep browns for a cozy, luxurious feel. In warmer months, it looks stunning with lighter pieces—think a mocha skirt with a crisp white shirt or a satin blouse with tailored trousers,” says Delhi-based designer Shasha Gaba. “In Indian fashion, 'Mocha Mousse' has incredible potential. It can elevate contemporary bridal looks, work beautifully with intricate embroidery, or even enhance fusion wear. It’s a versatile shade that blends tradition and modernity effortlessly,” says fashion designer Varun Chakkilam.

 Be it a simplistic satin saree worn by Shilpa Shetty or an embellished creation that Kiara Advani once rocked, there is no dearth of inspiration. While a dazzling brown lehenga swathed in sequins can be the best bet for a sangeet night, you can also take a Mocha Mousse-coloured lehenga to the mandap. Chakkilam suggests pairing it with jewel tones to create a dramatic contrast using statement accessories.

 



Khushi Kapoor, Kiara Advani and Sonam Kapoor in Mocha Mousse-hued outfits.
 Here are a few bonus tips from Kkhushi Sahaii, founder of label Kay-Kay, to style Mocha Mousse this winter:
For a chic and cosy vibe, pair it with tonal accents—something like a buttery suede jacket layered over a soft cashmere sweater and leather boots.
Try layering—a chunky knit over a sheer silk skirt or leather trousers would create a beautiful contrast of structure and softness.
If you’re aiming for something timeless, go monochromatic. A head-to-toe Mocha Mousse ensemble, perhaps in a mix of linen, chiffon, or velvet, looks incredibly polished and elegant.
Mocha Mousse in your makeup Beauty experts say Mocha Mousse is a fabulous colour for Indian skin tones, especially for eye makeup. Again, the versatility shines with how it complements both Indian and Western fashion sensibilities. “You can tone it up and down for the eye glam – it will work wonderfully with hues like darker shades of brown, sunset orange, and copper gold,” says Bindya Talluri, beauty content creator and founder of Bindt Beauty.

 While nude lips are a classic choice for many, Mocha Mousse-colored lipstick may not be the best fit for everyone. ""Due to its cooler undertones, Mocha Mousse might not complement darker complexions as a lipstick,"" says Bindya. Othrwise, do try ombre lips using this hue. “To use Mocha Mousse in makeup, start by applying it as a base eyeshadow for a warm, neutral look. For a more defined eye, layer it with deeper browns or golds to create dimension and a smoldering effect. This colour also works great for soft, winged eyeliner or to add subtle depth to your lower lash line,” suggests Sabhyata Bali, Founder and CEO of Zygos Beauty.Home decor Warm, cozy, and luxurious, Mocha Mousse exudes a blend of vibes that you would want your home to emit. It is already a staple in many Indian homes, especially those with a minimalist aesthetic. “For us Indians, it’s the colour of mitti, so it naturally evokes a sense of warmth and comfort,” says Nyishi Parekh, director of Architecture & Hospitality, Splendour Living.

 “While Mocha Mousse is commonly used in furniture upholstery, it can also be incorporated into your home through wallpaper or accent walls. Even in smaller homes, it can work wonders as an accent color. Add warmth with compact furniture or accessories like throw pillows, blankets, and rugs. This thoughtful approach will bring coziness to your space without overwhelming it,” suggests Paveela Bali, CEO and founder of Studio by Paveela.

 Vases, mugs, plant holders, and satin silk pillows in this shade would make for calm and cozy additions. As for lighting to complement the Mocha Mousse theme, soft, warm light is suggested.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 6, 2024
