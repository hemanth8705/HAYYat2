Psychologists have an innovative solution to help you stick to your resolutions – start them in December.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/why-now-december-is-a-better-time-to-start-your-new-year-resolutions-2652036-2024-12-19,"At the start of every new year, many people create a list of resolutions to improve their lives. For some, it’s finally taking the plunge and joining a gym, committing to never pick up a cigarette again, or embarking on a journey of eating healthily every day. They wait for 1 January to give themselves a fresh start and channel the infamous “new year, new me” energy. And when January actually arrives and it is time to execute those resolutions, many find themselves struggling to follow through as the initial burst of motivation fades and old habits prove difficult to break. Psychologists, meanwhile, have an innovative solution to making your new year resolutions – start them in December.Start your new year resolution right away Experts say that starting new year resolutions in December can improve the chances of sustaining them. The reasons why it works are ample. Firstly, it puts you into a soft practice and a habit-building zone. Building the foundation for habit change takes time; it often requires multiple attempts and some experimentation to identify the best ways to disrupt the context that supports unwanted habits.

“December's built-in challenges – like holiday treats and busy schedules – create an ideal testing ground. If someone can maintain their resolution during this demanding month, they're more likely to sustain it during less challenging times. Think of it as training with weights before running a race – when January arrives, the path feels lighter and more manageable,” explains Dr Chandni Tugnait, a psychotherapist, life and business coach, and founder-director of Gateway of Healing.The December strategy also helps overcome the ‘all-or-nothing’ mindset. After the initial excitement of a New Year’s resolution fades, it’s easy for the goal to lose priority, leading you to revert to old habits. Taking a test run in December can mentally prepare you for the changes you plan to implement in the year ahead. “December's built-in challenges – like holiday treats and busy schedules – create an ideal testing ground.

After the initial excitement of a New Year’s resolution fades, it’s easy for the goal to lose priority, leading you to revert to old habits. Taking a test run in December can mentally prepare you for the changes you plan to implement in the year ahead. “According to the Change Theory, when building new behaviours, a person goes through a cycle of precontemplation, contemplation, decision-making, action, maintenance, and relapse many times. So, if one is unable to maintain their new year resolution for a day or more, instead of taking it as a failure, view it as a slippage and start again,” explains Charu Prabhakar, clinical psychologist at online mental health service platform Lissun. By starting your resolution in December, you allow yourself to experience this cycle early, making it easier to stay resilient and recommit after a slip-up instead of losing hope and abandoning your resolution. Yash Sharma, a fitness coach who practises this approach himself, has already started working on his New Year’s resolution of training early in the morning. He explains that the mind often perceives a New Year’s resolution as an overwhelming task. “When the New Year begins, you spend time deciding what to do, then push yourself to start, all while thinking you need to maintain it for the entire year. It feels like a massive challenge. However, if you start pushing yourself in December, it becomes easier for your mind to continue the habit into the next year,” he shares.

 According to Dr Rahul Chandhok, Senior Consultant and Head Psychiatry at Artemis Lite Hospital, New Delhi, “December is the ‘soft start’ into resolutions. There is not as much tension and anxiety since the change in behaviour has been going on for weeks rather than just a cold turkey kind of change.” When you start those resolutions in December, habits already take root, making the transition into the new year smoother. “The brain has already begun adapting to the changes, whether it's a new exercise routine or a different eating pattern,” explains Dr Tugnait. Additionally, there is also an advantage to fine-tuning goals before the official new year begins. “Rather than diving in headfirst on 1 January, December provides time to adjust strategies and identify potential obstacles. This trial period helps create more realistic and sustainable resolutions, increasing the likelihood of long-term success,” says Dr Tugnait.More ways to make your new resolutions successful Of course, you can introduce or develop a habit at any time of the year. However, many people tend to join the craze for New Year’s resolutions, even though habits require time and consistency to build. It is also very important to be realistic with the resolution you set. Here are some helpful hacks to give a longer life to your new year resolutions:

Set SMART goals
Always set realistic, specific, and achievable goals.
“The goals should be Specific (example: I want to lose 5 kg), Measurable (I’ll measure it on the weighing scale), Achievable (this has to be achieved in a span of 3 months), Relevant (This is relevant for me as I want to work on my physical health), and have a fixed Time of execution (I’ll exercise between 6–7 pm). This approach of SMART goals has scientifically shown to enhance chances of sustaining them,” suggests psychologist Charu Prabhakar.

This approach of SMART goals has scientifically shown to enhance chances of sustaining them,” suggests psychologist Charu Prabhakar.
 Micro-milestone method
Dr Tugnait suggests breaking down your main resolution into monthly mini-goals. Instead of saying, ""I'll save Rs 50,000 this year,"" commit to saving at least Rs 3,000–Rs 4,000 each month. These smaller targets feel more achievable and provide regular wins to celebrate.


 Follow the two-day rule
Never skip your resolution-related activity for more than two consecutive days.
“This flexibility prevents the ‘all-or-nothing’ mindset while maintaining consistency. It's particularly effective for habits like exercise, meditation, or learning a new skill,” says Dr Tugnait.


 Habit stacking
Link your new habits to existing daily routines. If you want to read more, pair it with your morning coffee or evening wind-down. These connections make new habits feel more natural and sustainable.

Celebrities worldwide, from Hollywood A-listers to Indian fitness enthusiasts, are singing its praises, calling it the “magic molecule” for youth, energy, and longevity. But what is NAD+, why are stars obsessed with it, and how is it impacting the Indian wellness market? Dr Anjali Hooda, a renowned MD and Internist, explains, “NAD+ is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It plays a critical role in energy production, DNA repair, and slowing the ageing process. As we age, NAD+ levels decline, leading to fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and visible signs of ageing. Boosting NAD+ levels can help rejuvenate the body at a cellular level.”Why celebrities are hooked From Kendall Jenner to Hailey Beiber, celebrities are reportedly using NAD+ therapies for their anti-ageing and energy-boosting effects. Intravenous (IV) NAD+ drips have become a sought-after treatment among the elite, promising to enhance mental clarity, physical performance, and even recovery from jet lag or rigorous schedules.

 Bollywood has not been left behind. Indian stars, under the guidance of experts like Dr Hooda, are embracing NAD+ to maintain their hectic lifestyles and youthful appearances. “Actors and performers need peak energy levels and radiant skin, which NAD+ helps achieve. It’s no surprise they’re obsessed with it,” she says.How NAD+ works its magic NAD+ supports mitochondrial function - the powerhouse of our cells - helping convert food into energy. It also activates sirtuins, proteins associated with longevity and repair. By replenishing NAD+ levels, individuals may experience improved metabolism, better focus, and resistance to age-related diseases. Dr Hooda points out that while IV treatments are popular among celebrities, oral supplements, NAD+ precursors like NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), and even topical applications are entering the mainstream.Impact on the Indian market India’s wellness industry, already booming with trends like IV therapy bars and biohacking clinics, is rapidly adopting NAD+ treatments. Luxury wellness centers in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru are offering NAD+ IV drips, priced between Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000 per session. “The Indian market is seeing a surge in demand for high-end, evidence-based treatments,” says Dr Hooda. “NAD+ fits perfectly into this space, appealing to health-conscious millennials and the ultra-wealthy alike.” Affordable NAD+ supplements, manufactured by Indian pharmaceutical companies, are also making their way into drugstores and e-commerce platforms. Experts believe this accessibility could make NAD+ the next big thing in India’s burgeoning nutraceutical market.The science vs the hype While NAD+ shows immense promise, skeptics caution against over-reliance on it as a miracle cure. Dr Hooda advises, “It’s important to pair NAD+ therapies with a balanced diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. The molecule is a tool, not a standalone solution.”The verdict As awareness of NAD+ grows, India stands poised to become a major player in this global trend. With celebrities endorsing it and experts advocating its benefits, the “magic molecule” might just be the future of wellness. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast or simply looking to age gracefully, NAD+ offers a compelling promise: a chance to biohack your way to better health.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch

Microdosing Ozempic has gained momentum online, with people hoping to use the weight-loss benefits while dodging the side effects. ",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-microdosing-on-ozempic-help-you-lose-weight-without-any-side-effects-2651165-2024-12-18,"The weight-loss market is evolving more than ever. Crash diets, wellness programmes, injectables, supplements, and more are expected to create a massive global market worth USD 405 billion by 2030. India’s market is also anticipated to reach USD 52.3 billion by 2032. Among all these products and treatments, one that has garnered significant attention, especially after notable personalities like Elon Musk spoke about it, is Ozempic. However, it’s important to note that Ozempic was never originally intended as a weight-loss drug.What is Ozempic? Unless you've been living under a rock, you must have heard of Ozempic, which is actually a brand name for a semaglutide, an injectable medication used primarily to manage Type 2 diabetes. 

 



Microdosing Ozempic is gaining attention online. Photo: Getty Images

It belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which work by mimicking the action of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
This hormone helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes insulin production, and reduces the production of glucose in the liver. One of its notable effects is slowing down stomach emptying, which increases the feeling of fullness.
Although Ozempic was initially developed to manage diabetes, it has gained attention for its potential to aid in weight loss.
Some studies suggest that it can help users shed 5-10 per cent of their body weight when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. This weight loss effect has led to a growing interest in its off-label use for obesity management.
What are the side effects? While Ozempic is effective for managing blood sugar and promoting weight loss, it is not free from side effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Some people may also experience fatigue, dizziness, or mild headaches. These side effects are more common when starting the medication and tend to subside as the body adjusts.

 



Ozempic comes with various side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Photo: Unsplash
 In rare cases, serious side effects such as pancreatitis, gallbladder issues, or allergic reactions may occur. Dr Archana Batra, a dietician and certified diabetes educator, tells India Today, “Some people have experienced side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and fatigue, which create various problems in their daily lives.”  However, if there’s one side effect that almost all people who take Ozempic is losing muscle mass, while losing weight. This has also given rise to terms like “Ozempic face” and “Ozempic body”, which often occur when people lose muscle mass drastically due to taking Ozempic.  To avoid these side effects, and to avoid “Ozempic face and body” and still lose weight, some experts came up with the mircodosing of the drug, and it is now gaining more attention as a better way to take Ozempic. Can microdosing Ozempic actually help?  One of the first people to mention microdosing Ozempic was Dr Craig Koniver, a medical professional with over 1,20,000 followers on Instagram, in October 2024. Craig spoke on the Huberman Lab podcast, where he discussed how he had observed individuals taking Ozempic in much smaller amounts than the conventional doses. According to him, “these people were avoiding the side effects, essentially the loss of muscle mass”.

— Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D. (@hubermanlab) October 8, 2024 For context, microdosing involves administering smaller-than-usual doses of a drug to help the body adapt gradually. For Ozempic, this means starting with a very low dose and slowly increasing it over time.  According to Dr Aprajita Pradhan, senior consultant and unit head of endocrinology at Max Super Speciality Hospital, “Ozempic is usually started with a low weekly dose for 4 weeks, then the dose is up-titrated to reach the desired blood glucose control. This method of starting at a low dose helps in decreasing the side effects of Ozempic.” Dr Bhatra also seems to agree that using this approach, you can reduce the intensity of side effects. However, Niharikka Budhwani, a doctor of medicine and co-founder of Health Hatch, a wellness company, advises caution, stating, “Microdosing of any medication must be done under the supervision of a licenced doctor and is highly subjective, varying on a case-to-case basis. While this method appears promising, it should always be done with medical guidance.”Can other drugs be ‘microdosed’?  Microdosing is the practice of administering subtherapeutic doses of a drug (like Ozempic) to enhance tolerance, minimise side effects, or explore its effects at lower concentrations. The core principle is to allow the body to gradually adjust to the medication, thereby avoiding the ""shock"" that might come with a full dose. Experts suggest that this technique is not unique to Ozempic and is often used for other medications (including other weight-loss drugs), particularly those with strong side effects. Dr Batra says, “By using this approach, you can reduce the intensity of side effects. For example, in the beginning, users should start with low doses and extend to the titration period.” 

 



Experts agree that microdosing can possibly help in avoiding side effects. Photo: Unsplash
 This gradual increase helps users avoid sudden reactions, which can be particularly helpful for drugs with gastrointestinal side effects. Dr Pradhan adds that this could work for other weight-loss drugs too, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro are likely to be launched in India by 2025-26, and can also benefit from microdosing.  He further says, “Most of the recently approved injectable weight loss medications are initially started with a lower dose to improve patient tolerability and reduce side effects.” Experts believe that apart from weight-loss drugs, microdosing can also be applied to other medications as well. For instance, antidepressants are often microdosed to avoid sudden side effects like insomnia or restlessness.  But not all drugs are suitable for microdosing. The feasibility depends on the drug’s mechanism of action, its half-life, and the body’s ability to adapt to it over time.advertisementRememberOzempic’s potential for weight loss has brought it into the spotlight, but its side effects have raised concerns for many users.

db2bfbe8-64b7-468d-9da2-8553dc09fd2a,"You've been misunderstanding Trauma Bonding all along. It's a toxic trapMany may assume trauma bonding is a positive bond shared over a past trauma, but you will be surprised that it is absolutely not what you think.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/youve-been-misunderstanding-trauma-bonding-all-along-its-a-toxic-trap-2651160-2024-12-17,"When we say ""trauma bonding""—what comes to mind? Many might assume it’s a connection formed through shared trauma, but it’s more complex—and far more toxic—than it seems at first instance. Trauma bonding isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a psychological phenomenon that traps individuals in harmful relationships through cycles of abuse and affection.What is trauma bonding? According to Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, trauma bonding occurs when an abuser creates a cycle of manipulation by alternating between abusive behaviour and affectionate gestures. This unpredictable pattern makes the victim emotionally dependent, confusing love with control and harm. “The abuser alternates between harmful behaviour (abuse, manipulation) and positive behaviour (affection, apologies), creating confusion and dependency in the victim. This cycle makes the relationship feel unpredictable yet difficult to leave, as moments of ‘kindness’ can create a 'euphoric recall' of all the good memories,” says Ruuh.

 Relationship expert Shahzeen Shivdasani adds that trauma bonding is not about shared past traumas but staying in a toxic relationship where emotional abuse is followed by periods of kindness. This pattern fosters dependency, keeping victims emotionally hooked. Ekta Khurana, another Delhi-based psychologist and therapist mentions that sometimes victims are absolutely aware that the person showcasing the behaviour is toxic but yet, they cannot break free from the relationship.How does it affect mental health? The psychological toll of trauma bonding is severe. Ruuh explains that the constant highs and lows can lead to anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Victims often internalise blame, suffer from low self-esteem, and mistakenly believe they are responsible for the abuse.

 She also mentions that one of the downsides of forming such a bond is that the abuser’s approval becomes the source of the victim’s worth and safety, creating unhealthy reliance. This creates a unique kind of dependency on the abusers and victims stay too long trying to make sense of this relationship.How does trauma bonding develop? Shivdasani attributes the development of trauma bonding to intermittent reinforcement, where periods of affection follow abusive episodes. Victims try to rationalise their partner’s erratic behaviour, hoping for lasting change, which rarely comes. Additionally, people with insecure attachment styles or unresolved childhood trauma are more prone to falling into such toxic cycles, says Ruuh. “Over time, the tension-abuse-reconciliation cycle becomes normalised, making it harder to recognise the toxicity. Abusers often isolate their victim from their support systems like family and friends, making the abusive relationship the only emotional outlet for the victims,” mentions Ruuh.Breaking free and healing Ekta Khurana outlines the essential steps to break free:
Awareness: Recognise that the relationship is toxic and built on manipulation.
Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, join support groups, or seek therapy.
Document patterns: Keep a journal of abusive incidents to combat gaslighting.
Set boundaries: Establish physical and emotional distance from the abuser.
Rebuild self-worth: Invest in self-care, hobbies, and healthy social connections.
Therapeutic help: Consider therapies like CBT or EMDR for deep-rooted trauma.
Red flags to watch for Shahzeen Shivdasani highlights warning signs of trauma bonding:
The relationship alternates between intense affection and mistreatment.
The abuser justifies harmful behaviour as ‘for your own good’.
You feel isolated from friends and family.
Ending the relationship triggers anxiety or guilt.
Misconceptions about trauma bonding Contrary to popular belief, trauma bonding isn’t mutual or limited to romantic relationships. It can occur in friendships, workplaces, and family dynamics where power imbalances exist. So, watch out!Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 17, 2024

There are several struggles that often go unnoticed despite the ever-growing Indian pet market.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/pet-dog-owners-struggles-india-2650652-2024-12-17,"When 20-year-old art student Gargy Sharma from Delhi finally convinced her parents to go on a long-awaited family outing, she was thrilled. More than for herself, she was excited for Cheddar, her 2-year-old poodle, as it was his birthday month. The destination was pre-decided: a high-end, pet-friendly hangout street in Gurugram. However, her excitement quickly turned to disappointment when she discovered that Cheddar wasn’t allowed inside most restaurants there. Pets were restricted to the outdoor street area only. When you bring a pet into your home, it becomes a beloved family member. Your travel plans, daily routines, and overall lifestyle naturally adjust to accommodate their needs and presence. You willingly make compromises in various aspects of your life to prioritise the well-being of your furry companion. Indian pet parents, especially dog owners, however, feel that India is yet to become more accommodating for pets. There are several struggles that often go unnoticed despite the ever-growing Indian pet market. According to the Ken Research report published in July 2024, the Indian pet market was valued at USD 9.85 billion in 2023. This growth is driven by increasing pet ownership, rising disposable incomes, and a shift in consumer attitudes that view pets as family members. Additionally, the rise of DINK (Double Income, No Kids) couples, who often choose pets over having children, has also contributed to this trend. Consequently, there has been a proliferation of pet care products and services, including premium pet food, grooming, and veterinary care.

Dogs dominate the pet market in India. The overall population of pet dogs in India was over 33 million in 2023, and it is is likely to reach more than 51 million by 2028.Yet, pet dog owners in India often witness challenges at basic levels, such as travelling with their pets or gaining acceptance in housing societies.Healthcare hassles Dogs dominate the pet market in India. The overall population of pet dogs in India was over 33 million in 2023, and it is is likely to reach more than 51 million by 2028. Yet, pet dog owners in India often witness challenges at basic levels, such as travelling with their pets or gaining acceptance in housing societies.Healthcare hassles “Although the pet clinic culture is thriving in India, access to proper pet hospitals remains a significant challenge. There is a dire shortage,” says Koustav Das, a Noida resident and owner of a Labrador. “A friend took his dog to a regular veterinarian, where the pet was misdiagnosed. The dog is still suffering because of it,” he shares. Rashi Narang, founder of the leading pet care brand Heads Up For Tails and owner of two pet dogs, agrees and adds, “Reliable veterinary services and specialised care can still be hard to find in certain parts of India. Many pet parents struggle to access timely medical advice, emergency care, or advanced treatments, especially in smaller towns.”Travel woes Travelling with pets is another significant issue. Whether you wish to take a cab, train, or flight – you are likely to encounter several challenges if you are travelling with your pet. Limited carriers allow pet travel, and in India, Air India is one of them. While smaller pets, such as dogs weighing under 10 kg, are permitted to travel in the cabin, larger dogs must travel in the cargo hold. Rashi recalls having an exceptionally difficult experience while travelling with her pets on a flight. “The process involved a significant amount of paperwork, and I had to drop my dog off at the cargo terminal many hours before the flight. She had to stay in a crate for several hours, which was incredibly stressful for both of us. While there are options for very small dogs to travel in the cabin on select airlines, we need to do much more to accommodate dogs of all sizes. Larger dogs are often restricted to travelling in cargo, where they face altitude changes, loud noises, and unfamiliar surroundings. It’s a scary and isolating experience for them, and as pet parents, it’s heartbreaking to think of our pets enduring such stress,” she tells India Today.

 Many pet parents enrol their dogs in air travel training programmes to help them remain calm and unaffected during long-haul journeys in a cargo hold. Rashi, meanwhile, suggests introducing innovative solutions such as pet-friendly cabin options, specialised compartments for pets, and enhanced safety and comfort measures in cargo. “Travelling with a pet should be a positive experience, not a daunting one, and I hope we can work towards a future where all pets, regardless of size, can travel safely and comfortably with their families,” she tells India Today. Among cab providers, Ola does not yet offer a pet-friendly option. Uber, on the other hand, has launched a pet travel service, but it is currently available only in Bengaluru. In terms of train travel, the pet parent is supposed to book a two-seater coupe or a four-berth cabin to travel with their fur buddies. So, availability becomes a huge factor. In case you have to travel urgently, it is really difficult to take your pet along. Alternatively, some trains provide dog boxes where pets travel like 'luggage.' They are placed in a designated dog box located in second-class compartments. If you have a kitten or a puppy that can be carried in a basket, they can be carried by owners in any class after payment of the usual booking charges.advertisementPet boarding – Difficult to find good optionsIf travelling is an issue, leaving behind your pet at a boarding centre is no less challenging.“I discovered a pet boarding centre in Chhatarpur through Just Dial when I had to travel with my family to Dubai for a week. However, during a basic inspection visit, we were shocked by the conditions. It was a simple residential setup with barely any outdoor space for the dogs. Beer bottles were scattered around, suggesting a party had taken place the night before. Naturally, we decided not to leave our Golden Retriever there. The most alarming part was that such boarding centres operate without skilled staff,” Divya Arora, a 32-year-old professional in Delhi, tells India Today.Bengaluru-based Shobhit Mohanty, who founded the pet parent community and educational platform ThePack.in after encountering several hurdles and challenges in his pet parenting journey, shares similar thoughts.“India’s pet-friendliness is improving but lags significantly behind countries like the US, Germany, and the UK. Challenges such as limited access to quality veterinary care, behaviour trainers, pet-friendly parks, trustworthy boarding centres, and pet-friendly travel options remain significant,” he says.advertisementShobhit also highlights the need for stronger pet laws and, more importantly, better enforcement in India.“While laws against illegal breeding and animal cruelty exist, their implementation is weak, leading to widespread illegal breeding and frequent animal cruelty cases,” he says.Housing issuesKoustav adds how Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and housing society managements often impose unreasonable rules on pet owners, such as requiring dogs to be muzzled even when walking in parks.Finding pet-friendly housing remains a significant struggle. Many landlords are hesitant about pets, leaving families in tough situations. This is a deeply emotional issue for pet parents.

“There’s still a lack of understanding about pet behaviour in some communities. Pet parents often find themselves defending their decision to bring pets home or navigating situations where pets are misunderstood or even feared,” she adds.Pet attacks cannot be ignored either, with instances of pet dogs biting people in shared public spaces like elevators. The solution? Pet parent education.Need of the hour: Pet parent educationIn the last few years, India has certainly taken measures to become more pet-friendly. Dedicated festivals and events like Pet Fed and Kukur Tihar (an initiative by the Bengaluru municipal department), along with an increasing number of pet-friendly cafes and holiday properties, have gained prominence. Pet parks are also being set up by governments.The lack of pet parent training is also a reason why pet abandonment is a complex issue in India.“People need to understand that having a pet is a full-time responsibility. It’s their duty to train the pet properly, understand its personality, consult relevant professionals, and take ownership of its behaviour in public. From registering the pet to ensuring it receives annual booster shots, many are unaware of these essential responsibilities,” shares Koustav.He believes that as pet parents become more responsible and better informed, society’s perception of pet dogs will gradually change. “It requires a collective effort from both the government and pet parents,” he adds.“New pet parents need education on basics like toilet training, puppy biting, diet, and health.

 If travelling is an issue, leaving behind your pet at a boarding centre is no less challenging. “I discovered a pet boarding centre in Chhatarpur through Just Dial when I had to travel with my family to Dubai for a week. However, during a basic inspection visit, we were shocked by the conditions. It was a simple residential setup with barely any outdoor space for the dogs. Beer bottles were scattered around, suggesting a party had taken place the night before. Naturally, we decided not to leave our Golden Retriever there. The most alarming part was that such boarding centres operate without skilled staff,” Divya Arora, a 32-year-old professional in Delhi, tells India Today. Bengaluru-based Shobhit Mohanty, who founded the pet parent community and educational platform ThePack.in after encountering several hurdles and challenges in his pet parenting journey, shares similar thoughts. “India’s pet-friendliness is improving but lags significantly behind countries like the US, Germany, and the UK. Challenges such as limited access to quality veterinary care, behaviour trainers, pet-friendly parks, trustworthy boarding centres, and pet-friendly travel options remain significant,” he says. Shobhit also highlights the need for stronger pet laws and, more importantly, better enforcement in India. “While laws against illegal breeding and animal cruelty exist, their implementation is weak, leading to widespread illegal breeding and frequent animal cruelty cases,” he says.Housing issues Koustav adds how Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and housing society managements often impose unreasonable rules on pet owners, such as requiring dogs to be muzzled even when walking in parks. Finding pet-friendly housing remains a significant struggle. Many landlords are hesitant about pets, leaving families in tough situations. This is a deeply emotional issue for pet parents.

 “There’s still a lack of understanding about pet behaviour in some communities. Pet parents often find themselves defending their decision to bring pets home or navigating situations where pets are misunderstood or even feared,” she adds. Pet attacks cannot be ignored either, with instances of pet dogs biting people in shared public spaces like elevators. The solution? Pet parent education.Need of the hour: Pet parent education In the last few years, India has certainly taken measures to become more pet-friendly. Dedicated festivals and events like Pet Fed and Kukur Tihar (an initiative by the Bengaluru municipal department), along with an increasing number of pet-friendly cafes and holiday properties, have gained prominence. Pet parks are also being set up by governments. The lack of pet parent training is also a reason why pet abandonment is a complex issue in India. “People need to understand that having a pet is a full-time responsibility. It’s their duty to train the pet properly, understand its personality, consult relevant professionals, and take ownership of its behaviour in public. From registering the pet to ensuring it receives annual booster shots, many are unaware of these essential responsibilities,” shares Koustav. He believes that as pet parents become more responsible and better informed, society’s perception of pet dogs will gradually change. “It requires a collective effort from both the government and pet parents,” he adds. “New pet parents need education on basics like toilet training, puppy biting, diet, and health. Raising awareness should be a top priority to prevent challenges from arising early. While mandatory training sounds appealing, it’s not feasible due to the shortage of qualified trainers and the lack of dog training programmes in India. Without sufficient trainers, enforcing mandatory training would be impractical,” Shobhit, a vocal voice in the pet parenting community, highlights.

Over time, many of us have begun relying on social media for information, particularly on health-related topics and advice on what we should or shouldn't consume. Recently, one fruit that has been gaining traction across platforms like Instagram and Facebook for its purported anti-cancer properties is soursop (Graviola), a prickly, dark green fruit that commonly grows in tropical and subtropical regions around the world.Soursop for cancer? Soursop, a close cousin of the famous custard apple, is gaining buzz on social media for its anti-cancerous properties. This has led to a surge in products in the market, from supplements to juices to protein powders, with soursop as the main ingredient.

 Since the fruit is primarily grown in tropical areas, its reputation as a cancer-killing agent started gaining hype in the West. Now, it seems that this misinformation has reached India as well, with several influencer doctors promoting the fruit as being as effective as chemotherapy.Here’s what experts have to say India Today spoke to various experts and all of them agreed that even though the fruit is high in antioxidants, there’s no study that shows it can heal cancer.  Chintamani, chairman and head of the department of surgical oncology at Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, emphasises that there is ""no clear evidence to suggest that it is effective and safe for treatment of cancer in humans"".   He highlights that while soursop has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, these benefits have not been objectively assessed in human clinical trials.

 According to him, ""This product has a doubtful role as an anticancer agent and its safety is not established in humans."" Dr Suman S Karanth, senior consultant in medical oncology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, points out that while laboratory studies on animal tissue and cancer cells have demonstrated some anti-cancer activity in prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancer cells, ""these studies are not in humans"".   She warns that without clinical trials, there is no concrete evidence to support soursop’s efficacy in treating cancer in humans. Dr Karanth also raises concerns about the toxic effects of soursop’s acetogenin compounds, which can cause neurotoxicity and immune suppression.

 



Excessive consumption of soursop may cause nausea. Photo: Pexels
 Dr Pooja Babbar, a consultant in medical oncology at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, further explains that even though soursop contains acetogenins, which may have cytotoxic effects (toxic effects on cell function) on cancer cells by inhibiting specific compounds found in cancer cell membranes.  The consensus among experts is clear: While soursop’s potential as a cancer-fighting agent is supported by preclinical studies (on animals), there is no substantial human evidence to validate its use as a cancer treatment. But does it mean that the fruit has no benefits? Well, no. Does it have any benefits? Soursop offers several potential health benefits due to its rich nutritional content. The fruit is a source of essential vitamins (like Vitamin C, B1, and B2), minerals (like potassium, magnesium, and calcium), antioxidants, and dietary fibre. According to Dr Shilpa M R, a consultant and dietitian at Kshemavana Yoga and Naturopathy Centre, Bengaluru, the fruit: 
Boosts immunity: Soursop can ""boost immunity"" through its high Vitamin C content, which promotes the generation of white blood cells.
Rich in antioxidants: Soursop’s ""antioxidant property prevents cancer"" by combating oxidative stress in the body.
Promotes digestive health: Soursop's high fibre content helps maintain gut health and prevent constipation.
Regulates blood pressure: Dr Shilpa M R notes that its potassium content helps control blood pressure by balancing sodium levels and relaxing blood vessels.

Reduces inflammation: Soursop has anti-inflammatory properties, which may offer relief for joint pain and other inflammatory conditions.
Promotes skin and hair health: The antioxidants and Vitamin C in soursop support collagen production and fight signs of ageing.
May help stabilise blood sugar levels: Dr Babbar notes that soursop may help stabilise blood sugar levels, which could benefit those managing diabetes.
 Experts recommend consuming soursop in its natural form as a fruit, as it is considered safe for most people. However, they urge caution when using soursop supplements and other products as they are yet to be approved officially by the Food and Drug Administration. Potential side effects Despite its numerous health benefits, soursop also carries potential side effects. Experts caution that excessive consumption or unsupervised use of soursop could lead to adverse effects, particularly for those with pre-existing health conditions.
Neurotoxicity: Prof Chintamani warns that soursop ""is not very safe for those on treatment for neurological disorders like Parkinson disease"", as it may worsen symptoms and interfere with neurological treatments.
Toxic effects: Dr Karanth highlights that soursop’s fatty acid derivatives, called acetogenins, are ""toxic"" and linked to neurotoxicity, which can cause hair loss and immune system suppression.
Interference with cardiovascular treatments: Soursop could interfere with cardiovascular treatments and metabolic activities, urging caution and the supervision of a medical expert or nutritionist.
Nausea and vomiting: Dr Babbar mentions that soursop consumption can cause ""nausea, vomiting"" and a drop in blood pressure.
Allergic reactions: Dr Shilpa points out that some individuals may experience allergic responses like rashes or itching after consuming soursop.

However, it is certainly possible to keep the spark alive.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/indian-married-couples-romance-alive-while-living-with-family-2648573-2024-12-15,"The thought of cooking a meal together with your spouse, sneaking in playful cuddles along the way, or sharing an evening of passionate romance while curled up on the couch watching a favourite movie, are a few things many couples dream of. These dreams, however, often remain just that for couples living in joint family setups. Couples living with families find it difficult to cherish romance-filled moments owing to a lack of privacy, constant interruptions, and some unspoken expectations. Sometimes, you don’t even have the bandwidth to think of such things because you are so engrossed in family life, children, and all its demands. Sounds like the reality of your life? But does this mean living with family is a bad idea? No! Does it also mean that you let romance take a backseat due to family obligations? Definitely not! Marriage counsellors say finding privacy and keeping romance alive is a common issue for Indian couples who live under the same roof as their families – as it limits privacy and intimacy and creates obstacles for meaningful couple time. Not just physical intimacy, but emotional intimacy can also take a backseat. “Often, couples fall into routines where romance takes a backseat. This happens because their focus shifts to caregiving, household responsibilities, and managing complex family dynamics,” Dr Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based marriage counsellor, tells India Today.

“Many clients seek counselling for these concerns. Common issues include the lack of private time, one partner prioritising time with parents over the couple’s relationship, overwhelming household responsibilities, and the pressures of living with in-laws. If children are involved, the added responsibilities can further strain the relationship,” she adds. “Many clients seek counselling for these concerns. Common issues include the lack of private time, one partner prioritising time with parents over the couple’s relationship, overwhelming household responsibilities, and the pressures of living with in-laws. If children are involved, the added responsibilities can further strain the relationship,” she adds. This dynamic can negatively impact your marriage. Such challenges can leave couples feeling overwhelmed, leading to frustration and resentment. But there is a way out, of course! All you need is an intention along with a bit of creativity.Firstly, be intentional You and your partner need to have an intention to keep the romance alive—only then can you create the mental space and find creative solutions. You have to sit together, talk it out, and express your expectations. “When living with family, keeping the romance alive requires creativity and intentional effort. Couples must ensure that intimacy doesn’t take a backseat by prioritising alone time and setting boundaries with family members,” says Shahzeen Shivdasani, a Mumbai-based relationship expert and author. Be intentional about maintaining physical intimacy.

 “It requires both partners to work intentionally and proactively as a team,” adds Dr Khanna.Set boundaries with family members Setting boundaries with family members is essential for maintaining romance after marriage. It’s never too late to make changes for the better. Your parents or in-laws might not have prioritised such moments with their respective partners due to household responsibilities, but you don’t have to take the same route. It is possible to respect family and have your own personal space as a couple while living in the same house. “Designate time after everyone goes to sleep as your private moments or create a dedicated space in the house that’s just for the two of you,” suggests Shahzeen. Communicate your need for quality time with your partner to your family, and explain it respectfully. Be consistent with your efforts, and present this as non-negotiable. To maintain balance, ensure to encourage family activities on separate occasions.Carve out ‘us’ time – staycations, walks, date nights Stealing those flirty, playful moments beyond the four walls of your bedroom or at unexpected times of the day might be your idea of keeping the romance alive, but there is so much more you can do to keep the spark burning. Dr Khanna, a marriage counsellor with over 15 years of experience, recommends scheduling regular date nights or outings. This could include having lunch or dinner together, going to a movie, enjoying a long drive, or simply spending private moments as a couple. These small gestures create meaningful experiences that strengthen the bond. “To break the monotony of being confined to the bedroom, find creative ways to add excitement while living with family. Couples could perhaps plan activities that take them out of the house, such as walks, short drives, or outdoor picnics, to enjoy private moments in a different setting. Setting up a cosy nook in the living room or balcony for intimate conversations or movie nights might create a change of scene,” suggests Delhi-based marriage counsellor Shivani Sadhoo. If space is limited at home, plan monthly staycations to enjoy quality time together.

 



Go on weekly dates or plan monthly staycations with your partner. (Photo: Pexels)
 At least dedicate one hour to just each other, where no third party is there to interrupt. “Couples often face challenges when one partner feels the other is overly involved with their family. To address this, I suggest dedicating at least an hour each day exclusively to each other, during which family matters are not discussed,” says Dr Khanna. This could be your chai time in the morning, a long walk or a badminton date in the evening, or a little time on the terrace.Little gestures matter Give your partner a peck when they least expect it, don’t shy away from holding their hands or hugging them in front of the family. Plan those little surprises. Leave love-filled notes. These little gestures matter and can keep you two connected. Even activities like solving a puzzle or playing board games help. You can also send playful texts, emojis, or memes to stay connected even while at home. “Scheduling time when other family members are out or engaged may also help. Small surprises such as a home-cooked meal, surprise gifts, or planned activities can bring novelty and joy to their relationship,” suggests Shivani Sadhoo. Intimacy is a vital part of any relationship, and living with family might mean working a bit harder to nurture it. But by being creative, working as a team, and being excited and proactive – your connection is sure to remain strong and vibrant.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 15, 2024Tune InALSO READ |  Should newlyweds live on their own for the first few years of marriage?Trending Reel

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/how-to-manage-your-childs-anger-and-stubbornness-2649430-2024-12-14,"When you have a child around, it's common to see them get upset or angry when they don't get what they want. A simple wish can quickly turn into a tantrum, with crying and howling when it's unmet. But when their desires are fulfilled, their faces light up with a big grin. Parenting isn’t easy, and parents often find themselves criticised no matter what they do. If they give in to their child’s demands, they're accused of spoiling them. If they refuse, they’re labelled as heartless or uncaring. But the question here is: should parents give in to their child's stubbornness and anger, or is there a better way to navigate these moments?The loud display of anger Dr Sarthak Dave, an Ahmedabad-based psychiatrist, tells India Today that kids become stubborn and express their anger loudly because they absorb behaviours from their surroundings and consider them normal. If they frequently observe their parents displaying anger or reacting loudly, they learn to replicate this behaviour, believing it to be acceptable. He explains, ""At a young age, their id—the instinctual drive to fulfil their desires—is very strong, while their ego (logical reasoning) and superego (moral understanding) are still underdeveloped and grow with age and experience. When children want something, they struggle to think logically or anticipate the consequences of their actions. If they don’t get what they want, they feel distress and express it in ways they’ve learnt from their environment.""

Additionally, if they’ve previously received what they wanted by acting out, this behaviour gets reinforced, encouraging them to repeat it. Additionally, if they’ve previously received what they wanted by acting out, this behaviour gets reinforced, encouraging them to repeat it. Further, Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, tells us that kids can be stubborn or loud because they don’t yet have the words or skills to express their emotions or because they feel ignored or misunderstood by adults. She mentions that these outbursts are their way of coping with emotions they can’t fully control or explain. According to Patel, while kids do learn from their environment and often replicate their parents, stubbornness is also a natural part of development as children learn to assert themselves. It doesn’t always mean parents are at fault.What does this stubbornness say about your kid? A child’s stubbornness, anger, and loud reactions are often ways of acting out due to their limited ability to handle emotions and distress. ""These behaviours indicate that the child may not yet be developing the emotional tools needed to cope effectively. If such reactions are not addressed or discouraged, they can become ingrained as primitive defence mechanisms, suggesting that the child’s emotional growth is not progressing as it should,"" says Dr Dave. Meanwhile, Patel feels that stubbornness and anger are signs that a child:
Is seeking attention, understanding, or control.
May be feeling overwhelmed, insecure, or unsure how to handle a situation.
Is in a stage of development where they’re learning to test limits and establish independence.
Impact on mental health According to the experts, if left unchecked, constant anger and stubbornness can lead to issues such as difficulty managing emotions later in life, strained relationships with peers and family, and increased feelings of frustration or anxiety.

 



Anger and stubbornness can have long-term effects on a child's emotional development (Photo: Getty Images)
What should you do as a parent? Dr Sajeela Maini, senior consultant, department of psychiatry and behavioural sciences, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, states that parents should not give in to their child’s stubbornness and anger, as this will only make the child more stubborn, and their anger levels will increase multifold. Parents should make sure they are not rewarding such behaviour. By rewarding them, you are feeding stubbornness and anger, and this will only increase the tantrums. While Riddhi Doshi Patel agrees, she mentions that this doesn’t mean parents should ignore their child’s feelings. Instead, they should acknowledge their child’s emotions, set clear and consistent boundaries, and stay calm while avoiding engaging in a power struggle. To this, Dr Sarthak Dave adds that parents should prioritise guiding their children toward healthier ways of expressing their needs and help them move from immature defence mechanisms to more mature ones. Teaching effective and constructive communication methods is vital for their emotional development. To manage a difficult situation, you must...
Stay calm: Children often mirror your emotions. Responding with calmness can help de-escalate the situation.
Acknowledge their feelings: Show empathy by saying, ""I see you’re upset. Do you want to talk about it?""
Set clear boundaries: Be consistent with rules and consequences. Children feel safer when they know what to expect.
Offer choices: Giving children small choices helps them feel in control, reducing the need for stubborn behaviour. 
Teach problem-solving skills: Encourage them to use words to express their feelings or brainstorm solutions together.
Model healthy behaviour: Show them how to handle frustration calmly. For example, say, ""I feel frustrated too sometimes, and I take deep breaths to help.""

It’s spicy. It’s warm. It’s comfort in a bowl. For many Indians, Ema Datshi has become the ultimate go-to comfort food. You can enjoy it with rice or stick to tradition by pairing it with tingmo - a soft, steamed bread from Tibetan cuisine. For Sherya, a 26-year-old working professional from Delhi NCR, it’s the dish she “makes in no time” and whenever she’s craving something spicy yet indulgently cheesy.  “I cook it when I don’t have the time to make anything, and when I am feeling lazy. It’s my comfort food now,” she says.  And Shreya is far from alone. Google India’s year-end report, Year in Search 2024: What Sparked Curiosity Across India on Google, revealed that Ema Datshi was one of the top 10 most-searched recipes in the country. Interestingly, while it has captured Indian hearts (and taste buds), Ema Datshi is actually a culinary treasure from Bhutan and is often known as the country's national dish.   But how did this humble Bhutanese classic become one of India’s most searched recipes this year? The answer lies in the magic of social media,  and, of course, Deepika Padukone.  Let’s whip this up from scratch, and tell you a little about this dish first. Bhutan and their love for “Ema” The picturesque Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan boasts a cuisine that varies from region to region. Yet, if there’s one thing that unites the nation’s palate, it’s their deep-rooted love for chillies. Ema Datshi is a hearty, soul-warming stew where chillies take centre stage, paired with a unique local cheese that melts into a luscious, creamy sauce.  The name itself captures its essence - “Ema” means chilli and “Datshi” means cheese in Dzongkha, the national language of Bhutan. But for the Bhutanese, it’s more than just food; it’s a reflection of culture and tradition served on a plate. No meal in Bhutan is complete without Ema Datshi, and it shows the nation’s enduring love affair with chillies. For generations, it has been a household staple, enjoyed with red rice or tingmo.

 Ema Datshi evolved to meet the specific requirements of Bhutan and its people – the dish is extremely high in fats, and the addition of chillies was meant to help improve circulation and offer warmth in the colder winter months. 
You can also try making different kinds of Datshi. Apart from the OG Ema Datshi, there is Kewa Datshi, which offers a milder twist with thinly sliced potatoes simmered in the same rich, cheesy broth, resulting in a hearty, comforting dish. 
Shamu Datshi, on the other hand, uses mushrooms, and combines them with the signature cheese sauce to create a dish that’s savoury and umami-rich. 
Beyond these classics, there are other creative versions like Goong Datshi (made with spinach) and mixed Datshi, which blends multiple vegetables like cabbage, radish, or green beans into the stew. 
How did it gain fame? In India, however, out of all the types, it is the chillies that have gained more attention for various reasons. Let us discuss each one of them. The Viral Deepika’s video  About a year ago, Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone mentioned a Bhutanese dish in an interview with Curly Tales, noting its similarity to Indian pickles - but with cheese instead of spices. “I forget the name of it, but they have this dish almost a national dish, if I’m not mistaken, which is basically chillies and cheese mashed together. And it’s an achaar equivalent, and they eat it with rice,” Deepika shared in the viral interview.

 Although she couldn’t recall the name at that time, it didn’t take long for the internet to figure it out, the dish she was referring to was none other than Ema Datshi. The clip from the interview quickly went viral, sparking a wave of curiosity.  Food vloggers and social media foodies also jumped on the trend, reimagining the dish in their own creative ways. As the dish is made out of simple ingredients, Ema Datshi became a must-try for home cooks (as it also became viral on YouTube) and food enthusiasts alike, ultimately earning its place as one of India’s most-searched recipes.

 Several eateries have benefited from this growing interest in Ema Datshi. Lha Kitchen, is a Delhi-based restaurant known for its authentic Himalayan cuisine. Amongst its most popular offerings is, unsurprisingly, Ema Datshi. Akshay, the restaurant’s manager of over three years, believes Deepika’s video played a key role in driving interest. Speaking to India Today, he shared, “It was a video by Deepika that also somehow sparked interest, even though there was some interest already for the dish to begin with.” Today, Lha Kitchen serves an average of at least 10 plates of Ema Datshi daily, a significant increase since Deepika's mention put the dish on India’s culinary map.‘Modern Indians have an adventurous palate’ Indians are travelling more than ever. This has also impacted their need and desire to explore various cuisines as authentically as possible. Shivani Sharma, a chefpreneur and founder of Gourmestan, says that the modern Indian is well-travelled, has an adventurous palate, and a desire to explore hitherto underexplored cuisines and dishes.

 “This is further amplified by social media, which have made the world smaller and, at the same time, more intriguing than ever before,” she says. With Bhutan opening its doors to tourists only relatively recently (in the mid-70s), there is a lot of curiosity about the culture and people of one of the happiest countries on earth, Shivani says.Increase curiosity amongst Indians about cuisines  Chef Ishijyot Surri, the executive chef and founder of Mulk, Miniyaturk & SJI Gourmet tells India Today that there is a surge in the popularity of Tibetan and Bhutanese food cultures, especially among urban food lovers.  “These cuisines stand out for their soulful and wholesome nature. I also believe the demand for niche food items such as Ema Datshi has increased in accordance with the rising demand for more commonly known Tibetan dishes such as thukpa and momos,” he says.  He also says this likeness to Indian comfort foods such as dal or curry makes it more approachable for Indians.  Shivani also credits this increased demand for such cuisines to a section of Indians who are becoming more exploratory diners. “There is a deeper understanding of and appreciation for how local cuisines are inextricably tied in to the narratives of the place and its people. Dishes such as Ema Datshi are made with local produce and can be found in nearly every home in Bhutan, the simplicity of such foods and their pastoral roots definitely make them immediate favourites,” Shivani says. Make Ema Datshi, the expert way  We asked experts to share their take on how to make Ema Datshi, so if haven’t tried the dish yet, here’s how you can make it, according to Ishijyot.  “Ema Datshi is all about balance—balancing the heat of the chilies with the creaminess of the cheese,” he says. 
Use fresh green and red chilies for authentic flavour and heat.
Traditionally, yak cheese is used; but a mix of feta and mozzarella works well as a substitute in India.
Simmer the chilies with garlic, onions, and tomatoes in a little water to build a robust base.

Shivani gives us a healthier way to make the Datshi.“Our take on Ema Datshi replaces the full-fat cheese with heart-healthier vegan alternatives, and also adds mushrooms to amplify the innate umami flavour of the yak cheese (Datshi),” she says. Check out the healthier recipe: 
Melt the butter in a thick-bottomed pan and sauté the onion and peppers.
Add the chillies and garlic and sauté until fragrant.
Add the mushrooms and tomato. Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins over medium heat.

   Shivani also credits this increased demand for such cuisines to a section of Indians who are becoming more exploratory diners.  “There is a deeper understanding of and appreciation for how local cuisines are inextricably tied in to the narratives of the place and its people. Dishes such as Ema Datshi are made with local produce and can be found in nearly every home in Bhutan, the simplicity of such foods and their pastoral roots definitely make them immediate favourites,” Shivani says. Make Ema Datshi, the expert way   We asked experts to share their take on how to make Ema Datshi, so if haven’t tried the dish yet, here’s how you can make it, according to Ishijyot.   “Ema Datshi is all about balance—balancing the heat of the chilies with the creaminess of the cheese,” he says. 
Use fresh green and red chilies for authentic flavour and heat.
Traditionally, yak cheese is used; but a mix of feta and mozzarella works well as a substitute in India.
Simmer the chilies with garlic, onions, and tomatoes in a little water to build a robust base.

This buzzword has sparked a wave of obsession, prompting beauty brands to invest heavily in the trend.
How, you ask? By launching a range of collagen-based products - from supplements and protein powders to moisturisers - capturing the attention of beauty influencers everywhere.  However, unlike other trends, which come and go, collagen stayed for all the right reasons, and looks like it is here to stay.But what is collagen?  Debjani Gupta, a nutritionist and wellness expert from Mumbai, tells India Today that collagen is a vital protein that makes up about 30 per cent of the body's total protein.

 It plays a key role in supporting the skin’s elasticity, plumpness, and firmness. In our twenties and thirties, when collagen levels are higher, the skin appears firm, toned, and radiant, especially if diet and lifestyle habits are healthy.  However, as we age into our forties and fifties, collagen production declines, leading to signs of ageing like sagging skin and reduced skin tone. Functions of collagen in the body Collagen serves several vital functions in the body, such as:
Replacing dead cells: It promotes the growth of new cells.
Protecting organs: Collagen serves as a protective layer for vital organs.
Maintaining skin elasticity: It provides the skin with structure, elasticity, suppleness, and strength.
Assisting blood clotting: Collagen plays a key role in blood clotting when injuries occur.
 All these functions (especially skin elasticity) have made collagen quite popular. However, supplements, powders made out of collagen actually is pretty expensive (avg price goes Rs 2,500 for 500 gm), which has made Indians, especially, turned to “juggad” and are opting natural recipes that allegedly help in boosting collagen production in our body. The viral natural collagen  In the quest for youthful, glowing skin, the spotlight has turned to humble kitchen staples- amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple.

 Today, Skinfluencers are calling it the ""OG collagen boosters"" on social media sites like Instagram. But are these everyday fruits and veggies really capable of turning back the clock on ageing skin? We asked the experts. Breaking down the viral ingredients Amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are often known for their antioxidant and Vitamin C content. But Dr Rinky Kapoor, a consultant dermatologist and surgeon at The Esthetic Clinics, Mumbai, says, “Ingredients like amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are called natural collagen boosters because they are rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants. These nutrients help support your body to produce more collagen for better skin health.""

 



Amla is high in antioxidants. Photo: Getty Images
 However, before you start gulping down litres of juice, here’s a reality check. ""While these ingredients are healthy, they may not work as effectively as collagen supplements,"" Dr Kapoor warns.  ""Juicing them can negatively affect their fibre and nutrient properties, so it’s best to consume them raw or cooked,"" she says.  Sujit Shanshanwal, a Mumbai-based dermatologist, highlights the role of Vitamin C in this process.  ""Vitamin C plays a vital role in collagen production, but not directly. It supports the enzyme activity required for collagen synthesis and slows down collagen degradation,"" he adds. Debjani agrees. She adds that the health of the gut is directly linked to skin health and collagen production. Food (like amla, apple and beet) are rich in fibre, antioxidants, and essential vitamins (like vitamin C) promote better gut health. A healthy gut ensures much clearer and firmer skin.  So, are these the ""OG"" collagen boosters? Not quite. But they do support collagen production indirectly by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants that keep your existing collagen healthy.But If you’re picturing a bowl of carrot-beet-apple salad turning into collagen for your skin, hold that thought. Science is a little more complex. Sujit explains, ""To create collagen, your body needs amino acids like proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline, which are primarily found in animal sources like meat, fish, and eggs. For vegetarians, plant-based sources include soy products, mushrooms, cabbage, legumes, spinach, nuts, and seeds.""

 In short, you need more than just amla and beetroot to get that coveted collagen glow. ""Amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple support collagen health by providing antioxidants and Vitamin C, but they alone are not sufficient to create collagen,"" adds Sujit. The star of the collagen world is marine collagen, which comes from fish skin, bones, and scales. ""Marine collagen is considered a rich source of collagen, typically found in the form of collagen peptides or hydrolysed collagen,"" he adds.The side effects  While amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are nutrient powerhouses, experts suggest they’re not without potential side effects if consumed in excess. 
Gastric discomfort: Debjani says, if you’re not used to raw juices or high-fibre fruits, suddenly drinking a large glass of beetroot-carrot-apple juice could leave you feeling bloated. This happens because fibre needs time to adjust in your system.

Digestive sensitivity: People with sensitive digestion may experience bloating, gas, or even diarrhoea if they consume too much of these fruits or their juices. Dr Kapoor recommends starting with small portions and slowly increasing your intake.

Nutrient loss during juicing: According to Shanshanwal, juicing strips away fibre and, if heat is involved, it can also degrade Vitamin C, a key player in collagen production. So, while juice may be trendy, whole fruits and veggies are the better option for overall nutrition.
 Pro tip: If you’re juicing these ingredients, don’t throw away the pulp. Use it to make parathas, tikkis, or even smoothies to retain the fibre.Tips to produce collagen naturally in your body So, if amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple aren’t magic collagen factories, what is? Here's what experts have to say. 
Eat a collagen-friendly diet: Your body needs amino acids like proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline to produce collagen. These amino acids are abundant in animal products like meat, fish, and eggs. Vegetarians can rely on soy products, mushrooms, legumes, spinach, nuts, and seeds.
Amp up your antioxidants: Foods like amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple are rich in antioxidants, which protect your existing collagen from damage caused by free radicals (but they can’t produce collagen in your body). Think of them as a shield for your skin’s natural protein.
Get your dose of Vitamin C: No, you don’t have to chug litres of orange juice. Incorporate Vitamin C-rich foods like amla, citrus fruits, guava, and bell peppers into your daily diet. Vitamin C activates the enzymes that support collagen production.
Stay hydrated: Your skin cells are made of water, so staying hydrated keeps your skin plump and supple, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Exercise regularly: Sweat it out! Regular physical activity increases blood circulation, which promotes oxygen and nutrient delivery to the skin, boosting collagen production.
Protect your skin from UV damage: UV rays from the sun break down collagen in your skin, so wearing sunscreen is essential to maintain that youthful glow.
Consider marine collagen: If you’re open to supplements, marine collagen is a strong contender. Derived from fish, it’s often found in hydrolysed form, making it easier for your body to absorb. But, as Dr Kapoor cautions, ""Do not take collagen supplements without consulting a doctor as it may not be suitable for everyone."" Supplements should be your last resort. 
Remember  The hype around amla, beetroot, carrot, and apple as ""OG collagen boosters"" is both right and wrong. These ingredients don’t directly increase collagen production, but they support it by providing essential antioxidants, Vitamin C, and other nutrients that keep existing collagen strong. ""One should understand that no single ingredient or type of juice can help replace the need to adopt a healthy lifestyle,"" Dr Kapoor concludes.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 13, 2024

But can they truly be a game-changer in treating cracked heels and dry feet?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-viral-silicone-moisturising-socks-treat-cracked-heels-and-dry-feet-in-winter-2649006-2024-12-12,"Winter brings a host of skincare challenges, and our feet often bear the brunt of the season's harshness. Dryness and cracked heels are common issues many of us face during the colder months.
While slathering on moisturiser becomes a priority, it’s not always enough—particularly for tackling severely dry feet and cracked heels. So, what to do? The internet, meanwhile, appears to have a solution – using silicone socks. Unlike regular fabric socks, silicone socks function like a snug silicone glove for your feet. To use them, simply wash your feet thoroughly, slip on the socks, and leave them on for 15–30 minutes (or overnight). These reusable socks are easily available on platforms such as Amazon, Meesho, and Nykaa.

 



Silicone socks on sale on Amazon India.
 There is also a single-use moisturising socks variant – also widely available across online platforms. Single-use moisturising socks are infused with nourishing ingredients like shea butter and essential oils. In contrast, reusable silicone socks require you to apply your own moisturiser, balm, or serum before use. Essentially, they are designed to act as an occlusive layer, trapping moisture and enhancing the efficacy of any hydrating products. Both gel and silicone socks are expected to create a spa-like environment, promoting better hydration and healing, ultimately resulting in smoother, softer feet. Sounds great, right? But are these moisturising socks as good as they claim to be? Dermatologists want you to know a few things!Gel socks – a good addition to your winter routine According to experts, moisturising socks can be beneficial for feet during winter, but they are not a magical cure for cracked and dry feet. “Moisturising and gel socks, infused with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, or essential oils, can indeed be a valuable addition to foot care routines, especially during winter. The occlusive nature of these socks helps lock in moisture, promoting better absorption of the active ingredients. They can improve skin hydration, reduce dryness, and even help with cracked heels if used consistently,” says Dr Pratiksha Jain, associate consultant cosmetologist, SPARSH Hospital, Infantry Road, Bengaluru. “Think of them as sheet masks for your feet. These serum-soaked socks promise 20-30 minutes to baby-soft soles. But here’s the tea: they’re more like a band-aid than a cure. The star ingredient, usually butylene glycol, gives temporary hydration but doesn’t fix deep cracks,” adds Dr Geetika Srivastava, dermatologist and founder of Influennz Skin and Hair Clinic, Delhi.

 



Moisturising socks, available for purchase on Nykaa.
 We all love our sheet masks for an instant glow or as a pre-makeup ritual, right? However, the results are often quick but not long-lasting. The same applies to moisturising socks. Alternatively, you can incorporate them into an elaborate at-home pedicure session to give your feet some extra pampering.What about silicone socks? Silicone socks wherein you use your own foot cream or balm before putting these on are also dermat-approved. They can be worn for 15-20 minutes or overnight as well. “These beauties work via occlusion therapy. You slather on your favourite foot cream and wear the socks overnight. This locks in moisture and helps the cream penetrate deeper. It’s like tucking your feet into a spa cocoon while you snooze. We dermatologists love this technique for stubborn dryness,” says Dr Srivastava. For best results, use them with thick, emollient-rich foot creams containing ingredients like urea or hyaluronic acid. The prolonged contact overnight helps in repairing cracked heels and very dry skin.

 However, a few precautions should certainly be taken before using these silicone socks. “Clean and dry silicone socks properly after and before every use to prevent bacterial or fungal growth,” says Dr Jain. It is also very important to clean and dry your feet before using these socks. Wearing them for too long or without proper foot hygiene may create a moist environment, which could promote fungal infections like athlete’s foot. If you have cuts, wounds, or severe skin conditions, consult a dermatologist before using these socks.A good foot care routine Having soft and supple feet even in winter does not essentially require these gel or silicone socks. All you need is a good foot care routine. You can follow the expert-approved tips mentioned below:

Hydrate regularly: Apply a thick, emollient-rich foot cream with ingredients like urea, glycerin, or shea butter twice daily.
Exfoliate weekly: Use a gentle scrub or pumice stone to remove dead skin cells and prevent calluses.
Soak your feet: A warm foot soak with Epsom salts once a week can help soften skin and relieve dryness.
Wear socks: Opt for breathable cotton or wool socks to keep feet warm and protected.
Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from within.
Protect from cold: Avoid walking barefoot on cold floors, and moisturise immediately after bathing or washing your feet to lock in moisture.
So, are these socks a game-changer? For a quick fix, yes! But for long-term care? Stick to the classic winter foot care tips.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Should you wash your feet before going to bed? Doctors have THE answer

44925c52-5c56-496d-b596-6adf4b8baaf6,Does living together before marriage lower the chance of divorce?Thinking about marriage but unsure if you'll be able to adjust to living together? Why not try a live-in relationship first to see how things go before taking the next step?,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/does-living-together-before-marriage-lower-the-chance-of-divorce-2648781-2024-12-12,"Being with someone you love is an amazing feeling, right? But where there's love, there are bound to be disagreements. And during those moments, we sometimes say things we've been holding back, like, ""Had I known this about you, I wouldn't have married you."" The truth is, being in a relationship is different from being married and sharing a life together. With the patience levels many have these days, it's no surprise divorce rates are on the rise. But if couples lived together before marriage, would it help the relationship? Could being in a live-in arrangement first be the secret to avoiding a split later? Let's find out from experts.Giving up easily Aarti Chawla, a Mumbai-based relationship psychotherapist and life coach, tells India Today that people are giving up on marriages for a variety of reasons. Fast-paced lifestyles, lack of patience, and low tolerance are key factors. Gone are the days when lovers waited a year to meet, convinced their parents, and wrote letters to woo someone. Now, it's easier to swipe left and right. If things don't work out, people are more willing to move on. Chawla adds that it's become easier to find another 'option' when things don't work out in a relationship. Financial stress is another contributor. With both partners often working and earning, financial issues can create tension. If couples can't meet the financial goals they had when they got married, it leads to disappointment and conflicts. Meanwhile, Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, feels modern society places a high value on personal growth and happiness, which can lead people to leave relationships that feel stagnant or unfulfilling. ""Divorce is no longer seen as a taboo or social stigma, making it an easier option for people,"" she adds. Many individuals have higher or unrealistic expectations of their partners, love, and relationships, often influenced by media portrayals that clash with reality. Ruuh also mentions that there’s a growing recognition that toxic or unbalanced relationships can affect mental well-being, prompting people to prioritise their mental health.Can live-in be a saviour? ""Research shows mixed results: some studies suggest that couples who live together before marriage report higher satisfaction, understanding, and stability, while others suggest it leads to 'cohabitation inertia,' meaning couples marry out of convenience rather than compatibility,"" says Ruchi Ruuh. For her, the answer is nuanced. While living together before marriage isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, it can help partners understand each other's habits, compatibility, and ability to navigate conflicts. Aarti Chawla agrees that a live-in arrangement helps couples understand each other more deeply.

 



A live-in setup helps you understand your partner better (Photo: Pexels/Cottonbro studio)
 ""It helps them see the nuances of living together—not just as roommates, but as companions for the next 40-50 years. Mental preparedness is key. For a couple to thrive, they need to consider all areas of life, including mental wavelength, physical compatibility, basic values, and financial goals. Live-in gives them time to truly understand each other at all levels,"" she says. Living together allows couples to learn each other’s routines and habits, reducing the chances of surprises down the line. In many cases, this makes divorce less likely, as the basics are in place.The pros of a live-in relationship Living together before marriage can serve as a compatibility check. It lets you observe your partner’s behaviour in real-life situations, including finances, responsibilities, stressful life events, and decision-making. Sharing space can also improve communication and conflict-resolution skills. ""You learn to see your partner as a whole person, beyond the idealised version,"" says Ruuh, adding, ""This is invaluable to understanding their true self."" Being in a live-in relationship also allows couples to break up without the fear of family or societal pressure, which can be a relief for those wanting to make the decision on their own terms.Don't skip the downsides However, a live-in relationship has its downsides. One major con is the lack of commitment. Often, after years of living together, couples part ways because there’s no formal commitment. This arrangement gives both partners the freedom to walk away without consequences. Additionally, live-in relationships can attract judgement, especially in conservative societies and cultures. Sometimes, living together can create a false sense of commitment, even when the relationship isn't solid. If the relationship ends, untangling shared living arrangements can be emotionally and financially taxing—often as painful as a divorce.

Thinking of giving it a try? If you’re considering a live-in arrangement before tying the knot, keep a few things in mind:
Clarify your goals: Discuss what the live-in arrangement means for both of you, including long-term plans like marriage. Clear goals keep things on track.
Split expenses: Agree on how to divide rent, groceries, and utilities.
Divide household tasks: Set expectations for chores and responsibilities to avoid resentment.
Check in regularly: Have regular conversations to ensure you're both satisfied with the arrangement.
Plan for the worst: Be clear about what will happen if the relationship doesn't work out, making any potential transition smoother.
Respect personal space: Living together doesn't mean you have to spend every moment together. Make sure you both have time for personal interests and friends.
Set financial expectations: List out your financial goals and expectations ahead of time.
Discuss non-negotiables: Be upfront about what’s acceptable and what isn’t in the relationship.
 If done thoughtfully, a live-in relationship can give you a better sense of whether marriage is the right step for you and your partner.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 12, 2024ALSO READ |  Move over grand gestures, micro-mance your way to loveTrending Reel

Here's how to deal with airplane ear If you feel a strange sensation in your ear as soon as your flight takes off, you might be dealing with airplane ear. While it can be uncomfortable, it can be relieved with some simple tricks.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/no-more-ear-ritation-heres-how-to-deal-with-airplane-ear-2648173-2024-12-11,"Does the excitement of your much-awaited trip suddenly fade the moment your flight takes off, thanks to a sharp, annoying pain in your ears? And worse, it doesn't just disappear mid-flight—it lingers even after you land. Even if you haven't experienced this yourself, chances are you know someone who can't stop complaining about the discomfort during their flight. This issue is real, and it can be more than just the constant popping of ears—airplane ear can be downright painful.So, why does it happen? ""Airplane ear, also called barotrauma, occurs when the pressure in the middle ear doesn't equalise with the air pressure outside. This may cause ear pain, uneasiness, and even lead to hearing impairment,"" Dr Girish Anand MS, consultant - ENT surgery, Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, tells India Today. The doctor explains that as an airplane takes off or lands, the air pressure in the cabin changes. He states, ""Normally, the Eustachian tube, a small canal connecting the middle ear to the back of the nasal cavity, equalises the pressure. However, sometimes, this tube can get blocked, preventing pressure equalisation."" To this, Dr Amitabh Malik, chief and HOD, department of ENT, Paras Health, Gurugram, adds that factors like sinus congestion, colds, or allergies can also affect the function of the Eustachian tube, making it more difficult for the ear to adjust to changes in pressure.It's quite common As per Dr Malik, airplane ear is a common phenomenon, particularly during flights. ""Almost everyone experiences some level of ear discomfort when flying, but some are more susceptible. People with sinus issues, colds, nasal congestion, or allergies are at higher risk because these conditions can interfere with the Eustachian tube's function,"" the doctor says. Additionally, infants and young children are more likely to struggle with airplane ear because their Eustachian tubes are smaller and may not work as effectively. Those with a history of ear infections or certain anatomical issues may also experience more severe symptoms.

 



You're not alone in dealing with airplane ear (Photo: Getty Images)
Know the symptoms Dr Manjunath MK, senior consultant - ENT surgeon, Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, mentions that the most common symptom of airplane ear is a feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear. One may also experience ringing in the ears or temporary hearing loss. In more severe cases, it can lead to ear pain, and rarely, there may be a perforation of the eardrum.Save your ears
To help prevent or relieve the discomfort of airplane ear, try yawning or swallowing frequently, as this helps open the Eustachian tubes and equalise pressure.
Chewing gum or sucking on candy can encourage swallowing, which also balances pressure in the ear.
If you're dealing with sinus congestion or a cold, using a decongestant or nasal spray before your flight may reduce the risk of discomfort.
Valsalva maneuver, gently blowing your nose with your mouth closed, can also help open the Eustachian tubes.
It's best to avoid flying when you're sick, especially if you have a cold, allergies, or sinus infections, and if possible, delay your trip until you're symptom-free.
During the flight, try not to sleep during take-off or landing, as staying alert can help you manage pressure changes.
Keep chewing gum or munching sugar candies to encourage swallowing. You can also gently pop your ears by blowing your nose while pinching your nostrils closed.
When to seek professional help? According to the experts, in most cases, airplane ear resolves on its own after the flight without the need for medical treatment. However, if the symptoms persist, worsen, or cause significant discomfort, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional. If there is an infection or a ruptured eardrum, medical treatment such as antibiotics, pain relief, or ear drops may be required. In extreme cases, a doctor may recommend a procedure to help equalise the pressure in the ear.

 



Don't shy away from seeking help (Photo: Getty Images)
Now, before you check-in... You can easily avoid airplane ear by keeping a few simple tips in mind. Stay well-hydrated throughout your flight and steer clear of alcohol and caffeine. A helpful trick is sipping hot water during the journey to soothe your ears. And don’t forget to pack some chewing gum in your carry-on, it’s a handy way to help manage pressure changes.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 11, 2024ALSO READ |  Unpacking your bags after a vacation is tough.

In fact, even in India, where winter often marks the season of festivities and weddings, many of us also feel our mental well-being taking a hit. As this season approaches, our couch becomes our best friend, and leaving it - or even our bed - starts to feel like a monumental task. More often than not, all we want to do is lie around with our thoughts. Urban slang even has a name for it - seasonal depression - which hits us as sharply as the cold breeze that accompanies winter. But is “wintertime sadness”, aka ""winter depression"", actually real? Or is it just the weather messing with us? A quick scroll through Reddit or Quora reveals that plenty of people are asking the same thing — why does the mood shift as the sun sets or the seasons change?

Is mental health related to season change? Jasreen Birgi, counselling psychologist at Lissun, a digital mental health platform Delhi NCR, explains that winters in India are months of several festivities, but they are also filled with gloom and melancholy due to the chilling winds and shorter days.  She highlights that Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of sadness more prevalent in specific seasons, typically autumn and winter. It’s commonly referred to as ""winter depression,"" she says.   Dr Shilpi Saraswat, clinical psychologist at Sakra World Hospital, Bengaluru, agrees and tells India Today that, “SAD, is a recognised mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide.”  She adds that, like most depressive disorders, it ""affects mood, energy levels, sleep patterns, and appetite,"" and its symptoms include persistent feelings of sadness, low energy, and changes in sleep and eating habits.

 



A query on Quora. Photo: Quora
 Dr Arvind Otta, senior psychologist and mental health activist, further points out that it ""follows a seasonal pattern and typically worsens during autumn and winter months when daylight hours are shorter.”  He explains that ""the biological basis of SAD involves disruptions to circadian rhythms and changes in neurotransmitter levels, especially serotonin and melatonin.”Does science also agree? Experts unanimously agree that the link between weather and mood is undeniable. Birgi explains that reduced exposure to sunlight causes changes in brain chemistry, and this reduction ""triggers an increase in anxiety symptoms throughout the winter.”  According to Birgi, the decrease in sunlight affects our circadian rhythm and, in turn, impacts our sleep-wake cycles, increasing feelings of sluggishness and low energy.  “People also avoid going outside due to the cold weather, further limiting their exposure to natural light and physical activity, both of which are vital for mental health,” she says.

— NHS London (@NHSEnglandLDN) December 9, 2024 Dr Otta points to the role of sunlight in regulating serotonin levels, stating that people with SAD have increased serotonin transporter proteins during winter, leading to lower serotonin availability. He also notes the influence of atmospheric pressure changes, stating that gloomy weather characterised by overcast skies is associated with low serotonin levels, leading to feelings of depression or low mood. However, note that there aren't enough studies done on this area, so more studies are required to understand the illness better. How to deal with it? If the cold weather’s got you feeling blue, here’s what experts have to say on how to manage it. Increase exposure to natural light Mehezabin Dordi, a clinical psychologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, recommends spending time outside during daylight hours, even if it’s cloudy. She says natural light exposure can improve symptoms.   You can also keep curtains and blinds open to let in as much natural light as possible. Rearrange furniture to sit near windows.advertisementStay physically active
Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, increases serotonin levels, which help regulate mood.
If the weather permits, outdoor exercise combines physical activity with exposure to sunlight.
Maintain a healthy routine
Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Avoid oversleeping, as it can worsen symptoms.
Dr Otta suggests that healthy eating not only makes for a healthy weight but also balanced moods. “Omega-3 fatty acids, fruits and vegetables are, to some extent, good for the brain and quite very important with respect to one’s overall well-being. Prepare a menu for the winter so as not to get caught up by events,” he says. 
Be socially active 
Spend time with family and friends to avoid isolation, which can worsen depression. Experts like Dr Otta call it “talk therapy”.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT and other counselling therapies can support one in times of despair and provide strategies for coping. 
“Through this, you can learn to identify their negative thought patterns and ways to change the thinking for healthy counterparts, which seems very appropriate in cases of seasonal depression,” he says. 
Remember, sometimes, just discussing your feelings can make a big difference.
Meditate
Mindfulness practices like meditation can help you stay present and reduce feelings of hopelessness.
Try aromatherapy (avoid scented candles, though) with certain essential oils, like citrus and lavender, which may have mood-boosting effects.
However, if symptoms persist or significantly affect daily life, it’s important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can create a personalised treatment plan tailored to your needs.BottomlineWhether it’s cosy winters, wedding festivities, or grand celebrations, understanding your mental health triggers can help you stay balanced.

It is believed that urinating after sex is not merely a good hygiene practice but also keeps issues like UTI (urinary tract infection) and other infections away, especially among women.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-peeing-after-sex-really-prevent-uti-2647827-2024-12-10,"When Tanya, a 30-year-old writer from Delhi, got married, her mother shared a vital sexual wellness tip: always remember to pee after sex. “It will keep most infections away,” she told her. Sexual health is an essential part of overall well-being, and it comes with the responsibility of maintaining good hygiene to prevent infections. Among the many tips often recommended, one of the simplest (and most popular) is urinating after sexual intercourse. It is believed that doing so is not merely a good hygiene practice but also keeps issues like UTI (urinary tract infection) and other infections away – especially among women. UTIs are a common concern for sexually active women. Why? Well, Dr Vaishali Joshi, senior obstetrician and gynaecologist at Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, points out, ""Women are more prone to UTIs than men due to the proximity of their urinary and genital systems."" “After first intercourse, some women may develop a UTI. This is not uncommon and can occur due to bacteria entering the urinary tract during sexual activity. Common symptoms include burning during urination, frequent urination, or pain in the lower abdomen,” adds Dr Joshi.

But how important is this habit of peeing after intercourse, and does it truly help in preventing infections? We asked experts.Does peeing after sex matter?Dr Geeta Shroff, director of NuBella Centre for Women’s Health, emphasises that urination after intercourse is vital. But how important is this habit of peeing after intercourse, and does it truly help in preventing infections? We asked experts.Does peeing after sex matter? Dr Geeta Shroff, director of NuBella Centre for Women’s Health, emphasises that urination after intercourse is vital. “Peeing after sex can help prevent a urinary tract infection or even other infections, especially in females. During sexual intercourse, bacteria from the genital or anal areas can find their way into the urethra. Urinating after sexual intercourse ensures that these bacteria are expelled before they cause an infection,” Dr Shroff adds. Dr Kanika Jain, vice president of the Association of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Delhi (AOGD), professor and senior consultant, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, further explains, ""Sexual activity can introduce bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), into the urethra. Peeing afterward flushes these out before they ascend to the bladder, lowering the risk of infection."" It is recommended to urinate within 15–30 minutes of intercourse to flush out bacteria. “The first step is to drink plenty of water to help flush out the infection. If symptoms persist, antibiotics may be required to clear it. Prompt treatment is essential, as untreated UTIs can worsen, but they are generally not serious if addressed in time,” adds Dr Joshi.

 



Experts say peeing after sex does not ensure 100 per cent prevention but a reduced risk of getting a UTI. (Photo: Getty)
 Experts, however, add that peeing after sex does not ensure 100 per cent protection but certainly reduces the chances of getting a UTI. While not a foolproof method, it is an effective and simple precautionary measure for urinary health. Hydration also plays a key role here. “Drink enough water to enable you to urinate after sex,” says Dr Shroff. It is important to note while urinating after intercourse can help prevent a urinary infection, it plays no role in preventing STIs or vaginal infection. “Peeing specifically helps prevent UTIs but has no significant impact on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or vaginal infections,” says Dr Jain.Good hygiene tips to follow after intercourse Practising good post-sex hygiene can significantly reduce the risk of UTIs and other infections. It is important to use protection, avoid douching, and maintain overall genital and perineal hygiene. You may feel exhausted or not want to step out of bed and sleep right away, but getting up to pee, changing clothes, and gently cleansing your genitals can go a long way in keeping infections at bay. Here are some more expert-recommended tips:
advertisementGentle cleansing: Dr Shroff advises washing the genital area with warm water. Avoid harsh or scented soaps, which can disrupt the natural pH balance.
Change clothes: Avoid wearing tight clothes or non-breathable fabrics post-sex. Tight or damp clothing can encourage bacterial growth. Opt for loose-fitting, breathable cotton underwear to keep the area dry and fresh.
Wash your hands: Dr Joshi stresses the importance of clean hands before and after intercourse to prevent the transfer of germs.
Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water ensures regular urination, naturally flushing bacteria from the urinary tract.
Practise safe sex: Using condoms helps prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Monitor symptoms: If you notice signs of irritation, pain, or unusual discharge, seek a doctor. ""Ignoring symptoms can worsen infections, requiring more intensive treatment,"" warns Dr Joshi.
Wear breathable underwear: Choose cotton fabrics to prevent moisture build-up, which can encourage bacterial growth.
Clean sex toys: The sex toy culture is rising in India, with these products being just a BlinkIt away. While they are sure to make things exciting for you in the bedroom, cleaning them properly is essential to keep infections at bay. Doctors suggest washing toys with warm water and an appropriate cleanser after use to prevent bacterial transfer.
When to see a doctorRecurrent UTIs—defined as more than two to three infections within six months—may require specialist intervention.In the case of repeated UTIs, “routine tests performed are urine microscopic examination and urine culture and sensitivity. This will pick up the type of bacteria causing UTI and the effective antibiotics to clear the infection. The sonography of the kidney and bladder may be needed to look for after-effects of UTI,” shares Dr Joshi.Lastly...While peeing after sex is not a guarantee against UTIs or other infections, it is a simple and highly recommended practice to reduce risk. Combined with good hygiene habits and adequate hydration, it supports overall sexual and urinary health. As Dr Shroff puts it, ""It’s a small habit, but one that can make a big difference in your health and comfort.""Signs of suggestive infection, like burning while passing urine or frequent urination or pain in the lower part of the tummy, first thing, drink a lot of water, which helps to flush out the infection.

72ca3196-3bc0-42a6-9c8e-a9f8ad3a228e,"How long can you wear makeup without risking skin damage?Who doesn't love showing off flawless skin? While makeup can definitely help you achieve that perfect look, how long should you actually keep these products on?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/beauty/story/how-long-can-you-wear-makeup-without-risking-skin-damage-2647586-2024-12-10,"You might be the 'just a little blush, and I'm good to go' type, or perhaps you're all about that full-glam look—but one thing is for sure: makeup is a crucial part of our daily routine. And now, with men also embracing cosmetics to enhance their appearance, makeup has become even more universal. But here's the thing: as important as applying makeup is, removing it properly is even more crucial. We all know the cardinal rule—never go to bed with makeup on—but do you know how long you can actually wear makeup before it starts taking a toll on your skin?Bidding adieu is crucial Removing makeup well is important to allow your skin to breathe, repair, and regenerate. Dr Vidushi Jain, dermatologist and medical head at Dermalinks, NCR, tells India Today that if makeup is not removed properly, it clogs pores, disrupts the skin's natural barrier, and increases the risk of breakouts and premature ageing. To this, Dr Shifa Yadav, consultant - dermatology and cosmetology at Artemis Hospitals, Gurugram, adds that makeup residue can irritate the skin, causing redness, dryness, and other skin problems. Not only that, but long-term exposure to makeup residue can lead to skin discolouration and hyperpigmentation. It can also hinder the absorption of skincare products, as clean skin absorbs them more effectively, maximising their benefits.For how long should you wear makeup? According to Dr Jain, ideally, makeup should only be used for 8-12 hours at most. She mentions that wearing makeup for long periods can cause the products to settle into the skin and lead to issues, especially if they are non-comedogenic. On the other hand, Dr Yadav states that there's no definitive answer, as it depends on various factors like skin type, product quality, and individual sensitivity. ""However, it's generally recommended to limit makeup wear to a maximum of 10-12 hours per day,"" she adds. As per Dr Yadav, wearing makeup for too long can have the same impact on the skin as leaving residue—clogging pores, skin irritation, premature ageing, and drying out the skin. While makeup creates a protective layer on the skin, it can also disrupt its natural oil balance.

 Meanwhile, Dr Shireen Furtado, senior consultant - medical and cosmetic dermatology at Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, states that it is advisable to limit the application of makeup to a period that allows the skin to breathe and recover. It is often recommended that one should pay attention to their skin's response to prolonged makeup wear. Dr Furtado further tells us that wearing makeup can also have a positive impact. ""It can enhance the appearance of the skin by providing coverage for imperfections, evening out skin tone, and adding a healthy glow. Many formulations contain beneficial ingredients that can hydrate and protect the skin, contributing to a more polished look,"" she says. However, prolonged wear of products that contain harmful chemicals can compromise skin health.Reversing skin troubles To reverse the skin issues caused by wearing makeup for too long, you must detox your skin with a skincare routine that includes double cleansing, exfoliation, hydration, and nourishing serums that contain antioxidants, niacinamide, or hyaluronic acid for healing and rebalancing the skin. Focusing on makeup removal is very important. Make sure to follow a thorough cleansing routine so that no residue is left behind. Apart from this, you also need to focus on what you put in your body, as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and water can help improve skin health. However, if you have severe skin issues, consult a dermatologist for professional advice.

 



Make sure to thoroughly clean your skin after wearing makeup for an extended period (Photo: Getty Images)
Before long hours of makeup wear... Those who apply makeup for extended periods should make certain changes to their skincare regimen to maintain skin health and prevent potential damage. Remember to always use products that are non-comedogenic and do not strip the skin of its natural oils. Additionally, the inclusion of a broad-spectrum sunscreen is crucial, as it protects the skin from harmful UV rays, especially when makeup is worn throughout the day. The way you prep your skin before putting on makeup makes a big difference. Taking a break is vital. Try to minimise makeup wear, especially on days when you're not going out. Lastly, don't forget to include exfoliation and masking once a week.Published By: Mehak MalhotraPublished On: Dec 10, 2024ALSO READ |  Essential oils are Shraddha Kapoor's beauty secret.

US tech millionaire Bryan Johnson thinks so.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-you-live-forever-like-bryan-johnson-wants-to-2647404-2024-12-10,"Who doesn’t want to live forever? The idea of living a long, healthy life appeals to almost everyone. The quest for immortality has fascinated humans for centuries, serving as a central theme in numerous Bollywood and Hollywood films. But one man is taking this dream seriously—Bryan Johnson, a millionaire from the US, is actively trying to reverse his biological age and achieve what many fictional characters have only dreamed of: living forever. In fact, he believes it’s possible. Bryan even shares his daily routine on his website, offering people the chance to “subscribe” to his “Blueprint” if they want to follow in his footsteps. But is it really possible to extend your lifespan or, better yet, live forever? What do experts have to say about Bryan's lifestyle? And could you apply his routine to your own life? Before diving into these questions, let’s explore exactly what Bryan Johnson is doing in his pursuit of immortality. Bryan Johnson’s blueprint In 2013, after selling his company to eBay’s PayPal for $800 million, Bryan had plenty of options on how to spend his fortune. He could have travelled the world, bought a mansion, and lived a life of luxury. But instead, he decided to dedicate his life to chasing immortality — a quest that has earned him significant attention, especially after making headlines with his ""Project Blueprint"", a protocol-based lifestyle designed to help people live longer. The Blueprint, which is available for free, outlines Bryan's daily routine and how it has allegedly helped him achieve the biological age of an 18-year-old. For context, biological age refers to how old your cells are, and some experts consider it a more accurate measure of ageing than chronological age.

His daily routine includes light therapy, and taking 111 supplements, including the widely discussed 'Rapamycin' (he paused taking it after a few years). Good sleep and daily workouts are also a few key aspects of Bryan’s lifestyle. He consumes precisely 1,977 calories a day and eats 70 pounds of vegetables per month. His breakfast consists of a standard mix of broccoli, cauliflower, black lentils, mushrooms, garlic, and ginger. His next meal is ""nutty pudding"" with nuts and berries, and his final meal includes vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, 15 grams of 100% dark chocolate, and 30 millilitres of extra virgin olive oil.He also allows himself 'three' ounces of wine to end his day.Managing stress is vital for him, and he claims it plays a key role in living longer.PS: Although Bryan's Blueprint is technically free to access, he also sells products like protein powder and (soon-to-be-released) sunscreen under the guise of promoting health and longevity.What has Bryan achieved so far?advertisementBryan claims his lifestyle has helped him reverse his biological age by over 5 years, and his blood transfusion has helped his father do the same.

Here's what they had to say about its key components. 1. Working outBryan prioritises workouts, recommending three days of strength training and three days of cardio each week. Dr Aijaaz Ashai, a physiotherapist and celebrity fitness expert, supports this, stating that exercise can delay age-related diseases, preserve mobility, and enhance mental sharpness.On a cellular level, regular exercise helps maintain the length of telomeres—protective caps on DNA—which slow down the ageing process. ""While no one lives forever, a regular exercise routine can certainly add to your lifespan and improve the quality of your remaining years,” says Dr Ashai.2. Mental healthadvertisementAccording to Bryan’s Blueprint, if you buy his products — especially his “Best-selling longevity kit” with 70+ health actives — you’ll be able to manage daily challenges “with ease as stress-reducing ingredients promote calm and balanced emotions”.While managing stress is undoubtedly a priority for Bryan, can it help you live forever? According to mental health expert Shreya Kaul, the answer is a firm no.“Our bodies naturally start to deteriorate after a certain point. Our cells, organs, and genetics all begin to disintegrate. No living being is truly immortal,” she says.However, she does agree that managing stress is essential for leading a better, healthier life. She highlights that mental and physical health are deeply connected, with better mental health leading to improved immunity, energy, and agility.3. Clean diet and supplementsOne of the biggest pillars of Bryan’s Blueprint is his ultra-clean diet and daily consumption of 111 supplements. While research does show that healthy eating can reduce the risk of premature death by nearly 20%, it’s unlikely to guarantee immortality.Dr Nivedita Pandey, a senior gastroenterologist and director of Dr Good Deed Clinic, Patna, agrees. She highlights that free radicals (unstable molecules generated during digestion) damage our organs, leading to ageing. Eating natural, whole foods can help reduce free radicals, promoting longer and healthier lives.

Dr Aijaaz Ashai, a physiotherapist and celebrity fitness expert, supports this, stating that exercise can delay age-related diseases, preserve mobility, and enhance mental sharpness. On a cellular level, regular exercise helps maintain the length of telomeres—protective caps on DNA—which slow down the ageing process. ""While no one lives forever, a regular exercise routine can certainly add to your lifespan and improve the quality of your remaining years,” says Dr Ashai.2. Mental health According to Bryan’s Blueprint, if you buy his products — especially his “Best-selling longevity kit” with 70+ health actives — you’ll be able to manage daily challenges “with ease as stress-reducing ingredients promote calm and balanced emotions”. While managing stress is undoubtedly a priority for Bryan, can it help you live forever? According to mental health expert Shreya Kaul, the answer is a firm no. “Our bodies naturally start to deteriorate after a certain point. Our cells, organs, and genetics all begin to disintegrate. No living being is truly immortal,” she says. However, she does agree that managing stress is essential for leading a better, healthier life. She highlights that mental and physical health are deeply connected, with better mental health leading to improved immunity, energy, and agility.3. Clean diet and supplements One of the biggest pillars of Bryan’s Blueprint is his ultra-clean diet and daily consumption of 111 supplements. While research does show that healthy eating can reduce the risk of premature death by nearly 20%, it’s unlikely to guarantee immortality. Dr Nivedita Pandey, a senior gastroenterologist and director of Dr Good Deed Clinic, Patna, agrees. She highlights that free radicals (unstable molecules generated during digestion) damage our organs, leading to ageing. Eating natural, whole foods can help reduce free radicals, promoting longer and healthier lives.

 Now let's talk about supplements. When it comes to supplements, dietician Sohom Singh Roy, Redcliffe Labs, says they can bridge nutrient gaps in our diet. Targeted supplements can support immunity, brain function, and overall health. However, Kumaar Bagrodia, a neuroscientist from Mumbai and founder of various companies like HALE, NeuroLeap, Arkni and PhotoBioLife, tells us, not all supplements have enough scientific evidence as to their benefits. He notes that while calcium, iron, Vitamin D, folic acid, and omega-3 have strong evidence supporting their benefits, supplements alone can never replace a balanced diet.4. Sleep, sleep, sleep Bryan treats sleep as a non-negotiable part of his day. Experts agree. Kumaar calls it the ""golden hour"" for mental health, as it helps with memory consolidation, emotional processing, and tissue repair.

 “Sleep is crucial for mood regulation. It reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression and promotes emotional balance. It also supports biological well-being by enhancing energy levels and strengthening immunity,” he says. 5. Light therapy Bryan’s routine also includes light therapy - a growing trend, with even celebrities like Kim Kardashian adopting it.

 Kumaar explains that light of specific wavelengths can stimulate, heal, and regenerate cells and tissues. ""It naturally improves cellular mitochondria function. The therapy is non-invasive and promotes cellular repair, similar to how sunlight influences vitamin D synthesis,"" he says.The final breath: Can you live forever? After speaking with various experts, one thing becomes clear - biological immortality is still a fantasy. While Bryan’s lifestyle may help him maintain youthful biomarkers, there’s no scientific evidence that it will prevent death. ""Biologically, the human body is subject to the processes of ageing and senescence,"" says Kumaar. ""Cells accumulate damage over time due to oxidative stress, DNA mutations, and telomere shortening. Despite advances in regenerative medicine and anti-ageing therapies, these natural constraints make true immortality unlikely,"" he adds. Shreya also points out that discussions on health and longevity are often rooted in privilege. ""Bryan Johnson's 'Don't die' movement is great. Everyone wants to live longer and healthier, so why not? But not everyone has the luxury of prioritising longevity,” she explains. ""For people struggling to survive day to day, thoughts like 'This is killing me faster' don't even cross their minds. Their main concern is, 'How will I get food on the table tomorrow?,"" Shreya adds.  While Bryan Johnson's efforts are admirable, the idea of living forever remains a distant dream. For now, the best we can do is strive for a healthier, longer, and more meaningful life, so think twice before investing in someone's blueprint of living forever.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 10, 2024Must Watch

The alarm rings, but you're so cosy under your layers of blankets that the snooze button is just too tempting. You give in and drift back into sweet sleep, only to be awakened by the alarm again a few minutes later. You may hit snooze once more, but eventually, you know it's time to muster the courage to face the bone-chilling cold. As you prepare for the day, you begin the usual routine - brushing your teeth, enjoying a hot shower, and finally gearing up to pick your OOTD. You want something that keeps you warm while also checking the style box. Sounds like a daily sartorial conundrum? You're not alone. But here's the good news—we have a suggestion: befriend a few turtlenecks.

 Warm and cosy, turtlenecks are a basic winter staple, but when styled well, they can be the secret to a fabulous winter wardrobe. On mornings when you're running late and don't want to spend hours deciding what to wear, turtlenecks come in handy. Pair one with a pair of jeans, and you're good to go! If it’s too cold, layer up with a faux-leather jacket or an overcoat, and you’re all set. For party nights when you want to slay without freezing, pair your turtleneck with a leather skirt and boots. It’s as simple as that! Stylists highly recommend including turtlenecks, even when building a minimalist winter capsule wardrobe. Think of it as the white T-shirt of your summer wardrobe. From beach outings to workdays and brunch dates, your favourite white T-shirt works for almost any occasion, right? A turtleneck serves the same purpose during winter. And let’s not forget how it keeps your neck warm, protecting it from the winter chill. Its versatility is its biggest strength! It goes well with just about anything. You can wear it on its own or layer it with an open jacket or a cosy cardigan. No surprises here that celebrity winter looks are incomplete without a few iconic turtleneck moments every year!
This winter, it has already begun! Priyanka Chopra recently flaunted an ivory turtleneck that she teamed with matching trousers and a black jacket with faux fur accents. So luxe!

 Priyanka has had several stunning turtleneck moments in the last few years! She often throws over long overcoats. Deepika Padukone is the quintessential poster girl for turtleneck sweaters. Whenever the temperatures dip in Mumbai, she turns to her trusted turtlenecks – especially for her airport looks.

 Some pro tips:
Invest in basic turtlenecks like black, beige, fawn, and maroon first.
To give a glam makeover to a turtleneck, add a statement piece – it can be a skirt, a stunning jacket, or a quirky jewellery piece.
Turn to vibrant or multi-coloured turtlenecks to make winter fashion look edgy.
Pair an oversized turtleneck with your favourite jeans and sneakers for a relaxed look.
Layer a neutral-coloured turtleneck under a tailored blazer or a coat to ace the ‘office chic’ vibe.
A black or metallic turtleneck paired with a leather skirt and knee-high boots is the ultimate party combo.
To keep it sporty and athleisure, style a loose turtleneck with tights and chunky sneakers.

20f0639d-7181-4151-935c-51c36a740dcb,"Why solo trips are essential, even when you have a partner or kidsTravelling solo might seem odd when you have a partner, but it offers unique benefits that strengthen both your relationship and personal growth.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/why-solo-trips-are-essential-even-when-you-have-a-partner-or-kids-2646687-2024-12-08,"Happily married with two kids and always vacationing as a family. Does this sound like your story? Then keep reading. You’ve probably heard people say, “It was so much fun when I was single, but things have changed now that I’m married and have kids.”  For many, once a relationship deepens or a family grows, self-care quietly takes a backseat. Prioritising others' needs and happiness often becomes the default - even if it means sacrificing something that once brought you immense joy. Solo travel is often one of the first casualties. Society doesn’t make it any easier. The moment you mention travelling alone post-marriage or post-kids, the raised eyebrows and unsolicited comments begin. “How can you enjoy yourself alone?” or “Won’t you feel guilty leaving your kids behind?” These are just a couple of the judgemental remarks people endure. But pause for a moment and think: Are you holding yourself back because of societal expectations or fear of how your family might cope without you? If so, it’s time you needed some changes. Suppressing your passion - especially something as fulfilling as solo travel - does no good. Neglecting what you love only takes a toll on your mental well-being, and in the long run, this can affect your relationships too.
 


Why is it important to travel solo?An Indian household typical when a girl just randomly asks her parents – can I visit Goa with my college friends, please? Or let’s say she asks – I am going on a solo trip to Himachal Pradesh. Could you lend me some money? The cliché response would be – shaadi ke baad jahaan jana hai jao, not before!And then, after some years, when that girl finally gets married – she has a so-called “permanent travelling partner” for life. So, when is it her time to go and explore the world solo? More than men, it’s women who often have to give up on their aspirations and hobbies. However, irrespective of your relationship status, gender, or profession, everyone should travel solo, and experts highly recommend it.Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai, tells India Today, that travelling solo allows people to explore their preferences, dislikes, goals, and visions for life. It cultivates a sense of autonomy and freedom that is crucial for personal growth.“In the Indian context, where societal norms often emphasise the collective ‘we’ system, marriage or relationships are frequently associated with a sense of responsibility. A solo trip, therefore, becomes a form of self-care, helping you nurture your individuality while still existing as a partner to someone else,” she adds.

Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship counsellor, says, that in relationships, solo travelling helps maintain a sense of self that is often crucial for a healthy dynamic.“Healthy relationships are built on a concept called differentiation, which simply means that you celebrate being individuals while coming together to be a couple.

98ae2a9c-b5a7-4bb0-a779-8f1a0515a3e2,Pilates vs weight training: Which one helps you lose weight faster?Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century during World War I as a method to rehabilitate injured soldiers and dancers. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/pilates-vs-weight-training-which-one-helps-you-lose-weight-faster-2646112-2024-12-07,"If there’s one thing Bollywood icons like Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, and Janhvi Kapoor all have in common in their fitness routines, it isn’t a magical elixir for their youth and glamour - it’s their dedication to Pilates. In the past few years, Pilates has become quite the buzzword in the fitness industry. Though in India, it is gaining prominence now, Bollywood celebs have been obsessed with pilates for some time now.  But if you’re not aware, let us give you a crash course. What exactly is Pilates? Pilates is a form of low-impact exercise that focusses on strengthening muscles and improving flexibility, balance, and posture.  “The practice emphasises controlled movements, core strength, and proper alignment,” says Dr Vipul Lunawat, a fitness expert and the founder-director of the Institute of Sports Science and Technology of Pune.

 Dr Lunawat says that there are a few core principles of Pilates, like:
1. Concentration: Mindful engagement with each movement.
2. Control: Precision and mastery of your body’s movements.
3. Centering: Focus on your core, often referred to as the ""powerhouse"".
4. Flow: Smooth, continuous movements.
5. Precision: Attention to detail in form and technique.
6. Breathing: Proper breath control to enhance movement and relaxation.From World War I to celeb favorite Meenal Pathak, tells India Today that Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century during World War I as a method to rehabilitate injured soldiers and dancers.

 “Today, it has become particularly relevant because of our sedentary lifestyles, poor posture, and long sitting hours, which often lead to issues like wrist pain, shoulder pain, and joint discomfort,” says Meenal.  According to her, Pilates is highly effective (for both men and women) for addressing these problems as it, focuses on improving mobility and flexibility, alongside other benefits. It works wonders for posture, core strength, and spinal health. Pilates is all about strengthening, lengthening, and protecting your spine, which makes it an excellent choice. Now, there are two ways of doing Pilates: mat Pilates (which is done with very minimal or no equipment) and the more famous and preferred one by celebs is the other type - which uses a machine called reformer.

 This reformer Pilates has not only made quite a buzz on social media, as they are preferred by not only Bollywood celebs but by also influencers.  According to Meenal, “Mat Pilates is a fantastic way to start. It allows you to build strength and learn proper alignment without any tools. Small props like resistance bands can enhance the workout, but they’re not essential.” For those who want more variety, reformer Pilates uses machines with springs and straps to add resistance. Abhishek Bhadauria, Head Coach at MultiFit, notes, “The essence of Pilates lies in core engagement, and that can be achieved with or without equipment.”Weight training and Pilates: which can help you lose weight faster? Now, the question of the hour is, if you are trying to lose weight, which one can help to reach the goal faster, and which one should you prefer? We spoke to experts, and let’s have a look at both of them in depth.   1. Calorie burn
advertisementWeight training: A single high-intensity session burns more calories than Pilates and induces the afterburn effect (EPOC), where the body continues to burn calories post-workout.
Pilates: While it generally burns fewer calories, advanced Pilates sessions incorporating faster transitions or reformer machines can boost calorie expenditure.
2. Muscle building and metabolism
Weight training: Builds lean muscle, increasing resting metabolic rate (RMR) for long-term calorie burn.
Pilates: Tones muscles and enhances functional strength, but its impact on RMR is less significant.
Abhishek says, “Pilates excels in improving flexibility, balance, and core strength, making it an excellent choice for those seeking low-impact exercise or rehabilitation. Weight training, on the other hand, is ideal for building muscle mass and boosting metabolism. Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual goals and preferences.”3. Functional benefits
Pilates: Excels in flexibility, balance, and posture, reducing injury risk. As Dr Lunawat, explains, “Pilates is crucial for mobility and flexibility, which are often overlooked in traditional strength training but are vital for long-term health and injury prevention.”
Weight training: Improves bone density and overall strength, which is essential for physical resilience and metabolism.
Finally, as Jashan Bhumkar, fitness enthusiast, notes, “Both have their merits, but if Pilates motivates you to stay active, it’s just as effective in the long term.”advertisementWhich is faster for weight loss?In simple terms, weight training has the edge for rapid weight loss, largely due to its calorie-burning potential and metabolic benefits. A 2019 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that resistance training significantly improves body composition by reducing fat while preserving lean muscle.Dr Lunawat adds, “A combination of weight training and a calorie-controlled diet is ideal for quicker results. But Pilates can play a complementary role, improving mobility and aiding recovery.”Meenal says, “If your goal is to lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit. Pilates tones and builds functional strength, but adding weight training will help preserve muscle mass.”Why not combine the two?For maximum benefits, a balanced routine combining Pilates and weight training is ideal.

Rida, a content creator based in Bengaluru, currently has over a million followers on Instagram. However, she admits in her video that she hadn’t expected her vision board to become a reality. From spending more time with her friends and family to going on international solo trips and even buying an expensive piece of jewellery, Rida claims her vision board turned into reality.

But Rida is not alone. A quick search on the Internet today will reveal hundreds, uhm perhaps thousands, of influencers sharing videos on vision boards and how ""it has actually worked for them."" Vision boards have become the ""IT"" trend right now, and as each year comes to a close, such videos resurface in full force. From DIY vision board tutorials to ""vision board vs reality"" comparisons, and how they have ""manifested their vision board"" these videos are everywhere. But can a vision board actually help you achieve your goals for the next year, or is it just another passing trend? We asked the experts.What exactly is a vision board? If you haven’t seen the viral videos, let us tell you, a vision board is a creative visual representation of one’s goals, dreams, and aspirations. It typically takes the form of a collage made up of images, quotes, and affirmations that reflect what you aim to achieve in life. Think of it as a personal roadmap in picture form, offering a daily reminder of where you’re headed. As Aamish Dhingra, ICF-PCC certified life coach and co-founder of Cocoweave Coaching International, puts it for India Today, “Vision boards are like a compass. They provide clarity and direction but require you to take the journey.”   But can a vision board actually help you achieve your goals for the next year, or is it just another passing trend?

Absy Sam, a Mumbai-based psychologist, explains, “When we talk about the visual or the images that are created, the brain is able to process them much faster than words. This visual aid helps with clarity, memory retention, and emotional connect.” Today, vision boards are all over all the social media platforms, like YouTube, and is becoming an influencer's way of achieving goals. In fact, a lot of people (read: influencers) are hosting get-togethers so that they can make their vision boards together.

What does science have to say about vision boards? A post shared by Lisa | Toronto (@li.gorbunova)
 The effectiveness of vision boards is backed by psychology and neuroscience. The concept revolves around the brain’s Reticular Activating System (RAS), a network of neurons. Technically, it is a network of nerves in the brainstem that controls wakefulness, sleep-wake transitions, and behaviour. In simple terms, it acts as filtering out the things that are important to our brain.   Clinical psychologist Mehezabin Dordi from Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital explains, “When you visualise a goal, your brain activates neural pathways similar to when you physically work toward that goal. The RAS filters information and directs your focus toward things relevant to your goals.” She explains that if an individual has an exam and makes a vision board about it, it will help them. “Having a look at the vision board on a daily basis keeps your mind aware of your target and your brain functions in a way that syncs with your goal. For instance, if your vision board has a picture of obtaining first position in your final exam, your mind automatically starts functioning in the process of attaining those goals in the form of habits and actions and seeks out opportunities to fulfil that dream,” she says.

 Aamish elaborates, “If you repeatedly and persistently visualise your aspiration in life, your subconscious mind helps you take steps toward it by spotting opportunities or people that align with your goal.” This is why people often feel as though “luck” is on their side when, in reality, they have simply trained their minds to recognise opportunities.Benefits of making a vision board Creating a vision board can bring several emotional, mental, and practical benefits. Here’s a look at how it can make a difference (expert approved):
Clarity of goals: Vision boards make abstract desires concrete. Absy highlights that “when you use a vision board, it helps you bring all your abstract ideas into something visual and more structured.” This clarity allows for more precise goal-setting and action planning.
Motivation and inspiration: Looking at a vision board daily can be a powerful motivator. Aamish says, “The vision boards are quite motivating by giving you an imaginary perspective of success. This motivates you towards goal accomplishment to take needful actions.”
Emotional connection: The use of images and affirmations creates an emotional link with your goals. Shreans Daga, an approved life coach and spiritual teacher and chairman of Pyramid Valley International, says, “It’s not enough to think about a goal; you need to feel it with your entire being.” 
Focus and reduced distractions: Vision boards direct your mind’s focus on what matters. Absy tells India Today, “The ultimate goal of a vision board is to limit your distracted mind towards an image that has your dream encapsulated in a physical form.” This focus is essential for overcoming daily distractions and staying on track.
Increased self-belief and confidence: Visualisation strengthens positive neural pathways in the brain. Mehezabin notes that “visualizing success helps reinforce positive beliefs, boosting confidence and reducing self-doubt.”
advertisement‘Vision board alone can’t help you achieve your dreams’Experts caution that a vision board alone isn’t a magical solution. Shreans says that vision boards are not magic wands; they are tools for focus and intentionality. advertisement“The real magic happens when your thoughts, feelings, and actions align. Visualisation must be paired with action and effort for tangible results,” he says. Mehezabin agrees. She says that a vision board by itself cannot guarantee success, but it can be a valuable tool when combined with action and effort. “Creating a vision board helps clarify goals and serves as a visual reminder of what you want to achieve. It can strengthen motivation by keeping your focus on the end result, especially during challenging times,” she says.

All these have made vision boards popular amongst people, as they have a mix of both scientific and spiritual ways of achieving what you want in life, and working towards it. Social media have further amplified their appeal, with platforms showcasing creative, aesthetic and visually inspiring content that encourages people to adopt this practice. How to make your own vision boardCreating a vision board is a personal and creative process, and there’s no single right way to do it. But if vision boards still interests you, and here’s a quick step-by-step guide to get you started:
Define your goals: Start by reflecting on what you want in key areas of your life—career, relationships, health, personal growth, and finances. Think about where you want to be next year (since this trend focuses on making a new vision board every year).
Gather materials: You’ll need a board (corkboard, cardboard, or even a large piece of paper), scissors, glue, tape, and a collection of magazines, printouts, or photographs. If you prefer a digital version, there are plenty of online vision board tools and apps. But here we are talking about the offline one. 
Select images and words: Choose images, affirmations, and words that resonate with your goals. For example, if you aim to achieve fitness goals, you might add pictures of healthy food, active people, or motivational phrases that match the vibes. 
Organise and design: Arrange your images and words on the board in a way that feels right to you. You can divide it into sections for different life areas or create a free-flowing collage.
Add emotional elements: Make sure your vision board is personal to you. Include words that inspire your feelings of excitement, gratitude, or joy.
Pro tip: Place your vision board somewhere you’ll see it daily—on your bedroom wall, in your workspace, or as a screensaver on your phone.Absy Sam says that setting realistic, manageable goals on your vision board is essential to avoid disappointment. Small, actionable steps are key to maintaining motivation.“One thing that is very crucial for dream fulfilment is action. Vision boards can control your subconscious mind by aligning it with your goal, but physical action has to be done by you,” Aamish concludes.

 Are you also wondering what makes these creams trigger that warming effect on your skin? Well, menthol and capsaicin are mostly the key ingredients in this case. “Warming creams contain specific ingredients like capsicum extract, menthol, or certain essential oils that trigger a warming sensation on the skin. These components improve blood circulation in the applied area, which generates a sense of warmth,” says Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant - aesthetic physician, Gleneagles Hospital, Bengaluru. These lotions, essentially, stimulate the sensory receptors in the skin leading to the warming effect. “The active ingredients include capsaicin, menthol, or camphor. These interact with the nerve endings in the skin, creating a heat response. Capsaicin increases blood flow to the applied area, thereby producing warmth. Menthol initially causes a cooling effect, but this can be followed by a warming effect. This helps to relax the muscles, calm the tension, and comfort at the cold temperature,” explains Dr Shivani Yadav, consultant - dermatology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Gurugram. Warming lotions are popular in the West, and are also being created by Indian brands. Clensta, a skincare brand backed by Parineeti Chopra, has a product in this category. They use ingredients like ginger oil and Vanillyl Butyl Ether to create the warming effect.Are these safe to use? Dermatologists say these creams are mostly harmless, but a patch test is always recommended. Additionally, those with sensitive skin, pre-existing skin conditions, or allergies should exercise caution, as these creams can sometimes cause irritation, redness, or discomfort. Patch test “Generally, most people do not have to worry if winter warming creams are applied correctly, but caution must always be taken. They normally include capsaicin or menthol, causing the skin to feel like it is heating up. This can sometimes cause an irritation of sensitive skin and allergy reactions. One must conduct a patch test before a full application. Use them with great care on broken or inflamed skin,” suggests Dr Yadav. Avoid sensitive areas Dr Sachdev suggests not applying warming lotions on broken skin, near the eyes, or mucous membranes. Follow instructions Read the ingredients and buy from reputable brands. Always read the package to use the recommended amount and avoid excess application. Winter warming creams can be beneficial for providing temporary relief and comfort during cold weather. But individuals with sensitive skin, pre-existing skin conditions, or allergies should exercise caution, as these creams can sometimes cause irritation, redness, or discomfort. If you witness burning, itching or prolonged redness, it is better to stop using the product immediately. Consult a dermatologist immediately in case of allergy issues.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Dec 20, 2024

What is OCD, really? A post shared by Ekta Khurana | PSYCHOLOGIST | THERAPIST (@ektakhurana_)
 We often toss around the term OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) casually, but it is a mental health condition characterised by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) that a person feels driven to perform. These compulsions are not done for fun or preference but to ease the intense anxiety caused by the obsessions. Delhi-based psychologist and therapist Ekta Khurana says, “OCD is a serious issue that many people face daily. It’s not just about occasional intrusive thoughts or habits that people joke about. While it’s normal to have random thoughts, if they’re persistent, intrusive, and cause anxiety, it’s important to take them seriously.” For example: Obsession: Fear of harming loved ones unintentionally. Compulsion: Repeating specific prayers or rituals to prevent harm. While compulsive cleaning can be one symptom, it’s just one possibility in a broad spectrum.Common misconceptions Dr Rajiv Mehta, vice-chairperson of psychiatry at Sir Gangaram Hospital, says, “The most common misconception about OCD is that it is a weakness of self. It is not a disorder, but the person is deliberately repetitively doing the things.” “The other misconception is that as the person is deliberately doing the things, he or she can control the acts by self,” he adds. Besides, the stereotype of OCD is that it is about cleanliness. But it does not highlight a person’s other struggles. Someone with OCD might repeatedly check locks, count in specific patterns, or experience intrusive, distressing thoughts.

 You may like to believe it or not, but OCD can severely impact a person's daily life. People with severe OCD may spend hours a day trapped in obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals, interfering with work, relationships, and overall well-being.What can cause it Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a complex condition, and its exact cause is not fully understood, says Archana Singhal, founder of Mindwell Counsel, Delhi. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is a widely used clinical tool for assessing the severity of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It helps measure the intensity of both obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviours or mental acts) in individuals diagnosed with OCD, she adds. However, several factors are believed to contribute to the development of OCD, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological influences. These factors might work together to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. Singhal states some of the key potential causes: Genetic factors: Research suggests that genetics can play a significant role in the development of OCD. Having a family member with OCD increases the risk of developing the disorder, indicating a genetic predisposition. Studies have shown that OCD tends to run in families, suggesting that inherited genes may influence the brain's functioning in a way that contributes to the disorder. However, it's important to note that genetics alone is unlikely to be the sole cause of OCD. Brain structure and function: There is evidence that abnormalities in certain areas of the brain may contribute to OCD. Specifically, dysfunction in the circuitry involving the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and cingulate cortex has been implicated. These regions of the brain are involved in processing anxiety, decision-making, and behaviour regulation. In individuals with OCD, these brain areas may become overactive or fail to communicate properly, leading to the repetitive, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and actions (compulsions) characteristic of the disorder. Chemical imbalances (neurotransmitters): Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, anxiety, and behaviour, is thought to be involved in OCD. It is believed that people with OCD may have an imbalance of serotonin in their brains, which could contribute to the intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviours that are central to the disorder. This has led to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of OCD, which can help balance serotonin levels and alleviate symptoms for many individuals. Environmental factors: Environmental stressors or traumatic events can play a role in the onset or exacerbation of OCD. For example:
advertisementStressful life events such as the death of a loved one, divorce, abuse, or significant life changes can trigger or worsen OCD symptoms in some people.
Childhood trauma or adverse childhood experiences (such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse) may also increase the risk of developing OCD later in life. Some studies suggest that trauma can trigger OCD symptoms in predisposed individuals, particularly when combined with other factors like genetics.

Additionally, infection has been proposed as a potential trigger for OCD, particularly in children. This is known as PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections), where a strep infection may lead to sudden-onset OCD symptoms, although this theory remains controversial and is not universally accepted.Cognitive and behavioural factors: Some theories of OCD focus on cognitive and behavioural patterns. Cognitive models suggest that people with OCD may have certain cognitive biases, such as: Overestimating threats: They may perceive normal, everyday situations as dangerous or needing to be controlled. Inflated sense of responsibility: People with OCD might believe that they are responsible for preventing harm and that they must perform specific behaviours (compulsions) to prevent disasters.advertisementIntolerance of uncertainty: People with OCD often have difficulty tolerating uncertainty, which leads them to engage in compulsive rituals to reduce anxiety or to seek certainty.Behavioural models focus on the idea that OCD is learnt through classical conditioning, where certain actions become reinforced through repetition. When a person experiences anxiety and then engages in a compulsive behaviour (such as washing hands), the behaviour temporarily reduces the anxiety, reinforcing the cycle and making it more likely to occur again in the future.Is a cure available?OCD is a manageable condition, and seeking professional support can greatly enhance symptom control, enabling individuals to live more fulfilling lives. Effective OCD management typically involves a blend of treatment strategies, including therapy, medication, and lifestyle adjustments.Therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), is highly effective for treating OCD. ERP involves gradually exposing oneself to feared thoughts or situations and learning to resist the urge to perform compulsive behaviours.

Medication:  Several of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)are FDA-approved and commonly prescribed at higher doses to help alleviate anxiety and OCD symptoms.Lifestyle changes: Regular exercise, adequate sleep and a healthy diet can support overall mental health and help manage symptoms.Mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques: “Practices like mindfulness meditation, yoga and deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can alleviate some OCD symptoms,” says Archana Singhal.Support groups: Connecting with others who have OCD can provide valuable support and understanding.Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Deep Brain Stimulation are both approved treatments for patients with OCD and have not responded to other treatments.Piyali Maity, clinical director of counselling operations, 1to1help, concludes, “It is important to create an environment where individuals with OCD feel understood, supported, and empowered to seek help and that can be achieved once there is enough awareness. It is also important to be conscious and understand how we use the term OCD. Equating it with just being ‘neat’ or ‘perfectionistic’ is problematic. It is a stereotype that needs to be challenged so that the casual misuse of the term can be avoided.”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 21, 2024

Recent statistics also reveal a clear shift in how Indians approach their travel plans. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/indians-are-chasing-luxury-travel-like-never-before-whats-driving-this-shift-2653015-2024-12-22,"Luxury, business class, and extravagant retreats are becoming increasingly popular among Indian travellers. Once known for their resourcefulness and practical approach to travel, Indians today prioritise travel like never before, and they’re doing it in style – with a taste for luxury. ""I am ready to shell out a few extra bucks, but when I travel, it has to be comfortable. Brownie points if I can find luxury with that extra money,"" says Muskan Agarwal, a 25-year-old student from Delhi NCR, while sharing why she prefers to travel in luxury. Such is the mindset not only of Muskan but also of many Indians who are shifting from being budget travellers to embracing the idea of luxury travel.What data tells us Luxury travel among Indian tourists is no longer a rare occurrence. In fact, recent statistics reveal a clear shift in how Indians are approaching their travel plans. India Today analysed several year-end reports by various travel agencies, and all indicate the same.  According to data from Skyscanner, an online travel agency, 37 per cent of Indian travellers plan to upgrade their flights to business or first class in 2024. Additionally, 44 per cent intend to purchase access to airport lounges to ensure their trips begin on a luxurious note. Another MakeMyTrip (an online travel agency) data shows the same. In fact, it shows a 50 per cent year-on-year increase in business class bookings, with international flights witnessing a whopping 80  per cent jump, while domestic flights saw a 27 per cent rise. 

 



Data also shows a similar rise. Photo: MakeMyTrip
It also shows that India’s contribution of domestic hotel bookings priced above INR 10,000 has increased to 22 per cent as compared to 20 per cent in the same period last year. This number is almost double for international hotel bookings (a jump of 57 per cent from 51 per cent). These figures paint a compelling picture. For a demographic once known for cost-cutting and resourcefulness, this surge in premium travel choices marks a significant change. It’s not just about getting from point A to point B anymore; it’s about doing so in style, comfort, and with a dash of indulgence.Experts also agreeLouis D’Souza, director at Tamarind Global, says, “Luxury travel among Indian travellers has seen an extraordinary rise and this trend shows no signs of slowing down in 2025.” D’Souza explains that today’s Indian traveller craves unique, bespoke experiences that go beyond traditional sightseeing. “From unwinding in a private villa on an exclusive island to a gastronomic adventure at Michelin-star restaurants in Tokyo, or indulging in bespoke art and fashion tours in Paris, the essence of luxury is shifting toward experiential and meaningful travel,” he adds.Prabhakar Kamat, business head at Red Dot Representations, echoes this sentiment, and says the trend seems to be growing even more strongly for next year.

Let’s break down these reasons one by one. Why Indians prefer luxurySeveral factors have converged to drive the rise in luxury travel among Indians, transforming it from a niche market to a mainstream aspiration. Here’s a closer look at what’s behind this change:
Rising disposable incomes: Experts suggest that economic growth in India has created a more affluent middle and upper class, enabling a larger section of the population to afford premium travel experiences. 
Change in priorities: Experts like D'Souza suggest that the younger generation has prioritised travel as an essential part of their lives being the key contributors (Not 70 hours work week). Rajesh Magow, the co-founder and group CEO of MMT, says, “The trend toward premiumisation is becoming increasingly pronounced, as travellers are willing to spend more for a memorable holiday.”
Exposure to global lifestyles: Thanks to the rise of social media and digital platforms, Indian travellers have a front-row seat to the luxury experiences enjoyed by people around the world. This exposure has cultivated a taste for indulgence and exclusivity.

Celebration tourism: Destination weddings, milestone anniversaries, and large family reunions are on the rise. Grand occasions now call for equally grand destinations, and luxury travel provides the perfect setting for such celebrations.
Post-pandemic priorities: Privacy, safety, and bespoke experiences have become crucial considerations for travellers. Exclusive itineraries and private accommodations naturally align with these needs, making luxury travel a more appealing option. Moreover, ever since the pandemic, there has been a change in the mindset of many people, with them prioritising experiences over anything else. This has led to the rise of a very specific type of travel known as 'revenge travel'. 
Desire for unique experiences: As D’Souza points out, modern travellers are seeking experiences that go beyond sightseeing. Private villas, Michelin-starred dining, and immersive art and fashion tours have become the new definition of luxury.

 It also shows that India’s contribution of domestic hotel bookings priced above INR 10,000 has increased to 22 per cent as compared to 20 per cent in the same period last year. This number is almost double for international hotel bookings (a jump of 57 per cent from 51 per cent).  These figures paint a compelling picture. For a demographic once known for cost-cutting and resourcefulness, this surge in premium travel choices marks a significant change. It’s not just about getting from point A to point B anymore; it’s about doing so in style, comfort, and with a dash of indulgence.Experts also agree Louis D’Souza, director at Tamarind Global, says, “Luxury travel among Indian travellers has seen an extraordinary rise and this trend shows no signs of slowing down in 2025.” D’Souza explains that today’s Indian traveller craves unique, bespoke experiences that go beyond traditional sightseeing.  “From unwinding in a private villa on an exclusive island to a gastronomic adventure at Michelin-star restaurants in Tokyo, or indulging in bespoke art and fashion tours in Paris, the essence of luxury is shifting toward experiential and meaningful travel,” he adds. Prabhakar Kamat, business head at Red Dot Representations, echoes this sentiment, and says the trend seems to be growing even more strongly for next year.

0f8587f3-b100-4bd9-863d-25648330d1d9,"Retirement depression is real and rising in India. How to manage itFor many people, retirement brings feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and worthlessness, which can potentially lead to clinical depression.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/retirement-depression-is-real-how-to-manage-prevent-it-2654219-2024-12-23,"When Ritika, a 29-year-old woman from Delhi, flew from Berlin to celebrate her father's retirement, everything seemed perfect. Her father, a travel enthusiast, already had several trips planned for the months ahead. However, a year and a half later, Ritika found herself packing her bags to return to Delhi. Her father, once so vibrant, had developed a bevy of health issues, including signs of depression. Retirement depression, often caused by the emotional challenges that accompany retirement, is a growing issue in India. People who once led dynamic lives filled with social interactions, daily routines, and a sense of purpose often struggle to adjust to the sudden and stark changes brought on by retirement. Retirement comes with a set of benefits but also some challenges. “Retirement, for many people, comes with feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and worthlessness, which can lead to clinical depression,” says Dr Aarti Anand, senior consultant – psychiatry, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi. Retirement depression refers to feelings of sadness, anxiety, or hopelessness experienced after retiring from active work life. “Certain signs to recognise retirement depression include exhaustion or lack of motivation, along with generalised anxiety and having a persistent low mood,” says Nishtha Jain, counselling psychologist at the online mental health platform Lissun. “It is often caused by a lack of routine, reduced social interactions, and the sudden loss of a professional identity or purpose. Financial instability, health issues, and feelings of loneliness further exacerbate this condition,” says Sumalatha Vasudeva, psychologist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru. “Instead of feeling free, relaxed, and fulfilled, many people feel depressed, aimless, and isolated. They may grieve the loss of their old life, feel stressed about how they are going to fill their days, or worry about the toll that being at home all day is taking on the relationships with family members,” explains Dr Anand.

 Retirement can take away the sense of purpose and self-worth, make you feel lost, and leave behind a void. Though there is no suggestive data, experts say there is an increase in retirement depression among Indians. ""Retirement depression has fairly become more recognised and more prevalent with Indian populations. This change has come because of the changes in societal dynamics and traditional support systems that were previously available for retirees,"" says Jain. The changing family structure is also behind the rise in post-retirement depression among the elderly. “Traditionally, joint families provided emotional and social support for retirees. However, with the rise of nuclear families and urban migration, many retirees experience isolation and a sense of purposelessness, making them more vulnerable to depression,” adds Sumalatha Vasudeva. Not having hobbies outside one’s career is also a major cause of retirement depression.

 This retirement depression can lead to severe consequences, such as:
Chronic physical health issues like hypertension and diabetes due to stress
Cognitive decline, as reduced mental engagement impacts memory and problem-solving skills
Social withdrawal, which may cause strained family relationships
Increased risk of substance abuse or self-harm in severe cases
How to prevent retirement depression Retirement depression, however, can be prevented as well as managed. Prevention, as they say, is the best cure. “The best way to prevent retirement depression is to have a thought-out action plan well before retiring. This action plan should include planning about finances, routines, hobbies, and investments after retirement,” says Jain.

 



As a retiree, leading an active, healthy lifestyle is important for overall well-being. (Photo: AI Generative)
 To prevent retirement depression from affecting your or your parents’ lives, try having a plan ready. Here are a few expert-approved tips:
Plan ahead: Financial and emotional preparation for retirement.
Establish a routine: Stay active with hobbies, volunteer work, or part-time employment.
Social connections: Maintain and expand social networks to reduce loneliness.
Physical activity: Engage in regular exercise to improve mood and overall health.
Learn new skills: Pick up new hobbies or courses to maintain mental stimulation and purpose.
 Meanwhile, having a good support system and staying well-connected with family and friends is also crucial.Managing retirement depression Seeking professional help to manage anxiety and depression is imperative. It will help you navigate the challenges you are facing after retirement. A psychologist or counsellor can provide therapy to address these challenges.

 



Retirement is a major life change that requires not only advanced financial planning but also a strategy to stay occupied and fulfilled. (Photo: Getty)
 Here are additional strategies recommended by mental health experts to help manage retirement depression:
Join support groups: Go out for walks, socialise, and join communities or groups for retirees to share experiences and combat loneliness.
Adopt healthy habits: Ensure you take balanced nutrition, exercise regularly, and practise mindfulness activities such as yoga or meditation.
Set goals: Establish small, achievable goals to foster a sense of accomplishment. It could be something simple like going for a short trip every two months or reading 10 pages a day.
Family support: Express your emotions. Open communication with family members will help you share feelings and seek emotional support.

 The Protein Diet Coke is rooted in the trend of ""dirty soda"", a soda enhanced with syrups, creamers, or other ingredients for added flair. This trend was popularised by shows like The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, dirty soda has become a cultural phenomenon, and this new twist is no exception. But should you be adding Diet Coke to your protein shake or visa versa? We asked the experts. What do experts have to say?  When it comes to the trending combination of protein shakes and Diet Coke, experts have shared their thoughts, and the consensus is not overly optimistic. Parmeet Kaur, HOD-dietician and nutritionist at Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram, highlights that while this mix might sound intriguing, it often leads to digestive discomfort. The carbonation in Diet Coke produces gas when combined with protein powder, and can result in bloating. Moreover, artificial sweeteners like aspartame present in Diet Coke are known to cause sensitivity in some individuals, including headaches or digestive upset.

 Dr Bhavna Garg, senior consultant, dietitian, and nutritionist at Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital Kaushambi, agrees. She adds that the combination does not enhance the nutritional value of protein shakes. She notes that while the frothy mix might appear appealing, the caffeine and carbonation in Diet Coke can disturb digestion and potentially lead to bloating or discomfort. Both experts stress the importance of prioritising balanced nutrition over trendy mixes that may not serve any significant health purpose.Can you add it to your diet? While mixing protein shakes with Diet Coke might not be outright harmful, it isn’t a choice most nutritionists would recommend. According to Dr Garg, incorporating this combination into your diet depends largely on individual tolerance, but it doesn’t offer any substantial health benefits. Parmeet Kaur emphasises that protein shakes are best blended with water, milk, or plant-based alternatives to support proper digestion and nutrient absorption. If you’re aiming to meet your daily protein requirements, it’s better to consume protein shakes on their own rather than experimenting with carbonated beverages. But again, if you don’t like the taste of protein shake alone, you can’t try this trend, if it doesn’t upset your stomach.  For a balanced and healthy diet, focus on nutrient-rich foods and beverages that provide energy and essential nutrients without compromising digestive health.What’s the deal with Diet Coke? There has been a surge in people’s obsession with Diet Coke,  a low-calorie and sugar-free beverage, might seem like a healthier alternative to sugary drinks. Parmeet Kaur points out that its primary and controversial sweetener, aspartame, is not inherently toxic but can cause digestive upset or headaches in some individuals. While calorie intake might decrease with Diet Coke, its artificial sweeteners could trigger cravings for sweet foods, potentially impacting gut health. Dr Garg adds that moderate consumption of Diet Coke is key.  Excessive intake of artificially sweetened beverages has been linked to metabolic changes, digestive discomfort, and increased cravings for sweets. For a truly healthier lifestyle, she recommends opting for water, herbal teas, or natural beverages. In small quantities, Diet Coke may not pose a significant health risk, but it’s essential to ensure it doesn’t replace nutrient-rich and hydrating options in your diet.The last sip  While the combination of protein shakes and Diet Coke may spark curiosity among those who follow trends, it lacks the nutritional benefits that a health-conscious individual should prioritise. Experts recommend sticking to tried-and-tested options like water, milk, or plant-based altern atives for your protein shakes to ensure proper digestion and nutrient absorption.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 24, 2024

While we often think of tanning as a direct result of sun exposure, emerging research suggests that internal factors like gut health may play a subtle role in how our skin reacts to the sun. So, can poor gut health actually cause increased tanning?Gut health and skin: The connection Our gut does much more than just digesting food. It’s home to trillions of microorganisms that make up our gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem essential for overall health. A well-balanced gut microbiome regulates inflammation, supports the immune system, and even influences skin health. When this balance is disrupted—a state known as dysbiosis—it can lead to problems like inflammation and oxidative stress. Inflammation and oxidative stress are known to impact melanin production, the pigment responsible for the colour of our skin, hair, and eyes. They can affect how the skin reacts to UV rays from the sun, potentially leading to uneven pigmentation or an increased likelihood of damage.

Does poor gut health lead to more tanning?Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant and aesthetic physician, Gleneagles Hospital Bengaluru, says, “Emerging research suggests that gut health and skin health are interconnected. Poor gut health can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress, which may exacerbate pigmentation disorders or uneven tanning. A balanced gut microbiome supports overall skin health.”

 



A study has found a causal association between the gut microbiome and ease of skin tanning. (Photo: Getty Images)
However, she adds, that a compromised gut may impair the absorption of essential nutrients like antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that protect our skin from sun damage. This could make the skin more prone to UV-related changes, though not necessarily increased tanning.

This could make the skin more prone to UV-related changes, though not necessarily increased tanning. A study has found a causal association between the gut microbiome and ease of skin tanning. The gut-skin connection is the term used to describe the link between the digestive system and skin health.What Ayurveda says about gut health and tanning In Ayurveda, Vata Prakruti (individuals with a predominant air and space element) naturally have qualities like dryness, lightness, and irregularity in their body functions. This makes their metabolism unpredictable, leading to potential depletion of Rasa Dhatu (plasma or nutritive fluid), which is responsible for nourishing and hydrating the body tissues, including the skin. Dr Milind Salunke, wellness director at Swastik Wellbeing Sanctuary says, “When Rasa Dhatu is not adequately replenished due to Vata's drying nature, it results in dry, rough skin. Additionally, Vata's tendency to disturb digestive processes can cause constipation, as the body struggles to maintain proper moisture and smooth functioning in the digestive tract. This imbalance contributes to skin dryness and makes tanning more likely in Vata Prakruti individuals.What should be done Dr Aparna Santhanam, dermatologist and skin expert at ITC Dermafique, says, “Individuals with higher skin prototypes (a person's skin type in terms of response to ultraviolet radiations), greater eumelanin production, and genetic predisposition will tan more than others. While tanning may be perceived as protective, it is still a sign of UV-induced damage, and sun protection measures are essential for everyone to reduce the risk of photodamage and skin cancers. Experts suggest following these steps:
Use sun protection: Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30+ and wear protective clothing.
Limit sun exposure: Avoid peak UV hours, usually between 10 AM and 4 PM.
Maintain gut health: Eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, probiotics, and hydration to promote healthy skin.
Consult a professional: Seek advice from a dermatologist or aesthetic consultant for personalised treatments such as chemical peels or laser therapy to address pigmentation concerns.
 While poor gut health doesn’t directly cause increased tanning, it can influence your skin’s response to sun exposure by affecting factors like inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutrient availability. Conversely, tanning and sun exposure can also impact your gut microbiota, showing just how interconnected our internal and external health truly are.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 26, 2024Must Watch

 But if you don’t want to invest Rs 30,000-40,000 in a device or deal with the hassle of using it yourself, you can opt for facials offered at salons. These microcurrent facials are gaining popularity in India, with various salons offering them at prices ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000. But how and when did microcurrent facials become so popular? Should you get one? What do experts have to say about these facials? Here’s a quick guide. Let’s start from the beginning.From the treatment of facial paralysis to celeb favourite Microcurrent facials may sound like a futuristic beauty trend, but their roots trace back to an old medical practice. Initially developed in the 1980s as a treatment for facial paralysis, microcurrent technology was later adopted by the beauty industry when its aesthetic benefits became apparent. Talk about a glow-up!  Today, these facials are promoted as a way to tone facial muscles and improve skin’s overall appearance, offering a non-invasive alternative to more aggressive anti-aging procedures (read: botox).  In recent years, microcurrent facials have skyrocketed in popularity, largely thanks to celebrity endorsements and social media buzz.

 According to Dr Sonali Kohli, consultant dermatologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, “In recent years, microcurrent facial treatments have gained significant popularity amongst skincare enthusiasts and celebrities alike, promising a non-invasive 'natural facelift' effect.” This trend further expanded with the advent of at-home microcurrent devices, like the viral microcurrent wand, used by all celebrities. 'It's like a gym workout for your face' Microcurrent facials rely on low-level electrical currents, typically between 100 and 400 microamps, to stimulate facial muscles and skin cells. “It’s like a gym workout for your face,” says Dr Aparna Santhanam, a Mumbai-based dermatologist. The primary mechanism is boosting ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production, which is crucial for cellular energy. This uptick in ATP triggers several benefits, according to Dr Santhanam. 
Enhanced muscle tone and facial contours
Stimulated collagen and elastin production
Improved circulation and lymphatic drainage
Accelerated cellular repair
 Now, this leads to various ‘potential benefits’, according to Dr Kohli, like: Immediate effects
Lifted and firmer facial features
Reduced puffiness
Enhanced skin radiance
Long-term benefits
Gradual improvement in muscle tone
Better skin texture and firmness
Delay in the appearance of fine lines
Improved absorption of skincare products
 Dr Sidharth Sonthalia, dermatologist at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Gurugram, adds, “Microcurrent facials help by stimulating the tone of facial muscles and promoting production of collagen and elastin proteins in deeper layers. Additionally, the device boosts blood circulation and enhances penetration of skincare products. The overall impact includes improved skin tone, reduction in fine lines, and a lifted or sculpted youthful appearance.”Is it worth the hype? India Today spoke to various experts, and even though experts agreed there can be some benefits that we have mentioned above, they are short-lived.  For instance, Dr Santhanam says, “Microcurrent facials are not a gimmick, but their efficacy depends on realistic expectations and proper technique.” She mentions that it works well as a preventative or maintenance tool for light wrinkles. Dr Saurabh Shah, senior clinical and cosmetic dermatologist and dermatosurgeon, however, doesn’t agree. He says that although quite sought after, these facials are not an absolutely established and reliable treatment to address skin aging.

 “It's effects are uncertain, inconsistent, unreliable, and, most importantly, short-lived compared to its other counterparts like - RF (Radiofrequency) and HIFU (High intensity focused ultrasound), which are more consistent and definitive modes of treatments,” Dr Shah adds.  Dr Shah, however, says that microcurrent facials offer to be a relatively cheaper, safer and non-invasive option.At-home vs professional treatments Dr Santhanam highlights key differences:
Professional treatments: Use medical-grade devices for deeper penetration and visible results.
At-home devices: Great for maintenance but less effective due to lower intensity.
 Dr Sonthalia adds, “At-home devices can complement professional treatments, offering maintenance between sessions. However, professional facials use advanced equipment with precise settings tailored to individual needs, often delivering superior results compared to consumer-grade devices.” Now, if you’re going for professional treatment, experts suggest getting these facials in three phases: 
Initial phase: 1-2 sessions per week for 6-8 weeks.
Maintenance phase: Once every 4-6 weeks to maintain results.
Combination therapy: Pair with RF skin tightening or hydrafacials for enhanced outcomes.
 According to Dr Sonthalia, “Initially, 6-12 sessions spaced weekly or bi-weekly, conducted by a dermatologist, are recommended for optimal results. Once the desired result is achieved, maintenance sessions can be done every 4–6 weeks, at a clinic or home, depending on individual skin goals and aging concerns.”Side effects While generally safe, microcurrent facials aren’t entirely risk-free. Some potential side effects include:
Mild redness or irritation: Usually temporary and resolves quickly.
Metallic taste: Rare and fleeting, caused by electrical stimulation.
Contraindications: Not suitable for individuals with pacemakers, epilepsy, or certain skin conditions.
 Dr Kohli mentions, “The key to success lies in understanding that this is not a quick fix but rather a long-term investment in skin health and facial muscle tone.” advertisementThe last session Microcurrent facials are the perfect blend of science and skincare, offering a gentle, non-invasive route to a snatched, youthful visage, but their effects are short-lived like any other facials.

 Microcurrent facials are the perfect blend of science and skincare, offering a gentle, non-invasive route to a snatched, youthful visage, but their effects are short-lived like any other facials.

Don’t want to spend a fortune on an assemblage of heavy bridal outfits? You can rent them! Worried about storing a bulky lehenga after the wedding, knowing you’ll rarely wear it again? Renting is the answer! Always wanted to become a Sabyasachi bride but the budget doesn’t allow it? Check out a reputed rental store, and you can get it from there at a fraction of the price. From designer replicas to authentic couture creations, you can rent the bridal outfit of your dreams with the convenience of free delivery and pick-up—especially if you’re in a tier-1 city. There are physical stores and online portals providing wedding rental services all across the country. Players like Flyrobe, Rent a Closet, and Kuro India, along with a plethora of physical rental stores, have given ‘renting’ an acceptance facelift and made it easily accessible. “The wedding clothing rental market in India is growing rapidly, thanks to evolving mindsets and a greater emphasis on sustainability. Brides are increasingly open to renting their wedding outfits, recognising the practicality of wearing exquisite designer lehengas at a fraction of the purchase cost,” Aanchal Saini, CEO of Flyrobe, tells India Today.

Experts say India is adapting well to the wedding rental trend, especially among millennials and Gen Z, who are more open to alternative ownership models. The shift is further normalised by the influence of social media and influencers.While Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru have been early adopters of the rental trend, Jaipur, Ludhiana, and Hyderabad are also quickly catching up. Experts say India is adapting well to the wedding rental trend, especially among millennials and Gen Z, who are more open to alternative ownership models. The shift is further normalised by the influence of social media and influencers. While Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru have been early adopters of the rental trend, Jaipur, Ludhiana, and Hyderabad are also quickly catching up. “Interestingly, smaller cities like Raipur have shown an exceptionally positive response. These cities combine a strong appetite for lavish weddings with a growing awareness of sustainable and cost-effective options, making them ideal markets for rentals,” shares Saini. Celebrity weddings also have a role to play, inspiring many couples to take their celebrations to picturesque locations like Udaipur, Goa, and Kerala. These cities also see high demand for rentals. “Renting allows couples to recreate similar grandeur (at destination weddings) while maintaining financial and environmental sustainability,” says Saini. Celebrity fashion stylist and costume designer Divyak D’Souza thinks of renting as an excellent money-saving option. “Couture, particularly bridal couture, is notoriously expensive, so opting to rent instead of purchase can significantly cut costs. Beyond the financial savings, renting can be seen as a sustainable choice, especially for garments typically worn only once. It also eliminates the need for long-term maintenance, storage, and regular dry cleaning that comes with owning such attire,” Divyak D’Souza tells India Today.

What's stop Indian brides Practical, sustainable, and hassle-free, renting a wedding lehenga seems perfect in theory. Yet, it remains far from becoming a mainstream choice among Indian brides. For instance, when Bhavya Arora, a Delhi-based marketing professional, suggested renting a designer lehenga for her wedding celebrations, she was met with raised eyebrows from both her family and in-laws. The recent years have witnessed a rise in pre-loved luxury fashion in India, yet renting is still looked down upon by many—especially when it is for a sacred event like a wedding.

 Daisy (name changed on request), on the other hand, found it challenging to come across good designs. Additionally, no scope for personalisation—a huge wedding fashion trend—was another turn-off for her. Delhi-based journalist Tiasa, however, could not find any decent options in her hometown, Siliguri. The hassle of carrying a rented lehenga from Delhi to her hometown and then eventually returning it within a limited time period meant significant logistical challenges. “Somewhere along the line, the thought of people talking behind my back about my decision to rent instead of buy also crossed my mind. People my age and those who are digitally literate might understand, but elders often don’t,” she says. An Indian bride’s wedding outfit carries not only the weight of craftsmanship but also deep emotions. The ‘suhaag ka joda’ holds immense emotional significance, another reason why brides refrain from renting the wedding lehenga. “For our brides, spending on wedding clothes is an investment of their feelings and emotions, like the wedding itself. There is no way a bride is going to compromise on the vision she has for herself. What a bride wears on her wedding day is extremely important and is of high sentimental value to the bride,” says Nisha Kundnani of Bridelan, a luxury wedding stylist and personal shopper. “Just until five years ago, not even 1 per cent of the customers of Indian designers would spend on a 10 or 15 lakh lehenga. That range is now an average and very well-accepted range of Indian designers. The average spend on a wedding lehenga has also become this high because of the desirability and aspirational value, simply because the demand is so high that it is also creating counter parallels such as rentals and other ways of acquisition,” explains Nisha Kundnani, who closely works with Indian brides all over the world to curate their wedding looks.advertisementRenting - A popular choice among wedding guestsCurrently, outfit rentals are a big hit among wedding guests, including bridesmaids, the groom's sisters, and the bride's mother. For many, buying a new outfit or getting one stitched for every family or friend’s wedding is not feasible. Those with a strong penchant for fashion often rush to designer rental stores to find outfits that make them look stunning without burning a hole in their pockets. Additionally, novelty is also maintained in the Instagram grids—for those who still detest repeating outfits.“Renting wedding outfits doesn't yet appear to be a major choice among brides and grooms, especially in India, where weddings are deeply emotional and culturally significant events. However, rental fashion is gaining traction among wedding guests and family members who may attend multiple events and prefer a cost-effective and practical wardrobe solution,” says Divyak.advertisementPioneers in the rental business believe it will take time for brides to embrace outfit rentals for their big day.“Think of international travel—it used to be a big deal a decade ago, and now it’s just another getaway.

We love everything extra. From the way we travel to what we eat, there’s an extra layer of luxury and novelty that we have started enjoying, and the viral kunafa chocolates straight from Dubai speak to our penchant for all things luxe. Kunafa chocolates, inspired by the beloved Middle Eastern dessert, have become the unexpected culinary star of 2024. Combining the gooey richness of pistachio praline with the crisp texture of kataifi pastry, these indulgent treats have captivated taste buds and Instagram feeds worldwide.

 What started as a niche product in Dubai has transformed into a global phenomenon, with international brands jumping on the bandwagon and crafting their own versions.The curious journey of kunafa chocolates While kunafa is a traditional dessert of the Middle East, its journey in the form of chocolate began in Dubai, where a luxury chocolate brand combined the textures of crispy kunafa and creamy fillings to create something entirely new. In 2021, Sarah Hamouda founded Fix Dessert Chocolatier, offering a selection of chocolate treats and pastries that instantly struck a chord with buyers. Today, it has become what you could call a global phenomenon. While her brand boasts numerous flavours, like Fudge Brownies with Crunchy Cereal, Crunchy Lotus Cheesecake, and many more, it is the kunafa chocolate bar that has gained popularity across dimensions.

The contrast between the crunchy kunafa strands and the creamy pistachio filling added with a bite of chocolate created a texture and flavour combination that quickly became irresistible to food enthusiasts and influencers alike. The contrast between the crunchy kunafa strands and the creamy pistachio filling added with a bite of chocolate created a texture and flavour combination that quickly became irresistible to food enthusiasts and influencers alike. Social media played a pivotal role in amplifying the buzz. Food bloggers and dessert lovers from around the world were drawn to their novelty, fuelling demand far beyond Dubai’s borders. According to Vikas Temani, founder of Paul and Mike Chocolates, the visual storytelling on social media was key. “People couldn’t resist sharing videos of them enjoying a concoction of product that looked as good as it tasted.”

 Chef Varun Inamdar agrees. “The speed and scale at which it exploded on social media were surprising. It’s a testament to how powerful visual storytelling and digital platforms are in shaping food trends today: good, bad, ugly all debatable in the same breath.” But, there was a catch. While the chocolate drew a lot of attention worldwide, getting your hands on one was a challenge. Initially, Fix Dessert Chocolatier was available only in Dubai, with limited slots to place an order. People with access to Dubai purchased the chocolates themselves or relied on relatives or friends visiting the Middle Eastern city to bring them back. Yet, the demand surpassed the supply. That’s when people came up with the idea of creating their own versions of the viral chocolate, eager to taste or replicate something close to the original bar. That’s how quickly it caught on - so much so that many saw it as a brilliant business opportunity and have been milking the trend brilliantly.

Global reinterpretations and brand innovations A post shared by @nehadeepakshah

 It is very rare that Lindt, a royalty in the world of chocolate making, would want to replicate or go out of the way from traditional chocolate making to just milk a trend. But they did, most probably because they saw potential. A spokesperson of Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprungli tells India Today, “Our Lindt Maitre Chocolatiers always keep a close eye on current trends and accordingly became aware of the Dubai chocolate recipe trend on social media. The Lindt Maitres Chocolatiers then picked up on this taste trend and developed their own recipe.”

 



Lindt launched its Dubai chocolates last month. (Photo: Facebook)
 Lindt launched its limited-edition Dubai-inspired pistachio chocolate bar on November 9, 2024. The chocolate bar was released in select shops in Germany, with only 1,000 bars available. The launch was treated like a luxury product launch, with numbered tickets, taste-testing samples, and limited access. Regarding Lindt’s this strategic move, Vikas Temani says, “Lindt, and other brands, are likely doing this to expand into non-traditional markets. Europe, the US, Japan, and Australia have been strongholds for premium chocolates, but they’re now looking to tap into markets like India, where there’s a rich dessert culture. By reinterpreting global desserts into chocolate form, they’re making their products more relatable and accessible to these new audiences. We’ll likely see more of this trend in the future.” In India, Temani’s Paul and Mike has taken the onus of introducing all Indians to the taste of this viral Turkish dessert. “We are trying to ensure it’s a high-quality product with properly roasted pistachios and a great balance of flavours. The combination of a crispy, crunchy texture with melting chocolate creates an unforgettable mouthfeel that people crave after just one bite. That addictive experience definitely plays a part in the trend’s popularity. Also, the social media frenzy creates a sense of FOMO, which only drives the demand further,” says Temani.

 And then, there are other Indian craft chocolatiers who are reinterpreting this dessert with an Indian twist, Chitram Craft Chocolates being one of them. For Dr Arun Viswanathan of Chitram Craft Chocolates, kunafa is reminiscent of an Indian dessert, and he is working on a localised version called “Dubai Return Chocolate,” which will include South Indian textures and Middle Eastern flavours too. “We’re reinterpreting kunafa with a base made of nool peni, a traditional vermicelli dessert, and incorporating saffron and rose for a unique Indian identity,” Viswanathan shares. They might launch their ""Dubai Return Chocolate"" sometime in January. Ashmeet Singh Dua, founder of Xocolatl in Hyderabad, recalls how he was inspired by the growing popularity of kunafa in India. “Kunafa had already become a hit here, almost rivalling traditional favourites like khubani ka meetha,” Dua shares. Recognising an opportunity, he crafted a version of kunafa chocolate that incorporated pistachio paste and kataifi pastry sourced directly from abroad. “When we launched in September, our social media reel went viral,” Dua explains. “The combination of textures was unlike anything people had tasted before. Bloggers shared it, and we were flooded with inquiries. That’s when we knew we had a winner.”

 He mentions that since its launch in September, Xocolatl has sold several thousand kunafa chocolate bars. Smoor, a Bengaluru-based chocolate brand, is also set to launch its chocolate bar inspired by the viral dessert during Valentine’s Day.The future The success of this Middle Eastern-inspired treat has opened doors for more cross-cultural dessert innovations but Chef Varun Inamdar, is somewhat skeptical about the trend’s longevity. “It’s the Dalgona coffee of 2024,” he quips. “While it’s visually stunning and delicious, I don’t see it becoming a permanent fixture in the culinary world.” However, Vikas Temani predicts, “While it might not stay at its current high, it will still find takers in the long run. People may not have it frequently, but they’ll seek it out occasionally. This isn’t just a flash-in-the-pan trend; it’s becoming a category of its own. Look at brands like Lindt—they’ve started investing heavily in this space. That kind of commitment shows they see potential in this trend for the long term.”Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 28, 2024

Instead, it’s an accurate description of the latest talking point in the Indian alco-beverage industry: non-alcoholic spirits. Also known as zero-proof spirits, non-alcoholic alcohol is crafted to replicate the taste of traditional spirits but without the alcohol. These zero-proof drinks are not like your other non-alcoholic beverages such as ginger ale, soda, or mocktails. “Unlike mixers or soft drinks like ginger ale or soda, they are made using advanced techniques like distillation, infusion of botanicals, and careful layering of flavours to offer a sophisticated drinking experience,” Ruchi Nagrecha of non-alcoholic cocktail brand Sobriety Sips tells India Today.The growing trend of non-alcoholic spirits Non-alcoholic beers have been around for a long time, with several offerings from Indian brands as well. However, the trend has now expanded to include non-alcoholic gins, vodkas, rums, and cocktails. Several homegrown brands like Sober, Sobriety Sips, and Catwalk Botanics are at the forefront of this new trend in India. These drinks not only taste like traditional spirits but are also super-low on calories and, of course, don’t come with the notorious health side-effects and hangovers that alcohol is associated with.Gen Z and the 'sober curious' movement At the core of this trend is the rise of wellness-oriented thinking and the subsequent shift towards mindful drinking. Gen Z’s ‘sober curious’ movement—a trend encouraging people to explore their relationship with alcohol and reduce or avoid it—has also created space for zero-proof spirits.

 



Non-alcoholic gin and pink gin by Sober.
 According to Statista, Gen Z is significantly spending less on alcoholic beverages than previous generations. While Boomers, Gen X, and Millennials spent between USD 23 to USD 25 billion on alcohol in 2022, Gen Z’s spending amounted to just USD 3 billion.Filling in a lot of blanks Non-alcoholic spirits are emerging as a niche product category that can fill many gaps. For example, many bars and restaurants often neglect to make their mocktail menus exciting, limiting them to sugary mojitos, juices, blue lagoons, or lemon sodas. Zero-proof cocktails, however, provide non-drinkers with more interesting options. Popular hangout spots like The Pit and Monkey Bar in Delhi now have zero-proof cocktails on their menu. “This is a relatively new trend in India, gaining momentum over the past few years as post-Covid health consciousness and wellness trends have grown. Globally, the zero-proof movement started earlier, and now Indian consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, are embracing it. Factors such as health awareness, the need for inclusivity in social settings, and a cultural shift towards mindful alcohol consumption are driving the rise of non-alcoholic cocktails,” says Ruchi Nagrecha. For Ishan Arora, founder of Catwalk Botanics, launched in 2024, his brand was a result of seeking sobriety for himself.

 



Zero-proof spirit offerings by Catwalk Botanics.
 “Our customers are not chasing a high. They are already convinced that they want to quit, want to cut down,” Arora tells India Today. He further believes that these non-alcoholic spirits and even Gen Z’s sober curious movement come from a place of wellness and self-care. “Gen Zs are a generation who have grown up in alcohol-friendly families. According to the people of this age I have spoken to, they don’t want to replicate what happens thereafter (alcohol consumption),” he says. For Vansh Pahuja, founder of Sober, it was these small gaps that inspired him to introduce Sober—a house of non-alcoholic spirits. “It was a series of events in my life. After Covid, my father was advised to quit drinking, but he missed his regular ritual of coming home from work and sipping whisky while watching television. He didn’t want to replace it with coffee or lemon water, and there weren’t many alternatives. Similarly, when a close friend got pregnant, I realised she wouldn’t be drinking alcohol for a while, and I saw a huge potential market,” Vansh Pahuja tells us. He says his target market isn’t teetotalers but people who drink and are looking to reduce their alcohol consumption—such as those who are driving, parenting, observing religious practices, drinking moderately, or focused on fitness. Each brand has its recommended ways of consuming these non-alcoholic spirits, depending on the product. Mixing them with tonic water is one of the most common methods. Alternatively, zero-proof cocktails are also available, which don’t require adding mixers in specific quantities to enjoy these drinks. They are available in cans as well as bottles. Some brands, like Catwalk Botanics, are already on quick e-commerce platforms like BlinkIt.advertisementPricing and consumer curiosityThe pricing varies by brand, but a 750ml bottle of a non-alcoholic spirit typically costs around Rs 1,200. Industry insiders acknowledge that selling alcohol-free spirits at prices comparable to entry-level alcoholic beverages is not the easiest job, but there is curiosity among consumers. As a result, several brands have introduced cans and are planning to launch miniatures.These brands typically have their own online presence and sales platforms along with e-commerce platform tie-ups, but they also collaborate at events and pop-ups to boost awareness.“Our primary business comes from events, weddings, corporate parties, and pop-ups, which contribute about 70% of our sales,” shares Nagrecha.

As the name suggests, they promise to give your hair gorgeous curls—whether beachy, wavy, or highly defined—without the need for heat or harmful chemicals like hair-setting sprays. But which method is the best? And which one should you choose to achieve well-defined curls that last all day without relying on setting spray? TWe tried them out, tested them out, and documented the entire process. Before diving into the journey, here are a few things to know:
No heat was used in any of the techniques.
Almost all (except one) were overnight heatless curling methods. We recorded the process in three stages: while setting the curls, the next morning, and then again 8–9 hours later after going about our day.
This helped us assess how well the curls held up over time and determine which method offered the longest-lasting results.
We have fast-forwarded all the time-consuming bits. 
Day 1: Braiding  For the first day, we chose the simplest and most time-tested technique, (the OG) braiding. Process:
After dampening your hair, braid it as tightly as possible. Leave the braids in overnight and open them the next morning to reveal the results. Have a look at the video to see the results, and the rest of the process:
 
 Our final thoughts:
Braids work best if you don’t have a layered haircut.
While they don’t give you defined curls, the waves last almost the entire day without needing any setting spray.
Ideal for a casual, beachy, wavy look but not for high-end, well-defined curls (especially if you have a lot of layers).
Day 2: Heatless curler headband This technique has been at the centre of the heatless curls trend, dominating social media. The heatless curler headband is one of the easiest and most accessible tools, available on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. Process:
Place the headband on your head and secure it with a pin.
Damp your hair and divide it into two sections.
Braid each section tightly around the headband and secure the ends with a hairband (or else you will have to do some sections again, like us).
Leave it overnight.
 Here’s how it went:
 
 Our final thoughts:
Surprisingly easy to use, even if it looks complicated at first.
Creates neat, wavy curls with good volume.
Results last longer with a hair setting spray.
Comfortable to sleep in despite appearances.

Day 3: Foam rolling curlers Foam rolling curlers are one of the most affordable and popular options, especially among Indian influencers. Process:
Damp your hair and divide it into as many sections as possible.
Roll each section around a foam curler and bend it to lock.
Make sure you roll all your hair 
Leave it in overnight.

 Our final thoughts:

Slightly uncomfortable to sleep in.
Delivers highly defined curls that last a long time, even without heat or spray.

Process:
Start with freshly washed, damp hair.
Take small sections, roll each up with a velcro roller, and secure it with a pin.
Keep the rollers in for at least 3-4 hours.
Here’s how it went:
 
Our final thoughts:
Adds some volume but doesn’t create strong curls.
The longer you keep the rollers in, the better the volume and curl definition.
Takes some time to put it on. 
Day 5: The sock curlThis viral technique uses socks to curl hair. With so many variations online, we tried the most popular method.

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/why-is-it-a-good-idea-to-skip-the-mountains-this-new-years-2657548-2024-12-31,"How do you plan to welcome the new year when the clock strikes midnight on December 31? Will you escape to the mountains to toast to New Year with a spectacular view, or perhaps enjoy a cosy evening at home or in a chic café? (And yes, spending it solo is absolutely fine too!)  But if you’re one of those adventurous ones who is planning a getaway to mark the start of 2024 and have destinations like Manali, Mussoorie, or Jammu on your mind, and live your ‘Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani’ moment, it’s worth taking a moment to rethink your plans. ‘We were stuck for 24 hours’ Payal Porwal, a 25-year-old engineer, from Delhi NCR, planned to spend a quiet week in Manali before the New Year to avoid the notorious ‘New Year rush’. However, her carefully-laid plans went awry when she found herself stuck for 24 hours during a visit to one of Manali’s iconic hotspots, Solang Valley. “We thought we’d visit Solang for just 2–3 hours and then head back, but we ended up getting stuck in the same spot,” Payal shared with India Today. While stranded, Payal considered herself fortunate to find a kind local family who offered help and allowed her group to use their washroom. “It was a relief,” she recalls. However, things took a turn for the worse when, two hours later, the traffic started to move, but chaos ensued as impatient drivers began overtaking each other in a bid to get ahead. “This caused yet another traffic jam, and we were stuck in the same area for the entire night,” she adds. Eventually, Payal and her friends decided to book a hotel in Solang Valley after the police advised against continuing their journey. The icy roads had become treacherous, with several cars stuck and unable to move further.

 



An automobile is stuck in the mountains.
 Payal’s story is far from an isolated incident. Recently, a viral video by a travel vlogger, @chluckytyagi, stuck in the snowstorm of Manali sparked widespread concern. The clip, shot in the picturesque Solang Valley, shows a grim reality: over 1,500 vehicles trapped in the snow, including the Himachal SDM’s official car, according to him.

 “People planning to visit Solang Valley, please reconsider. Over 1,500 vehicles are stuck due to heavy snow. It’s chaos here—please don’t come,” the vlogger warned, pointing to an endless line of immobilised vehicles.Stranded in the snow Payal was one of the nearly 10,000 tourists stranded in Solang Valley last Friday (December 27), when a severe snowstorm paralysed the area. Around 2,000 vehicles were trapped, with only 100 cars able to leave as many drivers were missing from the scene. The event made headlines, painting a chilling picture of the chaos.  Such harsh weather conditions often lead to tragic accidents, particularly in popular hill stations, where roads become treacherous with snow and ice.

History repeating itself India’s love for New Year getaways is a growing trend, but it’s not without its pitfalls. Last year, Himachal Pradesh witnessed massive traffic jams during the festive season, with over 55,000 tourists stranded across various regions. This year seems poised to follow the same script, perhaps even on a larger scale, with travel on the rise.Skidding and slipping The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued warnings of extreme cold and dense fog across North-West and Central India, including Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu & Kashmir. With conditions worsening by the day, foggy highways and snow-laden hill stations have already seen an uptick in accidents. Social media is flooded with videos showing vehicles skidding dangerously on icy roads. In one particularly alarming clip, even a 4x4 (passenger car) nearly succumbed to the slippery conditions.

 Meanwhile, Uttarakhand faces additional challenges, with an orange alert for avalanches recently issued by the Defence Geoinformatics Research Establishment (DGRE), a DRDO laboratory. Heavy snowfall has also blanketed high-altitude regions like Chamoli, Badrinath, Hemkund Sahib, Auli, and Gorson, with similar reports coming from Jammu. Such conditions often accelerate the chances of accidents. High prices in frosty paradise Another challenge for winter travellers is the steep rise in accommodation prices. As New Year approaches, hotel rates skyrocket, and options become limited as most major properties get fully booked. This situation worsens if you’re planning an impromptu getaway during the New Year.Tips to avoid the New Year rush in the Indian mountains Now, if you’re still planning to travel this New Year, here are some tips, shared by Panki Sood, who operates eco-friendly boutiques in from Manali: 
Remember to park ethically, as not following this might cause traffic jams. 
Avoid overcrowded places if you’re going with kids and older people. 
Stay with your own group, and not interact with other groups, as it might create a ‘nuisance’. 
Expect steep hikes in hotel rates and transportation costs during the New Year period. To avoid exorbitant charges, book your stays months in advance or opt for budget-friendly alternatives like homestays or guesthouses.
Always pack snacks and keep ready-to-eat foods in your vehicle while travelling. 
Panki also reminds us not to litter while travelling! 
 Finally, if possible, avoid the dream of spending the New Year’s in the mountains. Go ahead a day or a day later. The mountains are not calling this New Year!Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Dec 31, 2024Trending Reel

Living Apart Together (LAT), a growing trend among committed and married couples in the West, refers to couples intentionally avoiding cohabitation in order to keep the spark alive. No more fights over putting the toilet seat down, leaving the towel on the bed, adjusting the AC temperature, or dealing with mismatched sleeping patterns! It’s about two individuals leading their own lives, chasing their goals, and focusing on themselves while remaining committed to each other. The decision to live in separate homes, despite being married, is not solely driven by these daily issues. Sometimes, the reasons are broader. It may stem from the need to maintain individuality or a strong belief in the importance of personal space - an idea mentioned by Lebanese-American writer Kahlil Gibran in his poem On Marriage: “But let there be spaces in your togetherness,
And let the winds of the heavens dance
between you.” In LAT couples, physical distance is a reality, but they remain romantically and emotionally committed to each other. But is that even possible? According to relationship experts and LAT couples themselves, the answer is a resounding yes. LAT certainly challenges the traditional norm which dictates that couples need to live together, but for some, it is a saviour of their bond.

 



Couples choose to live apart for a variety of reasons. Some value their solitude and personal space, finding that maintaining independence enhances their overall happiness. (Photo: Getty)
Such couples can live in the same building, the same housing society, or even in different cities—it just isn’t the same home. They mutually agree on this arrangement while keeping their time together flexible, such as setting specific days or weekends to meet at one partner’s place, go on outings, or take vacations. Unlike in a separation, these couples maintain intentional communication and stay committed.Why LAT works for some couples“This trend allows couples to maintain their bond while avoiding the conflicts that often arise from cohabitation. It can be genuinely helpful for a few people who want to preserve their individuality, reducing daily conflicts and keeping the romance alive,” says Ruchi Ruuh, a Delhi-based relationship expert.Couples choose to live apart for a variety of reasons. Some value their solitude and personal space, finding that maintaining independence enhances their overall happiness. For many, living apart allows them to strengthen their bond by reducing daily pressures.“Modern couples who value personal space, independence, and privacy benefit from this arrangement. It allows each person to maintain their own lifestyle while preserving their individuality,” adds Dr Nisha Khanna, a Delhi-based psychologist and marriage counsellor.The idea that distance can make a heart grow fonder is a key reason why LAT works for some couples.advertisement“Being apart can help couples appreciate each other more, deepening their connection. They may realise the importance of their partner more acutely and feel a strong desire to meet and spend time together, making those moments even more special,” explains Dr Khanna.So, there is a mix of both ‘me time’ and ‘couple time’. The couple can enjoy personal space and pursue individual interests while also looking forward to spending quality time together. This way, LAT couples stay refreshed and feel eager to connect as well.

The regular bickering over daily household work and chores also takes a backseat and doesn’t hamper the relationship. It is among the major pros of Living Apart Together.“One significant advantage is that when partners don’t share a living space, the need for constant adjustments and negotiations about responsibilities, chores, or the division of labour is minimised. This reduces potential sources of conflict and relationship-related frustration. Without these daily pressures, the couple can focus on maintaining harmony and avoid unnecessary disputes,” says Dr Khanna, a marriage counsellor with over 22 years of experience.advertisementReduced daily conflicts, increased quality time, and a better work-life balance can help prevent some marriages or relationships from deteriorating. However, it is not a universal solution.Living Apart Together works well for certain types of couples, although it may not suit everyone. The suitability of an LAT arrangement largely depends on the personalities and specific needs of the individuals involved.“It suits couples who love each other but struggle with shared living dynamics,” says Ruchi Ruuh.Additionally, LAT is also beneficial for:
Couples who have jobs in different cities or demanding schedules
Couples with drastically different routines or lifestyle preferences
Couples who want to care for ageing parents or maintain the life they lived prior to marriage
People who want to avoid overstimulation due to mental health issues
Living apart together can be extremely trickyLiving Apart Together is not without its set of cons, though. Firstly, it is only relevant for the affluent. Running two households is expensive. Secondly, it can be tricky to maintain, especially when the individuals are not on the same page.advertisement“Prolonged physical separation can lead to emotional distancing too. These sporadic interactions can really affect the intimacy as a couple,” says Ruchi.“The lack of regular face-to-face interactions can result in feelings of disconnection or emotional detachment. This is especially true if one partner is introverted or relies heavily on the other for emotional support,” adds Dr Khanna.It can intensify feelings of loneliness or isolation, particularly if the individual is in an unfamiliar location without a strong social circle. Experts also say that being apart makes providing support in times of crises harder, as they might find it difficult to understand each other’s communication nuances.So, a healthy balance to maintain proximity is important as it helps keep intimacy alive and strengthens the bond. Most essentially, open communication should not take a backseat.How to be a successful LAT coupleTrust is the cornerstone of a successful LAT relationship. Without trust, living apart can lead to misunderstandings, insecurity, and instability.Prioritise spending time together, even if the quantity of time is limited.“Dedicating 45 minutes to an hour a day or 5–7 hours a week can be sufficient to maintain a healthy relationship, provided both partners are aligned on this approach,” suggests Dr Khanna.advertisementSetting boundaries while planning to live apart together is essential. Have the difficult conversations about finances, non-negotiable aspects, expectations, and how you will balance personal space and shared time.

“Both partners must have clear expectations. Deciding how often you’ll meet, what responsibilities you want to share, and maintaining communication should be an ongoing discussion so both partners stay aligned and their needs are met,” says Ruchi.Additionally, being expressive and maintaining communication is of utmost importance. Openly expressing needs, expectations, and concerns can help prevent misunderstandings and conflict. Experts say a lack of communication can trigger isolation, depression, and even temptations like infidelity.Being emotionally invested and staying connected through video calls or by regularly checking in on each other also helps.“Most importantly, don’t treat it like a free pass to avoid emotional intimacy. Regularly communicate and share meaningful moments to stay bonded,” suggests Ruchi.Ultimately, an LAT setup requires maturity, mutual understanding, and the ability to handle independence responsibly.Can the trend be a hit in India too?An increasingly popular trend in the West, Living Apart Together (LAT) is not entirely unfamiliar in India.“Historically, many couples lived apart due to work, such as men migrating to cities for jobs while women stayed back in villages,” highlights Dr Khanna, while adding that many modern couples already embrace it owing to professional or family obligations.“Many couples, especially in metro cities, already live apart due to demanding jobs, long commutes, or the necessity to support families in different locations. For instance, professionals commuting between Noida and Gurgaon often choose to live apart during the week, meeting only on weekends to save time and energy,” she says.Relationship expert Ruchi also sees progressive couples in metro cities who value individuality or face career-related separations embracing LAT.One cannot, however, rule out society’s reaction and expectations. Couples who adopt this lifestyle may face stigma in traditional settings. Cultural and societal expectations often emphasise shared living spaces, which can make LAT less socially acceptable.LAT or not, remember what Kahlil Gibran said in his poem:“Love one another, but make not a bond

What will define their journey?Children of younger millennials and older Gen Z, Gen Beta will be born into a world dominated by technology and AI.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/gen-beta-has-arrived-what-can-we-expect-from-them-2657962-2025-01-01,"When the clock struck midnight, we all welcomed the New Year with cheers and anticipation. A new year brings along fresh beginnings—be it a new look, renewed resolutions (yes, the same old ones with a sprinkle of extra hope), or new aspirations. But 2025 is particularly special because it marks the arrival of a brand-new cohort: Generation Beta, some of whom will live long enough to witness the dawn of the 22nd century. Before you scratch your head to do the maths, let us tell you, that Generation Beta includes those born between 2025 and 2039. By 2035, they are projected to make up 16 per cent of the global population, positioning themselves as a crucial demographic shaping the world’s future. But what will their traits look like, and how will they be any different from the previous generations - Gen Alpha (2013–2024), Gen Z (1997–2012), Millennials (1981–1996), Gen X (1965–1980) and Baby Boomers (1946–1964)? Let us dig into it. What traits are expected of Gen Beta? Children of younger millennials and older Gen Z, Gen Beta will be born into a world dominated by technology and AI. Experts suggest this generation will start life differently from their predecessors. Dr Arvind Otta, a senior psychologist and mental health activist, explains that Gen Beta will grow up during significant advancements in technology. They might even have AI applications powerful enough to personalise their learning and entertainment experiences. These differences may enable Gen Beta to navigate complex digital environments from a young age. Additionally, with societal perspectives on technology evolving, there could be greater emphasis on privacy and mental health concerns for this generation.

Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, agrees. She adds that learning, entertainment, and social interactions for Gen Beta will shift even further online. Riddhi Doshi Patel, a Mumbai-based child psychologist and parenting counsellor, agrees. She adds that learning, entertainment, and social interactions for Gen Beta will shift even further online. According to demographer and futurist Mark McCrindle's blog post, another defining trait of Gen Beta will be their adaptation to a world grappling with significant societal challenges. With climate change, global population shifts, and rapid urbanisation at the forefront, sustainability will not just be a preference but an expectation. Environmental challenges will shape societal values during their formative years. In essence, Gen Beta might be seen as a 2.0 version of iPad or “Shephora kids,” complete with a sprinkle of sass. However, like every generation, they’ll face their own unique set of challenges.‘Indian six-year-old thinks blue eyes and fair skin are beautiful’ Suriti Chakrabarti, a mum of a three-year-old and expecting her second child next month, reflects on how parenting has evolved. Despite enjoying a “blessed childhood” with an open relationship with her parents, she admits her approach will differ due to changing times. She anticipates a “generation gap” between her children, even though they’ll only be three years apart. One concern she expects to remain consistent is the struggle to build interpersonal relationships in an era of rapid technological evolution. “As kids, we weren’t as tech-savvy, but at least we could form meaningful relationships. That’s something I feel is developing slowly in today’s generations,” Suriti says. Dr Otta concurs, adding that while automation and AI might make life easier for Gen Beta, skills like creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence will require deliberate nurturing. These skills may not develop naturally in an AI-saturated environment.

 Riddhi also points out that Gen Beta’s reliance on AI could hinder their decision-making abilities. Virtual reality and the metaverse, which are just emerging now, will likely become commonplace for them. However, frequent immersion in virtual environments could blur the boundaries between real and virtual life, affecting their mental and emotional well-being. She recalls a troubling incident with a six-year-old patient who believed being “beautiful” meant having blue eyes and fair skin—a perception shaped by societal and technological influences. Such skewed ideals, if not addressed, could become more prevalent among Gen Beta.Kids of younger millennials and older Gen Z Growing up, many of us discreetly used landlines or mobile phones, careful not to let our parents find out. However, the dynamics of parenting are shifting, even in the Indian context, as younger generations take on this role. Sushmita Marik, a 30-year-old learning and development specialist and soon-to-be mum, shares her thoughts on parenting in this tech-driven era. She plans to embrace her child’s curiosity by addressing their questions openly and fostering communication. While her child will grow up in an age dominated by technology and social media, she intends to maintain a healthy balance and prevent over-dependence on it.

 Like Sushmita, experts like Riddhi suggest that millennial and Gen Z parents may adopt parenting styles that are radically different from their predecessors. Unlike previous generations, they value flexibility, inclusivity, and mental health awareness. Modern parents are less embarrassed to discuss emotions and mental well-being with their children. This openness fosters vulnerability and communication. These new approaches, combined with the challenges of raising tech-savvy children, will likely define parenting in the Gen Beta era.Tips for parents to raise Gen Beta kids We asked the experts to share some tips that can be followed by the soon-to-be parents. Have a look: 
Foster self-love and acceptance
With AI and social media creating unrealistic beauty and lifestyle standards, parents must instil a strong sense of self-worth in their children. Encourage them to embrace their unique qualities and prioritise inner happiness over external validation.
Balance technology and offline experiences
Gen Beta will be surrounded by AI and tech from birth, making it crucial to create a balance between screen time and real-world activities. Introduce hobbies like sports, arts, and outdoor play to nurture creativity and social interaction beyond digital spaces.
Teach digital literacy and critical thinking
Prepare children to navigate the digital world responsibly. Teach them to question online content, recognise AI biases, and differentiate between fact and fiction. Equip them with tools to handle misinformation and make informed choices.
Emphasise emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills
In a world where social interactions are increasingly virtual, parents should focus on developing their child’s emotional intelligence. Encourage open conversations, empathy, and collaboration to build meaningful human connections.
Encourage creativity and adaptability
As automation transforms jobs and lifestyles, creativity and adaptability will become vital skills. Provide opportunities for exploratory learning, problem-solving, and experimenting with new ideas to help Gen Beta thrive in a fast-changing world.
Set realistic expectations
Avoid imposing unattainable standards influenced by social media or AI-driven content. Focus on your child’s strengths and encourage gradual progress rather than perfection, helping them grow without undue pressure.
Promote family connections
Amidst the dominance of digital interactions, ensure that family bonds remain strong. Spend quality time together, involve children in family traditions, and create a support system that values human connections over virtual ones.

Focused on education and career growth, they leaned into the IT boom and startup culture. Their love for travel, gadgets, yet building interpersonal relationships (in real life, not online) and experiences reflects the optimism of growing up in a liberalised economy.

5956d457-4fd8-476f-a5b5-985d726a4800,The expensive reality of social media's never-ending trendsThe need to stay on top of every new social media trend is not just exhaustive but also draining your bank account. ,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/society/story/the-expensive-reality-of-instagram-facebook-tiktoks-never-ending-trends-and-reels-2658413-2025-01-02,"If there’s one thing we have understood about social media trends is that they come and go at lightning speed. While social media offers us creative inspiration and a space to connect, the relentless chase to stay relevant can take a toll on mental health. Beneath the surface of these fleeting moments lies an increasingly common sentiment: exhaustion.The pace of trends Social media trends are designed to be fast-moving. Algorithms prioritise fresh, engaging content, which means creators are constantly under pressure to churn out new material. A dance trend might dominate TikTok for a week before being replaced by a cooking hack or a quirky meme. The result? An overwhelming cycle of consumption where even the most dedicated users struggle to keep up. Dr Arvind Otta, senior psychologist and mental health activist, points out that the rapid evolution of social media trends can leave people feeling overwhelmed. “The fear of not being able to keep up steals the joy of using social media,” he says. This drive to fit into online communities often results in exhaustion and frustration. Similarly, Sumalatha Vasudeva, psychologist at Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, notes that the constant need to stay current creates fatigue, ultimately leading to burnout. Sanjina Bose, clinical psychologist at Lissun (an online mental health counselling therapy platform), describes this as the “algorithm versus real-life race”. “People spend endless hours doom scrolling, isolating themselves from real-world connections, and measuring self-worth through likes and followers. It’s a draining process that often leads to anxiety, depression, and imposter syndrome,” she explains.

 



Doomscrolling is the compulsive urge to scroll through negative news and social media content. (Photo: Unsplash)
The FOMO factor Fear of missing out (FOMO) has long been associated with social media, but it has intensified by the relentless pace of trends. Users not only want to be informed but also feel compelled to participate - whether it’s recreating a trending video or posting about the latest viral topic. For some, this pressure to stay relevant can lead to burnout. Not too long ago, the internet was obsessed with the viral Dubai kunafa chocolate. Everyone wanted a bite of it. Since getting your hands on one was a challenge, people came up with the idea of creating their own versions of the viral chocolate, eager to taste or replicate something close to the original kunafa chocolate bar from Dubai. That is exactly how impactful social media is today – so much so that brands saw it as a brilliant business opportunity and have been milking the trend brilliantly. Gayathri G, a freelance consultant, says, “It’s so jarring—one moment it’s touted as a miracle, the next, it’s a potential danger. This is just one of countless examples of opposing sides, each trying to scare you. It’s mentally draining, and it makes me wonder how anyone can navigate all this without feeling overwhelmed.” “For example, lately, there’s been a lot of talk about the benefits of castor oil for digestion, detoxing, and skin health, with people insisting on using cold-pressed, hexane-free oil. But then today, I came across a reel warning that castor oil contains ricin, a deadly toxin, and explaining how the seeds must be cooked to make the oil safe,” she adds.

 It is not just exhaustive, it is expensive too. Every day, influencers introduce a new line of makeup, accessories, bags, or jewellery to their followers. Now, imagine millions of influencers urging you to buy something new, follow a trend, or even travel to a new destination daily. You’re tempted, and you might even give in to the temptation, but how long can you keep doing this? It eventually becomes a significant drain on your bank account. Meneka Subramaniyam, an IT professional, shares, ""I love buying new makeup products to add to my vast collection. Initially, it was easy when options were limited, but now it’s a struggle to keep up. Imagine having products from not just India but options were limited, but now it’s a struggle to keep up. Imagine having products from not just India but also South Korea, Japan, France, the US, and Germany, all vying for your attention. We often forget to exercise restraint and fail to realise what this is doing to our minds.""Social media burnout: A growing concern Hence, the phenomenon of social media burnout is becoming increasingly common. Dr Otta explains that burnout manifests in various ways - from stress and disinterest to resentment toward social media platforms. Physical symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and disrupted sleep cycles are also prevalent. Emotionally, individuals may feel detached, inadequate, or overly conscious about their online presence.

 Vasudeva agrees, stating that burnout often stems from constant engagement and comparison. “People feel drained and inadequate, sacrificing personal well-being to maintain an ideal online image,” she says. According to Bose, signs of burnout include:
Constant self-comparison
Agitation or emotional distress related to social media
Increased screen time and poor sleep schedules
Feelings of disconnection from real-life relationships
The impact on daily life and self-esteem Social media’s impact extends beyond the digital realm, affecting daily routines, productivity, and personal relationships. “The pressure to stay relevant can disrupt daily life,” says Dr Otta. “People spend excessive time online, which erodes confidence when comparing themselves to others.” Vasudeva adds that this constant comparison lowers self-esteem and creates self-doubt, leaving people feeling they must always be ‘on’ to maintain their online persona.Gen Z: The most vulnerable generation? Younger generations, especially Gen Z, are particularly affected by trend-chasing culture. “For Gen Z, their online presence is tied to their identity,” says Dr Otta. “The pressure to keep up with what’s popular impacts their self-esteem.” Bose adds, “Being raised in the digital era makes them more vulnerable to the fear of missing out (FOMO), leading to significant mental strain.” However, Millennials are no different.Practical steps to break free from trend-chasing Experts agree that breaking the cycle of trend-chasing requires mindful changes in social media habits. Here’s their advice: Set boundaries: Limit screen time or schedule specific periods to check social media. Apps that track usage can help. Curate your feed: Follow accounts that inspire and align with your values. Unfollow those that induce stress or comparison. Focus on authenticity: Post content that reflects your genuine interests rather than chasing trends. Engage in offline activities: Rediscover hobbies, nurture personal relationships, and spend time in nature to regain balance. Practice mindfulness: Reflect on your motives for posting and consider whether it’s for self-expression or external validation. Try a gradual detox: Begin with short social media breaks and extend them gradually to ease the transition. Ask yourself a few questions: When tempted to make an impulsive purchase after seeing a viral trend, pause and reflect: Do I really need this?
How often will I use it?
Can I repurpose it in 3–4 different ways?
If you can confidently answer ""yes"" to all these questions, go ahead and buy it! Otherwise, it’s best to let it pass.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 2, 2025

“Now we will have 100 people in flight screaming on WhatsApp calls. Congratulations.” These were some of the reactions on the social media platform X following Air India's announcement of in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity on domestic routes. 2025 began with exciting news for travel enthusiasts as Air India introduced complimentary internet access for passengers on select aircraft, including the Airbus A350, Boeing 787-9, and certain Airbus A321neo models. With this move, Air India became the first carrier in the country to offer in-flight Wi-Fi on domestic routes. “Connectivity is now an integral part of modern travel. For some, it is about the convenience and comfort of real-time sharing, while for others, it is about greater productivity and efficiency,” says Rajesh Dogra, Chief Customer Experience Officer, Air India.

 



On January 1, Air India introduced complimentary internet access for passengers on select aircraft.
 Accessible on Wi-Fi-enabled devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones with iOS or Android operating systems, the in-flight Wi-Fi will also allow passengers to connect multiple devices simultaneously while cruising above 10,000 feet. So, basically, you can stay active on social media, stay connected with loved ones, continue texting, take WhatsApp calls, browse the internet, or even attend live online masterclasses—all while on the flight. It will also be a great help for anxious flyers by enabling connectivity. Quite the mile-high luxury? Perhaps. But it's undeniable that the unavailability of internet on flights came with its own perks—like being blissfully away from work emails and free from the boss's calls. With access to in-flight Wi-Fi on some Air India flights now, here are a few things you might miss doing:Being away from work “I will be unavailable for a few hours since I am on a flight” will no longer be a valid excuse to step away from work. Your laptop and mobile will keep buzzing with emails, texts, and work-related calls—and with in-flight Wi-Fi now available, you may feel obligated to respond to them. On the contrary, some working professionals may find this beneficial, as those hours will no longer be wasted due to the inability to work while on a flight.Gazing out of the window Eyes can stay glued to the screen even in the air! After all, you will have so much to do on your Wi-Fi enabled gadgets. Who is going to have time to peek out of the window and gaze at the vast ocean of clouds or the breathtaking landscapes below?Reading Picking up a book for a flight has long been a ritual for many regular flyers. Reading on the go is one of the best ways to stay occupied during a flight, after all! But now, books may take a backseat. When given the choice between reading a book and doomscrolling, we all know which one most people would choose (or, end up doing).Enjoying ‘me’ time With no connection to the outside world or social media, those hours on a flight became the perfect opportunity to introspect and reflect on various aspects of life. To sit with your thoughts and not indulge in any distraction can be therapeutic (not on a long-haul flight, though).   Napping without notifications Flights used to be ideal for catching up on sleep without interruptions. Now, notifications are bound to disrupt that peace! Additionally, there will likely be passengers speaking loudly on WhatsApp calls, making it even harder to enjoy a restful nap.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Tune InALSO READ |  Wi-Fi access on flights no longer linked to altitude, now subject to permissionMust Watch

Many people find it convenient to save and reuse these containers over and over again. Recently, however, a debate has sparked online about whether these containers are safe to use at all. The concern stems from the fact that these containers are made from ‘black plastic’, a material that is more prevalent in our daily lives than you might realise. The conversation gained traction after a viral Instagram video, where an influencer advised against using or reusing black plastic containers for storing or reheating food in a microwave. Have a look at the video:

What is actually black plastic?
Black plastic is a type of plastic used to make everyday items like food trays, containers, and utensils. It’s often made from recycled materials, including old electronics, and contains chemicals to make it flame-resistant. 
These chemicals, like decaBDE, are not locked into the plastic and can sneak into your food, especially if it’s hot, fatty, or acidic. 
Imagine reheating leftovers in a black plastic container—the heat could trigger these chemicals to leach out, posing risks to your health. 
That’s why experts recommend being cautious when using black plastic in your kitchen. ButCan black plastic give you cancer? In a recent study published in the scientific journal of Chemosphere 203 black plastic consumer products were analysed. It found toxic flame-retardant chemicals in 85 per cent of these products.

 That’s why experts recommend being cautious when using black plastic in your kitchen. ButCan black plastic give you cancer?  In a recent study published in the scientific journal of Chemosphere 203 black plastic consumer products were analysed. It found toxic flame-retardant chemicals in 85 per cent of these products. Experts also cautioned against the use of black plastic as much as possible. For instance, according to Dr Aravind Badiger, technical director at BDR Pharmaceuticals, black plastic utensils and containers are associated with cancer risks due to their content of toxic flame retardants. These chemicals are known to migrate into food, causing harm over time. “DecaBDE and similar compounds are ‘suspected carcinogens and endocrine disruptors’, which can interfere with hormonal systems and potentially lead to cancer,” he says.

 Dr Sachin Trivedi, the director of medical oncology at HCG Cancer Center, agrees and adds that black plastic often contains substances like bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which are linked to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and reproductive issues. Prof Chintamani, chairman of the Department of Surgical Oncology, Sir Gangaram Hospital, further points out that microplastics from the black plastic often ingested through everyday items like tea bags and bottled water, add to the cumulative toxic load in the body.  However, all three experts that India Today spoke to shared that while there is no conclusive evidence linking black plastic to cancer, but they suggest that hormonal disruptions caused by plastic chemicals could contribute to cancer risks.   “While there isn’t definitive evidence directly linking black plastic to cancer, its chemical composition poses enough risks to warrant caution,” Dr Trivedi says.Other side effects of black plastics  Endocrine disruption Studies have shown that chemicals in black plastic, such as BPA and phthalates, disrupt the endocrine system, leading to potential reproductive health issues, obesity, and diabetes. Developmental and neurological effects Research indicates that exposure to certain additives in black plastic can result in developmental delays and reduced IQ in children, along with other neurological disorders.

 Environmental impact Dr Trivedi emphasises the environmental consequences of black plastic. It is difficult to recycle and often ends up in landfills or incinerators, releasing toxic substances like dioxins and furans into the air. These are known carcinogens and can harm human health when inhaled over time. Microplastic contamination Microplastics from black plastic find their way into food, water, and air, causing inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular damage in the human body. Their long-term health impacts are still under study but are a growing concern.Should you not use black plastic? Experts unanimously recommend avoiding black plastic for food storage and preparation. Dr Badiger advises using safer, free-from-harmful-chemicals materials like glass or stainless steel. Similarly, replacing black kitchen utensils with wooden or stainless-steel options can significantly reduce exposure to toxic substances. Moreover, heating food in black plastic, whether in a microwave or otherwise, should be avoided. As Chintamani explains, heating can cause toxic chemicals to leach into food, posing health risks. If you’re just using it repeatedly for storing food, it could lead to long-term exposure to harmful substances, contributing to health risks over time. So, always opt for microwave-safe containers made from safer materials, as mentioned above. Bottomline While the direct link between black plastics and cancer is still under research, the potential risks associated with their chemical composition and environmental impact are substantial. Opting for safer alternatives and avoiding heating food in black plastic are prudent steps to protect your health.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch

Not biscuits, rusks for sureHealth experts warn that many popular tea-time snack choices in Indian households are unhealthy and should be avoided for daily consumption. If your morning tea ritual also feels incomplete without dipping biscuits or rusks, it might be time to rethink your snack choices.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/food/story/healthy-tea-snacks-not-biscuits-rusks-2659861-2025-01-05,"Chai, in India, is an emotion. During winters, this emotion only intensifies, becoming the perfect antidote to the biting cold. For many, it is the first thing they relish in the morning. For others, it is also an essential breakfast companion, a post-lunch indulgence, an evening beverage, and even a post-dinner treat. As soul-soothing as the daily chai sessions feel, they often come with a hefty calorie load. But the chai is not to be solely blamed here—the real culprits are the snacks we tend to indulge in alongside those cups of tea. Health experts, however, warn that many popular tea-time snack choices in Indian households are unhealthy and should be avoided for daily consumption. If your morning tea ritual also feels incomplete without dipping biscuits or rusks, it might be time to rethink your snack choices.

 Moreover, a new survey suggests that Indians have been spending more on processed foods, refreshments, and beverages than on fruits and vegetables every month. This increased consumption of processed foods and sugary beverages is linked to a rise in diseases like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular issues in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in May 2024, also stated that 56.4 per cent of India's total disease burden is linked to unhealthy diets. A lot of the common tea snacks are high in calories and contain fewer essential nutrients, leading to health issues. “Chai is often paired with snacks in Indian culture, but the usual snacks such as biscuits, rusks, aloo bhujia, samosas, and kachoris are not healthy. They are high in refined flour, sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which may cause weight gain, high cholesterol, and diabetes if taken daily,” says Dr Neeti Sharma, Head, Nutritionist and Dietetics, Marengo Asia Hospitals Gurugram. “Nankhatai, biscuits, and rusks should be avoided as they are made with refined flour and unreliable oil quality. Similarly, fried snacks like aloo bhujia, namkeen, samosas, kachoris, and pakoras are harmful. They raise bad cholesterol, increase triglycerides, and pose a risk of coronary heart disease. These snacks lack nutritional value, providing only saturated fats and carbohydrates,” adds Reena Poptani, Clinical Dietitian and Diabetes Educator. Some of the tea snacks you should avoid on a regular basis include:

 Fried foods

Samosas and pakoras due to high calories, fat, and sodium content.



 Refined sugar treats

Store-bought cookies, biscuits, and rusks made with added sugar, unhealthy fats, and empty calories.



 Processed snacks

Chips and other processed foods high in unhealthy fats, sodium, and added sugars.

 “Deep-fried snacks can be enjoyed in moderation, limited to 1-2 times a week in small quantities, but they should not be consumed regularly. Biscuits and rusks made with whole wheat should also be restricted to 1-2 pieces per day,” suggests Dr Sharma. Many packaged products now come with enticing labels like ""50% less oil,"" ""healthier,"" or ""made with the goodness of oats."" However, it’s important to read the ingredients and labels carefully to understand what you're actually consuming.What to have instead? There are ample healthier options to replace your regular stack of biscuits, chips, packaged namkeen, and dry cakes. Health experts recommend roasted makhanas, seed mixes, and roasted black chana as healthy tea-time snack options. “Healthy alternatives also include baked or air-popped snacks, roasted chickpeas, popcorn, or makhanas. You can also opt for whole wheat crackers, biscuits, or cookies made at home with ingredients like quinoa or ragi,” says Simrat Kathuria, CEO and head dietitian at The Diet Xperts, Ludhiana. Experts also suggest khakra, bajra puff, jowar puff, puffed rice bhel with chutney and veggies, roasted peas, sprouts chaat, boiled corn chaat, chickpea salad, methi thepla, roasted sweet potato, baked samosa with vegetable filling, poha, murmura chivda, multigrain crackers, homemade dhokla, and whole-grain crackers to go with your cup of chai. However, moderation is key when it comes to snacking, even with nutritious foods. Overconsumption of any food, no matter how healthy, can disrupt the balance of your diet and lead to issues such as excessive calorie intake, weight gain, or nutrient imbalances.Love chai? A few things to remember
Limit tea intake to 1–2 cups per day if sugar and cream are added. Without sugar, 2–3 cups are acceptable.
 “Tea is acidic and contains caffeine, which can be harsh on an empty stomach,” says Simrat Kathuria. So, pair it with nutrient-dense snacks, especially in the morning. Avoid using tea as a hunger suppressant. Instead, enjoy it as a mindful addition to your diet. Having your chai without a healthy snack, by the way, is not a good idea. “Milk tea should not be consumed alone, as it is more likely to cause acidity or bloating due to its caffeine and tannins, which can lead to discomfort. To avoid this, a small and healthy snack can be served alongside,” says Dr Sharma.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Jan 5, 2025ALSO READ |  The Problem in Your Plate: Why an Indian home-cooked meal is not always healthyTrending Reel

But of course, this isn’t something anyone would want to boast about in public because, agree with us or not, it is kind of unhygienic, to say the least. However, there might be some good news for those who detest the idea of a shower during winter months. You might even want to share it with your friends without them looking down on you. At least, that’s what a viral Instagram video claims.A viral video’s startling claim A video shared by Dr Rebecca Pinto suggests that not having a bath in winter is not that bad after all because, apparently, it increases your life expectancy by 34 per cent.

 The video, while seemingly too good to be true, has racked up an impressive 6.6 million views on Instagram. However, not everyone was on board with its claims. Many social media users were quick to express their skepticism. “Is there any research article on this? If yes, you should have shared it before making such a bold claim,” one user remarked in the comments section.
 



 


While the claim is astounding, the expert cites no journal or research paper in her video which talks about the claim.So, it was only right to do what we do best: dig deeper to find out if there’s any truth to these claims.What other experts say While the claim is astounding, the expert cites no journal or research paper in her video which talks about the claim. So, it was only right to do what we do best: dig deeper to find out if there’s any truth to these claims.What other experts say While experts agree that bathing frequently can do your skin microbiome some harm, but skipping bath altogether in winter could be detrimental. Dr Balakrishna G K, HOD and senior consultant internal medicine, Gleneagles BGS Hospital Kengeri, Bengaluru, says, “The claim that skipping baths can increase life expectancy by 34 per cent seems exaggerated and lacks strong scientific backing. While frequent baths can disrupt the skin's microbiome and natural defences, entirely skipping baths may lead to hygiene concerns and infections.” Yes, temperature and exposure to cold significantly impact the body, and this holds true for various species. Research indicates that colder temperatures can reduce metabolic rates in some species, but to say that it actually happens for humans doesn’t hold any strong proof.

 Dr H Guru Prasad, associate clinical director and HOD, department of general medicine, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, adds, “Though the claim is alluring, but scrutinising research methodology and context before conclusions is key (if there's one at all). Bathing habits may indirectly connect to skin health preservation or hot water damage reduction but longevity relies on an intricate interplay of genes, lifestyle, and surroundings, making bathing alone unlikely to significantly impact longevity.”In fact, bathing is important, even in winters While we’re conditioned to think daily bathing is essential, hygiene standards vary widely across cultures. In colder climates, it’s not uncommon for people to bathe just a few times a week. However, you should be able to strike a balance as bathing has its benefits too.
Warm baths can improve blood flow and relaxation, indirectly aiding digestion.
 “Skipping bath occasionally likely causes minimal digestive effects, but consistent lack of bathing risks stress negatively impacting digestion,” says Dr Prasad.

Well, obviously, there’s truth to these claims, but does that mean hot shower enthusiasts are unknowingly harming their bodies?“Both cold and hot baths have their benefits and drawbacks. Cold baths can improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and boost energy levels, while hot baths are relaxing and can soothe muscle aches. However, in winter, lukewarm water is ideal as it helps clean the skin without stripping away too much of its natural moisture, unlike excessively hot water, which can exacerbate dryness,” explains Dr Balakrishna G K.The hygiene concernsWhile indulging in a bit of winter laziness is totally fine, you can’t ignore hygiene.

Held in Beverly Hills, California, on January 5, the Golden Globes set the fashion tone for the year as a parade of stars sashayed down the red carpet in their sartorial best. Among the celebrities in attendance were Zendaya, Demi Moore, Selena Gomez, Angelina Jolie, Mindy Kaling, Emma Stone, and Nicole Kidman, turning the 2025 Globes into a truly fashion-forward event. 2025 is going to be the year of unabashed maximalism – that’s what the red carpet scenario suggested. The trend emerges after ‘quiet luxury’ and ‘minimal fabulousness’ ruled the fashion game in the past few years. Billowing silhouettes, opera gloves, ogle-worthy jewellery pieces, sequin galore, voluminous hairstyles  and roaring red were the top trends at the Golden Globes. India also witnessed noteworthy fashion moments with Lilly Singh rocking a Gaurav Gupta creation, and Best Director nominee Payal Kapadia slaying it in a crisp black silk jumpsuit with brocade accents. Designer Manish Malhotra also made his debut in a self-designed monochrome tuxedo with a bejewelled lapel.

Several celebrities took inspiration from the event’s name, with a dazzling array of golden gowns dominating the red carpet on this glamorous night. Subtle, blingtastic, shimmering satin or swathed in sequin, all sorts golden creations were flaunted at The Globes. Mindy Kaling embraced maximalism in an Ashi Studio strapless golden gown adorned with sparkling silver stones. Kristen Bell’s pick for the night was also an Ashi Studio creation in rose gold – a sequinned bustier and skirt set.

 Demi Moore won big at The Globes this year – not only by bagging an award for her performance in ‘The Substance’ but also with her fashion choice. She looked gorgeous in a sculptural gleaming gown in champagne gold by Armani Prive. The crystal embellishments, must we add, further upped the glam quotient!

Sequin is still very much in Say what you will, but sequins are not going anywhere anytime soon! Year after year, sequin supremacy continues to reign. From Lilly Singh’s electrifying blue Gaurav Gupta gown to Nicole Kidman’s blingtastic (and backless) silver number, these show-stopping looks were among the scene-stealers at The Globes 2025.

Opera gloves If there was a fashion element as prominent as the presence of gold at The Globes 2025, it was opera gloves. The fashion world’s favorite accessory to add a hint of drama was embraced by a bevy of celebrities, including the star of the night, Ariana Grande, as well as Pamela Anderson and Ali Wong.

e2ef4435-dd40-41d5-84e1-1f71f423ad01,"What's the real story of tourism in Goa right now?Is tourism in Goa really declining, or are we missing an undercurrent, a positive one that can reposition the state's identity as the ""party capital of India""?",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/whats-the-real-story-of-tourism-in-goa-right-now-2661259-2025-01-08,"It’s the 1970s, and Goa is pulsating with the rhythm of full-moon parties. The air is electric with trance beats and psychedelic vibes, drawing in a crowd of free-spirited wanderers. This sun-soaked paradise, with its relaxed atmosphere, stunning landscapes, and culturally tolerant ethos, became a haven for the countercultural movement. For the hippies of that era, Goa was more than just a destination - it was a refuge where freedom, self-expression, and unconventional living thrived. Perhaps, it was with their arrival that Goa’s nascent tourism industry got an unintended boost. Fast forward to 2025, and the narrative has taken a sharp turn. Amid claims that Goa's tourism has lost the spark that once made it a symbol of escapism and allure, a question looms large: has Goa’s magic truly faded, or is this simply a reflection of changing times and evolving expectations?The social media debate The discourse around Goa's tourism on social media is anything but unanimous. On one side, some share videos of deserted streets, empty beaches, and quiet marketplaces, raising alarms with statements like, “Is it game over for Goa?” On the other, a contrasting narrative emerges, with bustling streets and thriving beach shacks showcasing a seemingly vibrant tourist season. So, who do you believe? For instance, X user Madhur posted a video of a Goan local shouting at tourists for parking at the wrong spot and stating this is one of the reasons for the decline in tourism in Goa. ""This kinda harassment is a major reason behind the decline of tourism in Goa. Yes, the guy shouldn’t have parked there but maybe he saw other cars and thought he also could,"" he writes in his tweet. See the tweet here:

— Madhur (@ThePlacardGuy) January 2, 2025 Adding fuel to the debate, entrepreneur Ramanuj Mukherjee shared data on Goa’s declining tourism numbers over recent years, boldly declaring that it has “gone to the dumps.”

Tourism in Goa is down in dumps

Foreign tourists have abandoned the state already. Look at 2019 v 2023 numbers. Russians and Brits who used to visit annually have opted for Sri Lanka instead.

— Ramanuj Mukherjee (@law_ninja) November 5, 2024 This didn’t sit well with Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte, who filed a complaint against Mukherjee last month. The minister, visibly frustrated with what he called “paid influencers,” addressed the controversy during a press conference: “I am not justifying the issues, but at the same time, we need to ensure that a wrong message is not created by someone. Let us amplify the right issues. Let us not disturb Goa with smaller issues when it is a tourism destination.” Amidst accusations and counter-accusations, the root causes of Goa’s challenges remain elusive. It goes beyond just tourist numbers, “expensive hotel tariffs,” or the “taxi mafia” narrative circulating online. The real reasons shaping Goa’s current reality are far more complex, natural, and nuanced than these oversimplified claims suggest.“Empty or comparatively empty” When addressing the narrative of Goa being “empty,” isn’t it subjective? A North Goa resident of three years, who wished to remain anonymous, shares, “In the South, we still see a consistent influx of foreign tourists, especially during the winters. However, these are usually long-term visitors who come for the season.” His sister chimes in, “First, we need to address the benchmark of ‘empty.’ I was at Martin’s Corner (South Goa eatery) the other day and had to wait for about 30 minutes to find a spot. Now, if that’s what you call empty! We all know that the state has been grappling with overtourism and if this is how things are balancing out, so be it.” The former further notes, “Tourism in Goa has diversified. Earlier, foreign backpackers dominated the scene. Now, we see a mix of budget domestic tourists and affluent Indian families. Budget tourism—like the so-called ‘minibus tourists’—brings people who often cook their own food or drink on the beaches, contributing less to the economy. On the other hand, affluent tourists spend significantly more and drive up prices, making it harder for locals to enjoy the same spaces. Whether that’s good or bad depends on whom you ask—it’s very subjective.” Lyndon Alves, a tourism stakeholder, highlights that overtourism is a global issue, but in Goa, it manifests differently. “This is the crowd that spends time complaining and crying, and honestly, that might be a good thing for Goa. Yes, we’ve taken a hit, but maybe it’s for the better. Overtourism of that quality is something we don’t want. Goa's brand has been spoilt by the lower-level Indian tourists,” Alves tells a media outlet. He adds, “Upmarket tourism hasn’t recovered well since Covid-19. The reality is that hotels don’t have enough rooms for upmarket tourists because many have prioritised conferences and weddings. The rates that wealthy Indian clients are paying for these events make it unviable for hotels to allocate rooms to charter tourists.”“It feels like Goa again” In recent months, Goa has made headlines—but not always for the right reasons. Overtourism has brought with it a host of challenges, from the notorious “taxi mafia” to strained garbage management systems. While efforts are underway to address these issues, a lower tourist influx might actually be a blessing in disguise for the state. Actor and travel vlogger Shenaz Treasury, currently spending time in Goa, has observed a noticeable difference this season. Having visited the state numerous times for both work and leisure, she shares, “The past few years, Goa was bursting at the seams, and it was not fun. Wrappers on the beach, plastic bottles everywhere, trash piling up, traffic jams galore, and construction ruining the vibe. This year? It feels different. The rubbish tourists—the ones who litter and don’t respect nature—seem to be missing. It feels like old Goa again. Blissful, peaceful, and oh-so-lovely.” Treasury also notes the shift in the type of visitors this year. “I love Goa this year. The Tourism Board should be thrilled. The trashy tourists have packed their bags, and what’s left is a more refined crowd (well, mostly). It’s giving me the Goa vibes I come back for every single year. I don’t mind paying the extra price if it means keeping trashy tourists who disrespect nature away!”advertisementIs Goa really expensive?Unlike in the past, travelling to far-off destinations like Thailand, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka has become remarkably easy. For this reason, Goa is now often compared to these destinations in terms of accommodation and food prices, as people are traveling in large numbers. This comparison might seem justified.The narrative that Goa is expensive—and therefore losing visitors—could hold some truth. So, could this also be an intentional move to restore Goa to its former glory, limiting access to only a select few and cutting out the ""trouble-causing lot""? Maybe.Alves raises a compelling question: “How can a place go down and be expensive at the same time?”From an economic perspective, there’s a point here. A place being perceived as ""not doing well"" while costs like hotel accommodations, airfares, and dining soar can be explained by a combination of factors, such as:Selective demand: Catering to a niche, high-spending crowd instead of the masses.Cost-push inflation: Rising operational costs driving up prices.Market positioning: Rebranding as a premium destination, intentionally excluding budget travellers.Economic paradox: A destination can face declining visitor satisfaction while prices remain high.Speculative pricing: Businesses' pricing is based on expected demand, not current realities.Shehnaz Treasury also offers insight: “Yes, Goa is ridiculously expensive now. A room on the beach for Rs 29,000—and it’s not even a 3-star?! No wonder people are flocking to Southeast Asia, Oman, or Baku instead. Makes sense. The NRIs are still here—they can afford it—but the 'classy foreigners' Goa was once known for? Barely seen. Instead, there’s a steady stream of Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish tourists.”The perception of Goa being “cheap” is changing, and this could signal a positive repositioning.Goa needs to evolve, transform, and how!When Indian tourists set foot in Goa, a sense of liberation washes over them, and for many, that’s part of the charm. However, some tourists seem to misuse this sense of freedom, engaging in behaviour that can only be described as ridiculous, thinking “yahaan sab chalta hai.” Manish Bhattacharya (name changed), a waiter at a popular Goa restaurant, recounts how groups of young boys often crowd the place—and how he caught them sneaking photos of foreigners.“I’ve been working here for the last 13 years and have seen all kinds of people. Recently, though, something that I often see—and have objected to several times—is a group of boys secretly photographing foreigners. When I noticed, I took their phone and warned them. They eventually left. But you know what? I think this is one of the reasons foreigners are leaving. They don’t feel safe or protected anymore.”And there are many more reasons why Goa needs to transform.Alves argues that smart management, involving all stakeholders, and a clearer understanding of how to reposition Goa’s tourism market—something that should have been done during the Covid-19 pandemic—can still be achieved. The market needs reinvention, with a focus on attracting more family tourism to shift the trend of young people visiting just to drink cheaply.“What we really need is family entertainment.

For many, this new beginning is an opportunity to reflect on personal goals, career ambitions, and overall lifestyle. Among these, fitness often takes centre stage, with many vowing to get in shape, embarking on a transformation journey, and hitting the gym with newfound enthusiasm. But remember, it's the little things that matter most. This common saying applies to many situations, but it is especially true when it comes to our health. From increasing water intake and making small dietary changes to ditching phone usage while eating, these simple lifestyle adjustments can make a significant impact on your well-being. Chances are, you already know what’s good and what’s not for your health, but hear it from health experts who want you to stick to the minor lifestyle changes that can truly transform your health for the better.Hello, hydration Staying hydrated is important for a bevy of bodily functions like carrying nutrients and oxygen to cells, regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, and protecting the organs and tissues. It also helps with digestion, maintaining energy, and even skin health. So, you know how important it is!

 



Aim to drink 8 glasses of water each day (Photo: Pexels)
“Start your day with a glass of water and aim to drink at least 8 glasses daily. Staying hydrated boosts metabolism, supports organ function, and improves skin health,” suggests Dr Balakrishna G K, HOD and senior consultant, Internal Medicine, Gleneagles BGS Hospital Kengeri, Bengaluru.To ensure you don’t miss out on regularly drinking water, carry a reusable water bottle and set reminders on your phone. You can also flavour it with your favourite fruits or herbs if you find drinking plain water unappealing.Plate your meals properly (focus on protein) “Start your day with a glass of water and aim to drink at least 8 glasses daily.

To ensure you don’t miss out on regularly drinking water, carry a reusable water bottle and set reminders on your phone. You can also flavour it with your favourite fruits or herbs if you find drinking plain water unappealing.Plate your meals properly (focus on protein) According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), as of May 2024, 56.4% of India's total disease burden is linked to unhealthy diets. While it is crucial to avoid regularly consuming processed and ultra-processed foods, it’s equally important to pay attention to your home-cooked meals. However, this doesn't mean you can eat anything and everything just because it's cooked at home. Contrary to popular belief, home-cooked food isn't always healthy, especially if it's not plated properly or contains excessive oil, sugar, or salt. Approach your meals with a balanced perspective—your daily diet should include fibre, lean protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and essential micronutrients. “Start taking a diversified high-fibre diet. Eat good amounts of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts which feed the best gut bacteria around. Fermentable foods like yoghurt, kefir, kimchi - incorporate probiotics and support a healthy population of microbiomes. Avoid many processed foods that contain refined sugar and unhealthy fat, which also can be fatal to gut bacteria,” suggests Dr Kapil Jamwal, clinical director, department of gastroenterology and hepatology, Marengo Asia Hospital Gurugram. Pay essential focus on protein, as it helps build and repair tissues, supports muscle growth, and plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and satiety. FYI, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has set the daily protein requirement as 0.83 grams per kg per day for adults. So, fill half the plate with vegetables and fruits, a quarter with lean protein, and a quarter with whole grains, complemented by healthy fats and a source of dairy or a dairy alternative. Here’s what a ‘plate for the day’ should look like, according to ICMR:

 



What balanced food for a day looks like for someone who aims to consume 2,000 calories, according to ICMR.
 To incorporate this change in your life, plan meals ahead of time and keep healthy snacks handy.Get moving (and start exercising) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), physical inactivity is a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

a124b665-2bc9-4c5e-a114-4743b4f74e0c,How the Michelangelo Phenomenon can shape or break a relationshipThe Michelangelo Phenomenon is a fascinating psychological concept that likens the dynamic between partners to that of a sculptor and their art.,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/how-the-michelangelo-phenomenon-can-shape-or-break-a-relationship-2662344-2025-01-09,"There is no denying that relationships have evolved over a period of time, which means the kind of relationship you share with your partner was exactly not how your grandparents did. But one thing has been persistent – an ideal relationship (not that there is any but you get it, right?) is one where partners help shape each other into their best selves. That’s basically the crux of the Michelangelo Phenomenon. This is a fascinating psychological concept that likens the dynamic between partners to that of a sculptor and their art. Just as the iconic Renaissance artist Michelangelo believed his sculptures were already present within the marble, waiting to be revealed, this phenomenon suggests that in a healthy relationship, partners ""sculpt"" each other by encouraging traits and aspirations that align with their ideal selves. But is this always a harmonious process, or can the chisel sometimes strike too hard?What is the Michelangelo Phenomenon? ""The phenomenon is about partners helping each other grow into their truest versions,"" explains Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai. ""By supporting each other’s values, goals, and virtues, they chip away the unnecessary parts, revealing the best version of themselves.""

The concept aligns with Self-Determination Theory (SDT), where people flourish when their autonomy, competence, and intrinsic goals are supported. In the context of relationships, Delhi-based relationship counsellor Ruchi Ruuh highlights how partners act as sculptors. ""They affirm traits and behaviours that align with their partner’s ideal self-concept, fostering trust, shared goals, and emotional intimacy,"" she says.Why it worksThe Michelangelo Phenomenon thrives on mutual encouragement, building emotional intimacy and resilience. When both partners feel supported, they’re more likely to achieve personal growth. ""This emotional safety allows them to explore aspirations without fear of judgment or abandonment,"" adds Ruuh.

When both partners feel supported, they’re more likely to achieve personal growth. ""This emotional safety allows them to explore aspirations without fear of judgment or abandonment,"" adds Ruuh. Even in long-distance relationships, the phenomenon’s principles apply. As Sam puts it, ""Strong communication is key to keeping the effect alive. It’s a reminder that growth and connection transcend physical boundaries."" Additionally, research on relational dynamics highlights that when couples invest in each other’s personal development, they experience higher levels of satisfaction and stability. Supporting a partner’s growth fosters a cycle of positivity that reinforces the emotional foundation of the relationship. Moreover, the shared pursuit of personal goals can strengthen the couple’s bond by creating common narratives and achievements.The cultural lens In India, the phenomenon intersects with cultural expectations and familial roles. ""India’s plurality comes with societal norms that can be challenging,"" explains Sam. ""When you’re talking about the Indian aspect, or let’s say the cultural aspect, in India, this can work very well. But as India is full of pluralities, we do come with a lot of cultural expectations. No matter where you belong or what kind of families or roles you have, we always have some set of expectations from society,” explains Sam. Ruuh echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the potential for positive applications beyond romance. ""This approach isn’t limited to romantic relationships. It works in friendships, family dynamics, and even professional setups.""When can things go awry However, the sculptor’s chisel can sometimes slip. ""When one partner imposes their vision of the ‘ideal self’ onto the other, it can lead to resentment,"" warns Ruuh. Over time, this dynamic may create role strain or internal conflict. Sam points out another risk: ""There’s a chance one might lose their real self trying to meet their partner’s expectations."" The imbalance can lead to dependency, emotional distance, or unintentional reinforcement of harmful behaviours. To prevent such pitfalls, Ruuh advises boundaries and mutual respect. ""It’s essential that both partners feel like equal contributors in this process. Otherwise, the sculptor might feel overburdened or inadequate.""Takeaway The essence of a relationship, whether it’s marriage or friendship, often hinges on compatibility. While that’s undoubtedly important, interpersonal growth is equally crucial. Stagnancy isn’t something people accept easily—if you don’t grow and your partner or friend doesn’t support that growth, it could strain the relationship. On the flip side, overdoing it by imposing your vision on others can also create problems. So, the key is balance and, most importantly, listening!Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 9, 2025

Many women grapple with its symptoms, from excessive facial hair growth to hair loss (yes, we get the irony), acne, irregular periods and more. To manage these symptoms, women often seek remedies that range from lifestyle changes to wellness teas to even medications.  Among these, supplements, especially for PCOS, are getting a lot of attention online. These supplements promise a way to manage these symptoms, and some also claim that they can help you heal your PCOS. But can supplements really help you or is it a big fat scam?How PCOS impacts women’s body In simple terms, PCOS is a hormonal disorder that commonly affects women of reproductive age. Dr Anjana Singh, director of obstetrics and gynaecology at Fortis Hospital, Noida, explains that PCOS is characterised by enlarged ovaries with small cysts on their outer edges. Symptoms include unexplained weight gain, excessive facial hair, discolouration of skin on the neck, and missed periods. “Patients of PCOS may experience weight gain, especially around the belly, along with fatigue and fertility issues,” adds Dr Rohan Palshetkar, head of unit at Bloom IVF. Women with PCOS are also more prone to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Although the exact cause is unknown, factors like genetics, insulin resistance, and inflammation are believed to play a role.

However, these products often come with hefty price tags, and their effectiveness can vary widely.Supplements offer potential benefits, but they are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Dr Preeti Deedwania, consultant at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida, advises caution, noting that online recommendations can often be misleading.“Supplements are not miracle cures; they are supportive tools that should be used under medical supervision,” reiterates Dr Singh.

Berberine: Long-term use could impact gut bacteria negatively and may interact with certain medications.
Probiotics: Although generally safe, they can occasionally cause bloating or gas.
“It’s crucial to follow prescribed doses and monitor for any adverse reactions,” advises Dr Deedwania. What can be done instead of popping supplements?Supplements alone cannot cure PCOS. Experts recommend a holistic approach that prioritises lifestyle changes over reliance on pills.
Diet: A balanced diet rich in fibre, lean proteins, and healthy fats can improve insulin sensitivity and hormone levels.
Exercise: Regular physical activity helps manage weight and reduce inflammation. Experts suggest even a 10 percent weight loss can significantly improve symptoms.

2e020f36-dcf5-4d4b-8dc5-97e24f4115d5,"The male attitude towards sex toys is changing in IndiaHesitation, social taboo, judgment, and the shame associated with using sex toys often prevents men from exploring sex toys.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/male-sex-toys-attitude-india-2662924-2025-01-10,"“Why do I even need something like this?” has long been the attitude among men when it comes to sex toys. One of the probable reasons why heterosexual men are not among the top users of sex toys in India in a survey published on Lancet. However, the mindset is now changing – that’s what the leading sex toy companies in India say now. Thanks to India’s bedroom revolution, sex toys finally came out of the closet in 2024. This shift was driven by a new wave of brands selling these products online, a rising number of sex educators and sexual wellness influencers, and the normalisation of sex toy usage through their availability on quick delivery apps like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, and Blinkit. According to the 'Laid in India' survey conducted by bedroom essentials brand MuMuse with 10,000 participants, 45 per cent of Indians use sex toys, and 78 per cent openly discuss them with their friends. Industry experts, as well as some research, suggest women are more likely to report owning sex toys compared to men. The same can be attributed to the destigmatisation of female sexual pleasure and wide orgasm gap. 69 per cent of women report better orgasms with sex toys vs. without, says the MyMuse survey. While women have historically been more vocal in embracing pleasure products, men are steadily catching up,” says Arjun Siva, business head at Love Depot.Female pleasure and the barriers it overcame In India, female pleasure coming to the forefront has taken a long time, effort, and a gradual shift in societal attitudes towards sexuality and women's rights. “Relatively speaking, men face fewer barriers to access when purchasing sexual wellness products compared to women, who typically encounter significantly higher levels of stigma and judgement. Women also generally have less privacy and agency within families and society, systemically, thanks to patriarchy. It is thus generally even more challenging for women than for men to openly explore and purchase products for their sexual pleasure,” says Leeza Mangaldas, sex educator and founder of self-care brand Leezu’s. “Therefore, statistically speaking, right now in India—and in fact, even globally—a woman is more likely to own a sex toy if her partner got it for her. However, there is a growing demographic of women taking charge of their own pleasure, which is both empowering and transformative. This shift signals a positive change, one that I am personally most excited about,” she tells India Today.The 'masculine' attitude For men, however, hesitation, social taboo, judgement, and the shame associated with using sex toys often prevent them from exploring these options. “It's probably due to patriarchy, sure—since much of masculinity depends on heteronormativity and sexual success with women, a man who has to ‘resort’ to sex toys is seen as a loser or a pervert,” writes a Reddit user in a post discussing why it is shameful for a man to want a sex toy for himself. “I think the difference is probably that women orgasm way less than men during sex; so when women have sex toys it’s simply to orgasm, whereas when men have sex toys it must be because they’re freaky. That’s the ‘assumption’ made by society,” reads another comment on the post. The stigma is, however, diminishing. “While women have traditionally led this space, the stigma around using male pleasure products is slowly diminishing,” says Anushka Gupta, founder of MyMuse. “Products like Toofaan have emerged as bestsellers, reflecting an eagerness among men to explore their sexual pleasure as well as to become more self-aware about their own sexuality, anatomy, and health. This year, we expect this trend to gain further momentum, driven by increasing awareness and availability of products catering to male sexual wellness,” says Mangaldas. According to her, Indian men are likely to embrace tools that provide an informed and enjoyable understanding of their sexual health and desires, as societal conversations around gender and pleasure are becoming more mainstream. Experts say this change is also fuelled by designs that prioritise discretion and the evolution of men’s pleasure, with men actively exploring sexual wellness as an integral part of broader self-care. “Products like stroker sleeves (both powered and non-powered), vibrating rings, and app-controlled devices are gaining traction, showing that men are becoming more experimental with their choices, contrary to popular opinion,” says Siva.Couple pleasure at the forefront Not just self-pleasure, sex toys are also helping build and maintain intimacy between couples. “Women report experiencing better orgasms with sex toys. For men, the biggest benefit comes in the form of enhanced connection with their partner, with 31 per cent of men saying toys have improved their intimacy with their partners,” says the ‘Laid in India’ survey. The focus on male pleasure has now shifted to mutual pleasure. The leading brands in the realm have a ‘for couple’ category, which usually comprises tools for ‘him’ as well as ‘her’. “Interestingly, men frequently purchase for their partners,” shares Gupta. Love Depot also reports a growing demand for couple-focused products. “We've noticed a growing demand for couple-focused products, now matching the popularity of solo items designed exclusively for him or her,” adds Siva.The revolution continues in 2025 While 2024 was the year when sex toys came out of the closet, this revolution is set to continue into this year. Industry leaders anticipate pleasure products becoming even more accessible and mainstream. “First, we’re likely to see an even greater normalisation of pleasure products, with items like massagers and lubricants becoming as common and accessible as everyday wellness products—think toothbrushes or face wash. Additionally, there will be a growing focus on inclusivity and gender equality in the sexual wellness space,” predicts Mangaldas. She also believes that this year more people will understand that these tools are not just about physical pleasure, but about fostering better intimacy, comfort, and connection with themselves and their partners. Some of the trends, according to Gupta, to watch out for include:
Tech integration: Expect advancements in connected devices with customisable options and features to enhance user experience.
Educational content: Brands will continue to ramp up sex education initiatives to normalise sexual wellness and empower consumers. More creators will follow suit, as will the increased representation of sex in OTT content.
Accessibility: Tier-II and III cities will emerge as significant growth markets as societal taboos continue to erode (PS: There is already a high demand from these areas).

",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/travel/story/what-the-indian-passport-can-learn-from-singapore-the-worlds-most-powerful-2663026-2025-01-11,"Henley Global on Wednesday, January 8, 2025, unveiled its Passport Index, crowning Singapore’s passport as the world’s most powerful once again. While Singapore shared the top spot last year with France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, this year it has reclaimed the throne exclusively, as these countries slipped in the rankings. The title is well-deserved - holders of a Singaporean passport can travel to 195 countries without needing a visa. Over the past eight years, Singapore has consistently ranked in the top two and has remained amongst the top ten for over two decades, solidifying its reputation as a travel powerhouse.

 In comparison, India’s passport is ranked 85th on the latest Henley Passport Index, granting visa-free access to 57 countries. But what gives Singapore’s passport such unrivalled clout, and how has it maintained its dominance over the years? The answer lies in far more than just the colour of its cover. The Passport Index  This year, Singapore has reclaimed its title as the world’s most powerful passport, offering visa-free access to an impressive 195 out of 227 global destinations listed in the Henley Passport Index. This achievement places Singapore firmly ahead of second-ranked Japan, which grants visa-free entry to 193 destinations, including China—a significant milestone since the restoration of travel post-Covid-19 lockdowns. The third spot is shared by a group of EU nations—France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Finland—along with South Korea. Citizens of these countries enjoy visa-free travel to 192 destinations worldwide, underscoring their strong global mobility. Now, if you’re wondering how this agency ranks its countries, let us give you a quick crash course.

 The Henley Passport Index ranks 199 passports by comparing their visa-free access to 227 global destinations. For each destination where no visa is required, the passport earns a score of 1. The same applies if travellers can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) upon entry. If a visa is mandatory, or if travellers must secure a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) or pre-departure authorisation for a visa on arrival, the passport receives a score of 0. In simple terms, a passport’s overall score reflects the total number of destinations it grants access to without requiring a visa, making it a clear measure of global travel freedom. This data, by the way, is exclusively received from International Air Transport Association (IATA). So, when it gives Singapore the ‘strongest passport’ title, it means holding a Singaporean passport can give you the freedom to travel more easily than any other passports. Not only Henley, but organisations and reports that also show the same. For instance, the passport index has also ranked Singapore’s passports in the top 10 for 2025. How is Singapore’s passport the strongest? How does a country make its passport strong and travel easy for its citizens? Well, there are various reasons.  Global mobility
Singapore’s passport is unmatched in global mobility, offering visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 195 out of 227 destinations. This exceptional reach allows Singaporeans to travel with ease, whether for business or leisure, making it a symbol of unparalleled international freedom. As Manoj Dharmani, CEO of DUDigital Global, a company specialising in visa facilitation, tells India Today, “Singapore's passport has emerged as the world's most powerful travel document.” Strategic diplomatic relations
At the heart of Singapore’s passport strength lies its robust diplomatic relations. The country has forged extensive bilateral and multilateral partnerships, ensuring visa waivers and simplified entry procedures with numerous nations. Louis D’Souza, a travel expert and the director of Tamarind Global, explains, “Singapore’s emphasis on diplomatic ties, economic strength, and its status as a global hub for trade and tourism play pivotal roles in sustaining its passport power.” These strong alliances have earned Singapore a high degree of international trust, translating directly into greater travel freedom for its citizens. Consistent economic stability
Singapore’s consistent economic growth and political stability have significantly enhanced its passport’s global standing. A strong and reliable economy reassures other nations, leading to more open visa policies for Singaporean passport holders.

 “Through years of careful diplomacy, economic success, and stable governance, Singapore has transformed its little red passport into a golden ticket for global travel and thus international trust,” says Dharmani. Commitment to security and integrity
The integrity of Singapore’s passport is another cornerstone of its strength. Rigorous issuance processes and state-of-the-art security features make forgery nearly impossible, earning global confidence. This commitment to security ensures smoother immigration processes and fewer travel restrictions for its citizens. This brings us to another next point.  Advanced biometric technology
In 2006, Singapore was one of the first to launch a biometric visa. These e-passports contain embedded microchips storing personal data like digital photographs and fingerprints, making them both secure and efficient.  Biometric passports streamline immigration procedures, especially at e-gates in major airports, ensuring faster and more reliable border clearance. This technological edge further bolsters its passport’s reputation. PS: India first launched biometric passports, in 2008 as a pilot project, initially only issuing them to diplomatic passport holders. How can India do better? Both Singapore and India are Asian countries, but if you’re an Indian and have ever applied for a Schengen or US visa, you know that the struggle is real. Visa rejections often impact a lot of our travel plans. This year's data shows that India’s passport is ranked 85th globally. This marks a slip of 5 positions since the last year.  However, Dharmani notes that India's passport tells a different story – one of gradual change and untapped potential. “Currently ranked 85th globally, India's position on the passport power index reflects both its challenges and opportunities. The Covid-19 pandemic dealt a significant blow, pushing India's ranking down to 90th in 2021 from its previous high of 71st in 2006,” he notes.

 But there’s still scope for change, according to experts. Here are some ways that both experts suggest: 
Strengthen diplomatic relations
 Experts suggest that India must expand its network of bilateral agreements, aiming for more visa waiver deals with key countries. By boosting diplomatic ties and fostering mutual trust, Indian travellers can benefit from easier global access.
Promote inbound tourism
 Another step can be simplifying visa regimes for international tourists. This can create reciprocal agreements with other countries. A welcoming policy towards foreign travellers often encourages similar concessions for Indian passport holders.
Enhance infrastructure and governance
 Streamlining bureaucratic processes and ensuring consistent foreign policies are essential. As D’Souza mentions, “Addressing internal challenges like bureaucracy and focusing on key sectors like tourism, technology, and trade can enhance India’s global reputation.”
Focus on economic growth and stability
 Even though India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, experts suggest that economic success and political stability are key drivers of international trust. A stronger economy can reassure other nations, making them more inclined to offer visa-free access to Indian travellers. “A stronger Indian passport will make international travel more accessible for citizens and also elevate India’s standing on the global scale. This path is challenging, but Singapore’s success shows us that the vision and commitment is achievable,” D’Souza concludes.Published By: Dristi SharmaPublished On: Jan 11, 2025Must Watch

Hollywood celebrities like Tom Hanks, Bella Hadid, and Emma Watson have openly shared their struggles with something called Impostor Syndrome—the persistent feeling of not truly deserving their achievements, even at the peak of their success. Back here in Bollywood, Shefali Shah revealed in an interview with NDTV last year that she struggles with low self-esteem. “I feel I have Impostor Syndrome, and I genuinely have very low self-esteem,” said the actress. When these words come from someone who has won a National Award and was also nominated for the International Emmys, it really shows how this behavioural pattern can make you feel limited.

 Similarly, Manoj Bajpayee told Mid-Day about his battle with Imposter Syndrome, admitting it made him feel “guilty” about his success. He credited fellow actor Akshaye Khanna with helping him overcome these negative thoughts. There could be a plethora of reasons why this feeling of being an “imposter” can creep into someone, but what comes across as very problematic is the feeling of not being good enough, which is increasingly fuelled by social media. But first, let’s understandWhat is Imposter Syndrome? Imposter Syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as frauds. It’s like getting an A+ on a test but still feeling like you cheated your way through. People dealing with it often think of their success as ""just luck"" or that they’ve somehow tricked everyone into believing that they’re capable. And the wild part? An individual struggling with Imposter Syndrome may get more successful with time, but their pessimist thought process could still be challenging their accomplishments. Interestingly, a review article published in the International Journal of Behavioural Science suggests that around 70 per cent of people will experience Imposter Syndrome at some point in their lives. It’s particularly prevalent in competitive environments, like academia, corporate workplaces, or creative industries, where external validation often overshadows personal achievements.How social media acts as a trigger Dr Rahul Chandhok, head consultant of mental health and behavioural science at Artemis Hospital Gurgaon, highlights how social media inflates Imposter syndrome by presenting idealised versions of life. “Social media inflates the effect of Imposter Syndrome by always providing ideal versions of others’ lives and achievements to you. Constant exhibition of these packaged highlights makes any individual feel inappropriately mediocre despite their actual accomplishments,” explains Dr Chandhok. “The pressure to meet the unrealistic standards set by influencers and peers leads to self-doubt and the belief that success is undeserved. The lack of context behind posts also creates a distorted reality, which can heighten feelings of failure. This digital environment fosters perfectionism because individuals fear judgement or rejection, which further fuels Imposter Syndrome. Mindful consumption and limiting comparisons are crucial for maintaining self-esteem in the social media era,” he adds.

The demographics most affected Certain groups are more vulnerable to social media-induced Imposter Syndrome than others. Psychologist Sumalatha Vasudeva from Gleneagles BGS Hospital, Bengaluru, explains, “Teenagers and young adults are particularly susceptible because they are still developing their identities and heavily rely on peer validation.” Child psychologist Riddhi Doshi Patel echoes this sentiment, and tells India Today, “Teenagers constantly compare themselves to the filtered realities on social media, leading to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.” This constant comparison to others’ curated lives - reels filled with achievements, vacations, and picture-perfect moments - warps their sense of reality. Instead of focusing on their own accomplishments, many end up feeling like they’re falling short. Adding to this is the fear of missing out (FOMO). Patel notes, “Constant updates on social media can create a sense of FOMO, making teens believe they’re missing out on exciting experiences.” The obsession with likes, comments, and follower counts only deepens this insecurity. But it’s not just teenagers who are at risk. Women in professional and academic spaces often experience higher levels of Imposter Syndrome due to societal pressures and gender biases. Creative and competitive professionals are also prone, as their industries often tie success to public recognition, Vasudeva points out. Additionally, marginalised groups face unique challenges, as systemic biases and stereotypes are frequently magnified in online spaces, adding another layer to the struggle.Combat mode on While social media can be overwhelming, there are ways to mitigate its negative impact, experts reiterate:
Curate your feed: Follow accounts that promote authenticity and positivity, avoiding those that trigger comparisons.
Limit screen time: Set boundaries to reduce overexposure to curated content.
Practice self-compassion: Remind yourself that social media often highlights the best moments and omits struggles.
Focus on personal goals: Shift your attention from external validation to internal growth and achievements.
Keep a journal: Document your accomplishments to recognise your progress and celebrate milestones.
Open up: Discuss feelings of self-doubt with trusted friends or a therapist for perspective.
Take breaks: Periodic social media detoxes can help recalibrate your self-perception and reconnect with reality.

fed03df4-704d-47b5-b8e7-d77589db87b4,"55% of Indians are left wanting more sex: SurveyA recent survey involving over 10,000 respondents has revealed startling insights into modern relationships and intimacy.",https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/relationship/story/55-of-indians-are-left-wanting-more-sex-survey-2664085-2025-01-13,"What’s happening behind closed doors in India’s bedrooms? A lot—and yet, not enough. A recent survey, Laid in India 2025 by MyMuse (a bedroom wellness brand), has sparked conversations about the evolving state of intimacy across the country. The survey, which drew insights from over 10,000 respondents, offers a refreshingly honest take on modern relationships, revealing surprising truths about how Indians approach love, desire, and connection.What the findings say The findings are as diverse as the country itself. While 87% of Indians no longer wait until marriage to explore intimacy, the survey says nearly 62% expressed a desire to break out of routine and try something new in the bedroom. The report also highlights a growing openness to sexual wellness products, with nearly half of the respondents either using or wanting to explore them. Emotional connection emerged as a critical factor for 87% of participants, showing that it’s not just about the physical—it’s also about meaningful bonds. Despite these progressive shifts, one data stood out: 55% of Indians are left wanting more sex. This dissatisfaction spans across singles, couples, and even married individuals. The data busts myths about marriage as a fix for intimacy issues, with 59% of married respondents admitting they still feel the lack of a thriving sex life. Interestingly, women reported slightly higher dissatisfaction (60%) compared to men (53%), challenging traditional narratives about who is more vocal about their needs.Why though? According to Srishati Singhal, founder of Evolve Beings (community of healers, therapists and seekers), this intimacy deficit stems from deeply rooted socio-cultural factors.
“I believe the statistics might actually be higher than what is reported. There are several factors contributing to this. Indian couples often marry young, leaving little time for exploration. Children usually follow soon after, disrupting intimacy,” she explains.
Another major issue is the lack of privacy, especially since many Indian couples live in joint families. “Even though this is gradually changing in metropolitan cities, the family dynamic often means couples have to be discreet. This constant involvement with family life leaves little time or space for couples to fully embrace their sexuality or maintain an active and fulfilling sex life,” she adds.
Moreover, Singhal feels there is a collective cultural repression around sexuality in India. People don’t learn about sexual intimacy, lovemaking, or tools to keep things exciting, which leads to a monotonous and routine-driven sexual life. Without education and awareness, couples struggle to rekindle passion or put effort into their intimate lives.
Adding to this is the modern lifestyle—busy schedules and constant exhaustion push intimacy to the bottom of the priority list. Often, intimacy is reduced to a quick stress-relief activity at the end of the day, which doesn’t sustain long-term relationships. While this may work in the honeymoon phase, it becomes increasingly difficult as the relationship matures, particularly after having children.
Content creator and sexual wellness expert Bhavjeet Sehgal identifies communication as the critical missing element in Indian relationships. She states, “Intimacy flourishes when partners are open about their desires and fantasies. Without honest communication, relationships stagnate. Women especially face societal judgment, which makes expressing their needs even harder.” Sehgal urges couples to prioritise transparent, judgment-free conversations to foster deeper emotional and physical connections.
Towards an intimate revolution There's no denying that there are problems, but Indians are increasingly willing to explore new avenues for intimacy. The report also highlights that discussions around sexual wellness are gaining acceptance, with nearly 48% eager to try tools that can enhance their experience. Anushka Gupta, co-founder of MyMuse, says, “The report is more than just a snapshot of the country’s sex lives. It doesn’t just point to the desire for more sex; it reflects the broader challenge of creating spaces for connection, experimentation, and communication in relationships.” **The report covers 500+ cities and towns, from Tier 1 metros to smaller Tier 3 regions, which provides a comprehensive look at intimacy across urban and rural India.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Jan 13, 2025Trending Reel
