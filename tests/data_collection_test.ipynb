       "(\"If you’re a fan of South Indian cinema and its infectious music, chances are you’ve found yourself dancing to Ramuloo Ramulaa from Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo. But do you know the musical genius behind this chartbuster? Enter Thaman S, the maestro whose compositions have become chartbusters. He is set to make waves in Bollywood with his debut full album for Varun Dhawan’s Christmas release, Baby John. Here’s everything you need to know about this prolific composer and his extraordinary journey. Born as Ghantasala Sai Srinivas in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, Thaman comes from a lineage steeped in music. His grandfather, Ghantasala Balaramayya, was a celebrated director and producer, while his father, Ghantasala Siva Kumar, was a renowned drummer who worked in over 700 films with legendary composer K Chakravarthy. His mother, Ghantasala Savitri, sister Yamini, and aunt B. Vasantha have all lent their voices as playback singers. Growing up in a Telugu-speaking family of musicians in Chennai, Thaman was immersed in the rhythms and melodies that would later define his career.   Thaman made his debut as a music director with Kick (2009) and has since become one of the most sought-after composers in South Indian cinema. His discography reads like a greatest-hits playlist -- Race Gurram, Sarrainodu, Tuck Jagadish, Sarkaru Vaari Paata, Varisu, and Guntur Kaaram. Each project showcased his knack for blending traditional Indian sounds with modern beats, creating tracks that resonate with listeners across generations and regions. It’s not just his music, but also his collaborations with top stars like Allu Arjun, Mahesh Babu, and Vijay that have cemented his position as a musical powerhouse. Tracks like Butta Bomma and Jai Balayya are proof of his ability to craft earworms that linger long after the credits roll.   While Thaman has dabbled in Bollywood before, composing the main theme for Simmba, Jai Bajrangbali for Singham Again, and the title track for Golmaal Again, Baby John marks his full-fledged album debut. Fans are eagerly awaiting how his signature style translates to Bollywood’s diverse musical landscape. Thaman’s entry into Bollywood is a natural progression for a composer who has already achieved superstar status in the South. With Baby John releasing this Christmas, he’s set to introduce a whole new audience to his distinctive sound.   Thaman’s appeal lies in his ability to innovate while staying true to his roots. Whether it’s the pulsating beats of Ramuloo Ramulaa or the soulful melodies of Butta Bomma, his compositions have a universal quality that transcends language and culture.   For those unfamiliar with Thaman’s work, now is the perfect time to explore his discography. Start with Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo and Race Gurram, then dive into his latest releases like Varisu and Guntur Kaaram. With Baby John just around the corner, Thaman S is poised to become a household name not just in India but globally. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or a curious newcomer, Thaman’s music promises a journey full of rhythm, emotion, and unforgettable melodies.Published By: Trisha BhattacharyaPublished On: Dec 18, 2024ALSO READ |  Varun Dhawan's Baby John: What to expect from the remake of Atlee's Theri\\n\",\n",

       "'In the ever-evolving world of health and wellness, a molecule called NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) has emerged as the new buzzword. Celebrities worldwide, from Hollywood A-listers to Indian fitness enthusiasts, are singing its praises, calling it the “magic molecule” for youth, energy, and longevity. But what is NAD+, why are stars obsessed with it, and how is it impacting the Indian wellness market? Dr Anjali Hooda, a renowned MD and Internist, explains, “NAD+ is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It plays a critical role in energy production, DNA repair, and slowing the ageing process. As we age, NAD+ levels decline, leading to fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and visible signs of ageing. Boosting NAD+ levels can help rejuvenate the body at a cellular level.”Why celebrities are hooked From Kendall Jenner to Hailey Beiber, celebrities are reportedly using NAD+ therapies for their anti-ageing and energy-boosting effects. Intravenous (IV) NAD+ drips have become a sought-after treatment among the elite, promising to enhance mental clarity, physical performance, and even recovery from jet lag or rigorous schedules.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIntravenous (IV) NAD+ drips have become a sought-after treatment among the elite. (Photo: Unsplash)\\n Bollywood has not been left behind. Indian stars, under the guidance of experts like Dr Hooda, are embracing NAD+ to maintain their hectic lifestyles and youthful appearances. “Actors and performers need peak energy levels and radiant skin, which NAD+ helps achieve. It’s no surprise they’re obsessed with it,” she says.How NAD+ works its magic NAD+ supports mitochondrial function - the powerhouse of our cells - helping convert food into energy. It also activates sirtuins, proteins associated with longevity and repair. By replenishing NAD+ levels, individuals may experience improved metabolism, better focus, and resistance to age-related diseases. Dr Hooda points out that while IV treatments are popular among celebrities, oral supplements, NAD+ precursors like NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), and even topical applications are entering the mainstream.Impact on the Indian market India’s wellness industry, already booming with trends like IV therapy bars and biohacking clinics, is rapidly adopting NAD+ treatments. Luxury wellness centers in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru are offering NAD+ IV drips, priced between Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000 per session. “The Indian market is seeing a surge in demand for high-end, evidence-based treatments,” says Dr Hooda. “NAD+ fits perfectly into this space, appealing to health-conscious millennials and the ultra-wealthy alike.” Affordable NAD+ supplements, manufactured by Indian pharmaceutical companies, are also making their way into drugstores and e-commerce platforms. Experts believe this accessibility could make NAD+ the next big thing in India’s burgeoning nutraceutical market.The science vs the hype While NAD+ shows immense promise, skeptics caution against over-reliance on it as a miracle cure. Dr Hooda advises, “It’s important to pair NAD+ therapies with a balanced diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. The molecule is a tool, not a standalone solution.”The verdict As awareness of NAD+ grows, India stands poised to become a major player in this global trend. With celebrities endorsing it and experts advocating its benefits, the “magic molecule” might just be the future of wellness. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast or simply looking to age gracefully, NAD+ offers a compelling promise: a chance to biohack your way to better health.Published By: Tiasa Bhowal Published On: Dec 18, 2024Must Watch \\n'"
